         <title>Logical Analysis of Multiple Single&#8208;Nucleotide&#8208;Polymorphisms with Programmable DNA Molecular Computation for Clinical Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analyzing complex single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) combinations in the genome is important for research and clinical applications, given that different SNP combinations can generate different phenotypic consequences. Recent works have shown that DNA&#8208;based molecular computing is powerful for simultaneously sensing and analyzing complex molecular information. Here, we designed a switching circuit&#8208;based DNA computational scheme that can integrate the sensing of multiple SNPs and simultaneously perform logical analysis of the detected SNP information to directly report clinical outcomes. As a demonstration, we successfully achieved automatic and accurate identification of 21 different blood group genotypes from 83 clinical blood samples with 100% accuracy compared to sequencing data in a more rapid manner (3 hours). Our method enables a new mode of automatic and logical sensing and analyzing subtle molecular information for clinical diagnosis, as well as guiding personalized medication.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization&#8208;Driven Controlled Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) Assemblies from Chromophore&#8208;Appended Poly(L&#8208;lactide)s: Highly Efficient Energy Transfer on a 2D Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rational approach towards precision two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of poly(L&#8208;lactides) (PLLAs), end&#8208;capped with dipolar dyes like merocyanine (MC) or naphthalene monoimide (NMI) and hydrophobic pyrene (PY) or benzene (Bn) is described. PLLA chains crystallize into diamond&#8208;shaped platelets in isopropanol, which forces the terminal dyes to assemble into 2D array on the platelet surface by either dipolar interactions or &#960;&#8208;stacking and exhibit tunable emission. Dipolar dyes play a critical role in imparting colloidal stability and structural uniformity to the 2D crystals, which is partly compromised for hydrophobic ones. Co&#8208;crystallization between NMI&#8208; and PY&#8208;labeled PLLAs yields similar diamond&#8208;shaped co&#8208;platelets with highly efficient (~80%) F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer on the 2D surface. Further, &#8220;living&#8221; CDSA method confers enlarged, segmented block co&#8208;platelets using one of the homopolymers as &#8220;seed&#8221; and the other as &#8220;unimer&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Symmetry Breaking Suppresses the Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline Solid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the correlations of both the local and global structures with lattice dynamics is critical in achieving low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) in crystalline materials. Herein, we demonstrate local cationic off&#8208;centring within the global rock&#8208;salt structure of AgSbSe2 by using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis and unravel the origin of its ultralow &#954;lat ~0.4 W/mK at 300 K. The cations are locally off&#8208;centered along the crystallographic &#12296;100&#12297; direction by about ~0.2 &#197;, which averages out as the rock&#8208;salt structure on the global scale. Phonon dispersion obtained within density functional theory (DFT) shows weak instabilities that cause local off&#8208;centering distortions within an anharmonic double&#8208;well potential. The local structural distortion arises from the stereochemically active 5s2 lone pairs of Sb. Our findings open an avenue for understanding how the local structure influences the phonon transport and facilitate the design of next generation crystalline materials with tailored thermal properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;directed Chemical Modification of Amyloid by Polyoxometalates for Inhibition of Protein Misfolding and Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of protein can significantly change protein conformation and function. Inspired by the natural PTM, we present a new assay to inhibit amyloid aggregation by chemical PTM modification. Polyoxometalates (POMs), a kind of inhibitors to &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) aggregation, are used as an example to exhibit the chemical PTM methods. After thiazolidinethione (TZ) was modified on POM, the POM derivatives (POMD&#8208;TZ) became a chemical PTM agent and could site&#8208;selectively covalent modify on A&#946; at Lys16. Multiple biophysical techniques and biochemical assays have been employed to show the superiority of the chemical PTM method to traditional A&#946; inhibitors. Since A&#946; oligomers are more cytotoxic, we further functionalized POMD&#8208;TZ with an A&#946;&#8208;targeted peptide and fluorescent probe to obtain an &#8220;A&#946; oligomer sensitized&#8221; probe. Our work provides a new way to regulate amyloid aggregation by using PTM agents for site&#8208;directed chemical modification of proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Construction of Biomimetic Nanosensors for Electrochemical Monitoring of Intracellular Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current strategies for nanoelectrode functionalization usually involve sophisticated modification procedures, uncontrollable and unstable modifier assembly, as well as a limited variety of modifiers. To address this issue, we propose a versatile strategy for large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalysts (BMCs) modified nanowires (NWs) to construct functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. This design protocol employs an easy, controllable and stable assembly of diverse BMCs&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composites on conductive NWs. The intrinsic catalytic activity of BMCs combined with outstanding electron transfer ability of conductive polymer enables the nanosensors to sensitively and selectively detect various biomolecules. Further application of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine functionalized nanosensors achieves real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;robust Xanthine&#8208;Sodium Complexes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A widely&#8208;accepted theory is that life originated from the hydrothermal environment in the primordial ocean. Nevertheless, the low desorption temperature from inorganic substrates and the fragileness of hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobases do not support the required thermal stability in such an environment. Herein, we report the super&#8208;robust complexes of xanthine, one of the precursors for the primitive nucleic acids, with Na. We demonstrate that the well&#8208;defined xanthine&#8208;Na complexes can only form when the temperature is &#8805;430 K, and the complexes keep adsorbed even at ~720 K, presenting as the most thermally stable organic polymer ever reported on Au(111). This work not only justifies the necessity of high&#8208;temperature, Na&#8208;rich environment for the prebiotic biosynthesis but also reveals the robustness of the xanthine&#8208;Na complexes upon the harsh environment. Moreover, the complexes can induce significant electron transfer with the metal as inert as Au and hence lift the Au atoms up.</dc:description>

         <title>A Morphing [4Fe&#8208;3S&#8208;nO]&#8208;Cluster within a Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase Scaffold</title>

         <dc:description>Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of CO2 to CO. Several anaerobic microorganisms encode multiple CODHs in their genome, of which some, despite being annotated as CODHs, lack a cysteine of the canonical binding motif for the active site Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster. Here, we report on the structure and reactivity of such a deviant enzyme, termed CooS&#8208;V Ch . Its structure reveals the typical CODH&#8208;scaffold, but contains an iron&#8208;sulfur&#8208;oxo hybrid&#8208;cluster. Although closely related to true CODHs, CooS&#8208;V Ch  catalyzes neither CO&#8208;oxidation, nor CO2&#8208;reduction. The active site of CooS&#8208;V Ch  undergoes a redox&#8208;dependent restructuring between a reduced [4Fe&#8208;3S]&#8208;cluster and an oxidized [4Fe&#8208;2S&#8208;S*&#8208;2O&#8208;2(H2O)]&#8208;cluster. Hydroxylamine, a slow&#8208;turnover substrate of CooS&#8208;V Ch , oxidizes the hybrid&#8208;cluster in two structurally distinct steps. Overall, minor changes in CODHs are sufficient to accommodate a Fe/S/O&#8208;cluster in place of the Ni,Fe&#8208;heterocubane&#8208;cluster of CODHs.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Damage&#8208;Response&#8208;Targeting Mitochondria&#8208;Activated Multifunctional Prodrug Strategy for Self&#8208;defensive Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel multifunctional construct, M1, designed explicitly to target the DNA damage response in cancer cells. M1 contains both a floxuridine (FUDR) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor combined with a GSH&#8208;sensitive linker. Further conjugation of the triphenylphosphonium moiety allows M1 to undergo specific activation in the mitochondria, where mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptosis is observed. Moreover, M1 has enormous effects on genomic DNA ascribed to FUDR's primary function of impeding DNA/RNA synthesis combined with diminishing PP2A&#8208;activated DNA repair pathways. Importantly, mechanistic studies highlight the PP2A obtrusion in FUDR/5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) therapy and underscore the importance of its inhibition to harbor therapeutic potential. HCT116 cell xenograft&#8208;bearing mice that have a low response rate to 5&#8208;FU show a prominent effect with M1, emphasizing the importance of DNA damage response targeting strategies using tumor&#8208;specific microenvironment&#8208;activatable systems.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8208;hosted enzymes for continuous flow catalysis in aqueous and organic solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully exploiting the potential of enzymes in cell&#8208;free biocatalysis requires a stabilization of the catalytically active proteins and their integration into efficient reactor systems. Although in recent years initial steps towards the immobilization of such biomolecules in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been taken, these demonstrations have been limited to batch experiments and to aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate a continuous MOF&#8208;based continuous flow enzyme reactor system, with high productivity and stability, which is also suitable for organic solvents. Under aqueous conditions, the stability of the enzyme was increased by 30&#8208;fold, and the space&#8208;time yield exceeded that obtained with other enzyme immobilization strategies by an order of magnitude. Importantly, the infiltration of the proteins into the MOF did not require additional functionalization, thus allowing for a time and cost&#8208;efficient fabrication of the biocatalysts using label&#8208;free enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;powered Ion Pumping in a Cation&#8208;selective Conducting Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simulation of the ion pumping against a proton gradient energized by light in the photosynthesis is of significant importance for the energy conversion in a non&#8208;biological environment. Herein, we report a light&#8208;powered ion pumping in a polystyrene sulfonate anions (PSS) doped polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer membrane (PSS&#8208;PPy) with a symmetric geometry. This PSS&#8208;PPy conducting polymer membrane exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport attributed to the negatively charged PSS groups. An asymmetric visible irradiation on one side of PSS&#8208;PPy membrane induces a built&#8208;in electric field across the membrane due to the intrinsic photoelectronic property of PPy, which drives the cationic transport against the concentration gradient, demonstrating an ion pumping effect. This work is a prototype that uses a geometry&#8208;symmetric conducting polymer membrane as a light&#8208;powered artificial ion pump for active ion transport, which exhibits potential applications in nanofluidic energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoinitiated intramolecular hydroetherification of alkenols has been used to form C&#8208;O bonds, but the intermolecular hydroetherification of alkenes with alcohols remains an unsolved challenge. We herein report the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted 2&#8208;deoxyglycosylation of alcohols with glycals. The glycosylation reaction was completed within 2 min in a high quantum yield (&#966; = 28.6). This method was suitable for a wide array of substrates and displayed good reaction yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The value of this protocol was further demonstrated by the iterative synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxyglycans with &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages up to a 20&#8208;mer in length and digoxin with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages. Mechanistic studies indicated that this reaction involved a glycosyl radical cation intermediate and a photoinitiated chain process.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Doping Chemistry for Nickel&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of electrode materials by heteroatom dopants is crucial for improving storage performance in rechargeable batteries.   Electron configurations of different dopants significantly influence the chemical interactions inbetween and the chemical bonding with the host material, yet the mechanism underneath remains unclear.  We revealed competitive doping chemistry of Group IIIA elements (boron and aluminum) taking nickel&#8208;rich cathode materials as a model. A notable difference between atomic radii of B and Al accounts for different spatial configurations of hybridized orbital in bonding with lattice oxygen. Density functional theory calculations reveal, Al is preferentially bonded to oxygen and vice versa, and shows much lower diffusion barrier than B(III). In case of Al&#8208;preoccupation, the bulk diffusion of B(III) is hindered. In this way, a B&#8208;rich surface and Al&#8208;rich bulk is formed, which helps to synergistically stabilize the structural evolution and surface chemistry of the cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Coal&#8208;Bed Methane Purification with Record&#160;CH4/N2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enrichment and purification of coal&#8208;bed methane provide a source of energy and help offset global warming. In this work, we demonstrate a strategy involving the regulation of the pore size and pore chemistry to promote the separation of CH  4  /N  2  mixtures in four nickel&#8208;based coordination networks, named  Ni(ina)  2  ,  Ni(3&#8208;ain)  2  ,  Ni(2&#8208;ain)  2  , and  Ni(pba)  2  , (where  ina  = isonicotinic acid,  3&#8208;ain  = 3&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid,  2&#8208;ain  = 2&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, and  pba  = 4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzoic acid). Among them,  Ni(ina)  2  and  Ni(3&#8208;ain)  2  can effectively separate CH  4  from N  2  with top&#8208;performing performance because of the suitable pore size (~0.6 and 0.5 nm) and pore environment. Explicitly,  Ni(ina)  2  exhibits the highest ever reported CH  4  /N  2  selectivity of 15.8 and excellent CH  4  uptake (40.8 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  ) at ambient conditions, thus setting new benchmarks for all reported MOFs and traditional adsorbents. The exceptional CH  4  /N  2  separation performance of  Ni(ina)  2  is confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Under different CH  4  /N  2  ratios,  Ni(ina)  2  selectively extracts methane from the gaseous blend and produces a high purity of CH  4  (99%). Theoretical calculations and CH  4  &#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal structure analysis provide critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism.  Ni(ina)  2  and  Ni(3&#8208;ain)  2  can form rich intermolecular interactions with methane, indicating a strong adsorption affinity between pore walls and CH  4  molecules. Importantly,  Ni(ina)  2  has good thermal and moisture stability and can easily be scaled up at a low cost ($25 per kilogram), which will be valuable for potential industrial applications. Overall, this work provides a powerful approach for the selective adsorption of CH  4  from coal&#8208;bed methane.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reversible Chemogenetic Switch for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T&#8197;Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy suffers from complications including cytokine release syndromes and T cell exhaustion. To curb these drawbacks, Jianfeng Zhou, Wenshe&#8197;Ray Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109550) reported a chemogenetic switch that can be reversibly turned on and off to control the expression of CAR using a clinical approved small&#8208;molecule drug, asunaprevir. This novel technique will potentially enable delicate modulation of CAR&#8208;T activation during cancer treatment.

         <dc:description>
We present evidence that the dual emission of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron compounds consisting of fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence in solution is caused by the experimental artifact, where bright emission intensity saturates the detection dynamic range of the fluorimeter.







Abstract
A series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron compounds 1&#8211;7 have been reported to exhibit unique dual emission, consisting of fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in solution. This finding triggered intensive research of RTP in &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron derivatives. Herein, we show clear evidence that the associated dual emission, especially RTP, is caused by the experimental artifact, where bright emission intensity saturates the detection dynamic range of the fluorimeter.

         <title>A Nuclear&#8208;Targeted AIE Photosensitizer for Enzyme Inhibition and Photosensitization in Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nucleus is considered the ideal target for anti&#8208;tumor therapy because DNA and some enzymes in the nucleus are the main causes of cell canceration and malignant proliferation. However, nuclear target drugs with good biosafety and high efficiency in cancer treatment are rare. Herein, a nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics was developed based on a triphenylamine structure skeleton. MeTPAE can not only interact with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to inhibit cell proliferation but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment (PDT). The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent PDT antitumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Insights into the Notorious CO Poisoning of Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide (CO) is notorious for its strong adsorption to poison platinum group metal catalysts in chemical industry. Here, we conceptually distinguish and quantify the effects of the occupancy and energy of d electrons, emerging as the two vital factors in d&#8208;band theory, on CO poisoning of Pt nanocatalysts. The stepwise defunctionalization of carbon support is adopted to fine&#8208;tune the 5d electronic structure of supported Pt nanoparticles. Excluding other promotional mechanisms, the increase of Pt 5d band energy strengthens the competitive adsorption of hydrogen against CO for the preferential oxidation of CO, affording the scaling relationship between Pt 5d band energy and CO/H2 adsorption energy difference. The decrease of Pt 5d band occupancy lowers CO site coverage to promote its association with oxygen for the total oxidation of CO, giving the scaling relationship between Pt 5d occupancy and activation energy. The above insights draw a molecular&#8208;level understanding of CO poisoning.</dc:description>

The stepwise defunctionalization of carbon support is adopted to fine-tune the 5d electronic structure of supported Pt nanoparticles. Excluding other promotional mechanisms, the increase of Pt 5d band energy strengthens the competitive adsorption of hydrogen against CO for the preferential oxidation of CO, affording the scaling relationship between Pt 5d band energy and CO/H2 adsorption energy difference. The decrease of Pt 5d band occupancy lowers CO site coverage to promote its association with oxygen for the total oxidation of CO, giving the scaling relationship between Pt 5d occupancy and activation energy. The above insights draw a molecular-level understanding of CO poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene Stabilized Disilicon(0) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis and reactivity of disilicon(0) complexes are of fundamental and application importance. Herein, we report the development of an N&#8208;heterocyclic imino substituted silylene (1), which has strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability and is significantly sterically hindered. The one&#8208;pot reaction of this silylene with [IPr&#8594;SiCl2] (IPr = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and KC8 (2 equiv.) in THF at &#8208;30 &#186;C leads to a silylene ligated disilicon(0) complex (2), isolated as red crystals in 60% yield. Characterization data and DFT calculations show that the trans&#8208;bent Si4 skeleton in 2 features a Si(0)=Si(0) double bond with a significant &#960;&#8722;&#960; bonding and one lone pair of electrons on each of these two Si(0) atoms. Complex 2 reacts readily with phenylacetylene, producing a structurally intriguing silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo&#8208;[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene (3), and revealing new aspects of low valent silicon chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the circular polarization capacity from chiral cellulose nanocrystal films for photo&#8208;controlled chiral helix of supramolecular polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized light (CPL) is key to asymmetric photochemistry as it could impart the chiral organization information into chemical products. Here, we demonstrate the circular polarization capacity from chiral cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) films to trigger photo&#8208;alignment of achiral supramolecular polymers into helical structures. Right&#8208;handed transmitted (T&#8208;) CPL was generated from self&#8208;assembled CNC films, which induced amorphous azobenzene (Azo) supramolecular polymers into chiral structures. The chiral induction effect of T&#8208;CPL is enhanced on Azo polymers with longer spacers. The absorptive dissymmetry factor (g  abs  ) values of liquid crystal supramolecular polymers can be amplified significantly (over 10 times) after T&#8208;CPL irradiation. Moreover, by integrating carbon dots into CNC films, CPL emission with considerable luminescence dissymmetry factor (g  lum  ) up to &#8208;0.66 was achieved, and it could be used for the photo&#8208;alignment of Azo polymers with high chiroptical property. This work provides new insight for the photo modulation of supramolecular polymers by CPL&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of Spatial and Temporal Control in Precision Cyclic Vinyl Polymer Synthesis by Lewis Pair Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In typical cyclic polymer synthesis via ring&#8208;closure, chain growth and cyclization events are competing with each other, thus affording cyclic polymers with uncontrolled molecular weight or ring size and high dispersity. Here we uncover a mechanism by which Lewis pair polymerization (LPP) operates on polar vinyl monomers that allows the control of where and when cyclization takes place, thereby achieving spatial and temporal control to afford precision cyclic vinyl polymers or block copolymers with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity (~1.03). A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates that cyclization occurs only after all monomers have been consumed (when) via conjugate addition of the propagating chain end to the specific site of the initiating chain end (where), allowing the cyclic polymer formation steps to be regulated and executed with precision in space and time.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;mediated protein shuttling between coacervate&#8208;based artificial cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of protein uptake and secretion is crucial for (inter)cellular signaling. Mimicking these molecular events is essential when engineering synthetic cellular systems. A first step towards achieving this goal is obtaining control over the uptake and release of proteins from synthetic cells in response to an external trigger. Herein, we have developed an artificial cell that sequesters and releases proteinaceous cargo upon addition of a coded chemical signal: single&#8208;stranded DNA oligos (ssDNA) were employed to independently control the localization of a set of three different ssDNA&#8208;modified proteins. The molecular coded signal allows for multiple iterations of triggered uptake and release, regulation of the amount and rate of protein release and the sequential release of the three different proteins. This signaling concept was furthermore used to directionally transfer a protein between two artificial cell populations, providing novel directions for engineering lifelike communication pathways inside higher order (proto)cellular structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Chemistry Triggers Ultrafast Radiative Recombination in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial chemistry strategy is developed to dramatically increase radiative recombination of perovskites. The oxide&#8208;bonded perovskite has a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state, exhibiting an unprecedented 5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate. The enormously enhanced radiative recombination promises to significantly promote the perovskite optoelectronic performance.







Abstract
Efficient radiative recombination is essential for perovskite luminescence, but the intrinsic radiative recombination rate as a basic material property is challenging to tailor. Here we report an interfacial chemistry strategy to dramatically increase the radiative recombination rate of perovskites. By coating aluminum oxide on the lead halide perovskite, lead&#8211;oxygen bonds are formed at the perovskite&#8208;oxide interface, producing the perovskite surface states with a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state. The oxide&#8208;bonded perovskite exhibits a &#8776;500 fold enhanced photoluminescence with a &#8776;10 fold reduced lifetime, indicating an unprecedented &#8776;5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate.

&lt;p&gt;An interfacial chemistry strategy is developed to dramatically increase radiative recombination of perovskites. The oxide-bonded perovskite has a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state, exhibiting an unprecedented 5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate. The enormously enhanced radiative recombination promises to significantly promote the perovskite optoelectronic performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient radiative recombination is essential for perovskite luminescence, but the intrinsic radiative recombination rate as a basic material property is challenging to tailor. Here we report an interfacial chemistry strategy to dramatically increase the radiative recombination rate of perovskites. By coating aluminum oxide on the lead halide perovskite, lead&#8211;oxygen bonds are formed at the perovskite-oxide interface, producing the perovskite surface states with a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state. The oxide-bonded perovskite exhibits a &#8776;500 fold enhanced photoluminescence with a &#8776;10 fold reduced lifetime, indicating an unprecedented &#8776;5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate. The enormously enhanced radiative recombination promises to significantly promote the perovskite optoelectronic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extraordinary p&#8211;d Hybridization Interaction in Heterostructural Pd&#8208;PdSe Nanosheets Boosts C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile strain effect and extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction that co&#8208;exist on Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets could effectively boost the C&#8722;C bond breaking in the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and enhance the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Advanced electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells are strongly desired owing to the higher energy efficiency. Herein, Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets (Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs) have been successfully fabricated via a one&#8208;step approach. These Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs feature unique electronic and geometrical structures, in which unconventional p&#8211;d hybridization interactions and tensile strain effect co&#8208;exist. Compared with commercial Pd/C and Pd NSs catalysts, Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs display 5.5 (6.6) and 2.5 (2.6) fold enhancement of specific (mass) activity for the EG oxidation reaction (EGOR). Especially, the optimum C1 pathway selectivity of Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs reaches 44.3&#8201;%, illustrating the superior C&#8722;C bond cleavage ability. Electrochemical in situ FTIR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction and tensile strain effect could effectively reduce the activation energy of C&#8722;C bond breaking and accelerate CO* oxidation, boosting the complete oxidation of EG and improving the catalytic performance.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Observation of Structural Dynamics Triggering Excimer Formation in a Perylene Bisimide Folda&#8208;dimer by Ultrafast Time&#8208;Domain Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The term &#8220;excimer&#8221;, a contraction of an excited dimer, is the most classical photoproduct in organic materials. In this work, vibrational snapshots showing ultrafast structural dynamics triggering the excimer formation and its relaxation are presented based on ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that interchromophore vibrational modes are related to perturbing the excited&#8208;state potential surface of a dimer stack.







Abstract
In &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic photovoltaic materials, an excimer state has been generally regarded as a trap state which hinders efficient excitation energy transport. But despite wide investigations of the excimer for overcoming the undesirable energy loss, the understanding of the relationship between the structure of the excimer in stacked organic compounds and its properties remains elusive. Here, we present the landscape of structural dynamics from the excimer formation to its relaxation in a co&#8208;facially stacked archetypical perylene bisimide folda&#8208;dimer using ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. We directly captured vibrational snapshots illustrating the ultrafast structural evolution triggering the excimer formation along the interchromophore coordinate on the complex excited&#8208;state potential surfaces and following evolution into a relaxed excimer state. Not only does this work showcase the ultrafast structural dynamics necessary for the excimer formation and control of excimer characteristics but also provides important criteria for designing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of P&#8208;Chiral Aminophosphinites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral aminophosphinites with esters of hydroxylamines is achieved by means of the dynamic kinetic transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines. A two&#8208;electron redox process is proposed for this reaction based on mechanistic studies.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of diarylphosphines and O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamines is developed. In the cases of symmetrical diarylphosphines, a series of aminophosphinites is prepared in high yields. In the cases of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines, an array of P&#8208;chiral aminophosphinites is synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivity by using a copper(I)&#8208;(R,RP)&#8208;Ph&#8208;FOXAP complex as a chiral catalyst. Based on several control experiments and 31P&#8197;NMR studies, a two&#8208;electron redox mechanism involving the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines is proposed for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction. Finally, one representative P&#8208;chiral phosphoric amide generated through the oxidation with H2O2 is transformed to a chiral diarylphosphinate in high yield with retained enantioselectivity, which allows further transformations towards various P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphines.

         <title>Phosphonate/Phosphine Oxide Dyad Additive for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one dyad additive combining phosphonate and phosphine oxide groups for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is demonstrated. Owing to its dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional green PeLEDs with maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.1&#8201;% is obtained.







Abstract
Additives play a critical role for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we report a novel phosphonate/phosphine oxide dyad molecular additive (PE&#8208;TPPO), with unique dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, to boost the device efficiency of metal&#8211;halide perovskites. In addition to the defect passivation effect of the phosphine oxide group to enhance the photoluminescence intensity and homogeneity of perovskite film, the phosphonate group with strong electron affinity can capture the injected electrons to increase local carrier concentration and accelerate the carrier radiative recombination in the electroluminescence process. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional green PeLEDs modified by this dyad additive exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency, current efficiency, and power efficiency of 25.1&#8201;%, 100.5&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and 98.7&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, respectively, which are among the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies.

         <title>The Role of Copper Salts and O2 in the Mechanism of C&#8801;N Bond Activation for Facilitating Nitrogen Transfer Reactions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed theoretical study on the intricate mechanism and electron transfer landscape of oxygen&#8208;assisted copper&#8208;promoted formation of aryl nitrile species starting from aryl aldehyde. In this reaction the major driving force is the redox cycle of the copper center (CuII/CuI), which acts as the electron source and sink whenever necessary along the course of reaction.







Abstract
C&#8801;N bond scission can be a potential avenue for the functionalization of chemical bonds. We have conducted a computational study, using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio multireference CASSCF methods, to unravel the intricate mechanistic pathways traversed in the copper&#8208;promoted, dioxygen&#8208;assisted reaction for the formation of aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehyde. This aryl isocyanate species acts as an active species for C&#8801;N bond cleavage of coordinated cyanide anion enabling nitrogen transfer to various aldehydes. Electronic structure analysis revealed that under all the reaction conditions radical&#8208;based pathways are operative, which is in agreement with the experimental findings. The major driving force is a CuII/I redox cycle initiated by single&#8208;electron transfer from the carbon center of the nitrile moiety. Our study reveals that the copper salts act as the &#8220;electron pool&#8221; in this unique nitrogen transfer reaction forming an aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehydes.

&lt;p&gt;A detailed theoretical study on the intricate mechanism and electron transfer landscape of oxygen-assisted copper-promoted formation of aryl nitrile species starting from aryl aldehyde. In this reaction the major driving force is the redox cycle of the copper center (Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;), which acts as the electron source and sink whenever necessary along the course of reaction.

         <title>A Facile and Unprecedented Route to a Library of Thermostable Formaldehyde&#8208;Derived Polyesters: Highly Active and Selective Copolymerization of Cyclic Acetals and Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discloses the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 cyclic anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters that can flow at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The development of new strategies for producing polyesters can expand the category of biodegradable materials. Here, we disclose the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals (made from formaldehyde and diols) and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters. At a wide range of reaction temperatures (25 to 140&#8201;&#176;C), diverse metal&#8208;free Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acids are highly active catalysts for these copolymerizations via the cationic mechanism. Of interest, kinetic studies indicate that the copolymerization of cyclic acetals and anhydrides shifts the chemical equilibrium of &#8220;cyclic acetals &#8652; polyacetals&#8221; to the left, thus yielding polyesters with up to &gt;99&#8201;% alternating degree. The obtained polyesters possess high oxygen content ([O]&#8201;:&#8201;[C] up to 6&#8201;:&#8201;7), molecular weights of 2.0&#8211;33.3&#8197;kDa, narrow polydispersities of 1.2&#8211;1.5, low glass transition temperatures (&#8722;64 to &#8722;27&#8201;&#176;C), as well as high decomposition temperatures (275 to 324&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Triptycene&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks with hea Net for Hydrogen Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D COFs with a non&#8208;interpenetrated hea net, JUC&#8208;596 and JUC&#8208;597, are designed and successfully synthesized for the first time. Remarkably, JUC&#8208;596 exhibits an exceptional performance in H2 adsorption up to 305&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (or 2.72&#8197;wt%) at 77&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic polymers reported so far.







Abstract
Owing to the finite building blocks and difficulty in structural identification, it remains a tremendous challenge to elaborately design and synthesize three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with predetermined topologies. Herein, we report the first two cases of 3D COFs with the non&#8208;interpenetrated hea net, termed JUC&#8208;596 and JUC&#8208;597, by using the combination of tetrahedral and triangular prism building units. Due to the presence of triptycene functional groups and fluorine atoms, JUC&#8208;596 exhibits an exceptional performance in the H2 adsorption up to 305&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (or 2.72&#8197;wt%) at 77&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic materials reported so far. Furthermore, the strong interaction between H2 and COF materials is verified through the DFT theoretical calculations. This work represents a captivating example of rational design of functional COFs based on a reticular chemistry guide and demonstrates its promising application in clean energy storage.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stannate(II): A Tetraamido Tin(II) Dianion and Strong Metal&#8208;Centered &#963;&#8208;Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The macrocyclic calix[4]pyrrole enables the synthesis of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion. The compound is a very strong metal&#8208;centered &#963;&#8208;donor with a Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) value exceeding that of carbenes and electron&#8208;rich phosphines. The coordinative and nucleophilic features are demonstrated with transition metals and organic substrates.







Abstract
Anionic, metal&#8208;centered nucleophiles are emerging compounds with unique reactivities. Here, we describe the isolation and full characterization of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion, its behavior as ligand towards transition metals, and its reactivity as a tin&#8208;centered nucleophile. Experimental values such as the Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) and computations attest tin&#8208;located &#963;&#8208;donor ability exceeding that of carbenes or electron&#8208;rich phosphines. Against transition metals, the stannate(II) can act as &#951;1&#8208; or &#951;5&#8208;type ligand. With aldehydes, it reacts by hydride substitution to give valuable acyl stannates. The reductive dehalogenation of iodobenzene indicates facile redox pathways mediated by halogen bond interaction. Calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) represents the first example of this macrocyclic ligand in low&#8208;valent p&#8208;block element chemistry.

         <title>Dissection of Light&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation at a Highly Active Iron Porphyrin: Insights in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptionally high performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photocatalytic reduction displayed by an iron&#8211;porphyrin bearing urea groups in the second coordination sphere is the result of the interaction of CO2 with the catalyst prior to the occurrence of the second electron uptake in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are among the best molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Powering these catalysts with the help of photosensitizers comes along with a couple of unsolved challenges that need to be addressed with much vigor. We have designed an iron porphyrin catalyst decorated with urea functions (UrFe) acting as a multipoint hydrogen bonding scaffold towards the CO2 substrate. We found a spectacular photocatalytic activity reaching unreported TONs and TOFs as high as 7270 and 3720&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively. While the Fe0 redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, we show here that the FeI species is already involved in the CO2 activation, which represents the rate&#8208;determining step in the photocatalytic cycle. The urea functions help to dock the CO2 upon photocatalysis. DFT calculations bring support to our experimental findings that constitute a new paradigm in the catalytic reduction of CO2.

         <title>Helicity Modulation in NIR&#8208;Absorbing Porphyrin&#8211;Ryleneimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peripheral substitution of a &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrin with bulky groups produces a curved chromophore with four helical stereogenic units. The curvature and stereochemistry of such porphyrins can be controlled by varying the substituents, coordinated metal ions, and apical ligands. In particular, when the achiral saddle&#8208;shaped free bases are treated with large metal ions, i.e., Cd  II  or Hg  II  , the resulting complexes switch to chiral propeller&#8208;like configurations. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses show that apical coordination of a water molecule is sufficient to induce a notable bowl&#8208;like distortion of the cadmium complex, which however retains its chiral structure. For phenyl&#8208; and tolyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, the switching is thermodynamically controlled, whereas complexes bearing bulky 4&#8208;(  tert  &#8208;butyl)phenyl groups switch to their chiral forms upon heating. In the latter case, the chiral Hg porphyrin was converted into the corresponding free base and other metal complexes without any loss of configurational purity, ultimately providing access to stable, enantiopure porphyrin propellers.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic Polyoxometalates: Selective Polyanion Binding and Ultrahigh Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational development of anion templation strategy in the construction of macrocycles has been historically limited to small anions, but large polyoxoanions can offer unmatched structural diversity and ample binding sites. Here we report the formation of a {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle by using the Preyssler anion, [NaP5W30O110]14&#8211; ({P5W30}), as a supramolecular template. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle displays selective anion binding behavior in solution. In the solid state, the 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex, {P5W30}2&#8834;{Mo22Fe8}, transports protons more effectively, through extended hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, than a related 1:1 complex where the guest is completely encapsulated. The results highlight the great potential this anion templation approach has in producing macrocyclic systems for selective anion recognition and proton conduction purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Hyperforin and Pyrohyperforin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capitalizing on the late&#8208;stage diversification of an essential 1,3&#8208;diene intermediate, we describe herein a 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;hyperforin and (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin, starting from commercially available allylacetone. Our convergent synthesis features a series of critical reactions: (1) an enantioselective deconjugative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acid using chiral lithium amides as noncovalent stereodirecting auxiliaries; (2) a HfCl  4  mediated carbonyl &#945;&#8208;  tert  &#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework; (3) an abiotic cascade pyran formation; and (4) a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes. During the course of our synthesis, we also identified a 1,2cyclopropanediol overbred intermediate which was responsible for the 1,3&#8208;diene precursor formation through a controlled fragmentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Disassembly of Elemental Sulfur: An Approach to the Precise Synthesis of Polydisulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The usage of elemental sulfur (S  8  ) for constructing sulfur&#8208;containing polymers is of great significance in terms of sulfur resource utilization or fabricating high&#8208;performance polymers. Currently, the random disassembly of S  8  hinders its direct use in the precise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers. Herein, we provide an effective strategy for controlling the dismantlement of S  8  to synthesize polydisulfides, a promising category of dynamic bonds containing polymers. In this strategy, the completely alternating copolymerization of one sulfur atom, which is orderly derived from S  8  , with episulfides is achieved with MTBD (7&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) as catalyst and [PPN]SbF  6  ([PPN]  +  is bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium) as cocatalyst. Delightedly, the living polymerization feature, and the good monomer compatibility allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) was employed to elaborate the copolymerization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Wrinkled Titanium Carbide (MXene) with Surface Charge Polarizations through Chemical Etching for Superior Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the high conductivity of two&#8208;dimensional laminated transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) contributes to outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding by the reflection of electromagnetic waves (EWs), it is difficulty to improve EMI shielding by pursuing higher conductivity due to the limitation of intrinsic properties. Here, we achieve the superior EMI shielding by introducing the absorption of EWs in MXenes with micro&#8208;sized wrinkles which is induced by abundant Ti vacancies under the chemical etching. The shielding effectiveness is up to 107 dB at 20 &#181;m&#8208;thickness. Combining with atomic&#8208;scale structure observation and the first&#8208;principles calculations, it is concluded that the promotion of EMI shielding originates from the resonant absorption of formed electric dipoles induced by the asymmetrical distribution of charge densities near Ti vacancies. Our results could open a new vista for developing two&#8208;dimensional EMI shielding materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO/CH4 using Metal&#8208;Organic &#8216;Soft&#8217; Coordination Polymer Gel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of well&#8208;defined and astutely designed, low molecular weight gelator (LMWG) based linker with a suitable metal ion is a promising method for preparing photocatalytically active coordination polymer gels. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and gelation behaviour of a tetrapodal LMWG based on a porphyrin core connected to four terpyridine units (TPY&#8208;POR) through amide linkages. The self&#8208;assembly of TPY&#8208;POR LMWG with Ru  II  ions results in a Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR coordination polymer gel (CPG), with a nanoscroll morphology. Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG exhibits efficient CO  2  photoreduction to CO (3.5 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) with &gt;99% selectivity in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) as sacrificial electron donor. Interestingly, in the presence of 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) with TEA as the sacrificial electron donor, the 8e  &#8208;  /8H  +  photoreduction of CO  2  to CH  4  is realized with &gt;95 % selectivity (6.7 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ). In CPG, porphyrin acts as a photosensitizer and covalently attached [Ru(TPY)  2  ]  2+  acts as a catalytic center as demonstrated by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Further, combining information from the  in situ  DRIFT spectroscopy and DFT calculation, a possible reaction mechanism for CO  2  reduction to CO and CH  4  was outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Allylic C&#8211;H Alkylation Enabled by a Dual&#8208;Function&#160;Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of allylic C&#8211;H bonds with nucleophiles minimizes pre&#8208;functionalization and converts inexpensive, abundantly available materials to value&#8208;added alkenyl&#8208;substituted products but remains challenging. Here we report an electrocatalytic allylic C&#8211;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles employing an easily available cobalt&#8208;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. These C(sp3)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through H2 evolution and require no external chemical oxidants. Importantly, the mild conditions and unique electrocatalytic radical process ensure excellent functional group tolerance and substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes. The synthetic utility of the electrochemical method is highlighted by its scalability (up to 200 mmol scale) under low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05 equiv) and its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Oriented Nanoarchitectonics of Bacteriorhodopsin for Enhancement of ATP Generation of FoF1&#8208;ATPase Based Assembly System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The energy conversion plays an important role in the metabolism of the photosynthesis organisms. Improving energy transformation by promoting proton gradient, has been a great challenge for a long time. In the present work, we realize a proton directional migration by building oriented bacteriorhodopsin (BR) microcapsules coated by F  o  F  1  &#8208;ATPase molecular motors through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) assembly. The conformation changes of BR under illumination lead to proton transfer in radial direction, which generates a higher proton gradient to drive F  o  F  1  &#8208;ATPase for the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Furthermore, to promote the photosynthetic activity, the optically matched quantum dots are introduced into the artificial co&#8208;assembly system of BR and F  o  F  1  &#8208;ATPase. Such a design creates a new path for the light energy usage.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;nitrogen Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first structural characterizations of these simple fluoro&#8208;nitrogen cations have been accomplished. It is shown that the hybridization of the central nitrogen atom and of the number of fluorine substituents are the determining factors governing the N&#8722;F bond lengths which decrease from 1.40&#8197;&#197; to 1.26&#8197;&#197; with increasing fluorine substitution and increasing s&#8208;character of the nitrogen atom.







Abstract
The crystal structures of [NH3F]+[CF3SO3]&#8722;, [NH2F2]+[SbF6]&#8722;, and [N2F3]+[Sb3F16]&#8722; have been determined, representing the first structural characterizations of these simple fluoro&#8208;nitrogen cations. The influences of the hybridization of the central nitrogen atom and of the number of fluorine substituents on the N&#8722;F bond lengths are evaluated for the series N2F+, N2F3+, NF2O+, NH3F+, NH2F2+, and NF4+. It is shown that the N&#8722;F bond length decreases from 1.40&#8197;&#197; to 1.26&#8197;&#197; with increasing fluorine substitution and increasing s&#8208;character of the nitrogen atom, and that unusual N&#8722;F bond lengths reported in the previous literature are caused by disorder problems

         <title>Cutting COF&#8208;like C4N to Give Colloidal Quantum Dots: Towards Optical Encryption and Bidirectional Sulfur Chemistry via Functional Group and Edge Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of colloidal carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;like quantum dots, C4NQDs, and their functional composites have been introduced. They show interesting fluorescence/room&#8208;temperature&#8208;phosphorescence dual&#8208;mode emission for advanced optical encryption. They also show edge&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;catalysis toward sulfur chemistry in Li&#8722;S cells by exploiting the functional group and edge effects of quantum dots.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first synthesis of colloidal C4N quantum dots (QDs) and their functional composites and explore their optical activities and edge&#8208;selective polysulfide adsorption&#8208;catalysis. As&#8208;obtained C4NQDs are rich in carbonyl groups and edges, allowing good solution processability and facile assembly with other moieties for creating functionalities. While C4NQDs show normal fluorescence (FL), the QD/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composites give FL/room&#8208;temperature&#8208;phosphorescence (RTP) dual&#8208;mode emission, enabling the corresponding solution to be used as an encryption ink. The QDs anchored onto carbon nanotubes can be used as a barrier layer to decorate commercial separators, endowing a Li&#8722;S cell with excellent cycling stability, high rate capability, and large areal capacity. Computation and experiment studies show that edge sites in C4N favor polysulfide adsorption and catalysis and the enriched edges and carbonyl groups in QDs synergically promotecatalytic conversion of sulfur species.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lignin&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers as High&#8208;Temperature and UV&#8208;Blocking Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;initiating frustrated Lewis pairs promoted compounded sequence control to achieve one&#8208;step synthesis of the well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit much superior mechanical properties to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs and maintain TPEs properties at temperatures as high as 180&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
This work utilizes frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of tethered bis&#8208;organophosphorus superbases and a bulky organoaluminum to furnish the highly efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers via one&#8208;step block copolymerization of lignin&#8208;based syringyl methacrylate and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, through di&#8208;initiation and compounded sequence control. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit microphase separation and much superior mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 2091&#8201;%, tensile strength up to 11.5&#8197;MPa, and elastic recovery up to 95&#8201;% after 10 cycles) to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs. More impressively, lignin&#8208;based tri&#8208;BCPs can maintain TPEs properties up to 180&#8201;&#176;C, exhibit high transparency and nearly 100&#8201;% UV shield, suggesting potential applications in temperature&#8208;resistant and optical devices.

Polyacrylonitrile which has C&#8801;N groups was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in perovskite films. The coordination of C&#8801;N with the lead cation was much stronger than that of the normally used C=O group. It could also reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. The device efficiency was improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;%, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage enhanced from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V.







Abstract
In solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite films, halide&#8208;anion related defects including halide vacancies and interstitial defects can easily form at the surfaces and grain boundaries. The uncoordinated lead cations produce defect levels within the band gap, and the excess iodides disturb the interfacial carrier transport. Thus these defects lead to severe nonradiative recombination, hysteresis, and large energy loss in the device. Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in the perovskite films. The coordinating ability of cyano group was found to be stronger than that of the normally used carbonyl groups, and the strong coordination could reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. With the PAN perovskite film, the device efficiency improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;% and the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V, the ion migration activation energy increased, and operational stability improved.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Magnesium Vanadates as Potential Magnesium&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials through an Ab&#8197;Initio Guided Carbothermal Reduction Approach**

Ab initio prediction of thermodynamic parameters leads to a predictive synthesis strategy utilizing solid carbon for facile preparation of a series of magnesium vanadate compounds. 25Mg solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy of these compounds is shown to be a practical way for characterizing their local Mg structures.







Abstract
Many technologically relevant materials for advanced energy storage and catalysis feature reduced transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxides that are often nontrivial to prepare because of the need to control the reducing nature of the atmosphere in which they are synthesized. Herein, we show that an ab&#8197;initio predictive synthesis strategy can be used to produce multi&#8208;gram&#8208;scale products of various MgVxOy&#8208;type phases (&#948;&#8208;MgV2O5, spinel MgV2O4, and MgVO3) containing V3+ or V4+ relevant for Mg&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Characterization of these phases using 25Mg solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy illustrates the potential of 25Mg NMR for studying reversible magnesiation and local charge distributions. Rotor&#8208;assisted population transfer (RAPT) is used as a much&#8208;needed signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise enhancement technique. The ab&#8197;initio guided synthesis method is seen as a step forward towards a predictive synthesis strategy for targeting specific complex TM oxides with variable oxidation states of technological importance.

         <title>Cyclodextrins with Multiple Pyrenyl Groups: An Approach to Organic Molecules Exhibiting Bright Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrins with multiple pyrene units exhibited bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Owing to their good molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105 M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8208;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5), the CPL brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1.







Abstract
We report a simple and effective approach to organic molecules exhibiting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by combining a chiral cyclic molecular scaffold and multiple excimer&#8208;enabling moieties. An &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CyD) scaffold was modified with six pyrenyl groups to obtain pyrene&#8211;cyclodextrins (PCDs) in a one&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available compounds. The PCDs exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8722;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5). Owing to the excellent photophysical properties of the PCDs, the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Photophysical and chiroptical studies of the PCDs with only five pyrene units and with linkers of various lengths connecting the CyD with the pyrene units revealed that the formation of a pyrene excimer in a spatially crowded environment is crucial for CPL anisotropy. This study paves the way for the development of bright CPL organic molecules.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Reliant Dynamic Properties and Elasto&#8208;Plastic to Plastic Crystal (Rotator) Phase Transition in a Metal Oxyacid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical mechanical responses, from elastic and elasto&#8208;plastic bending to exceptional malleability, have been realized at different stress and temperature conditions in crystals of a rhenium oxyacid salt. The extent of the molecular rotations/translations in the mechanism is governed by the crystal structure.







Abstract
Although, dynamic crystals are attractive for use in many technologies, molecular level mechanisms of various solid&#8208;state dynamic processes and their interdependence, remain poorly understood. Here, we report a rare example of a dynamic crystal (1), involving a heavy transition metal, rhenium, with an initial two&#8208;face elasticity (within &#8776;1&#8201;% strain), followed by elasto&#8208;plastic deformation, at room temperature. Further, these crystals transform to a rotator (plastic) crystal phase at &#8776;105&#8201;&#176;C, displaying exceptional malleability. Qualitative and quantitative mechanical tests, X&#8208;ray diffraction, &#956;&#8208;Raman and polarized light microscopy experiments reveal that the elasto&#8208;plastic deformation involves both partial molecular rotations and slip, while malleability in the rotator phase is facilitated by reorientational motions and increased symmetry (slip planes). Our work, connecting the plastically bendable (1D or 2D) crystals with the rotator phases (3D), is important for designing multi&#8208;functional dynamic crystals.

         <title>Thermo&#8208; and Mechanochromic Camouflage and Self&#8208;Healing in Biomimetic Soft Actuators Based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore is chemically introduced into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape&#8208;morphing and reversible color&#8208;changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also have excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics.







Abstract
In nature, many mysterious creatures capable of deformation camouflage, color camouflage, and self&#8208;healing have inspired scientists to develop various biomimetic soft robots. However, the systematic integration of all the above functionalities into a single soft actuator system still remains a challenge. Here we chemically introduce a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape&#8208;morphing and reversible color&#8208;changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also show excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics. We hope that such a TASN&#8208;LCE actuator system endowed with dynamic distortion, thermo&#8208; and mechano&#8208;chromic camouflage, and self&#8208;healing functionalities would pave the way for further development of multifunctional biomimetic soft robotic devices.

     alt="Thermo- and Mechanochromic Camouflage and Self-Healing in Biomimetic Soft Actuators Based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-stimuli-responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore is chemically introduced into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol-ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN-LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape-morphing and reversible color-changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also have excellent self-healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, many mysterious creatures capable of deformation camouflage, color camouflage, and self-healing have inspired scientists to develop various biomimetic soft robots. However, the systematic integration of all the above functionalities into a single soft actuator system still remains a challenge. Here we chemically introduce a multi-stimuli-responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol-ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN-LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape-morphing and reversible color-changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also show excellent self-healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics. We hope that such a TASN-LCE actuator system endowed with dynamic distortion, thermo- and mechano-chromic camouflage, and self-healing functionalities would pave the way for further development of multifunctional biomimetic soft robotic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supported &#963;&#8208;Complexes of Li&#8722;C Bonds from Coordination of Monomeric Molecules of LiCH3, LiCH2CH3 and LiC6H5 to Mo&#8803;Mo Bonds</title>

The coordination of monomeric LiCH2R (R=H, CH3) and LiC6H5 molecules to a Mo2 core is reported. The molecular structures of the new complexes were analyzed both in solution by NMR spectroscopic techniques and in the solid state and gas phase by X&#8208;ray and computational studies.







Abstract
LiCH3 and LiCH2CH3 react with the complex [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2(thf)2] (1&#8901;thf) with coordination of two molecules of LiCH2R (R=H, CH3) and formation of complexes [Mo2{&#956;&#8208;HLi(thf)CH2R}2(AdDipp2)2], 5&#8901;LiCH3 and 5&#8901;LiCH2CH3, respectively (AdDipp2=HC(NDipp)2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; thf=C4H8O). Due to steric hindrance, only one molecule of LiC6H5 adds to 1&#8901;thf generating the complex [Mo2(H){&#956;&#8208;HLi(thf)C6H5}(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2], (4&#8901;LiC6H5). Computational studies disclose the existence of five&#8208;center six&#8208;electron bonding within the H&#8722;Mo&#8803;Mo&#8722;C&#8722;Li metallacycles, with a mostly covalent H&#8722;Mo&#8803;Mo&#8722;C group and predominantly ionic Li&#8722;C and Li&#8722;H interactions. However, the latter bonds exhibit non&#8208;negligible covalency, as indicated by X&#8208;ray, computational data and the large one&#8208;bond 6,7Li,1H and 6,7Li,13C NMR coupling constants found for the three&#8208;atom H&#8722;Li&#8722;C chains. By contrast, the phenyl group in 4&#8901;LiC6H5 coordinates in an &#951;2 fashion to the lithium atom through the ipso and one of the ortho carbon atoms.

         <title>Microfluidic Fabrication of Hierarchical&#8208;Ordered ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx Core&#8211;Sheath Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>

High&#8208;performance asymmetric supercapacitors based on hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx core&#8211;sheath fibers have been developed by microfluidic assembly and microchannel reaction methods. Due to an in situ Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn bonding bridge, well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity and fast interfacial charge transfer, supercapacitors deliver high energy density, large capacitance, long&#8208;term stability and natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications.







Abstract
We report hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx MXene core&#8211;sheath fibers, in which a ZIF&#8722;L(Zn) nanowall array sheath is grown vertically on an anisotropic Ti3C2Tx core by Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn chemical bonds. Through highly efficient microfluidic assembly and microchannel reactions, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx exhibits well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity, ordered ionic pathways, fast interfacial electron conduction and large&#8208;scale fabrication, significantly boosting charges dynamic transport and intercalation. The resultant ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber presents large capacitance (1700&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and outstanding rate performance in a 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;based solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitors deliver high energy density (19.0&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), excellent capacitance (854&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3), large deformable/wearable capabilities and long&#8208;time cyclic stability (20&#8201;000 cycles), which realize natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications to drive water level/earthquake alarm devices.

         <title>Chemically Engineered Porous Molecular Coatings as Reactive Oxygen Species Generators and Reservoirs for Long&#8208;Lasting Self&#8208;Cleaning Textiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of solution&#8208;processable, crystalline porous materials were prepared and used as textiles coatings to spontaneously convert absorbed oxygen from air into reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon absorption of daylight, and long&#8208;termly store ROS in dark conditions. This work paves the way for further developing self&#8208;cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Wearable personal protective equipment that is decorated with photoactive self&#8208;cleaning materials capable of actively neutralizing biological pathogens is in high demand. Here, we developed a series of solution&#8208;processable, crystalline porous materials capable of addressing this challenge. Textiles coated with these materials exhibit a broad range of functionalities, including spontaneous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation upon absorption of daylight, and long&#8208;term ROS storage in dark conditions. The ROS generation and storage abilities of these materials can be further improved through chemical engineering of the precursors without altering the three&#8208;dimensional assembled superstructures. In comparison with traditional TiO2 or C3N4 self&#8208;cleaning materials, the fluorinated molecular coating material HOF&#8208;101&#8208;F shows a 10&#8208; to 60&#8208;fold enhancement of ROS generation and 10&#8208; to 20&#8208;fold greater ROS storage ability. Our results pave the way for further developing self&#8208;cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>K&#8208;Chabazite Zeolite Nanocrystal Aggregates for Highly Efficient Methane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seed iteration method to synthesize macro&#8211;meso&#8211;micro hierarchical K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal (&#8776;50&#8197;nm) aggregates with enhanced mass transfer rate and adsorption capacity of CH4 to effectively separate CH4/N2 is reported, which has significant potential for low&#8208;concentrated coalbed methane enrichment.







Abstract
Methane (CH4) enrichment and purification is of great significance for increasing the heating value of unconventional natural gas sources and curtailing its effect on global warming. For a long time, commercial adsorbents for CH4 separation have been hampered by low adsorption capacities, sub&#8208;optimal adsorption selectivities, or slow diffusion rates, which have significantly restricted separation productivity. Herein, we report a facile and green seed&#8208;passaging method to fabricate donut&#8208;like macro&#8211;meso&#8211;micro hierarchical zeolite K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal aggregates. This consecutive seed&#8208;inducing method requires no organic template. By utilizing this unique nanocrystallization technique, the CH4 adsorption capacity, gas diffusion rate, and separation productivity of the resultant material are dramatically increased compared with those of commercially available adsorbents, thus setting a new benchmark in CH4/N2 separation. More importantly, production of this adsorbent can be easily scaled&#8208;up to the order of 100&#8197;kg using readily available raw materials in this environmentally friendly synthetic route, enabling potential industrial implementation.

         <title>Functional Characterization and Protein Engineering of a Triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Glycosyltransferase Reveal a Conserved Residue Critical for the Regiospecificity</title>

We characterized the first plant cycloartane glycosyltransferase AmGT8 from A. membranaceus. Its mutants A394F, A394D, and T131V were discovered using semi&#8208;rational design, which showed specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O, and 2&#8242;&#8208;O glycosylation activities, respectively. This study uncovered a conserved residue critical for the regiospecificity of plant glycosyltransferases.







Abstract
Engineering the function of triterpene glucosyltransferases (GTs) is challenging due to the large size of the sugar acceptors. In this work, we identified a multifunctional glycosyltransferase AmGT8 catalyzing triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation from the medicinal plant Astragalus membranaceus. To engineer its regiospecificity, a small mutant library was built based on semi&#8208;rational design. Variants A394F, A394D, and T131V were found to catalyze specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O, and 2&#8242;&#8208;O glycosylation, respectively. The origin of regioselectivity of AmGT8 and its A394F variant was studied by molecular dynamics and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Residue 394 is highly conserved as A/G and is critical for the regiospecificity of the C&#8208; and O&#8208;GTs TcCGT1 and GuGT10/14. Finally, astragalosides III and IV were synthesized by mutants A394F, T131V and P192E. This work reports biocatalysts for saponin synthesis and gives new insights into protein engineering of regioselectivity in plant GTs.

         <title>Modification of Multi&#8208;Component Building Blocks for Assembling Giant Chiral Lanthanide&#8208;Titanium Molecular Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modification procedure on a 15&#8208;component building block of achiral Ln24Ti8 wheel&#8208;like assemblies has been developed to obtain new accessible building blocks, resulting in a pair of new chiral enantiomers in elusive Ln&#8211;Ti systems.







Abstract
Building blocks with multiple components are promising for the synthesis of complex molecular assemblies, but are rarely available. Herein, we report a modification procedure for a multi&#8208;component building block [Ln3Ti(HSA)6(SA)4(H2O)]&#8722; ({Ln3Ti&#8208;SA}, H2SA=salicylic acid, Ln=Eu/Gd) to form new building blocks {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} (H2MSA=5&#8208;methoxysalicylic acid, x=1, 2, 3) by constructing [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8722; units. The obtained {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} can further assemble into a chiral Ln22Ti14 ring with the formulae [Eu22Ti14(MSA)48(HMSA)22(CH3COO)4(H2O)10(iPrOH)] and [Gd22Ti14(MSA)46(HMSA)26(CH3COO)4(H2O)8]. Parallel experiments without Ti4+ result in linear Ln chains. Detailed analysis shows that the [Ti(MSA)4]4&#8722; unit makes the originally variable Ln chains become available building blocks and the modified [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8722; further triggers interesting chiral&#8208;sorting behavior. Finally, the electronic adsorption and magneto&#8208;optic responses of these molecular rings are investigated.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic In Vivo Methylation&#8208;Hydroamination of Bioderived Lignin Monomers to Generate a Key Precursor to L&#8208;DOPA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein and strain engineering combined. The combination of two engineered enzymes (a methyltransferase and an ammonia lyase) and an engineered E.&#8197;coli strain (for regeneration of the SAM cofactor) has been developed to enable a fully biocatalytic one&#8208;pot methylation&#8211;hydroamination cascade. As an example, the synthesis of l &#8208;veratrylglycine from renewable lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid has been demonstrated, in high yield and excellent ee.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates can be derived from the depolymerisation of lignin feedstocks. Direct biotransformations of the hydroxycinnamic acid monomers obtained can be exploited to produce high&#8208;value chemicals, such as &#945;&#8208;amino acids, however the reaction is often hampered by the chemical autooxidation in alkaline or harsh reaction media. Regioselective O&#8208;methyltransferases (OMTs) are ubiquitous enzymes in natural secondary metabolic pathways utilising an expensive co&#8208;substrate S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) as the methylating reagent altering the physicochemical properties of the hydroxycinnamic acids. In this study, we engineered an OMT to accept a variety of electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates, modified a commercial E.&#8197;coli strain BL21 (DE3) to regenerate SAM in&#8197;vivo, and combined it with an engineered ammonia lyase to partake in a one&#8208;pot, two whole cell enzyme cascade to produce the l&#8208;DOPA precursor l&#8208;veratrylglycine from lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid.

         <title>Smart Nano&#8208;PROTACs Reprogram Tumor Microenvironment for Activatable Photo&#8208;metabolic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) are developed for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. SPNCOX&#8208;mediated therapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity but also induce targeted intratumoral degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system, leading to the depletion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME to inhibit tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence.







Abstract
Protease inhibitors can modulate intratumoral metabolic processes to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which however suffer from the limited efficacy and off&#8208;targeted side effects. We report smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) with phototherapeutic ablation and cancer&#8208;specific protein degradation to reprogram the TME for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. This nano&#8208;PROTAC has a semiconducting polymer backbone linked with a cyclooxygenase 1/2 (COX&#8208;1/2)&#8208;targeting PROTAC peptide (CPP) via a cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable segment. CPP can be activated by the tumor&#8208;overexpressed CatB to induce the degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The persistent degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 depletes their metabolite prostaglandin E2 which is responsible for activation of immune suppressor cells. Such a smart PROTAC strategy synergized with phototherapy specifically reprograms the immunosuppressive TME and reinvigorates antitumor immunity.

         <title>Degradable Vinyl Random Copolymers via Photocontrolled Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Copolymerization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via photocontrolled radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP) is developed. A variety of acrylates or acrylamides can be copolymerized with the macrocyclic allylic sulfone with near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios at all feed compositions. The unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by sulfur dioxide in rROCCP was resolved by reducing the solubility of sulfur dioxide.







Abstract
Degradable vinyl polymers by radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization are promising solutions to the challenges caused by non&#8208;degradable vinyl plastics. However, achieving even distributions of labile functional groups in the backbone of degradable vinyl polymers remains challenging. Herein, we report a photocatalytic approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP). The rROCCP of macrocyclic allylic sulfones and acrylates or acrylamides mediated by visible light at ambient temperature achieved near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios over the entire range of the feed compositions. Experimental and computational evidence revealed an unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by in situ generated sulfur dioxide (SO2), which was successfully overcome by reducing the solubility of SO2. This study provides a powerful approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers with comparable material properties to non&#8208;degradable vinyl polymers.

         <title>A Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;Anchored Rhenium(I) Photosensitizer Evokes Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored photosensitizer CA&#8208;Re was developed. It is capable of inducing and self&#8208;reporting membrane rupture upon irradiation, as well as evoking pyroptosis to activate anti&#8208;tumor immunity.







Abstract
An ideal cancer treatment should not only destroy primary tumors but also improve the immunogenicity of the tumor microenvironment to achieve a satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor immune effect. We designed a carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored rhenium(I) photosensitizer, named CA&#8208;Re, that not only performs type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II photodynamic therapy (PDT) with high efficiency under hypoxia (nanomolar&#8208;level phototoxicity), but also evokes gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptotic cell death to effectively stimulate tumor immunogenicity. CA&#8208;Re could disrupt and self&#8208;report the loss of membrane integrity simultaneously. This promoted the maturation and antigen&#8208;presenting ability of dendritic cells (DCs), and fully activated T cells dependent adaptive immune response in vivo, eventually eliminating distant tumors at the same time as destroying primary tumors. To the best of our knowledge, CA&#8208;Re is the first metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducer.

         <title>Aquimarins, Peptide Antibiotics with Amino&#8208;Modified C&#8208;Termini from a Sponge&#8208;Derived Aquimarina sp. Bacterium</title>

Potion from the ocean: New peptide antibiotics from a sponge&#8208;derived bacterium are reported, featuring chlorination and an unusual amino&#8208;capped C&#8208;terminus. Studies on isolation, structure elucidation, biosynthesis, total synthesis, and structure&#8211;activity relationships are presented.







Abstract
Genome mining and bioactivity studies suggested the sponge&#8208;derived bacterium Aquimarina sp. Aq135 as a producer of new antibiotics. Activity&#8208;guided isolation identified antibacterial peptides, named aquimarins, featuring a new scaffold with an unusual C&#8208;terminal amino group and chlorine moieties. Responsible for the halogenation is the FeII/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent chlorinase AqmA that halogenates up to two isoleucine residues in a carrier protein&#8208;dependent fashion. Total syntheses of two natural aquimarins and eight non&#8208;natural variants were developed. Structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies with these compounds showed that the synthetically more laborious chlorinations are not required for antibacterial activity but enhance cytotoxicity. In contrast, variants lacking the C&#8208;terminal amine were virtually inactive, suggesting diamines similar to the terminal aquimarin residue as candidate building blocks for new peptidomimetic antibiotics.

         <title>Regeneration of Phytochemicals by Structure&#8208;Driven Organization of Microbial Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable access to hypericin, a phytochemical with promising medicinal properties but low natural abundance, a strategy involving structure&#8208;based modification and organization of the microbial biosynthetic steps was developed without knowing its biosynthetic pathway in native plants. The designed consecutive reactions (see scheme) occurred in repurposed cells, thus circumventing the complex plant secondary metabolism.







Abstract
Medicinal phytochemicals, such as artemisinin and taxol, have impacted the world, and hypericin might do so if its availability issue could be addressed. Hypericin is the hallmark component of Saint John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), an approved depression alleviator documented in the US, European, and British pharmacopoeias with its additional effectiveness against diverse cancers and viruses. However, the academia&#8208;to&#8208;industry transition of hypericin remain hampered by its low in planta abundance, unfeasible bulk chemical synthesis, and unclear biosynthetic mechanism. Here, we present a strategy consisting of the hypericin&#8208;structure&#8208;centered modification and reorganization of microbial biosynthetic steps in the repurposed cells that have been tamed to enable the designed consecutive reactions to afford hypericin (43.1&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1), without acquiring its biosynthetic knowledge in native plants. The study provides a synthetic biology route to hypericin and establishes a platform for biosustainable access to medicinal phytochemicals.

Hypericin is the hallmark component of Saint John's wort (&lt;i&gt;Hypericum perforatum&lt;/i&gt; L.), an approved depression alleviator documented in the US, European, and British pharmacopoeias with its additional effectiveness against diverse cancers and viruses. However, the academia-to-industry transition of hypericin remain hampered by its low &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt; abundance, unfeasible bulk chemical synthesis, and unclear biosynthetic mechanism. Here, we present a strategy consisting of the hypericin-structure-centered modification and reorganization of microbial biosynthetic steps in the repurposed cells that have been tamed to enable the designed consecutive reactions to afford hypericin (43.1&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), without acquiring its biosynthetic knowledge in native plants. The study provides a synthetic biology route to hypericin and establishes a platform for biosustainable access to medicinal phytochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The First Sulfate&#8208;Pillared Hybrid Ultramicroporous Material, SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, and Its Acetylene Capture Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prototypal member of a new family of hybrid ultramicroporous material, SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, uses earth&#8208;friendly sulfate anions to selectively capture C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures, enabling recovery of both gases at high purities even from trace mixtures.







Abstract
Hybrid ultramicroporous materials, HUMs, are comprised of metal cations linked by combinations of inorganic and organic ligands. Their modular nature makes them amenable to crystal engineering studies, which have thus far afforded four HUM platforms (as classified by the inorganic linkers). HUMs are of practical interest because of their benchmark gas separation performance for several industrial gas mixtures. We report herein design and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the prototypal sulfate&#8208;linked HUM, the fsc topology coordination network ([Zn(tepb)(SO4)]n), SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, tepb=(tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene). Alignment of the sulfate anions enables strong binding to C2H2 via O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HC interactions but weak CO2 binding, affording a new benchmark for the difference between C2H2 and CO2 heats of sorption at low loading (&#916;Qst=24&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Dynamic column breakthrough studies afforded fuel&#8208;grade C2H2 from trace (1&#8201;:&#8201;99) or 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;C2H2/CO2 mixtures, outperforming its SiF62&#8722; analogue, SIFSIX&#8208;22&#8208;Zn.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Structured Upconversion/Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanoparticles for Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An up&#8208;conversion nanoparticles and MnII&#8208;based perovskite core&#8211;shell heterostructures nanocomposite was successfully synthesized for the first time, which showed dual&#8208;color emissions under the excitation of UV light and IR laser. This work suggests its potential in high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting.







Abstract
In view of their excellent luminescence properties, nanocrystalline metal halide perovskites have diverse optoelectronic applications, including those related to anticounterfeiting. However, high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting typically requires multiple encryptions relying on several optical modes to ensure information security. Herein, an efficient anticounterfeiting strategy based on dual optical encryption is realized by combining up&#8208; and downconversion luminescence in a nanocomposite with NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+,Yb3+ as core and a CsMnCl3 as shell. The emission color of this nanocomposite depends on the penetration depth of incident radiation and can be changed by varying the excitation source (980&#8197;nm laser or UV light) to produce different luminescent patterns. This feature allows one to effectively improve the anticounterfeiting index and fabricate professional anticounterfeiting materials.

         <title>Ordered PtFeIr Intermetallic Nanowires Prepared through a Silica&#8208;Protection Strategy for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowires supported on commercial carbon were synthesized. Coating with SiO2 and the addition of Ir enabled the integrity of the nanowire structure to be maintained during their transformation from a disordered fcc&#8208;phase to an ordered fct&#8208;phase. The fct&#8208;phase nanowires exhibited much better ORR activity and structural and electrochemical stability than the fcc&#8208;phase ones.







Abstract
Developing efficient and stable Pt&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is a way to promote the large&#8208;scale application of fuel cells. Pt&#8208;based alloy nanowires are promising ORR catalysts, but their application is hampered by activity loss caused by structural destruction during long&#8208;term cycling. Herein, the preparation of ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowire catalysts with an average diameter of 2.6&#8197;nm and face&#8208;centered tetragonal structure (fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C) is reported. A silica&#8208;protected strategy prevents the deformation of PtFeIr nanowires during the phase transition at high temperature. The as&#8208;prepared fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C exhibited superior mass activity for ORR (2.03&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) than disordered PtFeIr nanowires with face&#8208;centered cubic structure (1.11&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and commercial Pt/C (0.21&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1). Importantly, the structure and electrochemical performance of fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C were maintained after stability tests, showing the advantages of the ordered structure.

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity and Stability of Finned Ferrierite Catalysts in Butene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of finned ferrierite produces a zeolite with reduced mass transport limitations, thereby enhancing its catalyst lifetime and increasing its selectivity to isobutene in tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.







Abstract
Designing zeolite catalysts with improved mass transport properties is crucial for restrictive networks of either one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional pore topologies. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of finned ferrierite (FER), a commercial zeolite with two&#8208;dimensional pores, where protrusions on crystal surfaces behave as pseudo nanoparticles. Catalytic tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization reveal a 3&#8208;fold enhancement of catalyst lifetime and an increase of 12&#8201;% selectivity to isobutene for finned samples compared to corresponding seeds. Electron tomography was used to confirm the identical crystallographic registry of fins and seeds. Time&#8208;resolved titration of Br&#248;nsted acid sites confirmed the improved mass transport properties of finned ferrierite compared to conventional analogues. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemistry of Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) was systematically investigated on a single nanoparticle level using nanoparticle impact electrochemistry, which enables in&#8208;depth understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the system, allowing quantitative analysis of the increased reaction possibility and the decreased activation energy. This work reveals the intrinsic physicochemical information at the nano&#8208;confined domains.







Abstract
The structure&#8211;function relationship of plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) is of great importance for the design of efficient PEEC catalysts, but is rarely investigated at single nanoparticle level for the lack of an efficient nanoscale methodology. Herein, we report the utilization of nanoparticle impact electrochemistry to allow single nanoparticle PEEC, where the effect of incident light on the plasmonic Ag/Au nanoparticles for accelerating cobalt metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOFNs) catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is systematically explored. It is found that the plasmon&#8208;excited hot carrier injection can lower the reaction activation energy, resulting in a much promoted reaction probability and the integral charge generated from individual collisions. Besides, a plasmonic nanoparticle filtering method is established to effectively distinguish different plasmonic nanoparticles. This work provides a unique view in understanding the intrinsic physicochemical properties for PEEC at the nano&#8208;confined domains.

         <title>A Nanohook&#8208;Equipped Bionanocatalyst for Localized Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst can firstly hook to bacteria and biofilm, then catalyze H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals for localized disinfection. Upon the near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, the bionanocatalyst can generate heat, which simultaneously accelerates the catalytic therapy and enables the heat ablation against bacteria.







Abstract
Novel bionanocatalysts have opened a new era in fighting multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. They can kill bacteria by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of chemicals like H2O2. However, ROSs&#8217; ultrashort diffusion distance limit their bactericidal activity. We present a nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst (Ni@Co&#8208;NC) with bacterial binding ability that shows robust ROS&#8208;generating capacity under physiological H2O2 levels. The Ni@Co&#8208;NC's pH&#8208;dependent performance confines its effects to the biofilm microenvironment, leaving healthy tissue unaffected. Furthermore, it can generate heat upon NIR laser irradiation, enhancing its catalytic performance while achieving heat ablation against bacteria. With the Ni@Co&#8208;NC's synergistic effects, bacterial populations fall by &gt;99.99&#8201;%. More surprisingly, the mature biofilm shows no recurrence after treatment with the Ni@Co&#8208;NC, demonstrating its tremendous potential for treating MDR bacterial related infections.

         <title>Hindered Tetraphenylethylene Helicates: Chiral Fluorophores with Deep&#8208;Blue Emission, Multiple&#8208;Color CPL, and Chiral Recognition Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates, with a completely immobilized propeller&#8208;like conformation through substitution at the 2,6&#8208;positions of the phenyl rings, were prepared by a short synthetic route. These helicates, with their many modification positions, show deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) that can be tuned over a wide range, and highly enantioselective chiral recognition.







Abstract
New hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates with substitution at 2,6&#8208;position of phenyl rings were designed and synthesized. Due to the increased hindrance, the TPE helicates emit strong deep&#8208;blue to violet fluorescence both in the solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possess amino groups with an unpredented planar structure and sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and high chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.

         <title>Stabilization of Polyoxometalate Charge Carriers via Redox&#8208;Driven Nanoconfinement in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of polyoxometalates (POMs) within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes is shown, demonstrating that the level of carbon oxidation and the efficacy of the filling are determined by the frontier orbital energies of the POM. Nanoencapsulation is found to confer significant stability to polyoxomolybdates despite their inherent lability.







Abstract
We describe the preparation of hybrid redox materials based on polyoxomolybdates encapsulated within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Polyoxomolybdates readily oxidize SWNTs under ambient conditions in solution, and here we study their charge&#8208;transfer interactions with SWNTs to provide detailed mechanistic insights into the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of these and similar nanoclusters. We are able to correlate the relative redox potentials of the encapsulated clusters with the level of SWNT oxidation in the resultant hybrid materials and use this to show that precise redox tuning is a necessary requirement for successful encapsulation. The host&#8211;guest redox materials described here exhibit exceptional electrochemical stability, retaining up to 86&#8201;% of their charge capacity over 1000 oxidation/reduction cycles, despite the typical lability and solution&#8208;phase electrochemical instability of the polyoxomolybdates we have explored. Our findings illustrate the broad applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation approach to the design and fabrication of tunable, highly conductive, ultra&#8208;stable nanoconfined energy materials.

         <title>Implementation of Quantum Level Addressability and Geometric Phase Manipulation in Aligned Endohedral Fullerene Qudits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toward molecular quantum computing, the system needs to have good coherence, scalability, and addressability. Using endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time, this work tackled the remaining two challenges by molecular modification and ensemble alignment. The refined molecular system scales up to four addressable quantum levels and enables the first implementation of geometric phase manipulation using pure electron paramagnetic resonance.







Abstract
Endohedral nitrogen fullerenes have been proposed as building blocks for quantum information processing due to their long spin coherence time. However, addressability of the individual electron spin levels in such a multiplet system of 4S3/2 has never been achieved because of the molecular isotropy and transition degeneracy among the Zeeman levels. Herein, by molecular engineering, we lifted the degeneracy by zero&#8208;field splitting effects and made the multiple transitions addressable by a liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;assisted method. The endohedral nitrogen fullerene derivatives with rigid addends of spiro structure and large aspect ratios of regioselective bis&#8208;addition improve the ordering of the spin ensemble. These samples empower endohedral&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based qudits, in which the transitions between the 4 electron spin levels were respectively addressed and coherently manipulated. The quantum geometric phase manipulation, which has long been proposed for the advantages in error tolerance and gating speed, was implemented in a pure electron spin system using molecules for the first time.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Manipulation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Enhanced Metal&#8211;Oxygen Covalency for Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiIII&#8208;NCF with enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency is obtained by manipulating the spin state of Ni2+ in NiII&#8208;NCF, which facilitates formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li2O2 among NiIII&#8208;NCF nanowire arrays upon discharging. This enables small charge/discharge overvoltages, superior rate capability, and long cycling stability.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8722;O2 batteries have attracted extensive attention in the past decade owing to their high theoretical energy density; however, they are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and large voltage hysteresis. We regulate the spin state of partial Ni2+ metal centers (t2g6eg2) of conductive nickel catecholate framework (NiII&#8208;NCF) nanowire arrays to high&#8208;valence Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) for NiIII&#8208;NCF. The spin&#8208;state modulation enables enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency in NiIII&#8208;NCF, which facilitates electron exchange between the Ni sites and oxygen adsorbates and accelerates the oxygen redox kinetics. Upon discharging, the high affinity of Ni3+ sites with the intermediate LiO2 promotes formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li2O2 in the void space among NiIII&#8208;NCF nanowires. The Li&#8722;O2 battery based on NiIII&#8208;NCF offers remarkably reduced discharge/charge voltage gaps, superior rate capability, and a long cycling stability of over 200 cycles. This work highlights the importance of electron spin state on the redox kinetics and will provide insight into electronic structure regulation of electrocatalysts for Li&#8722;O2 batteries and beyond.

         <title>Configurationally Chiral SuFEx&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically chiral SuFEx (sulfur&#8211;fluorine exchange) click reaction was used to produce a series of configurationally chiral high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. This step&#8208;growth polymerization occurs with high efficiency and enantiospecifically (ee&gt;98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Novel methods to make synthetic chiral polymers are highly desirable given their potential in a rapidly increasing number of bio&#8208;inspired applications. The enantiospecific sulfur&#8211;fluorine exchange (SuFEx) reaction of chiral di&#8208;sulfonimidoyl fluorides (di&#8208;SFs) with diphenols, was used to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight chiral polymers with configurational backbone chirality. The resulting new class of polymers, polysulfonimidates, can be efficiently produced via this step&#8208;growth mechanism for a wide range of di&#8208;SFs and diphenols, yielding MnPS up to 283&#8197;kDa with a typical dispersity &#272; around 1.6. The optical activity of the resulting chiral polymers is largely due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the S atoms (configurational chirality). Finally, the enantiospecificity (ee&gt;98&#8201;%) of the polymerization reaction was demonstrated by the degradation of a disulfide&#8208;containing polysulfonimidate. This novel route towards configurational main&#8208;chain chirality opens up new approaches towards tailor&#8208;made chiral polymers with precisely defined properties.

         <title>TMSCF2Br&#8208;Enabled Fluorination&#8211;Aminocarbonylation of Aldehydes: Modular Access to &#945;&#8208;Fluoroamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines has been developed, in which the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl) is the key to the success of this multicomponent process.







Abstract
A protocol for the modular assembly of the &#945;&#8208;fluoroamide motif has been developed, which provides a practical method for the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines through a three&#8208;component fluorination&#8211;aminocarbonylation process. The key to the success of this process is taking advantage of the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl). The mechanism of the process involves the 1,2&#8208;fluorine and oxygen migrations of the in situ formed TMS&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;aminodifluoromethyl carbinol intermediates, which represents a new type of deoxyfluorination reaction.

         <title>Coordinated Anionic Inorganic Module&#8212;An Efficient Approach Towards Highly Efficient Blue&#8208;Emitting Copper Halide Ionic Hybrid Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and facile strategy for the design and synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating a coordinated anionic inorganic module in these ionic species is reported. By using this approach, a family of strongly blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures has been prepared with high internal quantum yields (IQYs) up to 98&#8201;%.







Abstract
Copper halide based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid semiconductors exhibit great potential as light&#8208;emitting materials with excellent structural variety and optical tunability. Among them, copper halide hybrid molecular compounds with discrete inorganic modules are particularly interesting due to their high quantum efficiency. However, synthesizing highly efficient blue&#8208;emitting molecular clusters remains challenging. Here, we report a novel and facile strategy for the design and synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating coordinated anionic inorganic modules in these ionic species. By using this approach, a family of strongly blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures has been prepared with high internal quantum yields up to 98&#8201;%. Strong luminescence from the combination of ionic and covalent bonds in these compounds make them ideal candidates as alternative, rare&#8208;earth&#8208;element free light&#8208;emitting materials for possible use in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Proton Battery in Mild Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is developed in mild ZnSO4 electrolyte, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and broadens proton&#8208;based battery chemistry.







Abstract
All&#8208;organic proton batteries are attracting extensive attention due to their sustainability merits and excellent rate capability. Generally, strong acids (e.g. H2SO4) have to be employed as the electrolytes to provide H+ for all&#8208;organic proton batteries due to the high H+ intercalation energy barrier. Until now, the design of all&#8208;organic proton batteries in mild electrolytes is still a challenge. Herein, a poly(2,9&#8208;dihydroquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine) (PO) molecule was designed and synthesized, where the adjacent C=N groups show two different chemical environments, resulting in two&#8208;step redox reactions. Moreover, the two reactions possess considerable voltage difference because of the large LUMO energy gap between PO and its reduction product. More impressively, the C=N groups endow the &#960;&#8208;conjugated PO molecule with H+ uptake/removal in the ZnSO4 electrolyte.

     alt="A Symmetric All-Organic Proton Battery in Mild Electrolyte"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A symmetric all-organic proton battery is developed in mild ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and broadens proton-based battery chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-organic proton batteries are attracting extensive attention due to their sustainability merits and excellent rate capability. Generally, strong acids (e.g. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) have to be employed as the electrolytes to provide H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for all-organic proton batteries due to the high H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation energy barrier. Until now, the design of all-organic proton batteries in mild electrolytes is still a challenge. Herein, a poly(2,9-dihydroquinoxalino[2,3-b]phenazine) (PO) molecule was designed and synthesized, where the adjacent C=N groups show two different chemical environments, resulting in two-step redox reactions. Moreover, the two reactions possess considerable voltage difference because of the large LUMO energy gap between PO and its reduction product. More impressively, the C=N groups endow the &#960;-conjugated PO molecule with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake/removal in the ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte. As a result, a symmetric all-organic proton battery is achieved in a mild electrolyte for the first time, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and also broadens the chemistry of proton-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoporosity&#8208;Enabled Selectivity of Mesoporous Palladium&#8208;Based Nanocrystals Catalysts in Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporosity engineering is demonstrated as an efficient route for boosting catalytic selectivity of Pd&#8208;based nanobundle catalysts in the semihydrogenation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies reveal that the continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of mesoporous Pd&#8208;based catalysts synergistically weaken the adsorption and binding strength of alkenes and energetically disable further over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes.







Abstract
We reported mesoporosity engineering as a general strategy to promote semihydrogenation selectivity of palladium (Pd)&#8208;based nanobundles catalysts. The best mesoporous PdP displayed full conversion, remarkable activity, excellent selectivity, and high stability in semihydrogenation of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyne, all of which are remarkably better than commercial Lindlar catalysts. Mechanistic investigations ascribed high semihydrogenation selectivity to the continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of catalysts that weakened the adsorption and interaction capacity of alkenes and thus inhibited over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to industrially unfavorable alkanes. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that convex crystalline mesoporosity of nanobundles catalysts electronically optimized the coordination environment of Pd active sites and energetically changed hydrogenation trends, resulting in a superior semihydrogenation selectivity to targeted alkenes.

         <title>Multiple Wavelength Photopolymerization of Stable Poly(Catecholamines)&#8208;DNA Origami Nanostructures**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami nanostructures have been decorated with photosensitive reaction centers that produce reactive oxygen species at their individual characteristic wavelengths. In this way, polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine is induced and independent polymer patterning on the DNA origami template can be directed. In addition, the polymer rings alter the interaction of DNA origami objects and cell membranes, thereby promoting their cellular uptake.







Abstract
The synthesis of multicomponent polymer hybrids with nanometer precision is chemically challenging in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex nanostructures. Here, we leverage the fidelity of the DNA origami technique to install a multiple wavelength responsive photopolymerization system with nanometer resolution. By precisely immobilizing various photosensitizers on the origami template, which are only activated at their respective maximum wavelength, we can control sequential polymerization processes. In particular, the triggered photosensitizers generate reactive oxygen species that in turn initiate the polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine. We imprint polymeric layers at designated positions on DNA origami, which modifies the polyanionic nature of the DNA objects, thus promoting their uptake into living cells while preserving their integrity. Our herein proposed method provides a rapid platform to access complex 3D nanostructures by customizing material and biological interfaces.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Absorbing and Emissive Quadruple Helicene Enabled by the Scholl Reaction of Perylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quadruple helicene having two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible&#8208;light regions.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis, structural analysis, optical and chiroptical properties of a novel quadruple helicene, which has two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework of 92 sp2 carbon atoms. It was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate with the formation of eight carbon&#8208;carbon bonds on the perylene unit in a single synthetic operation. Chemical oxidation of the quadruple helicene with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate resulted in an air&#8208;stable dication, which exhibits the same helicity in its four helicene moieties as unambiguously identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission with absorption and emission maxima at 848&#8197;nm and 977&#8197;nm, respectively, and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible&#8208;light regions.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Tunable Persistent Luminescent Materials via Radiative Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, feasible, and simple approach for dynamic tunable afterglow systems based on a simple radiative energy transfer mechanism is presented. The persistent luminescence (&#964;&gt;0.7&#8197;s) can be reversibly converted between different colors in the solid, solution, and gel states by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor through a simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, a universal strategy for solid, solution, or gel state organic persistent luminescent materials via radiative energy transfer is proposed. The persistent luminescence (&#964;&gt;0.7&#8197;s) could be remotely regulated between different colors by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor. The function relies on the simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism, rather than the complicated communication between the excited state of the molecules such as F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter energy transfer. And the &#8220;apparent lifetime&#8221; for the energy acceptor is the same as the lifetime of the energy donor, which was different with a traditional radiative energy transfer process. The simple working principle endows this strategy with huge universality, flexibility, and operability. This work offers a simple, feasible, and universal way to construct various persistent luminescent materials in solid, solution, and gel states.

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Cationic Low&#8208;Coordinate Tetrylenes: Highly Lewis Acidic &#963;&#8208;Donor Ligands in Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In stark contrast to poorly electrophilic classical &#963;&#8208;donating spectator ligands, we show that geometrically constrained low&#8208;coordinate, cationic GeII and SnII ligands remain highly electrophilic in the coordination sphere of Ni0, despite being &#963;&#8208;donors; binding of nucleophiles and fluoride abstraction at the donor atom is demonstrated, alongside the capacity to catalyse the hydrosilylation of alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
A novel non&#8208;innocent ligand class, namely cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles, is reported in the phosphine&#8208;functionalised cationic tetrylene Ni0 complexes, [PhRDippENi(PPh3)3]+ (4&#8201;a/b (Ge) and 5 (Sn); PhRDipp={[Ph2PCH2SiR2](Dipp)N}&#8722;; R=Ph, iPr; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). The inherent electronic nature of low&#8208;coordinate tetryliumylidenes, combined with the geometrically constrained [N&#8722;E&#8722;Ni] bending angle enforced by the chelating phosphine arm in these complexes, leads to strongly electrophilic EII centres which readily bind nucleophiles, reversibly in the case of NH3. Further, the GeII centre in 4&#8201;a/b readily abstracts the fluoride ion from [SbF6]&#8722; to form the fluoro&#8208;germylene complex PhRDippGe(F)Ni(PPh3)3 9, despite this GeII centre simultaneously being a &#963;&#8208;donating ligand towards Ni0. Alongside the observed catalytic ability of 4 and 5 in the hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes, this forms an exciting introduction to a multi&#8208;talented ligand class in cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles.

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to poorly electrophilic classical &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-donating spectator ligands, we show that geometrically constrained low-coordinate, cationic Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Sn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ligands remain highly electrophilic in the coordination sphere of Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, despite being &#963;-donors; binding of nucleophiles and fluoride abstraction at the donor atom is demonstrated, alongside the capacity to catalyse the hydrosilylation of alkenes and alkynes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel non-innocent ligand class, namely cationic single-centre ambiphiles, is reported in the phosphine-functionalised cationic tetrylene Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, [&lt;sup&gt;PhR&lt;/sup&gt;DippENi(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a/b&lt;/b&gt; (Ge) and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; (Sn); &lt;sup&gt;PhR&lt;/sup&gt;Dipp={[Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](Dipp)N}&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;; R=Ph, &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr; Dipp=2,6-&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The inherent electronic nature of low-coordinate tetryliumylidenes, combined with the geometrically constrained [N&#8722;E&#8722;Ni] bending angle enforced by the chelating phosphine arm in these complexes, leads to strongly electrophilic E&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; centres which readily bind nucleophiles, reversibly in the case of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Further, the Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; centre in &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a/b&lt;/b&gt; readily abstracts the fluoride ion from [SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to form the fluoro-germylene complex &lt;sup&gt;PhR&lt;/sup&gt;DippGe(F)Ni(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, despite this Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; centre simultaneously being a &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-donating ligand towards Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. Alongside the observed catalytic ability of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; in the hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes, this forms an exciting introduction to a multi-talented ligand class in cationic single-centre ambiphiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Pyroptosis is a unique form of programmed cell death that is essentially proinflammatory and critical for immunity. In their Research Article(e202115800), Qian Cao, Zong&#8208;Wan Mao, and co&#8208;workers developed a carbonic anhydrase&#8197;IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored photosensitizer, CA&#8208;Re, that is capable of inducing and self&#8208;reporting membrane rupture upon irradiation, as well as evoking pyroptosis to activate antitumor immunity. CA&#8208;Re is the first metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducer, and this work provides a promising avenue for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.

Copper halide based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid structures exhibit great potential as light&#8208;emitting materials. In their Research Article (e202115225), Wei Liu, Gangfeng Ouyang et&#8197;al. report a facile strategy for the synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating a coordinated anionic inorganic module with a neutral organic ligand molecule. By using this approach, a family of blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures have been prepared with high internal quantum yields of up to 98&#8201;%.

In their Communication (e202114353), Kimihisa Yamamoto and co&#8208;workers developed a new synthetic method using huge dendritic supramolecular capsules constructed only by self&#8208;assembly based on coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry, and successfully demonstrate the first&#8208;ever precise synthesis of quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials.

Gene fusion is an important natural process to create new enzymes from simpler ancestors. Gerrit&#8197;J. Poelarends and co&#8208;workers have adopted this strategy in their Communication (e202113970) to evolve a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an efficient enzyme for enantioselective Michael reactions. They designed a tandem fused 4&#8208;OT that has reduced structural symmetry, expanding its optimization potential by allowing independent sequence diversification of adjacent subunits, and thus enlarging the protein sequence space that can be travelled by directed evolution.

         <title>A Molecular Pump Facilitates Mechanical Adsorption Away from Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attaching or embedding biological or artificial molecular pumps to or into a surface or interface to achieve compartmentalization enables their unidirectional molecular motion to be organized in a confined environment. This approach led to the discovery of the phenomenon of mechanisorption and paves the way towards building highly complex organized molecular architectures.







Abstract
Artificial molecular pumps that perform unidirectional motion on the molecular scale have been used to design systems operating away from equilibrium. Crafting such pumps onto a surface allows their unidirectional movement to be organized in a confined environment as well as the active pumping of adsorbents from the bulk solution to the surface. This study led to the discovery of the phenomenon of mechanisorption and paves the way for the construction of highly complex organized molecular architectures.

         <title>Fighting Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria: Promising Strategies Orchestrated by Molecularly Imprinted Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent infections and deaths caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria are a worldwide health issue. Molecularly imprinted polymers that are antibody mimics with selective recognition sites for a target molecule can fight these bacteria on several fronts. The targets range from endotoxins, &#946;&#8208;lactamase and adhesins to biofilm components and quorum sensing messengers.







Abstract
Infections caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria are difficult and sometimes impossible to treat, making them one of the major public health problems of our time. We highlight how one unique material, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), can orchestrate several strategies to fight this serious societal issue. MIPs are tailor&#8208;made biomimetic supramolecular receptors that recognize and bind target molecules with high affinity and selectivity, comparable to those of antibodies. While research on MIPs for combatting cancer has flourished, comprehensive work on their involvement in combatting resistant superbugs has been rather scarce. This review aims at filling this gap. We will describe the causes of bacterial resistance and at which level MIPs can deploy their weapons. MIPs&#8217; targets can be biofilm constituents, quorum sensing messengers, bacterial surface proteins and antibiotic&#8208;deactivating enzymes, among others. We will conclude with the current challenges and future developments in this field.

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids in Nuclear Medicine Imaging: Shedding Light on Nano&#8211;Bio Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) has been advancing in biomedicine over the past decade. Its recent integration with nuclear medicine imaging has broadened our understanding of the bio&#8208;interfacing of FNAs. In this Minireview, we survey and discuss nuclear imaging of FNAs in&#8197;vivo with the aim of highlighting outstanding questions on nano&#8211;bio interactions and potential directions for translation.







Abstract
Framework nucleic acids (FNAs) represent nanoscale oligonucleotide assemblies with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties that are different from their building blocks. Following simple Watson&#8211;Crick base&#8208;pairing rules, arbitrary DNA frameworks with diverse shapes, sizes, and dimensions can be prepared with high reproducibility and stability. The programmable assembly of nucleic acids into FNAs presents a highly controllable model for studies on nano&#8211;bio interactions and allows scrutiny of &#8220;nanostructure&#8208;activity relationships.&#8221; Herein, we present an overview of recent progress with FNAs in the hope of deepening our understanding of nano&#8211;bio interfacing. We summarize the biological profiles and immune responses of various FNAs as functions of their shape, sizes, and surface charges. We then highlight recent efforts to apply FNAs for biomedical applications and discuss the challenges of FNAs for potential clinical translation. We believe that this Minireview can bring up&#8208;to&#8208;date information on FNAs and shed light on how their design may be harnessed for selective biomedical applications.

         <title>Gene Fusion and Directed Evolution to Break Structural Symmetry and Boost Catalysis by an Oligomeric C&#8722;C Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>

         <dc:description>
Less symmetry, more diversity: Here we show that gene duplication and fusion to break structural symmetry, allowing independent sequence diversification of neighboring subunits by directed evolution, is a powerful strategy to boost catalysis by a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT), enabling efficient asymmetric Michael additions.







Abstract
Gene duplication and fusion are among the primary natural processes that generate new proteins from simpler ancestors. Here we adopted this strategy to evolve a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an efficient biocatalyst for enantioselective Michael reactions. We first designed a tandem&#8208;fused 4&#8208;OT to allow independent sequence diversification of adjacent subunits by directed evolution. This fused 4&#8208;OT was then subjected to eleven rounds of directed evolution to give variant 4&#8208;OT(F11), which showed an up to 320&#8208;fold enhanced activity for the Michael addition of nitromethane to cinnamaldehydes. Crystallographic analysis revealed that 4&#8208;OT(F11) has an unusual asymmetric trimeric architecture in which one of the monomers is flipped 180&#176; relative to the others. This gene duplication and fusion strategy to break structural symmetry is likely to become an indispensable asset of the enzyme engineering toolbox, finding wide use in engineering oligomeric proteins.

         <title>Dearomative Cyclopropanation of Naphthols via Cyclopropene Ring&#8208;Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208; and acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclopropanation of naphthols from cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening has been described. The reaction is scalable and highly chemoselective, and the vinyl cyclopropane products can be uniquely diversified. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
The dearomatization of 2&#8208;naphthols represents a simple method for the construction of complex 3D structures from simple planar starting materials. We describe a cyclopropanation of 2&#8208;naphthols that proceeds via cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening using rhodium and acid catalysis under mild conditions. The vinyl cyclopropane molecules were formed with high chemoselectivity and scalability, which could be further functionalized at different sites. Both computational and experimental evidence were used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Highly Accurate Synthesis of Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles by Dendron&#8208;assembled Supramolecular Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Dendron&#8208;assembled supramolecules&#8221; constructed by self&#8208;assembly based on coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry serve as flexibly designable supramolecular huge templates and demonstrate the first&#8208;ever precise synthesis of quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials. This concept for the creation of larger inorganic nanomaterials using even larger organic molecules will provide a crucial key to exploring the last frontier in nanoscience.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm) have been predicted to exhibit unique properties originating from the gray structures considered both bulk solids and molecules, while their synthesis is extremely difficult. The present study describes a new template synthesis method for quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanosized materials using a combination of coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry. Utilizing self&#8208;assembly of guest basic phenylazomethine dendron units onto host acidic core units with six tritylium cations, the dendron&#8208;assembled supramolecules were constructed easily and quantitatively without costly techniques. This huge supramolecular capsule accumulating multiple acidic rhodium salts in its basic ligands enabled a precise synthesis of rhodium particles via formation of multinuclear complexes. The obtained particles (Rh84, &#8776;1.5&#8197;nm) have particle sizes within 1&#8211;3&#8197;nm range and were larger than conventional sub&#8208;nanoparticles (Rh14, &#8776;0.85&#8197;nm), therefore the precise template synthesis of quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles was successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Transformer&#8208;Induced Metamorphosis of Polymeric Nanoparticle Shape at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The shape of nanoparticles is a crucial parameter that affects their fundamental properties. Herein, we report a straightforward approach wherein addition of a small organic molecule (transformer) can induce metamorphosis of the nanoparticle shape without altering the chemical structure of the constituent polymers. Importantly, this method is applicable to various block copolymers without requiring the synthesis of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers.







Abstract
Controlled polymerizations have enabled the production of nanostructured materials with different shapes, each exhibiting distinct properties. Despite the importance of shape, current morphological transformation strategies are limited in polymer scope, alter the chemical structure, require high temperatures, and are fairly tedious. Herein we present a rapid and versatile morphological transformation strategy that operates at room temperature and does not impair the chemical structure of the constituent polymers. By simply adding a molecular transformer to an aqueous dispersion of polymeric nanoparticles, a rapid evolution to the next higher&#8208;order morphology was observed, yielding a range of morphologies from a single starting material. Significantly, this approach can be applied to nanoparticles produced by disparate block copolymers obtained by various synthetic techniques including emulsion polymerization, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly and traditional solution self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Electrical Reverse Shift: Sustainable CO2 Valorization for Industrial Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) enables production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO2 compatible with existing industrial processes. Herein we demonstrate the advantages of a methanation active catalyst, including superior activity, favorable temperature profile, and suppression of carbon formation.







Abstract
Utilization of CO2 is a requirement for a sustainable production of carbon&#8208;based chemicals. The reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (RWGS) can valorize CO2 by reaction with hydrogen to produce a synthesis gas compatible with existing industrial infrastructure. Fully electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) was achieved using integrated ohmic heating and a nickel&#8208;type catalyst at industrially relevant conditions. Using a feed of H2&#8201;:&#8201;CO2 in a ratio of 2.25 at 10&#8197;barg, utilizing high temperature operation at 1050&#8201;&#176;C allowed for production of a synthesis gas with a H2/CO ratio of 2.0 and no detectable methane, ideal for production of sustainable fuel by e.g. the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis. Facilitating RWGS through CH4 as intermediate was found superior to the selective RWGS route, due to higher activity and suppression of carbon formation. The eRWGS&#8482; catalyst is found to provide a preferential emissions&#8208;free route for production of synthesis gas for any relevant H2/CO ratio, enabling production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO2 and renewable electricity with high hydrogen and carbon efficiency.

         <title>Hydrogenative Cycloisomerization and Sigmatropic Rearrangement Reactions of Cationic Ruthenium Carbenes Formed by Catalytic Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented hydrogenation reactions are disclosed, commencing with geminal delivery of both H&#8208;atoms of H2 to the triple bond of a propargyl alcohol derivative. When catalyzed with cationic ruthenium complexes, the resulting pianostool carbenes are so &#8220;hot&#8221; that they are readily intercepted by tethered nucleophiles, resulting in cycloisomerization or [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement reactions.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Hydrogenation of propargyl alcohol derivatives with [CpXRu(MeCN)3]PF6 (CpX=substituted cyclopentadienyl) as catalysts affords cationic pianostool ruthenium carbene complexes which are so electrophilic that they attack a tethered olefin to furnish cyclopentene products; cyclopropanation or metathesis do not compete with this novel transformation. If the transient carbenes carry appropriate propargylic substituents, however, they engage in ([2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic) rearrangements to give enol esters (carbonates, carbamates, sulfonates) or alkenyl halides. Both pathways are unprecedented in the vast hydrogenation literature. The proposed mechanistic scenarios are in line with labeling experiments and spectroscopic data; most notably, PHIP NMR spectroscopy (PHIP=parahydrogen induced polarization) provides compelling evidence that the reactions are indeed triggered by highly unorthodox gem&#8208;hydrogenation events.

         <title>A Mechanistically Inspired Halenium Ion Initiated Spiroketalization: Entry to Mono&#8208; and Dibromospiroketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halenium affinity (HalA) guided design leads to stereoselective bromospiroketalization of alkyl ketones, templated by a tethered 2&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl(THP)&#8208;protected alcohol. Subtle alteration of the reaction conditions provides either the bromospiroketals or the dibromospiroketals.







Abstract
Employing halenium affinity (HalA) as a guiding tool, the weak nucleophilic character of alkyl ketones was modulated by the templating effect of a tethered 2&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl(THP)&#8208;protected alcohol towards realizing a bromenium ion initiated spiroketalization cascade. Addition of ethanol aided an early termination of the cascade by scavenging the THP group after the halofunctionalization stage, furnishing monobromospiroketals. Alternatively, exclusion of ethanol from the reaction mixture biased the transient oxocarbenium towards &#945;&#8208;deprotonation that precedes a second bromofunctionalization event thus, furnishing dibrominated spiroketals. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity exploited in the current methodology provides a novel and rapid access to the dibrominated spiroketal motifs exhibited by several natural products.

         <title>Controlling Chemoselectivity of Catalytic Hydroboration with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;controllable, chemoselective hydroboration of ketoacids is reported using a well&#8208;defined cobalt hydride catalyst. Excellent selectivities can be achieved, with acids reacting in the dark and ketones in the light. This approach can be further extended to other functional groups.







Abstract
The ability to selectively react one functional group in the presence of another underpins efficient reaction sequences. Despite many designer catalytic systems being reported for hydroboration reactions, which allow introduction of a functional handle for cross&#8208;coupling or act as mild method for reducing polar functionality, these platforms rarely deal with more complex systems where multiple potentially reactive sites exist. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to use light to distinguish between ketones and carboxylic acids in more complex molecules. By taking advantage of different activation modes, a single catalytic system can be used for hydroboration, with the chemoselectivity dictated only by the presence or absence of visible light.

         <title>Controlled In&#8208;Cell Generation of Active Palladium(0) Species for Bioorthogonal Decaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, cell&#8208;permeable source of PdII is intracellularly reduced to the catalytically active Pd0 through the addition of sodium ascorbate. Controlled in&#8208;cell generation of Pd0 enables Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal intracellular activation of caged cytotoxic drugs and fluorophores in cancer cells.







Abstract
Owing to their bioorthogonality, transition metals have become very popular in the development of biocompatible bond&#8208;cleavage reactions. However, many approaches require design and synthesis of complex ligands or formulation of nanoparticles which often perform poorly in living cells. This work reports on a method for the generation of an active palladium species that triggers bond&#8208;cleaving reactions inside living cells. We utilized the water&#8208;soluble Na2PdCl4 as a simple source of PdII which can be intracellularly reduced by sodium ascorbate to the active Pd0 species. Once generated, Pd0 triggers the cleavage of allyl ether and carbamate caging groups leading to the release of biologically active molecules. These findings do not only expand the toolbox of available bioorthogonal dissociative reactions but also provide an additional strategy for controlling the reactivity of Pd species involved in Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reactions.

         <title>Vectorial Catalysis in Surface&#8208;Anchored Nanometer&#8208;Sized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Based Microfluidic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling multiple reactions in a programmed manner and defined spatial localization is a key goal in catalysis, which is referred to as vectorial catalysis. We realized a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based vectorial catalysis system by anchoring two different nano&#8208;MOFs at precise spatial positions in the microfluidic device and tested their performance in the catalysis of a two&#8208;step reaction sequence.







Abstract
Vectorial catalysis&#8212;controlling multi&#8208;step reactions in a programmed sequence and by defined spatial localization in a microscale device&#8212;is an enticing goal in bio&#8208;inspired catalysis research. However, translating concepts from natural cascade biocatalysis into artificial hierarchical chemical systems remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate integration of two different surface&#8208;anchored nanometer&#8208;sized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in a microfluidic device for modelling vectorial catalysis. Catalyst immobilization at defined sections along the microchannel and a two&#8208;step cascade reaction was conducted with full conversion after 30&#8197;seconds and high turnover frequencies (TOF&#8776;105&#8197;h&#8722;1).

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Triggered Dynamic Disulfide Bond Self&#8208;Heals Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized polyurethane is used as an additive to self&#8208;heal a CsPbIBr2 film by a disulfide&#8208;exchange reaction upon heat treatment. The inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cell achieves a champion efficiency of 10.61&#8201;% with efficiency recovery after heat treatment.







Abstract
One great challenge for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lies in their poor operational stability under harsh stimuli by humidity, heat, light, etc. Herein, a thermal&#8208;triggered self&#8208;healing polyurethane (PU) is tailored to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSCs. The dynamic covalent disulfide bonds between adjacent molecule chains in PU at high temperatures self&#8208;heal the in&#8208;service formed defects within the CsPbIBr2 perovskite film. Finally, the best device free of encapsulation achieves a champion efficiency up to 10.61&#8201;% and an excellent long&#8208;term stability in an air atmosphere over 80&#8197;days and persistent heat attack (85&#8201;&#176;C) over 35&#8197;days. Moreover, the photovoltaic performances are recovered by a simple heat treatment.

         <title>12b,24b&#8208;Diborahexabenzo[a,c,fg,l,n,qr]pentacene: A Low&#8208;LUMO Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon</title>

A doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene was designed based on presynthetic DFT calculations, predicting intriguing optoelectronic properties. Subsequently, the electron&#8208;deficient, NIR&#8208;emitting B&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was prepared via six net C&#8722;H borylations from an unfunctionalized alkene in a two&#8208;pot synthetic procedure. The structure obtained by X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed an enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation upon cyclization compared to non&#8208;fused derivatives.







Abstract
Herein we devise and execute a new synthesis of a pristine boron&#8208;doped nanographene. Our target boron&#8208;doped nanographene was designed based on DFT calculations to possess a low LUMO energy level and a narrow band gap derived from its precise geometry and B&#8208;doping arrangement. Our synthesis of this target, a doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene (B2&#8208;HBP), employs six net C&#8722;H borylations of an alkene, comprising consecutive hydroboration/electrophilic borylation/dehydrogenation and BBr3/AlCl3/2,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H borylation steps. As predicted by our calculations, B2&#8208;HBP absorbs strongly in the visible region and emits in the NIR up to 1150&#8197;nm in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene solutions. Furthermore, B2&#8208;HBP possesses a very low LUMO level, showing two reversible reductions at &#8722;1.00&#8197;V and &#8722;1.17&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc. Our methodology is surprisingly selective despite its implementation of unfunctionalized precursors and offers a new approach to the synthesis of pristine B&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Thionolactone as Resin Additive to Prepare (bio)degradable 3D Objects via VAT Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3D printing and especially VAT photopolymerization leads to cross&#8208;linked materials with high thermal, chemical and mechanical properties. Nevertheless, such stability is incompatible with degradability and re/upcyclability. We showed here that thionolactone and especially dibenzo[c,e]&#8208;oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) could be used as an additive (2 wt%) to acrylate&#8208;based resins to introduce weak bonds into the network via a radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization process. The low amount of additive allows to only slightly modify the printability of the resin, keep intact its resolution and maintain the mechanical properties of the 3D object. The resin with additive was used in UV microfabrication and 2&#8208;photon stereolithography setup and commercial 3D printers. The fabricated objects were shown to degrade in basic solvent as well in a home&#8208;made compost. The rate of degradation is nonetheless dependent of the size of the object. This feature was used to prepare 3D objects with support structures that could be easily solubilized.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Application of photochemical protocols to polymer synthesis are of interest due to the unique possibilities such as topological and temporal control, rapid polymerization processes and environmentally benign features provided finding application in adhesives, coatings, adaptive manufacturing, etc. In particular, utilization of photochemistry in controlled/living polymerizations offers the precise control over the macromolecular structure and chain lengths in addition to advantages associated with photochemistry. Herein, the latest developments on photocontrolled living radical and cationic polymerizations and their combinations for macromolecular syntheses are discussed. The review summarizes and spotlights the recent studies in the emerging area of photoinduced controlled/living polymerizations.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorescent Block Copolymer Micelles with Responsive Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Responsive fluorescent materials offer a high potential for sensing and (bio&#8208;)imaging applications. To investigate new concepts for such materials and to broaden their applicability, the previously reported non&#8208;fluorescent zinc(II) complex  [Zn(L)]  that shows coordination&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on emission was encapsulated into a family of non&#8208;fluorescent polystyrene&#8208;  block  &#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;  b  &#8208;P4VP) diblock copolymer micelles leading to brightly emissive materials. Coordination&#8208;induced  turn&#8208;on  emission upon incorporation and ligation of the  [Zn(L)]  in the P4VP core outperform parent  [Zn(L)]  in pyridine solution with respect to lifetimes, quantum yields, and temperature resistance. The quantum yield can be easily tuned by tailoring the selectivity of the employed solvent or solvent mixture and, thus, the tendency of the PS&#8208;  b  &#8208;P4VP diblock copolymers to self&#8208;assemble into micelles. A medium&#8208;dependent  off&#8208;on  sensor upon micelle formation could be established by suppression of non&#8208;micelle&#8208;borne emission background pertinent to chloroform through controlled acidification indicating an additional pH&#8208;dependent process.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Counting of Molecules in the Halo and Dense&#8208;Core of Nanovesicles by Regulating Dynamics of Vesicle Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the discovery that in the presence of chaotropic anions (SCN&#8722;) the opening of nanometer biological vesicles at an electrified interface often becomes a two&#8208;step process (around 30% doublet peaks). We have then used this to independently count molecules in each subvesicular compartment, the halo and protein dense&#8208;core, and the fraction of catecholamine binding to the dense&#8208;core is 68%. Moreover, we differentiated two distinct populations of large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs) and quantified their content, which might correspond to immature (43%) and mature (30%) LDCVs, to reveal differences in their biogenesis. We speculate this is caused by an increase in the electrostatic attraction between protonated catecholamine and the negatively charged dense&#8208;core following adsorption of SCN&#8722;.</dc:description>

         <title>Coloration in Supraparticles Assembled from Polyhedral Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supraparticles are spherical colloidal crystals prepared by confined self&#8208;assembly processes. A particularly appealing property of these microscale structures is their structural color arising from interference of light with their building blocks. Here, we assemble supraparticles with high structural order that exhibit coloration from uniform, polyhedral metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles. We analyse the structural coloration as a function of the size of these anisotropic building blocks and their internal structure. We attribute the angle&#8208;dependent coloration of the MOF supraparticles to the presence of ordered, onion&#8208;like layers at the outermost regions. Surprisingly, even though different shapes of the MOF particles have different propensities to form these onion layers, all supraparticle dispersions show well&#8208;visible macroscopic coloration, indicating that local ordering is sufficient to generate interference effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;imprinting of the helical organization in liquid crystal networks using achiral monomers and circularly polarized light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over molecular motion is facilitated in materials with highly ordered nanoscale structures. Here we report on the fabrication of cholesteric liquid crystal networks by circularly polarized light irradiation, without the need for chiral dopant or plasticizer. The polymer network is obtained by photopolymerization of a smectic achiral diacrylate mesogen consisting of an azobenzene core and discrete oligodimethylsiloxane tails. The synchronous helical photoalignment and photopolymerization originate from the cooperative movement of the mesogens ordered in well&#8208;defined responsive structures, together with the flexibility of the oligodimethylsiloxane blocks. The resulting thin films show excellent thermal stability and light&#8208;induced memory features with reversible responses. Additionally, we demonstrate the fabrication of photo&#8208;patterned films of liquid crystal networks with opposite helical senses. These findings provide a new method to make light&#8208;controllable chiroptical materials with exciting applications in optics and photonics.</dc:description>

         <title>Overturned Loading of Inert CeO2 to Active Co3O4 for Unusually Improved Catalytic Activity in Fenton&#8208;like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to improving the catalytic activity of nanocomposites by either exposing more active sites or regulating the interaction between the support and nanoparticles while keeping the structure of the active sites unchanged. Here, we report the fabrication of a Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposite via overturning the loading direction, i.e., loading an inert CeO2 support onto active Co3O4 nanoparticles. The resultant catalyst exhibits unexpectedly higher activity and stability in peroxymonosulfate&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reactions than its analog prepared by the traditional impregnation method. Abundant oxygen vacancies (Ov with a Co&#8230;Ov&#8230;Ce structure instead of Co&#8230;Ov) are generated as new active sites to facilitate the cleavage of the peroxide bond to produce SO4&#8226;&#8208; and accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step, i.e., the desorption of SO4&#8226;&#8208;, affording improved activity. This strategy is a new direction for boosting the catalytic activity of the Co3O4 composite catalysts in various scenarios, including environmental remediation and energy applications</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved In Situ Monitoring of Mechanochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical transformations offer environmentally benign synthesis routes, whilst enhancing both the speed and selectivity of reactions. In this light, mechanochemistry promises to transform the way in which chemistry is done in both academia and industry but is greatly hindered by a current lack in mechanistic understanding. The continued development and use of time&#8208;resolved  in situ  (TRIS) approaches to monitor mechanochemical reactions provides a new dimension to elucidate these fascinating transformations. We here discuss recent trends in method development that have pushed the boundaries of mechanochemical research. New features of mechanochemical reactions obtained by TRIS techniques are subsequently discussed, shedding light on how different TRIS approaches have been used. Emphasis is placed on the strength of combining complementary techniques. Finally, we outline our views for the potential of TRIS methods in mechanochemical research, towards establishing a new, environmentally benign paradigm in the chemical sciences.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Multifunctional wearable electronic devices based on natural materials are highly desirable for versatile applications of energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence. Herein, multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with hierarchical structures for integrated visual Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via the facile vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration process.

The resultant flexible and mechanically strong AgNW/leather nanocomposites exhibit extremely low sheet resistance of 0.8 &#937;/sq, superior visual Joule heating temperatures up to 108&#176;C at low supplied voltage of 2.0 V due to efficient energy conversion, excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of ~55 dB and outstanding piezoresistive sensing ability in human motion detection. This work demonstrates the fabrication of multifunctional AgNW/leather nanocomposites for next&#8208;generation wearable electronic devices in energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence,  etc  .</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Neutral Diboron Analogues of Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although Schleyer's computations in 1979 predicted that the ground state of parent diborirane features a planar&#8208;tetracoordinate carbon atom (anti van't Hoff&#8208;Le Bel geometry), this work demonstrates that substitution of C coupled with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) coordination provides access to isolable diborirane derivatives  3  and  4  with van't Hoff&#8208;Le Bel geometry. Species  3  and  4  are isoelectronic with cyclopropane and the highly strained B  2  C rings feature 2c&#8208;2e bent &#963; bonds. Consequently, the B&#8722;B and B&#8722;C bonds in  3  are cleaved in the presence of hydride, proton, and chalcogens. The former two reactions gave NHC&#8208;coordinated fluorenyldihydridoborane  5  and dichlorofluorenylborane  6  , respectively, whereas the latter transformations afforded novel thiaborirane  8  and selenaborirane  9  . In addition, transfer hydrogenation of  3  with ammonia borane (H  3  N&#8226;BH  3  ) led to the formation of (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diborane  7  via selective cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. These reactivities show potential for their future application in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Transamidation of Thioamides by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free N&#8211;C(S) Transacylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioamides represent highly valuable isosteric in the strictest sense &#8220;single atom substitution&#8221; analogues of amides that have found broad applications in chemistry and biology. A long&#8208;standing challenge is the direct transamidation of thioamides, a process which would convert one thioamide bond (R&#8211;C(S)&#8211;NR  1  R  2  ) into another (R&#8211;C(S)&#8211;NR  3  N  4  ). Herein, we report the first general method for the direct transamidation of thioamides by highly chemoselective N&#8211;C(S) transacylation. The method relies on site&#8208;selective N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl activation of 2&#176; and 1&#176; thioamides, resulting in ground&#8208;state&#8208;destabilization of thioamides, thus enabling to rationally manipulate nucleophilic addition to the thioamide bond. This method showcases a remarkably broad scope including late&#8208;stage functionalization (&gt;100 examples). We further present extensive DFT studies that provide insight into the chemoselectivity and provide guidelines for the development of transamidation methods of the thioamide bond.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyracylene is a unique cyclopenta&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) that exhibits dual aromatic characteristics. Herein we report the synthesis of doubly N&#8208;doped benzannulated pyracylenes, namely dibenzodiazapyracylenes, by oxidative N&#8211;N linking reaction of [2.2](2,5)pyrrolophane&#8208;type precursors. Dibenzodiazapyracylenes displayed well&#8208;ordered &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular packing&#160;in the solid state, which were feasible for effective hole&#8208;transporting along the stacking direction. High carrier mobility was estimated by microwave conductivity measurements as compared to dibenzoullazine. The high HOMO level of dibenzodiazapyracylene was verified by electrochemistry and its persistent radical cation species has been detected.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Reduction&#8208;Induced Hydrogenation of a Helical Bilayer Nanographene with K and Rb Metals: Electron Multiaddition and Selective Rb+ Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reduction&#8208;induced hydrogenation of a helical bilayer nanographene (C138H120) with K or Rb in 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 is reported by Israel Fern&#225;ndez, Marina&#8197;A. Petrukhina, Nazario Mart&#237;n et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115747). DFT calculations predict that localization of the first two electrons in the helicene moiety leads to a site&#8208;specific hydrogenation at the carbon atoms located on the edge of the central [6]helicene backbone (pink hydrogens). The third electron forms a radical trianion on the HBC leading to a final Rb&#8208;complex.

         <title>Mechanism of the Bifunctional Multiple Product Sesterterpene Synthase AcAS from Aspergillus calidoustus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sesterterpene synthase from Aspergillus calidoustus was characterised that produces calidoustene, a compound with a new skeleton, besides five known compounds. A deep mechanistic investigation through isotopic labelling experiments, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and DFT calculations is presented. The substrate analog 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;FPP was converted into several oxygenated terpenoids.







Abstract
The multiproduct chimeric sesterterpene synthase AcAS from Aspergillus calidoustus yielded spirocyclic calidoustene, which exhibits a novel skeleton, besides five known sesterterpenes. The complex cyclisation mechanism to all six compounds was investigated by isotopic labelling experiments in combination with DFT calculations. Chemically synthesised 8&#8208;hydroxyfarnesyl diphosphate was converted with isopentenyl diphosphate and AcAS into four oxygenated sesterterpenoids that structurally resemble cytochrome&#8197;P450 oxidation products of the sesterterpene hydrocarbons. Protein engineering of AcAS broadened the substrate scope and gave significantly improved enzyme yields.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of (R)&#8208;Tamsulosin Utilizing Sequential Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a multistep continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (R)&#8208;tamsulosin, three C&#8722;N bond formation/cleavage reactions with hydrogen gas over heterogeneous catalysts enabled the efficient construction of the key skeleton. Two different polysilane&#8208;modified Pd catalysts were developed for these transformations, which were followed by a deprotection step under homogeneous catalysis to provide tamsulosin in 60&#8201;% overall yield in a flow stream.







Abstract
We describe the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (R)&#8208;tamsulosin, a blockbuster therapeutic drug employed for dysuria associated with urinary stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia, by utilizing sequential heterogeneous catalysis. Two heterogeneous catalysts have been developed for the synthesis, and the key step involves reductive amination of nitriles using dimethylpolysilane&#8208;modified Pd on activated carbon/calcium phosphate. Overall, (R)&#8208;tamsulosin was obtained in 60&#8201;% yield and 64&#8201;% ee (99&#8201;% ee after recrystallization) in a flow stream through four catalytic transformations without the need for the isolation or purification of any intermediates or byproduct.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Energy&#8208;Storage Nanoagent for Continuously Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidative Stress Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The siRNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;ferrocene modified persistent luminescence nanoparticle (siRNA&#8208;ApFe&#8208;PLNP) was designed as an energy&#8208;storage nanoagent to achieve continuous amplification of oxidative stress after photo&#8208;activation, eliminating the need for constant light irradiation and further avoiding the photo&#8208;induced tissue damage.







Abstract
Regulation of cellular oxidative stress plays a critical role in revealing the molecular mechanisms of cellular activities and thus is a potential strategy for tumor treatment. Optical methods have been employed for intelligent regulation of oxidative stress in tumor regions. However, long&#8208;time continuous irradiation inevitably causes damage to normal tissues. Herein, a ferrocene&#8208;containing nucleic acid&#8208;based energy&#8208;storage nanoagent was designed to achieve the continuous photo&#8208;regulation of cellular oxidative stress in the dark. Specifically, the photoenergy stored in the agent could convert effectively and accelerate Fenton&#8208;like reaction continuously, augmenting cellular oxidative stress. This nanoagent could also silence oxidative damage repair genes to further amplify oxidative stress. This strategy not only provides oxidative stress regulation for studying the molecular mechanisms of biological activities, but also offers a promising step toward tumor microenvironment modulation.

         <title>Rational Design of Zinc/Zeolite Catalyst: Selective Formation of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol to Aromatics Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow triple&#8208;shelled Zn/MFI single crystals not only exhibit a significantly long lifetime but also an enhanced shape selectivity for p&#8208;xylene in the methanol to aromatics (MTA) reaction. The Zn species were directly imaged in the micropores of only the ZSM&#8208;5 layer and the specific structure and anchor location of the Zn species was determined.







Abstract
The production of p&#8208;xylene from the methanol to aromatics (MTA) reaction is challenging. The catalytic stability, which is inversely proportional to the particle size of the zeolite, is not always compatible with p&#8208;xylene selectivity, which is inversely proportional to the external acid sites. In this study, based on a nano&#8208;sized zeolite, we designed hollow triple&#8208;shelled Zn/MFI single crystals using the ultra&#8208;dilute liquid&#8208;phase growth technique. The obtained composites possessed one ZSM&#8208;5 layer (&#8776;30&#8197;nm) in the middle and two silicalite&#8208;1 layers (&#8776;20&#8197;nm) epitaxially grown on two sides of ZSM&#8208;5, which exhibited a considerably long lifetime (100&#8201;% methanol conversion &gt;40&#8197;h) as well as an enhanced shape selectivity of p&#8208;xylene (&gt;35&#8201;%) with a p&#8208;xylene/xylene ratio of &#8776;90&#8201;%. Importantly, using this sandwich&#8208;like zeolite structure, we directly imaged the Zn species in the micropores of only the ZSM&#8208;5 layer and further determined the specific structure and anchor location of the Zn species.

         <title>Phosphorogenic Iridium(III) bis&#8208;Tetrazine Complexes for Bioorthogonal Peptide Stapling, Bioimaging, Photocytotoxic Applications, and the Construction of Nanosized Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dual functionality of 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as a bioorthogonal reactive unit and a luminescence quencher has shaped tetrazine&#8208;based probes as attractive candidates for luminogenic labeling of biomolecules in living systems. Three cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes featuring two tetrazine units were synthesized and characterized. Upon photoexcitation, the complexes were non&#8208;emissive but displayed up to 3900&#8208;fold emission enhancement upon the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder (IEDDA) [4 + 2] cycloaddition with (1  R  ,8  S  ,9  s  )&#8208;bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) substrates. The rapid reaction kinetics (  k  2  up to 1.47 &#215; 10  4  M  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  ) of the complexes toward BCN substrates allowed effective peptide labeling. The complexes were also applied as live cell bioimaging reagents and photocytotoxic agents. One of the complexes was utilized in the preparation of luminescent nanosized hydrogels that exhibited interesting cargo delivery properties.</dc:description>

Upon photoexcitation, the complexes were non-emissive but displayed up to 3900-fold emission enhancement upon the inverse electron-demand Diels&#8722;Alder (IEDDA) [4 + 2] cycloaddition with (1  R  ,8  S  ,9  s  )-bicyclo[6.1.0]non-4-yne (BCN) substrates. The rapid reaction kinetics (  k  2  up to 1.47 &#215; 10  4  M  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  ) of the complexes toward BCN substrates allowed effective peptide labeling. The complexes were also applied as live cell bioimaging reagents and photocytotoxic agents. One of the complexes was utilized in the preparation of luminescent nanosized hydrogels that exhibited interesting cargo delivery properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Streamline sulfur redox reactions to achieve efficient room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is vital to dynamically regulate S activity to achieve efficient and stable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT/Na&#8208;S) batteries. Herein, we report using cobalt sulfide as an electron reservoir to enhance the activity of sulfur cathodes, and simultaneously combining with cobalt single atoms as double&#8208;end binding sites for stable S conversion process. The rationally constructed CoS  2  electron reservoir enables the straight reduction of S to short&#8208;chain sodium polysulfides (Na  2  S  4  ) via a streamlined redox path through electron transfer. Meanwhile, cobalt single atoms synergistically working with the electron reservoir to reinforce the streamlined redox path, which immobilize in&#8208;situ formed long&#8208;chain products and catalyze their conversion, thus realizing high S utilization and sustainable cycling stability. The as&#8208;developed sulfur cathodes exhibit a superior rate performance of 443 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  with a high cycling capacity retention of 80 % after 5000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Alkynyl Sulfonium Salts Can Be Employed as Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysts and Generate Alkynyl Radicals under Blue&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonding (ChB) has emerged as a promising tool in organic synthesis. However, compared with the well&#8208;developed selenium&#8208; and tellurium&#8208;based salt catalysts, the ChB catalysis of sulfonium salts is still unknown. Here, we report a new type of alkynyl&#8208;sulfonium salt ChB catalysis for various ionic transformations, including transfer hydrogenation, bromination, bromolactonization, dimerization of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction and Ritter reaction. More importantly, the photocapability of ChB was first demonstrated to generate alkynyl radicals for the synthesis of a variety of chalcogenoacetylenes. Mechanistic studies shed light on the mechanism of the photoinduced reactions and confirmed the involvement of alkynyl radicals which are difficult to be generated otherwise.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the High&#8208;Pressure Phase Behaviour of Highly Compressible Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks: From Discontinuous to Continuous Pore Closure by Linker Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;pressure behaviour of flexible zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) of the ZIF&#8208;62 family with the chemical composition&#160;M(im)2&#8208;x(bim)x&#160;is presented (M2+&#160;= Zn2+, Co2+; im&#8211;&#160;= imidazolate; bim&#8211;&#160;= benzimidazolate, 0.02 &#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804; 0.37). High&#8208;pressure powder X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that the materials contract reversibly from an open pore (op) to a closed pore (cp)&#160;phase under a hydrostatic pressure of up to 4000 bar. Sequentially increasing the bim&#8211;&#160;fraction (x) reinforces the framework, leading to an increased threshold pressure for the&#160;op&#8208;to&#8208;cp&#160;phase transition, while the total volume contraction across the transition decreases. Most importantly, the typical discontinuous&#160;op&#8208;to&#8208;cp&#160;transition (first order) changes to an unusual continuous transition (second order) for&#160;x&#160;&#8805; 0.35. This allows finetuning the void volume and the pore size of the material continuously by adjusting the pressure, thus opening new possibilities for MOFs in pressure&#8208;switchable devices, membranes, and actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the tip effect on single&#8208;atom and cluster catalysts: forming reversible oxygen species with high efficiency in chlorine evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorine evolution reaction has been applied in the production since a century ago. After times of evolution, it has been widely realized by the electrocatalytic process on anode nowadays. However, the anode applied in production contains a large amount of precious metal, increasing the cost. It is thus an opportunity to apply sub&#8208;nano catalysts in this field. By regulating the tip effect (TE) of the catalyst, it was discovered that the oxidized sub&#8208;nano iridium clusters supported by titanium carbide exhibit much higher efficiency than the single&#8208;atom one, which demonstrates the significance of modifying the electronic interaction. Moreover, it exhibits a ~20% decrease of the electricity, ~98% selectivity towards chlorine evolution reaction, and high durability of over 350 h. Therefore, this cluster catalyst performs great potential in applying in the practical production and the comprehension of the tip effect on different types of catalysts is also pushed to a higher level.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Conversion of Propargylic Alcohols and Propargylic Amines with CO2 Activated by Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8</title>

         <dc:description>
The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8 with a yolk&#8211;shell structure was synthesized, and it represents the first noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst that can effectively catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
The cyclization reactions of propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 are important in industrial applications, but it was a great challenge that non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts catalyzed both reactions under mild conditions. Herein, the catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8 was prepared by encapsulating Cu2O nanoparticles into robust ZIF&#8208;8, and it can effectively catalyze the cyclization of both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 into valuable &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonates and oxazolidinones with turnover numbers (TONs) of 12.1 and 19.6, which can be recycled at least five times. The mechanisms were further uncovered by NMR, FTIR, 13C isotope&#8208;labeling experiments and DFT calculations, in which Cu2O and DBU can synergistically activate the C&#8801;C bond and the hydroxy/amino group of substrates. Importantly, it is the first example of a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst that can catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 simultaneously.

Amphiphilic supramolecular adhesives with low glass transition temperature and massive hydrogen bonds were designed by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate. The adhesive dopant facilitates a dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect at only 70&#8201;&#176;C and contributes to efficient and highly flexible perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) have attracted great attention due to their advantageous traits such as low cost, portability, light&#8208;weight, etc. However, mechanical stability is still the weak point in their practical application. Herein, we prepared efficient FPSCs with remarkable mechanical stability by a dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect, which can be realized by the usage of a supramolecular adhesive. The supramolecular adhesive, which was obtained by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, is amphiphilic, has a proper glass transition temperature and a high density of hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and receptors, providing the possibility of thermal dynamic repair of mechanical damage in FPSCs. The adhesive also greatly improves the leveling property of the precursor solution on the hydrophobic poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)]amine (PTAA) surface. PSCs containing this adhesive achieve more than a 20&#8201;% power conversion efficiency (PCE) on flexible substrates and a 21.99&#8201;% PCE on rigid substrates (certified PCE of 21.27&#8201;%), with improved electron mobility and reduced defect concentration.

         <title>Overlooked Factors Required for Electrolyte Solvents in Li&#8211;O2 Batteries: Capabilities of Quenching 1O2 and Forming Highly&#8208;Decomposable Li2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs) equipped with a N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolyte exhibited superior cycle characteristics based on the capabilities of quenching 1O2 and forming highly decomposable Li2O2, which have been overlooked as factors required for electrolyte solvents for LOBs.







Abstract
Although sufficient tolerance against attack by superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;) has been mainly recognized as an important property for Li&#8211;O2 battery (LOB) electrolytes, recent evidence has revealed that other critical factors also govern the cyclability, prompting a reconsideration of the basic design guidelines of LOB electrolytes. Here, we found that LOBs equipped with a N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA)&#8208;based electrolyte exhibited better cyclability compared with other standard LOB electrolytes. This superior cyclability is attributable to the capabilities of quenching 1O2 and forming highly decomposable Li2O2. The 1O2 quenching capability is equivalent to that of a tetraglyme&#8208;based electrolyte containing a several millimolar concentration of a typical chemical quencher. Based on these overlooked factors, the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte led to superior cyclability despite its lower O2&#8722; tolerance. Thus, the present work provides a novel design guideline for the development of LOB electrolytes.

         <title>Activatable Persistent Luminescence from Porphyrin Derivatives and Supramolecular Probes with Imaging&#8208;Modality Transformable Characteristics for Improved Biological Applications**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin derivatives that can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence (PL) over 60&#8197;min are reported and a mechanism for the phenomenon is proposed. The derivatives are used to synthesize supramolecular probes with peroxynitrite&#8208;activated PL and light&#8208;triggered imaging&#8208;modality transformation characteristics that permit improved biological uses.







Abstract
Persistent luminescence without excitation light and tissue autofluorescence interference holds great promise for biological applications, but is limited by available materials with long&#8208;wavelength emission and excellent clinical potential. Here, we report that porphyrin derivatives can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence over 60&#8197;min after cessation of excitation light or on interaction with peroxynitrite. A plausible mechanism of the successive oxidation of vinylene bonds was demonstrated. A supramolecular probe with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure was constructed to enhance the tumor targeting ability and the photoacoustic and persistent luminescence signals. Such probes featuring light&#8208;triggered function transformation from photoacoustic imaging to persistent luminescence imaging permit advanced image&#8208;guided cancer surgery. Furthermore, peroxynitrite&#8208;activated persistent luminescence of the supramolecular probe also enables rapid and precise screening of immunogenic cell death drugs.

         <title>Biosynthetic Structural Proteins with Super Plasticity, Extraordinary Mechanical Performance, Biodegradability, Biocompatibility and Information Storage Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysine&#8208;rich structural proteins were synthesized by a microbial system. The protein&#8208;based bioplastics showed super plasticity, extraordinary mechanical performance, desirable biodegradability, biocompatibility, structural stability, and data encoding ability. Information storage and hemostatic applications were realized in this new bioplastic system. This work offers a compelling prospect for developing a new generation of ecological materials.







Abstract
Degradable bioplastics have attracted growing interest worldwide. However, it is challenging to develop bioplastics with a simple processing procedure, strong mechanical performance, good biocompatibility, and adjustable physicochemical properties. Herein, we introduced structural proteins as building blocks and developed a simple environmentally friendly approach to fabricate diverse protein&#8208;based plastics. A cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;level production approach was developed through batch fermentation of Escherichia coli to produce the biomaterials. These bioplastics possess super plasticity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high resistance to organic solvents. Their structural and mechanical properties can be precisely controlled. Besides, high density information storage and hemostatic applications were realized in the bioplastic system. The customizable bioplastics have great potential for applications in numerous fields and are capable to scale up to the industrial level.

         <title>Engineering Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photoenzymatic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalyst&#8211;enzyme coupled artificial photosynthesis system was constructed for photoenzymatic reduction of CO2 using COFs as enzyme carriers. The hybrid system showed an apparent quantum yield as high as 9.17&#177;0.44&#8201;%, surpassing the reported NADH&#8208;regenerated photocatalysts of crystalline framework materials.







Abstract
It is of profound significance concerning the global energy and environmental crisis to develop new techniques that can reduce and convert CO2. To address this challenge, we built a new type of artificial photoenzymatic system for CO2 reduction, using a rationally designed mesoporous olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) as the porous solid carrier for co&#8208;immobilizing formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and Rh&#8208;based electron mediator. By adjusting the incorporating content of the Rh electronic mediator, which facilitates the regeneration of nicotinamide cofactor (NADH) from NAD+, the apparent quantum yield can reach as high as 9.17&#177;0.44&#8201;%, surpassing all reported NADH&#8208;regenerated photocatalysts constructed by crystalline framework materials. Finally, the assembled photocatalyst&#8211;enzyme coupled system can selectively convert CO2 to formic acid with high efficiency and good reusability. This work demonstrates the first example using COFs to immobilize enzymes for artificial photosynthesis systems that utilize solar energy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Tuning Induced d&#8208;Band Center Modulation on Co&#8208;Based Spinel Oxide for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Co&#8208;based spinel oxides coupled with N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes were synthesized as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. The cation&#8208;tuning induced ATd&#8208;O&#8208;BOh corner&#8208;sharing effect enables the modulation and optimization of the electronic structure of Co&#8208;based spinel oxides, resulting in the superior electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Atomic substitutions at the tetrahedral site (ATd) could theoretically achieve an efficient optimization of the charge at the octahedral site (BOh) through the ATd&#8208;O&#8208;BOh interactions in the spinel oxides (AB2O4). Despite substantial progress having been made, the precise control and adjustment of the spinel oxides are still challenging owing to the complexity of their crystal structure. In this work, we demonstrate a simple solvent method to tailor the structures of spinel oxides and use the spinel oxide composites (ACo2O4/NCNTs, A=Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) for oxygen electrocatalysis. The optimized MnCo2O4/NCNTs exhibit high activity and excellent durability for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Remarkably, the rechargeable liquid Zn&#8211;air battery equipped with a MnCo2O4/NCNTs cathode affords a specific capacity of 827&#8197;mAh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1 with a high power density of 74.63&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and no voltage degradation after 300 cycles at a high charging&#8211;discharging rate (5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the substitution could regulate the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and thereby lead to the modulation of the electronic structure accompanied with the movement of the d&#8208;band center. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites interact through the Mn&#8722;O&#8722;Co, and the Co3+Oh of MnCo2O4 with the optimal charge structure allows a more suitable binding interaction between the active center and the oxygenated species, resulting in superior oxygen electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Enantioselective Cascade Annulation of &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;ynones and Enals Enabled by Gold and Oxidative NHC Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented system of gold and oxidative NHC relay catalysis was developed, which enables highly enantioselective cascade annulation between readily available &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ynones with enals to afford pyrrole&#8208;fused lactones in high yield and excellent level of enantioselectivity. The lactone products could be readily converted to diverse densely functionalized pyrroles and pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in high yields and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented gold and oxidative NHC relay catalysis that enables highly enantioselective cascade annulation between readily available &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ynones with enals. This method utilizes the in situ&#8208;generated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as a novel and versatile synthon, which engage with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazolium intermediates generated from enals by oxidative NHC catalysis to produce pyrrole&#8208;fused lactones in high yield and excellent enantioselectivity. Synthetic utility of the lactone products is also demonstrated by facile conversion to densely functionalized pyrroles and pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in high yields with excellent stereopurity.

         <title>A Smart Theranostic Prodrug System Activated by Reactive Oxygen Species for Regional Chemotherapy of Metastatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated smart theranostic prodrug system for efficient regional chemotherapy of metastatic cancers has been developed. The prodrug can selectively target cancer cells and be activated by highly expressed ROS, rapidly releasing drug with high efficiency. It shows significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy towards metastatic cancers (up to 99.9&#8201;%) with no obvious side effects.







Abstract
Metastatic cancer is difficult to cure because of its uncontrollable nature and side effects during treatment. We constructed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated smart theranostic prodrug system based on an ROS active site linked with both a targeting group and an anticancer drug for efficient regional chemotherapy of metastatic cancers. The optimized prodrug (Bio&#8208;(8)&#8208;MB&#8208;CPT) with biotin as the targeting group displayed high sensitivity towards ROS and selectively targeting ability towards cervical cancer cells, showing highly efficient drug release (up to 92&#8201;%) in vitro. Bio&#8208;(8)&#8208;MB&#8208;CPT thus exerted strong toxicity towards cervical cancer cells, but unlike the parent drug (camptothecin), showed no toxicity towards normal cells. Moreover, the prodrug displayed significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo and eradicated the tumor with no obvious side effects (inhibition of the tumor reached up to 99.9&#8201;%).

         <title>Orthoquinone&#8211;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ordered Channel Structures for Ultrahigh Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel orthoquinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF)&#8722;BT&#8208;PTO COF cathode was designed and synthesized for aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries. The inherent ordered open channel structure facilitates ion transfer and insertion, thus making the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism with staged Zn2+, H+ co&#8208;insertion behavior and achieve ultra&#8208;fast kinetics and unprecedented cyclability.







Abstract
Elaborate molecular design on cathodes is of great importance for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries&#8217; performance elevation. Herein, we design a novel orthoquinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework with an ordered channel structures (BT&#8208;PTO COF) cathode for an ultrahigh performance aqueous zinc&#8211;organic battery. The ordered channel structure facilitates ions transfer and makes the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism. Thus, it delivers a high reversible capacity of 225&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an exceptional long&#8208;term cyclability (retention rate 98.0&#8201;% at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;18&#8197;C) after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles). Moreover, a co&#8208;insertion mechanism with Zn2+ first followed by two H+ is uncovered for the first time. Significantly, this co&#8208;insertion behaviour evolves to more H+ insertion routes at high current density and gives the COF ultra&#8208;fast kinetics thus it achieves unprecedented specific power of 184&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1(COF) and a high energy density of 92.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1(COF). Our work reports a superior organic material for zinc batteries and provides a design idea for future high&#8208;performance organic cathodes.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elaborate molecular design on cathodes is of great importance for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries&#8217; performance elevation. Herein, we design a novel orthoquinone-based covalent organic framework with an ordered channel structures (BT-PTO COF) cathode for an ultrahigh performance aqueous zinc&#8211;organic battery. The ordered channel structure facilitates ions transfer and makes the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism. Thus, it delivers a high reversible capacity of 225&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an exceptional long-term cyclability (retention rate 98.0&#8201;% at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&#8776;18&#8197;C) after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles). Moreover, a co-insertion mechanism with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; first followed by two H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is uncovered for the first time. Significantly, this co-insertion behaviour evolves to more H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion routes at high current density and gives the COF ultra-fast kinetics thus it achieves unprecedented specific power of 184&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;(COF)&lt;/sub&gt; and a high energy density of 92.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;(COF)&lt;/sub&gt;. Our work reports a superior organic material for zinc batteries and provides a design idea for future high-performance organic cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Deposition of a Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanorod Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Film with Efficient Charge and Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical film deposition of a single&#8208;crystalline polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon on electrodes, with synthetically controlled crystal structure, film thickness, and crystal orientations is reported. The film supports exceptionally efficient migration of both charges and excitons, with a free carrier mobility over 30&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, a low exciton binding energy of 118.5&#8197;meV, and a remarkable exciton diffusion length of 45&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Electrochemical deposition has emerged as an efficient technique for preparing conjugated polymer films on electrodes. However, this method encounters difficulties in synthesizing crystalline products and controlling their orientation on electrodes. Here we report electrochemical film deposition of a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The film is composed of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods, in which the molecules adopt a cofacial stacking arrangement along the &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction. Film thickness and crystal size can be controlled by electrochemical conditions such as scan rate and electrolyte species, while the choice of anode material determines crystal orientation. The film supports exceptionally efficient migration of both free carriers and excitons: the free carrier mobility reaches over 30&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, whereas the excitons are delocalized with a low binding energy of 118.5&#8197;meV and a remarkable exciton diffusion length of 45&#8197;nm.

         <title>Gold (I/III)&#8208;Catalyzed Trifluoromethylthiolation and Trifluoromethylselenolation of Organohalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first gold(I/III)&#8208;catalyzed direct trifluoromethylthiolation and trifluoromethylselenolation of organohalides are reported. This mild and efficient protocol enjoys a broad substrate scope and high yield (&gt;60 examples with up to 97&#8201;% isolated yield). Its robustness was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, which makes this reaction applicable to pharmaceutical and agrochemical research and development.







Abstract
The first C&#8722;SCF3/SeCF3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions using gold redox catalysis [(MeDalphos)AuCl], AgSCF3 or Me4NSeCF3, and organohalides as substrates are reported. The new methodology enables a one&#8208;stop shop synthesis of aryl/alkenyl/alkynyl trifluoromethylthio&#8208; and selenoethers with a broad substrate scope (&gt;60 examples with up to 97&#8201;% isolated yield). The method is scalable, and its robustness is evidenced by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, which makes this reaction an attractive alternative in the synthesis of trifluoromethylthio&#8208; and selenoethers for pharmaceutical and agrochemical research and development.

         <title>Interfacial Manganese&#8208;Doping in CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets by Employing a Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immiscible bi&#8208;phasic post&#8208;synthetic strategy for MnX2 (X=Br, Cl) doping in CsPbX3 perovskite nanoplatelets (NPls) is reported. The shuttle role of the electron&#8208;donor oleylamine at the water&#8211;hexane interface is the underlying reason for the MnX2 transport from the polar to nonpolar phase and its delivery to the NPls. Moreover, the halide anion plays an essential role in maintaining an appropriate radius of Mn2+ for the perovskite crystal structure.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;doping in cesium lead halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPls) is of particular importance where strong quantum confinement plays a significant role towards the exciton&#8211;dopant coupling. In this work, we report an immiscible bi&#8208;phasic strategy for post&#8208;synthetic Mn&#8208;doping of CsPbX3 (X=Br, Cl) NPls. A systematic study shows that electron&#8208;donating oleylamine acts as a shuttle ligand to transport MnX2 through the water&#8211;hexane interface and deliver it to the NPls. The halide anion also plays an essential role in maintaining an appropriate radius of Mn2+ and thus fulfilling the octahedral factor required for the formation of perovskite crystals. By varying the thickness of parent NPls, we can tune the dopant incorporation and, consequently, the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process in doped NPls. Time&#8208;resolved optical measurements offer a detailed insight into the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process. This new approach for post&#8208;synthetic cation doping paves a way towards exploring the cation exchange process in several other halide perovskites at the polar&#8211;nonpolar interface.

         <title>Electrochemical Fluorination of Vinyl Boronates through Donor&#8208;Stabilized Vinyl Carbocation Intermediates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl carbocations were generated via single&#8208;electron oxidation of alkenyl boronates using electrical potentials. This electrochemical process enabled the formation of these reactive species without the use of Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids. The intermediate vinyl carbocations were trapped with nucleophilic fluoride sources to yield vinyl fluorides; the production of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Br bonds was also demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrochemical generation of vinyl carbocations from alkenyl boronic esters and boronates is reported. Using easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle nucleophilic fluoride reagents, these intermediates are trapped to form fully substituted vinyl fluorides. Mechanistic studies support the formation of dicoordinated carbocations through sequential single&#8208;electron oxidation events. Notably, this electrochemical fluorination features fast reaction times and Lewis acid&#8208;free conditions. This transformation provides a complementary method to access vinyl fluorides with simple fluoride salts such as TBAF.

         <title>Modulating the Frontier Orbitals of an Aluminylene for Facile Dearomatization of Inert Arenes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene at an electron&#8208;deficient aluminylene center can remarkably boost the redox property of the aluminylene via modulation of frontier orbitals. This allows for facile dearomatization of inert arenes via either [4+1] cycloadditions or cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds.

Lewis bases are well known to stabilize electron&#8208;deficient species. We demonstrate herein that the redox property of a monocoordinated aluminylene 1 featuring only four valence electrons for the shell of Al can be boosted by a Lewis base. The coordination of 1 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) effectively shrinks the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, thereby enhancing the reactivity of the ensuing acyclic mono&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized aluminylene 2, which is isoelectronic with singlet carbenes. Moreover, such base coordination completely reverses the predominant chemical reactivity (i.e. electrophilicity/nucleophilicity) of aluminylenes. In marked contrast to 1, 2 readily undergoes a [4+1] cycloaddition reaction with naphthalene and biphenylene at room temperature. Strikingly, the enhanced ambiphilic nature of Al in 2 also enables facile cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds of inert arenes in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular fashion affording 3 and 5. The formation of 5 represents the first example of the cleavage of an aromatic C(3)&#8722;C(4) bond in biphenylene by a single&#8208;atom center.

&lt;p&gt;The coordination of an N-heterocyclic carbene at an electron-deficient aluminylene center can remarkably boost the redox property of the aluminylene via modulation of frontier orbitals. This allows for facile dearomatization of inert arenes via either [4+1] cycloadditions or cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds.

         <title>An Overlooked Pathway in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Diazoalkanes with Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most popular illustration of the role of Frontier Molecular Orbitals (FMO) in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions must be revised: the reactions of diazoacetates with enamines proceed stepwise and are controlled by interactions of the enamines&#8217; HOMO with &#960;*N=N (LUMO) and not with the unoccupied orbital of the heteropropargyl fragment (LUMO+1). Tautomers of the intermediate zwitterions have been observed and the mechanism studied by DFT computations.







Abstract
Methyl diazoacetate reacts with 1&#8208;(N&#8208;pyrrolidino)cycloalkenes to give products of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and azo couplings. The kinetics and mechanisms of these reactions were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;systems in the 1,3&#8208;dipoles of the propargyl&#8208;allenyl type allow for two separate reaction pathways for the (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions. The commonly considered concerted pathway is rationalized by the interaction of the enamine HOMO with LUMO+1, the lowest unoccupied orbital of the heteropropargyl anion fragment of methyl diazoacetate. We show that HOMO/LUMO(&#960;*N=N) interactions between enamines and methyl diazoacetate open a previously unrecognized reaction path for stepwise cycloadditions through zwitterionic intermediates with barriers approximately 40&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower in energy in CHCl3 (DFT calculations) than for the concerted path.

         <title>Controlled Uptake of an Iridium Complex inside Engineered apo&#8208;Ferritin Nanocages: Study of Structure and Catalysis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable hybrid bio&#8208;nanocage with selective immobilization of an iridium complex inside the self&#8208;assembly protein, ferritin has been developed. These hybrid bio&#8208;catalysts reduce substituted acetophenones into the corresponding chiral alcohols with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The effect of the mutation at the core of the ferritin nanocage (apo&#8208;rHLFr) on the uptake of IrCp* has been investigated by structural and spectroscopic methods. Site&#8208;specific mutations of two polar residues viz., Asp38 and Arg52 were investigated. The uptake of IrCp* was increased by about 1.5&#8208;fold on mutation of Arg52 by His compared to the wild&#8208;type variant, while mutation of Asp38 by His had no effect on the uptake. All the variants of the Ir&#8208;embedded ferritin cages remained as stable as the wild&#8208;type analogue. These hybrid bio&#8208;nanocages of ferritin were found to efficiently catalyze transfer hydrogenation of various substituted acetophenones forming the corresponding chiral alcohols with up to 88&#8201;% conversion and 70&#8201;% enantioselectivity. An electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent on the reactant enhanced the Turnover frequency of the reaction. Molecular docking analyses suggested that the substrate binds in different orientations at the active site in different mutants of the nanocage.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Furfural in Aqueous Acetic Acid Media with Enhanced 2&#8208;Methylfuran Selectivity Using CuPd Bimetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of Pd enhanced the selectivity of Cu catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogenation of furfural to 2&#8208;methylfuran in an aqueous 0.1&#8197;M acidic acid solution. The origin of the superior performance was revealed by in&#8197;situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic and kinetic isotopic measurements and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a series of CuPd catalysts for electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of furfural to 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF or FurCH3 where Fur=furyl) in aqueous 0.1&#8197;M acetic acid (pH&#8197;2.9). The highest faradaic efficiency (FE) for MF reached 75&#8201;% at &#8722;0.58&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode with an average partial current density of 4.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic and kinetic isotopic experiments suggested that electrogenerated adsorbed hydrogen (Hads) was involved in the reaction and incorporation of Pd enhanced the surface coverage of Hads and optimized the adsorption pattern of furfural, leading to a higher FE for MF. Density functional theory calculations revealed that Pd incorporation reduced the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of FurCH2* to FurCH3*. Our study demonstrates that catalyst surface structure/composition plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity in ECH and provides a new strategy for designing advanced catalysts for ECH of bio&#8208;derived oxygenates.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Terpenoid&#8211;Pyrrolobenzoxazine Hybrid Natural Product CJ&#8208;12662</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of the terpene&#8211;amino acid hybrid CJ&#8208;12662 has been uncovered. In particular, the biosynthesis involves two different oxidation strategies (one&#8208;electron or two&#8208;electron oxidation routes) for the modification of each unit, reflecting its chemical reactivity. Finally, ThmM catalyzes the formation of the N&#8208;oxide, which undergoes a [1,2]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement to form the unique pyrrolobenzoxazine structure.







Abstract
The fungal natural product CJ&#8208;12662 is a structurally complex terpene&#8211;amino acid hybrid, and is a potent anthelmintic compound. The biosynthetic pathway of CJ&#8208;12662 is elucidated based on metabolite analysis from heterologous expression. We demonstrate the terpene portion is derived from successive P450&#8208;catalyzed oxidations of amorpha&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene, while three flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes are involved in morphing the esterified tryptophan into a chlorinated pyrrolobenzoxazine, utilizing a cascaded [1,2]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement.

         <title>Structures of Silver Fingers and a Pathway to Their Genotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative AgI binding to CCHH zinc fingers causes zinc ion release followed by a collapse of the stable secondary structure and formation of a highly stable Ag2S2 cluster. CCHC, CCCH and CCCC zinc fingers react analogously. Such silver&#8208;induced perturbation inhibits binding of the CCHH zinc finger protein to its cognate DNA sequence and as a consequence may affect many cellular processes including transcriptional regulation.







Abstract
Recently, we demonstrated that AgI can directly replace ZnII in zinc fingers (ZFs). The cooperative binding of AgI to ZFs leads to a thermodynamically irreversible formation of silver clusters destroying the native ZF structure. Thus, a reported loss of biological function of ZF proteins is a likely consequence of such replacement. Here, we report an X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study of AgnSn clusters formed in ZFs to probe their structural features. Selective probing of the local environment around AgI by XAS showed the predominance of digonal AgI coordination to two sulfur donors, coordinated with an average Ag&#8722;S distance at 2.41&#8197;&#197;. No Ag&#8722;N bonds were present. A mixed AgS2/AgS3 geometry was found solely in the CCCH AgI&#8722;ZF. We also show that cooperative replacement of ZnII ions with the studied Ag2S2 clusters occurred in a three&#8208;ZF transcription factor protein 1MEY#, leading to a dissociation of 1MEY# from the complex with its cognate DNA.

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Fluorescent Spherical Nucleic Acids Self&#8208;Assembled from a DNA&#8208;Grafted Conjugated Polymer for Amplified Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of amphiphilic DNA&#8208;grafted conjugated polymer (PFBT&#8208;g&#8208;DNA) is synthesized and assembles into fluorescent spherical nucleic acids (FCP&#8208;SNAs) with excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability. Since the FCP&#8208;SNAs can efficiently &#8220;pump&#8221; the collected energy to the receptor, showing exceptional signal transduction ability, they are applied to detect the ultralow concentration of nucleic acid down to 1.7&#8197;pM.







Abstract
The ultralow concentration of nucleic acids in complex biological samples requires fluorescence probes with high specificity and sensitivity. Herein, a new kind of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) is developed by using fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) as a light&#8208;harvesting antenna to enhance the signal transduction of nucleic acid detection. Specifically, amphiphilic DNA&#8208;grafted FCPs are synthesized and self&#8208;assemble into FCP&#8208;SNA structures. Tuning the hydrophobicity of the graft copolymer can adjust the size and light&#8208;harvesting capability of the FCP&#8208;SNAs. We observe that more efficient signal amplification occurs in larger FCP&#8208;SNAs, as more chromophores are involved, and the energy transfer can go beyond the F&#246;rster radius. Accordingly, the optimized FCP&#8208;SNA shows an antenna effect of up to 37&#8208;fold signal amplification and the limit of detection down to 1.7&#8197;pM in microRNA detection. Consequently, the FCP&#8208;SNA is applied to amplified in situ nucleic acid detecting and imaging at the single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>HFIP Mediates a Direct C&#8722;C Coupling between Michael Acceptors and Eschenmoser's salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Michael Acceptors efficiently couple with Eschenmoser's salt in hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) without the need for additives or catalysts. The role of iodide and the solvent HFIP in this transformation have been studied in detail experimentally and computationally to obtain a full mechanistic picture. The products were further transformed through rearrangements and Michael additions.







Abstract
A direct C&#8722;C coupling process that merges Michael acceptors and Eschenmoser's salt is presented. Although reminiscent of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction, this process requires no Lewis base catalyst. The underlying mechanism was unveiled by a combination of kinetic, isotopic labelling experiments as well as computational investigations, which showcased the critical role of HFIP as a superior mediator for proton&#8208;transfer events as well as the decisive role of the halide counterion.

         <dc:description>
A series of rotaxane&#8208;based catalysts in which the mechanical bond between a bipyridine macrocycle and an NDI&#8208;containing axle is intrinsic to their activity is reported. Computational analysis suggests that the high selectivity observed (&gt;60 fold for Michael addition over a competing decarboxylation pathway) is due to &#960;&#8208;stacking of the mechanically bonded components that leads to high polarizability.







Abstract
We report a series of rotaxane&#8208;based anion&#8211;&#960; catalysts in which the mechanical bond between a bipyridine macrocycle and an axle containing an NDI unit is intrinsic to the activity observed, including a [3]rotaxane that catalyses an otherwise disfavoured Michael addition in &gt;60 fold selectivity over a competing decarboxylation pathway that dominates under Br&#248;nsted base conditions. The results are rationalized by detailed experimental investigations, electrochemical and computational analysis.

         <title>Accelerated Mechanochemistry in Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When polymer chains are stressed in solution, mechanochemistry is accelerated if helical conformations are present in the chain, as measured using a combination of size&#8208;exclusion chromatography and the use of rhodamine mechanophore activation. This phenomenon is explained by the increased persistence length in helical polymers, leading to more efficient energy transduction.







Abstract
Polymer chains, if long enough, are known to undergo bond scission when mechanically stressed. While the mechanochemical response of random coils is well understood, biopolymers and some key synthetic chains adopt well&#8208;defined secondary structures such as helices. To understand covalent mechanochemistry in such structures, poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl glutamates) are prepared while regulating the feed&#8208;monomer chirality, producing chains with similar molecular weights and backbone chemistry but different helicities. Such chains are stressed in solution and their mechanochemistry rates compared by following molecular weight change and using a rhodamine mechanochromophore. Results reveal that while helicity itself is not affected by the covalent bond scissions, chains with higher helicity undergo faster mechanochemistry. Considering that the polymers tested differ only in conformation, these results indicate that helix&#8208;induced chain rigidity improves the efficiency of mechanical energy transduction.

         <title>Tailoring a Near&#8208;Infrared Macrocyclization Scaffold Allows the Control of In Situ Self&#8208;assembly for Photoacoustic/PET Bimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;triggered macrocyclization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of small molecules into nanoparticles has shown promise to design activatable probes for molecular imaging. However, controlling macrocyclization and self&#8208;assembly to concurrently augment positron emission tomography (PET) and photoacoustic (PA) signals for bimodality imaging is challenging. Herein, we report the engineering of a triazole&#8208;IR780 fluorophore as a versatile macrocyclization scaffold for controlling in situ self&#8208;assembly and design a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;activatable PA/PET bimodal probe (  [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1  ) for in vivo imaging of tumor apoptosis. By leveraging the high&#8208;sensitivity whole&#8208;body imaging signals offered by PET with the high&#8208;resolution imaging signals offered by PA,  [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1  can provide a promising tool for the early evaluation of antitumor efficacy, helpful to optimize the therapeutic protocol for patients. This scaffold may be adopted to design other activatable bimodal probes for in vivo imaging.</dc:description>

Herein, we report the engineering of a triazole-IR780 fluorophore as a versatile macrocyclization scaffold for controlling in situ self-assembly and design a caspase-3-activatable PA/PET bimodal probe (  [18F]-IR780-1  ) for in vivo imaging of tumor apoptosis. By leveraging the high-sensitivity whole-body imaging signals offered by PET with the high-resolution imaging signals offered by PA,  [18F]-IR780-1  can provide a promising tool for the early evaluation of antitumor efficacy, helpful to optimize the therapeutic protocol for patients.

         <title>Efficient Polyester Hydrogenolytic Deconstruction via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commodity polyester plastics such as PET, PBT, and PEN are hydrogenolytically deconstructed to their starting monomeric carboxylic acids and light alkanes using a solventless tandem catalytic approach with two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C. These selective reactions operate near the polymer melting temperature under 1 atm H2 and are compatible with mixed plastics, as reported by Yosi Kratish and Tobin&#8197;J. Marks in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202112576).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprogrammable elastomers with dynamic covalent bonds are of paramount significance for emerging applications such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116219), Ling Wang, Wei Feng et&#8197;al. demonstrate mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by introducing dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain chiral liquid crystalline polymer networks.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D&#8208;helical structure of a non&#8208;symmetric poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) with dynamic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is reported in the Research Article by F&#233;lix Freire et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115070). By conformational changes in the pendant group a helix inversion in the PDPA can be initiated, creating a CPL switch.

         <title>The Chemistry of Organic Contrast Agents in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic fluorophores in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) range have been validated as attractive imaging tools in biomedical research owing to their biocompatibility, flexible chemical structure, and tunable spectra. This Review systematically summarizes recent advances in the chemistry, design principles, and optical properties of NIR&#8208;II organic contrast agents.







Abstract
Optical imaging, especially fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, is a non&#8208;invasive imaging approach with high spatial and temporal resolution and high sensitivity, compared to positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to the merits of imaging using the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, like deeper penetration depth, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, high resolution, and low tissue damage, researchers have devoted great effort to developing contrast agents with NIR&#8208;II absorption or emission. In this Review, we summarize recently developed organic luminescent and photoacoustic materials, ranging from small molecules to conjugated polymers. Then, we systematically introduce engineering strategies and describe the imaging performance classified by the skeleton cores. Finally, we elucidate the challenges and prospects of these NIR&#8208;II organic dyes for potential clinical applications. We expect our summary can inspire researchers to expand the spectrum of NIR&#8208;II contrast agents for diverse bioapplications.

         <title>Advances in the Sensing and Treatment of Wound Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wound biofilms are a challenging problem for modern medicine. Advances in the areas of sensors and reporters that can accurately detect early biofilm formation in the wound, and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offer promise for better detection and treatment. This review focuses on novel approaches to biofilm eradication and detection and compares them to conventional methods.







Abstract
Wound biofilms represent a particularly challenging problem in modern medicine. They are increasingly antibiotic resistant and can prevent the healing of chronic wounds. However, current treatment and diagnostic options are hampered by the complexity of the biofilm environment. In this review, we present new chemical avenues in biofilm sensors and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offering promise for better detection, chemical specificity, and biocompatibility. We briefly discuss existing methods for biofilm detection and focus on novel, sensor&#8208;based approaches that show promise for early, accurate detection of biofilm formation on wound sites and that can be translated to point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. We then discuss technologies inspired by new materials for efficient biofilm eradication. We focus on ultrasound&#8208;induced microbubbles and nanomaterials that can both penetrate the biofilm and simultaneously carry active antimicrobials and discuss the benefits of those approaches in comparison to conventional methods.

         <title>Global Analysis of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extensive analysis of the mechanical properties of organic crystals has determined the limits of their mechanical performance as a separate class of engineering materials. This Minireview also explores the reasons for the softness of organic crystals.







Abstract
Organic crystals, although widely studied, have not been considered nascent candidate materials in engineering design. Here we summarize the mechanical properties of organic crystals that have been reported over the past three decades, and we establish a global mechanical property profile that can be used to predict and identify mechanically robust organic crystals. Being composed of light elements, organic crystals populate a narrow region in the mechanical property&#8211;density space between soft, disordered organic materials and stiff, ordered materials. Two subsets of extraordinarily stiff and hard organic crystalline materials were identified and rationalized by the normalized number density, strength, and directionality of their intermolecular interactions. We conclude that future lightweight, soft, all&#8208;organic components in devices should capitalize on the greatest asset of organic single crystals&#8212;namely, the combination of long&#8208;range structural order and softness.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Semisynthesis of Lipidated Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipidation is a co&#8208; and post&#8208;translational modification that is known to influence the structure, function, and localization of peptides and proteins. This Review aims to highlight significant advances in the development of modern synthetic and semisynthetic methods for the generation of homogeneously lipidated proteins that have underpinned the study of the effects of lipid modifications on protein structure and function with unprecedented precision.







Abstract
Lipidation is a ubiquitous modification of peptides and proteins that can occur either co&#8208; or post&#8208;translationally. An array of different lipid classes can adorn proteins and has been shown to influence a number of crucial biological activities, including the regulation of signaling, cell&#8211;cell adhesion events, and the anchoring of proteins to lipid rafts and phospholipid membranes. Whereas nature employs a range of enzymes to install lipid modifications onto proteins, the use of these for the chemoenzymatic generation of lipidated proteins is often inefficient or impractical. An alternative is to harness the power of modern synthetic and semisynthetic technologies to access lipid&#8208;modified proteins in a pure and homogeneously modified form. This Review aims to highlight significant advances in the development of lipidation and ligation chemistry and their implementation in the synthesis and semisynthesis of homogeneous lipidated proteins that have enabled the influence of these modifications on protein structure and function to be uncovered.

         <title>Structural Insight into the Catalytic Mechanism of the Endoperoxide Synthase FtmOx1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary complex FtmOx1&#8901;2OG&#8901;fumitremorgin&#8197;B has been solved at a resolution of 1.22&#8197;&#197;, providing an accurate structural basis for the mechanistic study of endoperoxide formation. The binding conformation of fumitremorgin&#8197;B in this structure is different from any previously docked structures. Structural analysis and multiscale calculations revealed that Y68 radical is key to endoperoxidation.







Abstract
The 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme enzyme FtmOx1 catalyzes the endoperoxide biosynthesis of verruculogen. Although several mechanistic studies have been carried out, the catalytic mechanism of FtmOx1 is not well determined owing to the lack of a reliable complex structure of FtmOx1 with fumitremorgin&#8197;B. Herein we provide the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the ternary complex FtmOx1&#8901;2OG&#8901;fumitremorgin&#8197;B at a resolution of 1.22&#8197;&#197;. Our structures show that the binding of fumitremorgin&#8197;B induces significant compression of the active pocket and that Y68 is in close proximity to C26 of the substrate. Further MD simulation and QM/MM calculations support a CarC&#8208;like mechanism, in which Y68 acts as the H&#8197;atom donor for quenching the C26&#8208;centered substrate radical. Our results are consistent with all available experimental data and highlight the importance of accurate complex structures in the mechanistic study of enzymatic catalysis.

         <title>Tuning Bulk O2 and Nonbonding Oxygen State for Reversible Anionic Redox Chemistry in P2&#8208;Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the reversibility of oxygen redox is quite significant for layered oxides cathodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we for the first time simultaneously tune bulk O2 and nonbonding oxygen state for reversible oxygen redox chemistry in P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 through a synergy of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/Ti co&#8208;doping. O2&#8208; is oxidized to molecular O2 and peroxide (O&#173;2)n&#8208; (n &lt; 2) during charging. Molecular O2 derived from transition metal (TM) migration is related to the superstructure ordering induced by Li doping. The synergy mechanism of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/ Ti co&#8208;doping on the two O&#8208;redox modes is revealed. Firstly, Li2TiO3 coating restrains the surface O2 and inhibits O2 loss. Secondly, nonbonding Li&#8208;O&#8208;Na enhances the reversibility of O2&#8208;&#8594;(O2)n&#8208;. Thirdly, Ti doping strengthens the TM&#8208;O bond which fixes lattice oxygen. The cationic redox reversibility is also enhanced by Li/Ti co&#8208;doping. The proposed insights into the oxygen redox reversibility are insightful for other oxide cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;cooperative Self&#8208;Assembly with Maintained Emission Regulated by Conformational and Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a strategy to enable a maintained emissive behavior in the self&#8208;assembled state by enforcing an anti&#8208;cooperative self&#8208;assembly involving weak intermolecular dye interactions. To achieve this goal, we designed a conformationally flexible monomer unit  1  with a central 1,3&#8208;substituted (diphenyl)urea hydrogen bonding synthon that is tethered to two BODIPY dyes featuring sterically bulky trialkoxybenzene substituents at the  meso  &#8208;position. The competition between attractive forces (H&#8208;bonding and aromatic interactions) and destabilizing effects (steric and competing conformational effects) limits the assembly, halting the supramolecular growth at the stage of small oligomers. Given the presence of weak dye&#8208;dye interactions, the emission properties of molecularly dissolved  1  are negligibly affected upon aggregation. Our findings contribute to broadening the scope of emissive supramolecular assemblies and controlled supramolecular polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>1D/2D/3D Reversible Dimensional Transformation in Cu(II) Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reversible transformation between 1D, 2D, and 3D is demonstrated for the first time in coordination polymers comprising Cu(II) ions and bidentate terephthalate (BDC  2&#8211;  ). 1D uniform chains were reversibly transformed into 2D layers with the construction of Cupaddlewheels by eliminating water molecules. 2D/3D reversible transformation was achieved by removing/rebinding  N  ,  N&#8208;  dimethylformamide coordinated to the paddlewheels. These dimensional transformations significantly changed chemical and physical properties such as gas sorption and magnetism. Although the uptake in open&#8208;framework 1D and 2D Cu&#8208;BDC was insignificant, pronounced absorption was observed for 3D Cu&#8208;BDC. Drastic difference in magnetic behavior is consistent with their coordination structures; uniform 1D chain of Cu(II) in 1D Cu&#8208;BDC and 2D sheet based on Cu(II)&#8208;paddlewheel dimers in 2D Cu&#8208;BDC. Ferromagnetic behavior observed in air&#8208;exposed 3D Cu&#8208;BDC is attributed to the 3D structure formed by the connection of 2D sheets.</dc:description>

         <title>Record Aluminum Molecular Rings for Optical Limiting and Nonlinear Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline cluster materials, a class of functional motif aggregations, provide a great opportunity for tuning the properties stemming from the flexible and accurate variation of inorganic and organic compositions. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of functional ligand and ring size regulation on the structures and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Revealed by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis results, aluminum molecular ring expansion is achieved by 2 &#215; 9 and 3 &#215; 6 strategies. In terms of the given organic shells, we further tuned the aluminum molecular ring sizes from 3.0 nm to 1.7 nm. The picosecond Z&#8208;scan measurements results revealed that the third&#8208;order NLO performances do not only depend on the general conjugate interactions but are also related to hydrogen bonding, polarizability, and ring sizes. The large nonlinear absorption coefficient and onset prove that the observed samples are promising candidates for the field of nonlinear optics field.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Ambiphile Reactivity Trends in the Anti&#8208;(Hetero)annulation of Non&#8208;Conjugated Alkenes via PdII/PdIV Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to access 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles from non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides and ambiphilic organohalides is described. Under PdII/PdIV catalysis, this [n+2] annulation proceeds in an anti&#8208;selective fashion and tolerates a wide array of ambiphiles, which are systematically benchmarked with respect to nucleophile identity, electrophile identity, and product ring&#8208;size. Otherwise unreactive ambiphilic ortho&#8208;haloacetophenones can be activated using an amine co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
In this study, we systematically evaluate different ambiphilic organohalides for their ability to participate in anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208; or heteroannulation with non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides under PdII/PdIV catalysis. Detailed optimization of the reaction conditions has led to protocols for synthesizing tetrahydropyridines, tetralins, pyrrolidines, and other carbo/heterocyclic cores via [n+2] (n=3&#8211;5) (hetero)annulation. Expansion of scope to otherwise unreactive ambiphilic haloketones through PdII/amine co&#8208;catalysis is also demonstrated. Compared to other annulation processes, this method proceeds via a distinct PdII/PdIV mechanism involving Wacker&#8208;type directed nucleopalladation. This difference results in unique reactivity and selectivity patterns, as revealed through assessment of reaction scope and competition experiments.

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Reveals Sex Difference in Vesicular Storage and Release of Catecholamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantitative measurements of sex difference in vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at a single vesicle level are very essential to understand sex differences in cognitive behaviors; however, such measurements are very challenging to conventional analytical methods. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the duration of single exocytotic events of chromaffin cells prepared from male rats is statistically longer than that from female rats, leading to more neurotransmitter released in male group. Further analysis reveals that a higher percentage of vesicles in female group release part of neurotransmitter, i.e., partial release, during exocytosis than that in male group. This sex dimorphism in neurotransmitter release in exocytosis might relate to the sex difference in the expression of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. Our finding offers the first experimental evidence that sex dimorphism even exists in vesicle chemistry, providing a brand new viewpoint for understanding the sex dimorphism in cognitive behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Arylation of Tertiary C&#8210;H Bonds of Cyclobutylmethyl Ketones Using Transient Directing Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first example of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed selective tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group. The electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand is identified as an external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers were readily accessed without preinstalling internal directing groups in up to 81% yield and &gt;95:5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8210;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8210;H arylation. In the presence of a &#946;&#8208;methyl C&#8210;H bond, the desired arylation of the tertiary C&#8211;H bond can still proceed as the predominant pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote C(sp3)&#8208;H Acylation of Amides and Cascade Cyclization via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of inert C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds under environmentally benign catalytic conditions remains a challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an organocatalytic remote C(sp  3  )&#8208;H acylation of amides and cascade cyclization through a radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism using  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as the catalyst. Notably, a diversity of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates, including simple linear aliphatic carbamates and  ortho  &#8208;alkyl benzamides, can be successfully applied to this organocatalytic system. With the established protocol, over 120 examples of functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were facilely synthesized in up to 99% yield under mild conditions. The robustness and generality of the organocatalytic strategy was further highlighted by the successful acylation of unactivated C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds and late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules. The attempt for asymmetric control of the radical reaction proved to be feasible by using a newly designed chiral thiazolium catalyst, and moderate enantioselectivity was obtained at the current stage. Preliminary mechanistic investigations including several control reactions, KIE experiments, and computational studies shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Dominance of Cyclobutadienyl Over Cyclopentadienyl in the Crystal Field Splitting in Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>

         <title>Emissive Platinum(II) Macrocycles as Tunable Cascade Energy Transfer Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing artificial light&#8208;harvesting scaffolds with cascade energy transfer process is significant for better understanding of photosynthesis. Here, we report [3+3] self&#8208;assembled Pt(II) fluorescent macrocycles (  3a  and  3b  ) as light&#8208;harvesting platforms with cascade energy transfer. The Pt(II) macrocycles aggregate into nanospheres and show emission enhancement characteristics upon increasing water content in acetone medium. These aggregates (  3a  a  and  3b  a  ) serve as energy donors when mixed with the hydrophobic dye Eosin&#8208;Y (ESY).&#160; In the presence of a second dye, Nile Red (NiR), an unusual sequential two&#8208;step energy transfer takes place from the macrocycles to NiR. In this case, ESY acts as a bridge in the relay mode. Additionally, a unique strategy to control such an energy transfer process by tuning the chain length of the alkyl group attached to the periphery of the macrocycles is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Encoding Enantiomeric Molecular Chiralities on Graphene Basal Planes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene has demonstrated broad applications due to its prominent properties. Its molecular structure makes graphene achiral. Here, we propose a direct way to prepare chiral graphene by transferring chiral structural conformation from chiral conjugated amino acids onto graphene basal plane through &#928;&#8208;&#928; interaction followed by thermal fusion. Using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy, we estimated an areal coverage of the molecular imprints (chiral regions) up to 64% on the basal plane of graphene (grown by chemical vapor deposition). The high concentration of molecular imprints in their single layer points to a close packing of the deposited amino acid molecules prior to &#8220;thermal fusion&#8221;. Such &#8220;molecular chirality&#8208;encoded graphene&#8221; was tested as an electrode in electrochemical enantioselective recognition. The chirality&#8208;encoded graphene might find use for other chirality&#8208;related studies and the encoding procedure might be extended to other two&#8208;dimensional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Widefield SERS for High&#8208;Throughput Nanoparticle Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging is a powerful technology with unprecedent potential for ultrasensitive chemical analysis. Point&#8208;by&#8208;point scanning and often excessively long spectral acquisition&#8208;times hamper the broad exploitation of the full analytical potential of SERS. Here, we introduce large scale SERS particle screening (LSSPS), a multiplexed widefield screening approach to particle&#8208;characterization, which is 500&#8208;1000 times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations. Beyond its higher throughput, LSSPS simultaneously quantifies both the sample&#8217;s Raman and Rayleigh scattering, allowing for an unprecedented correlation of SERS activity with the particle&#8208;size and to directly quantify the fraction of SERS active particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Catalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Arenes: Expeditious Synthesis of the Remdesivir Nucleoside**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars is presented. A silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which are cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The utility of the method is showcased in the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 by a subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.







Abstract
Since early 2020, scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, in particular by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spread of the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the human body. The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stages of the infection. However, the current synthetic routes rely on the use of protecting groups, air&#8208;sensitive reagents, and cryogenic conditions, thus impeding a cost&#8208;efficient supply to patients. We have, therefore, focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation that initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The method significantly expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 after a subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.

         <title>Accelerating Radiative Decay in Blue Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emitters by Minimizing the Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distances</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorophores are constructed with strong through&#8208;space donor&#8211;acceptor interactions by minimizing their face&#8208;to&#8208;face distance of 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, realizing efficient blue emission and fast radiative decay. The materials show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with relieved efficiency roll&#8208;off and CIEy coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15, when used as emitter and sensitizer in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorophors (TADF) featuring through&#8208;space charge transfers (TSCT) suffer from low radiative decay rates (krs), especially for blue emitters. Here, a xanthene bridge is adopted to construct space&#8208;confined face&#8208;to&#8208;face donor&#8211;acceptor alignment and minimize their distances down to 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, even shorter than the interlayer distance of graphite and thus strengthening the electronic interactions. The resulting blue TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters exhibit peaks around &#8776;460&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;90&#8201;%, and krs of nearly 107&#8197;s&#8722;1, almost 2&#8211;10&#8197;times higher than previously observed values with comparable reverse intersystem crossing rates. The corresponding blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15 using those molecules as emitters and sensitizers, respectively.

         <title>CLIPON: A CRISPR&#8208;Enabled Strategy that Turns Commercial Pregnancy Test Strips into General Point&#8208;of&#8208;Need Test Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational integration of the human chorionic gonadotropin, CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a/crRNA system, and large&#8208;sized DNA assemblies, a portable sensing platform termed CLIPON has been developed, which can transduce both nucleic acid and non&#8208;nucleic acid targets into commercial pregnancy test strip readout. The detection is sensitive, selective, instrument&#8208;free, and allows future integration into a microchip.







Abstract
Desirable biosensing assays need to be sensitive, specific, cost&#8208;effective, instrument&#8208;free, and versatile. Herein we report a new strategy termed CLIPON (CRISPR and Large DNA assembly Induced Pregnancy strips for signal&#8208;ON detection) that can deliver these traits. CLIPON integrates a commercial pregnancy test strip (PTS) with four biological elements: the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a, crRNA and cauliflower&#8208;like large&#8208;sized DNA assemblies (CLD). CLIPON uses the Cas12a/crRNA complex both to recognize a target of interest and to release CLD&#8208;bound hCG so that target presence can translate into a colorimetric signal on the PTS. We demonstrate the versatility of CLIPON through sensitive and specific detection of HPV genomic DNA, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA and adenosine. We also engineer a cell phone app and a hand&#8208;held microchip to achieve signal quantification. CLIPON represents an attractive option for biosensing and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.
