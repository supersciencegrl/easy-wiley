      <title>500&#8208;fold amplification of small molecule circularly polarized luminescence through circularly polarized FRET</title>
      <dc:description>Strongly dissymmetric circularly polarised (CP) luminescence from small organic molecules could transform a range of technologies, such as display devices. However, highly dissymmetric emission is usually not possible with small organic molecules, which typically give dissymmetric factors of photoluminescence (  g  PL  ) less than 10  &#8208;2  . Here we describe an almost 10  3  &#8208;fold chiroptical amplification of a &#960;&#8208;extended superhelicene when embedded in an achiral conjugated polymer matrix. This combination increases the |gPL| of the superhelicene from approximately 3 &#215; 10  &#8208;4  in solution to 0.15 in a blend film in the solid&#8208;state. We propose that the amplification arises not simply through a chiral environment effect, but instead due to electrodynamic coupling between the electric and magnetic transition dipoles of the polymer donor and superhelicene acceptor, and subsequent CP F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. We show that this amplification effect holds across several achiral polymer hosts and thus represents a simple and versatile approach to enhance the g&#8208;factors of small organic molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced Hydroarylation and Cyclization of Alkenes with Luminescent Platinum(II) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Photoinduced hydroarylation of alkenes is an appealing synthetic strategy for arene functionalization. Herein, we demonstrated that aryl radicals generated from electron&#8208;deficient aryl chlorides/bromides could be trapped by an array of terminal/internal aryl alkenes in the presence of [Pt(O^N^C^N)] under visible&#8208;light (410 nm) irradiation, affording anti&#8208;Markonikov hydroarylated compounds in up to 95% yield.

      <title>In Vivo Uranium Antidotal Therapy by a Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>Internal uranium contamination as a consequence of uranium mining, nuclear incident, and nuclear terrorist attacks is one of the most significant concerns in society today. The most effective strategies for dealing with this issue, if it arises, is to develop new materials that can rapidly capture and remove the uranium from the body. However, current selections of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art antidotal agents suffer from clear drawbacks dealing with limited uranium capture capability, poor selectivity, and/or high toxicity. Here, we propose a new agent for actinide antidotal therapy with fast uranium uptake kinetics and efficient in vivo uranium removal by a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic framework (nano&#8208;MOF). UiO&#8208;66 nanoparticles post&#8208;synthetically functionalized with carboxyl groups, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(COOH)  4  &#8208;180, exhibit the fastest uranium uptake kinetics reported with more than 65% of uranyl in fetal bovine serum (FBS) removed within 5 min. Moreover, the in vivo bio&#8208;distribution studies show that the material accumulates in kidneys and femurs where uranium mainly deposits facilitating the in vivo removal of uranium. The results of the in vivo uranium removal assays with mice show that UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(COOH)  4  &#8208;180 could successfully reduce the amounts of uranyl deposited in kidneys and femurs by up to 55.4% and 36.5%, respectively, and is significantly more efficient than the commercial actinide decorporation agent, ZnNa  3  &#8208;DTPA.</dc:description>

      <title>Interfacing High&#8208;Energy Charge Transfer States to a Near&#8208;IR Sensitizer for Efficient Electron Transfer upon Near&#8208;IR Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>Novel push&#8208;pull systems comprised of triphenylamine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene, a high&#8208;energy CT species is linked to a near&#8208;IR sensitizer, azaBODIPY, for promoting excited state CS. These new systems revealed panchromatic absorption due to combined effect of intramolecular CT, and near&#8208;IR absorbing azaBODIPY. Using electrochemical and computational studies, energy levels were established to visualize excited state events. Fs&#8208;TA studies were performed to monitor excited state CT events. From target analysis, the effect of solvent polarity, number of linked CT entities, and excitation wavelength dependence in governing the lifetime of CS states was established. Electron exchange between two TPA&#8208;TCBD entities in  3  seem to prolong lifetime of the CS state. Importantly, we have been successful in demonstrating efficient CS upon both high&#8208;energy CT and low&#8208;energy near&#8208;IR excitations, signifying importance of these push&#8208;pull systems for optoelectronic applications operating in the wide optical window.</dc:description>

      <title>Electric&#8208;Field Mediated Electron Tunneling of Supramolecular Naphthalimide Nanostructures for Biomimetic H2 Production</title>
      <dc:description>This work reported on the smart design and synthesis of two   novel semiconducting  bis  (4&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;bridging 1, 8&#8208;naphthalimide) bolaamphiphiles (BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  and BENI&#8208;NH  3  +  ) to fabricate supramolecular metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) nanostructures  for biomimetic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. An impressive H  2  evolution rate of  ca.  3.12 mmol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  and an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of  ca.  1.63 % at 400 nm were achieved over the BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  &#8208;NH  3  +  &#8208;Ni MIS photosystem prepared by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly of BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  with the opposite&#8208;charged  DuBois  &#8208;Ni catalysts.

Discrete dinickel(I) complexes (  2  Na  ,  2  K  ) of L  &#8722;  have now been synthesized via a direct reduction route and fully characterized. They feature two adjacent T&#8208;shaped metalloradicals that are antiferromagnetically coupled (  J  = &#8208;83/&#8208;71 cm  &#8208;1  ), giving an  S  = 0 ground state.

X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals distinctly different positions of the K  +  in  1  K  and  2  K  , suggesting a stabilizing interaction of K  +  with the dihydride unit in  1  K  . H  2  release from  1  K  can be triggered by peripheral g&#8208;C protonation at the nacnac subunits, which according to DFT calculations drastically lowers the barrier for reductive H  2  elimination from the bimetallic cleft. The resulting twice protonated dinickel(I) complex  3  reflects the non&#8208;innocence of nacnac ligands in terms of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity, as it harbors not only 2e  &#8211;  on the two metals but also 2H  +  stored at the ligand periphery.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic Bio&#8208;Barcode Assay Enables Electrochemical Detection of a Cancer Biomarker in Undiluted Human Plasma: A Sample&#8208;In&#8208;Answer&#8208;Out Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
An electrochemical bio&#8208;barcode assay allows protein biomarkers to be analyzed in undiluted and unprocessed human plasma samples. The dynamic DNA/protein complexes, composed of antibody&#8208;labelled DNA motifs (TB and B*C) and redox&#8208;labelled DNA (CR*), eliminate the need for multistep processing and allow sample&#8208;in&#8208;answer&#8208;out analysis.







Abstract
There is a need for biosensing systems that can be operated at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) for disease screening and diagnostics and health monitoring. In spite of this, simple to operate systems with the required analytical sensitivity and specificity in clinical samples, using a sample&#8208;in&#8208;answer&#8208;out approach, remain elusive. Reported here is an electrochemical bio&#8208;barcode assay (e&#8208;biobarcode assay) that integrates biorecognition with signal transduction using molecular (DNA/protein) machines and signal readout using nanostructured electrodes. The e&#8208;biobarcode assay eliminates multistep processing and uses a single step for analysis following sample collection into the reagent tube. A clinically relevant performance for the analysis of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in undiluted and unprocessed human plasma: a log&#8208;linear range of 1&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1&#8211;200&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1 and a LOD of 0.4&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1, was achieved. The e&#8208;biobarcode assay offers a realistic solution for biomarker analysis at the POC.

      <title>Unlocking Nature's Biosynthetic Power&#8212;Metabolic Engineering for the Fermentative Production of Chemicals</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances and future perspectives in microbial metabolic engineering are described in this Review, with a focus on selected commercially relevant examples. Existing biosynthetic pathways for natural products can now be easily discovered and optimized to enable competitive production processes. Moreover, nature's unlimited number of enzymes and metabolic pathways can now be rearranged to yield novel biosynthetic routes.







Abstract
Fermentation as a production method for chemicals is especially attractive, as it is based on cheap renewable raw materials and often exhibits advantages in terms of costs and sustainability. The tremendous development of technology in bioscience has resulted in an exponentially increasing knowledge about biological systems and has become the main driver for innovations in the field of metabolic engineering. Progress in recombinant DNA technology, genomics, and computational methods open new, cheaper, and faster ways to metabolically engineer microorganisms. Existing biosynthetic pathways for natural products, such as vitamins, organic acids, amino acids, or secondary metabolites, can be discovered and optimized efficiently, thereby enabling competitive commercial production processes. Novel biosynthetic routes can now be designed by the rearrangement of nature's unlimited number of enzymes and metabolic pathways in microbial strains. This expands the range of chemicals accessible by biotechnology and has yielded the first commercial products, while new fermentation technologies targeting novel active ingredients, commodity chemicals, and CO2&#8208;fixation methods are on the horizon.

      <title>Catalytic Decarboxylative C&#8211;N Formation to Generate Alkyl, Alkenyl and Aryl Amines</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed sp  2  carbon&#8211;nitrogen (C&#8211;N) formation is a reliable method with which to synthesize aryl amines. Catalytic sp  3  C&#8211;N formation reactions have been reported occasionally, and methods which can realize both sp  2  and sp  3  C&#8211;N formation are relatively unexplored. Here we address this challenge with a method of catalytic decarboxylative C&#8211;N formation which proceeds through a cascade carboxylic acid activation, acyl azide formation, Curtius rearrangement and nucleophilic addition reaction. The reaction uses naturally abundant organic carboxylic acids as carbon sources, readily prepared azidoformates as the nitrogen sources, and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and Cu(OAc)  2  as catalysts with as low as 0.1 mol% loading, providing protected alkyl, alkenyl and aryl amines in high yields with gaseous N  2  and CO  2  as the only byproducts. Examples are demonstrated of late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and drug molecules, stereospecific synthesis of useful &#945;&#8208;chiral alkyl amines, and rapid construction of different ureas and primary amines.</dc:description>

Specifically, the self&#8208;pillaring twinned MFI growth around MEL cores during secondary growth was key for creating these additional, non&#8208;zeolitic pores. The uniform, embedded non&#8208;zeolitic pores allowed for reducing defect formation considerably and facilitating molecular transport, resulting in high p&#8208;xylene perm&#8208;selectivity and molar flux. Specifically, compared to a conventional, crack network&#8208;containing MFI membranes of similar thickness (~1 &#181;m), the mesoporous MFI membranes showed almost double p&#8208;xylene permeance (~1.6 &#177; 0.4 &#215; 10&#8208;7 mol&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;s&#8208;1&#183;Pa&#8208;1) and a high p&#8208;/o&#8208;xylene separation factor (~53.8 &#177; 7.3 vs. 3.5 &#177; 0.5 in the conventional MFI membrane) at 225 &#176;C.

      <title>Reactivity, Selectivity and Synthesis of 4&#8208;C&#8208;Silylated Glycosyl Donors and 4&#8208;Deoxy Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>A method for introducing dimethylphenylsilyl at the 4&#8209;position in carbohydrates has been developed. Two C&#8208;silylated glycosyl donors were prepared via levoglucosenone, starting from cellulose. The glycosylation properties were studied using three glucoside acceptors, a 3&#8208;OH, 4&#8208;OH and 6&#8208;OH. Compared with the 4&#8209;deoxy variant, it was found that the anomeric selectivity was influenced more by the C&#8208;2 substituents orientation than the silyl in the 4&#8208;position. In general, the reactivity of these donors was higher than the corresponding 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;analogue, albeit a competition experiment showed that the introduction of a C&#8208;Si increases the relative reactivity by a modest factor of around two.</dc:description>

      <title>Series of Crystals with Giant Optical Anisotropy: A Targeted Strategic Research</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringence, as a key optical characteristic in polaized light, takes a vital role in optical communication, polarizing microscopic observation, and laser phase&#8208;matching. Currently, the main commercially used birefringent oxides &#945;&#8208;BaB2O  4  and YVO4  have the birefringences of 0.12 and 0.22, respectively. With the development of optical technology, more strict requirements for enhancing birefringence of oxides have been emerging. In this work, we propose a targeted high&#8208;throughput screening system to search birefringence&#8208;active functional modules (FMs) and large birefringent materials. A series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C2O4]2&#8208;  , [C2O6]2&#8208;  , [C4O4]2&#8208;  , and [C6O6]2&#8208;  units are discovered to be novel birefringence&#8208;active FMs. Increasing optical anisotropy appears in order of [CO3]2&#8208;  , [C2O4]2&#8208;  , [C2O6]2&#8208;  , [C4O4]2&#8208;  , and [C6O6]2&#8208;  according to quantum chemistry calculations. The theoretical and experimental studies on the oxycarbides confirm the feasibility of strategy. Based on this, the oxycarbides ranging from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared region with large birefringence from 0.1 to 1.35 are found, most of them break through the birefringent limit of oxides. And the largest one is 11 and 6 times of &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4  and YVO4  unprecedentedly. The (NH4)2C2O4  &#183;H2O crystal is grown and its experimental birefringence is 0.248 at 546 nm, which is identified as a promising UV birefringent crystal. In addition to newly found FMs, the A&#8208;site cations take significant roles in optical properties by influencing the density and arrangement of C&#8208;O units. The screened out compounds prove the validity of the FM&#8208;driven strategy, which would be a guide&#8208;line for exploring new birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) plays an important role in maintaining the reactive oxygen metabolic balance, yet limited GPx&#8208;mimicking nanozymes are currently available for  in vivo  therapy. Herein, a ligand engineering strategy is developed to modulate the GPx&#8208;mimicking activity of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanozyme. With different substituted ligands, the GPx&#8208;mimicking activities of MIL&#8208;47(V)&#8208;X (X = F, Br, NH  2  , CH  3  , OH, and H) MOFs are rationally regulated. With the best one as an example, both  in vitro  and  in vivo  experiments reveal the excellent antioxidation ability of MIL&#8208;47(V)&#8208;NH  2  , which alleviates inflammatory response effectively for both ear injury and colitis, better than less&#8208;active MIL&#8208;47(V). This study proves that high&#8208;performance GPx&#8208;mimicking nanozymes can be rationally designed by a ligand engineering strategy, and that structure&#8208;activity relationships can direct the  in vivo  therapy. Therefore, it not only enriches the research of nanozymes, but also expands the range of the biomimetic MOFs and knowledge&#8208;enabled nanomedicine.</dc:description>

      <title>DNA Origami Templated Growth of Multilamellar Lipid Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>Lipids are important building blocks in cellular compartments and their supramolecular self&#8208;assembly into well&#8208;defined hierarchical structures has gained major interest. Cationic lipids and unstructured DNA can co&#8208;assemble into highly ordered structures (lipoplexes), but potential applications of lipoplexes are still rather limited. Using scaffolded DNA origami nanostructures could aid in resolving these drawbacks. Here, we have complexed DNA origami together with a cationic lipid 1,2&#8208;dioleoly&#8208;3&#8208;trimethylammonium&#8208;propane (DOTAP) and studied their self&#8208;assembly driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The results suggest that the DNA origami function as a template for the growth of multilamellar lipid structures and that the DNA origami are embedded in the formed lipid matrix. Furthermore, the lipid encapsulation was found to significantly shield the DNA origami against nuclease digestion. The presented complexation strategy is suitable for a wide range of DNA&#8208;based templates and could therefore find uses in construction of cell&#8208;membrane associated components.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lipids are important building blocks in cellular compartments and their supramolecular self&#8208;assembly into well&#8208;defined hierarchical structures has gained major interest. Cationic lipids and unstructured DNA can co&#8208;assemble into highly ordered structures (lipoplexes), but potential applications of lipoplexes are still rather limited. Using scaffolded DNA origami nanostructures could aid in resolving these drawbacks. Here, we have complexed DNA origami together with a cationic lipid 1,2&#8208;dioleoly&#8208;3&#8208;trimethylammonium&#8208;propane (DOTAP) and studied their self&#8208;assembly driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The results suggest that the DNA origami function as a template for the growth of multilamellar lipid structures and that the DNA origami are embedded in the formed lipid matrix. Furthermore, the lipid encapsulation was found to significantly shield the DNA origami against nuclease digestion. The presented complexation strategy is suitable for a wide range of DNA&#8208;based templates and could therefore find uses in construction of cell&#8208;membrane associated components.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Coherent Vibration and Femtosecond Dynamics of the Platinum Complex Oligomers upon Intermolecular Bond Formation in the Excited State</title>
      <dc:description>Femtosecond time&#8208;resolved absorption and picosecond time&#8208;resolved emission measurements were carried out for highly concentrated aqueous solutions of K  2  [Pt(CN)  4  ] to investigate excited&#8208;state dynamics of the [Pt(CN)  4  2&#8210;  ] oligomers formed with metallophilic interaction. Time&#8208;resolved absorption spectra exhibit complicated dynamics that is represented with five time constants. Among them, the 90&#8208;ps and 400&#8208;ps dynamics were assigned to the S  1  &#8594; T  1  intersystem crossing of the trimer and tetramer coexisting in the solution by comparison with the fluorescence decays. Clear oscillations of transient absorption were observed in the first few picoseconds, and the frequency vs detected&#8208;wavelength 2D analysis revealed that the 135&#8208;cm  &#8208;1  and 65&#8208;cm  &#8208;1  oscillations arise from the Pt&#8208;Pt stretch motions of the S  1  trimer and S  1  tetramer, respectively. The obtained time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic data provide a clear view of the excited&#8208;state dynamics of the [Pt(CN)  4  2&#8210;  ] oligomers in the femto/picosecond region.</dc:description>

Advanced electron microscopy tools show they are composed of amorphous silica and iron nanoparticles of large surface areas and inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;particle porosity. Their building resembles that of a heterogeneous catalyst, but they can also exhibit a bilayer structure. Additional surface area measurements suggest that membranes grown from natural waters hold even higher catalytic potential.

      <title>A Dinuclear Persulfide&#8208;Bridged Ruthenium Compound is a Hypoxia&#8208;Selective Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Donor.</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S) is a gaseous molecule that has received attention for its role in biological processes and therapeutic potential in diseases such as ischemic reperfusion injury. Despite its clinical relevance, delivery of H  2  S to biological systems is hampered by its toxicity at high concentrations. Herein, we report the first metal based H  2  S donor that delivers this gas selectively to hypoxic cells. We further show that H  2  S release from this compound protects H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts from an in vitro model of ischemic reperfusion injury.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S) is a gaseous molecule that has received attention for its role in biological processes and therapeutic potential in diseases such as ischemic reperfusion injury. Despite its clinical relevance, delivery of H  2  S to biological systems is hampered by its toxicity at high concentrations. Herein, we report the first metal based H  2  S donor that delivers this gas selectively to hypoxic cells. We further show that H  2  S release from this compound protects H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts from an in vitro model of ischemic reperfusion injury.

      <title>On the Existence of N&#8594;C Dative Bond in C60&#8208;Piperidine Complex</title>
      <dc:description>The complexes formed between carbon allotropes (C  20  , C  60  fullerenes, graphene and single wall carbon nanotubes) and piperidine have been investigated by means of computational quantum chemical and experimental IR and NMR techniques. Alongside hydrogen bonds; the C&#183;&#183;&#183;N tetrel bond; and lone&#8208;pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, the unexpected N&#8594;C dative/covalent bond has been detected solely in complexes of fullerenes with piperidine. The effect of particular structural motives on the formation of dative bonds has been explored. Non&#8208;planarity and five&#8208;member rings of carbon allotropes represent the key structural prerequisites for the unique formation of a dative N&#8594;C bond. The results of thermodynamics calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and NMR and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopies explain the specific interactions between C  60  and piperidine. The differences in behavior of individual carbon allotropes in terms of dative bonding formation brings a new insight into their controllable organic functionalization.</dc:description>

      <title>Structure based design of bicyclic peptide inhibitors of RbAp48</title>
      <dc:description>The scaffolding protein RbAp48 is part of several epigenetic regulation complexes and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. In order to develop tool compounds for the study of RbAp48 function, we have developed peptide inhibitors targeting the protein&#8208;protein interaction interface between RbAp48 and the scaffold protein MTA1. Based on a MTA1&#8208;derived linear peptide with low micromolar affinity and informed by crystallographic analysis, a bicyclic peptide was developed that inhibits the RbAp48/MTA1 interaction with a very low nanomolar KD value of 8.56 nM, and which showed appreciable stability against cellular proteases. Design included exchange of a polar amide cyclization strategy to hydrophobic aromatic linkers enabling mono&#8208; and bicyclization by means of cysteine alkylation, which improved affinity by direct interaction of the linkers with a hydrophobic residue on RbAp48. Our results demonstrate that stepwise evolution of a structure&#8208;based design is a suitable strategy for inhibitor development targeting PPIs.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The scaffolding protein RbAp48 is part of several epigenetic regulation complexes and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. In order to develop tool compounds for the study of RbAp48 function, we have developed peptide inhibitors targeting the protein&#8208;protein interaction interface between RbAp48 and the scaffold protein MTA1. Based on a MTA1&#8208;derived linear peptide with low micromolar affinity and informed by crystallographic analysis, a bicyclic peptide was developed that inhibits the RbAp48/MTA1 interaction with a very low nanomolar KD value of 8.56 nM, and which showed appreciable stability against cellular proteases. Design included exchange of a polar amide cyclization strategy to hydrophobic aromatic linkers enabling mono&#8208; and bicyclization by means of cysteine alkylation, which improved affinity by direct interaction of the linkers with a hydrophobic residue on RbAp48. Our results demonstrate that stepwise evolution of a structure&#8208;based design is a suitable strategy for inhibitor development targeting PPIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Extended Benzene&#8208;Fused Oligo&#8208;BODIPYs: In Three Steps to a Series of Large, Arc&#8208;Shaped, Near Infrared Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>We present a straightforward, three&#8208;step synthesis engaging an oligomerization and subsequent one&#8208;pot oxidation step to form fully conjugated, benzene&#8208;fused oligo&#8208;BODIPYs from simple BODIPY precursors.

The structural integrity was verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and all target compounds were studied in detail by photophysical, electrochemical and computational means. The main S1 excited state gradually converges to a structure&#8208;specific excitation limit, displaying a strong shift of the absorption event from about 500 nm (BODIPY monomer) to 955 nm (octamer) with attenuation coefficients up to ca. 500 000 M&#8208;1cm1.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Field&#8208;Driven Extraction of Bioreceptors into Polymeric Membranes for Label&#8208;Free Potentiometric Biosensing</title>
      <dc:description>We report here on a novel concept of a magnetically&#8208;controlled extraction of hydrophilic bioreceptors into polymeric membranes for bioassays. The potentiometric assay relies on the intrinsic charges of an antimicrobial peptide and its unique recognition abilities, which can eliminate the probe labelling and indicator addition. The target binding event could effectively prevent the extraction of the peptide into the polymeric membrane doped with an ion exchanger, thus resulting in a potential change. The potentiometric response properties of the peptide assembled on magnetic beads can be dynamically controlled and modulated by applying a magnetic field.  Staphylococcus aureus  , as a model of food&#8208;borne pathogens, was measured at levels down to 10 CFU mL  &#8208;1  . Based on this sensing strategy, a potentiometric array was developed for the pattern recognition of bacteria.

      <title>Cyclized polyacrylonitrile anode for alkali metal ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Alkali metal (Li, Na, and K) ion batteries are vital in portable and large&#8208;scale stationary energy storage. Recently, organic anodes have attracted increasing attention for alkali metal ion batteries due to their chemical diversity and potential high capacity. In this work, we discovered that cyclized polyacrylonitrile (cPAN) can serve as a superior anode for alkali metal ion batteries. Remarkably, upon activation cycling, as an anode of lithium&#8208;ion battery, cPAN exhibits a reversible capacity as high as 1238 mAh g&#8208;1 under a current density of 50 mA g&#8208;1. Based on electrochemical experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations, it is demonstrated that the hexagonal carbon ring, piperidine ring, and pyridine nitrogen in ladder cPAN are the main active sites for lithium&#8208;ion storage. In addition, we show that cPAN displays a unique potential&#8208;dependent solid electrolyte interphase formation from 0.1 to 0.01 V vs. Li/Li+. Furthermore, cPAN displays decent performance as an anode in SIBs and PIBs. The discovery of cPAN anode could pave the way for the future development of organic anodes for alkali metal ion batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Cation additive enabled rechargeable LiOH based lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium oxygen (Li&#8208;O  2  ) batteries have attracted extensive research interest due to their high energy density. Other than Li  2  O  2  (a typical discharge product in Li&#8208;O  2  batteries), LiOH is proved to be electrochemically active as an alternative product. Here we report a simple strategy to achieve a reversible LiOH based Li&#8208;O  2  battery with the use of a cation additive, sodium ions, to the lithium electrolyte. Without redox mediators in the cell, LiOH is detected as the sole discharge product and it charges at a low charge potential of 3.4 V. A solution&#8208;based reaction route is proposed, showing that the competing solvation environment of the catalyst and Li  +  leads to LiOH precipitation at the cathode. It is critical to tune the cell chemistry of Li&#8208;O  2  batteries by designing a simple system to promote LiOH formation/decomposition.</dc:description>

      <title>Host&#8208;Guest Exchange of Viologen Guests in Porphyrin Cage Compounds as Studied by Selective Exchange Spectroscopy (1D EXSY) NMR</title>
      <dc:description>Dynamics in complexes of porphyrin cage compounds and viologen&#8208;derived guest molecules are investigated by selective exchange NMR spectroscopy (1D EXSY). Exchange rates were found to be independent of excess guest concentration, revealing a dissociative exchange mechanism, which is accompanied by negative activation entropies. The latter indicates significant reorganization of the host&#8208;guest complex during dissociation. Dissymmetric viologen guests bearing bulky head groups exhibited more unidirectional binding and slower exchange rates than guests with less bulky head groups. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies revealed that the exchange process is primarily driven by the thermodynamics of binding. Overall, guest binding can be influenced by introducing steric and electronic groups on the host, which for small substituents that make the cavity sidewalls more electron&#8208;rich, results in stronger binding. Exchange studies with guests bearing a polymer chain revealed that both slippage and full dissociation takes place and the rate constants for both processes were determined. The slippage rate constant corresponded to the exchange rate constants of smaller guests, which further revealed that for smaller guests exchange takes place nearly exclusively under thermodynamic control.</dc:description>

      <title>Towards a Single Chemical Model for Understanding Lanthanide Hexaborides</title>
      <dc:description>
Lanthanide hexaborides (LnB6) have a plethora of seemingly mutually incompatible properties. We propose a chemical bonding model that rationalizes the entire LnB6 series. The boron atoms can access different bonding states with the Ln, and in some LnB6 switch between them through phonon motion. The new paradigm allows predictions of new properties of mixed alloys.







Abstract
Lanthanide hexaborides (LnB6) have disparate and often anomalous properties, from structurally homogeneous mixed valency, to superconductivity, spectral anomalies, and unexplained phase transitions. It is unclear how such a diversity of properties may arise in the solids of identical crystal structures and seemingly very similar electronic structures. Building on our previous model for SmB6 (mixed valent, with a peak in specific heat, and pressure induced magnetic phase transitions), we present a unifying dynamic bonding model for LnB6 that explains simultaneously EuB6 (possessing an anomalous peak in specific heat at low T, magnetic phase transitions, and no mixed valency), YbB6 (mixed valent topological insulator), and rather ordinary LaB6. We show that Ln can engage in covalent bonding with boron, and, in some members of the LnB6 family, also easily access alternative bonding states through the electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The accessibility, relative energetics, and bonding nature of the states involved dictate the properties.

     alt="Towards a Single Chemical Model for Understanding Lanthanide Hexaborides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanthanide hexaborides (LnB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) have a plethora of seemingly mutually incompatible properties. We propose a chemical bonding model that rationalizes the entire LnB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; series. The boron atoms can access different bonding states with the Ln, and in some LnB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; switch between them through phonon motion. The new paradigm allows predictions of new properties of mixed alloys.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanthanide hexaborides (LnB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) have disparate and often anomalous properties, from structurally homogeneous mixed valency, to superconductivity, spectral anomalies, and unexplained phase transitions. It is unclear how such a diversity of properties may arise in the solids of identical crystal structures and seemingly very similar electronic structures. Building on our previous model for SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (mixed valent, with a peak in specific heat, and pressure induced magnetic phase transitions), we present a unifying dynamic bonding model for LnB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; that explains simultaneously EuB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (possessing an anomalous peak in specific heat at low T, magnetic phase transitions, and no mixed valency), YbB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (mixed valent topological insulator), and rather ordinary LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. We show that Ln can engage in covalent bonding with boron, and, in some members of the LnB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; family, also easily access alternative bonding states through the electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The accessibility, relative energetics, and bonding nature of the states involved dictate the properties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Bidentate (P^N)Gold(III) Fluoride Complexes: Reactivity Platforms for Reductive Elimination Studies</title>
      <dc:description>A new family of cationic, bidentate (P^N)gold(III) fluoride complexes has been prepared and a detailed characterization of the gold&#8208;fluoride bond has been carried out. Our results correlate with the observed reactivity of the fluoro ligand, which undergoes facile exchange with both cyano and acetylene nucleophiles. The resulting (P^N)arylgold(III)C(sp) complexes have enabled the first study of reductive elimination on (P^N)gold(III) systems demonstrating that C(sp  2  )&#8208;C(sp) bond formation occurs at higher rates than those reported for analogous phosphine&#8208;based monodentate systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Rapid and Nondestructive Histopathological Analysis for Intraoperative Cancer Diagnosis Using an Enzyme&#8208;Activated NIR&#8208;II Nanoprobe</title>
      <dc:description>Accurate intraoperative histopathological analysis is critical to the tumor surgery. However, conventional methods are labor&#8208; and time&#8208;intensive, which greatly delay the intraoperative decision&#8208;making. Herein, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe (A&amp;MMP@Ag  2  S&#8208;AF7P) is presented for rapid and nondestructive histopathological analysis for  ex vivo  and  in vivo  neuroblastoma diagnosis. A&amp;MMP@Ag  2  S&#8208;AF7P displays the negligible fluorescence in normal tissues but is activated quickly by inhibiting the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process between Ag  2  S QDs and A1094 mediated by MMP14 overexpressed in neuroblastoma, meanwhile, the exposure of the membrane penetrating peptide R9 (TAT&#8208;peptide) results in efficient internalization of nanoprobes in the cancer cells, providing superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) tissue ratio. Instant illumination of the lesion and well&#8208;defined tumor margins make the nanoprobes adequate as rapid diagnostic reagent for incorporation into cancer surgical or tissue biopsy procedures.</dc:description>
