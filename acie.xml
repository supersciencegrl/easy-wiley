         <title>Arene Activation through Iminium Ions: Product Diversity from Intramolecular Photocycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde&#8208;derived iminium ions 1 form benzoxacyclic products 2 in a photochemical reaction cascade (n=0,1). Structurally different products 3 (meta photocycloaddition) and 4 (aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction) are observed depending on two key substituents (R, R1).







Abstract
While 2&#8208;alk&#8208;&#969;&#8208;enyloxy&#8208;sustituted benzaldehydes do not display any photochemical reactivity at the arene core, the respective iminium perchlorates were found to undergo efficient reactions either upon direct irradiation (&#955;=366&#8197;nm) or under sensitizing conditions (&#955;=420&#8197;nm, 2.5&#8197;mol% thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one). Three pathways were found: (a)&#8197;Most commonly, the reaction led to benzoxacyclic products in which the olefin in the tether underwent a formal, yet unprecedented carboformylation (13 examples, 44&#8211;99&#8201;% yield). The cascade process occurred with high diastereoselectivity and was found to be stereoconvergent. (b)&#8197;If a substituent resides in the 3&#8208;position of the benzene ring, a meta photocycloaddition was observed which produced tetracyclic skeletons with five stereogenic centers in excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (2 examples, 58&#8211;79&#8201;% yield). (c)&#8197;If the tether was internally substituted at the alkene, an arene photocycloaddition was avoided and an azetidine was formed in an aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction (2 examples, 95&#8211;98&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Multidentate Chelation Heals Structural Imperfections for Minimized Recombination Loss in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical modification of tin perovskites by biocompatible multidentate chelators realized &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; healing of structural imperfections and manipulation of carrier dynamics, delivering an efficiency up to 13.70&#8201;% with enhanced long&#8208;term stability over 1200&#8197;h.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (Sn&#8208;PSCs) have emerged as promising environmentally viable photovoltaic technologies, but still suffer from severe non&#8208;radiative recombination loss due to the presence of abundant deep&#8208;level defects in the perovskite film and under&#8208;optimized carrier dynamics throughout the device. Herein, we healed the structural imperfections of Sn perovskites in an &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; manner by incorporating a new class of biocompatible chelating agent with multidentate claws, namely, 2&#8208;Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), which passivated a variety of deep&#8208;level Sn&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects, cooperatively reinforced the passivation efficacy, released the lattice strain, improved the structural toughness, and promoted the carrier transport of Sn perovskites. Encouragingly, an efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% with a small voltage deficit of &#8776;0.47&#8197;V has been achieved for the GAA&#8208;modified Sn&#8208;PSCs. GAA modification also extended the lifespan of Sn&#8208;PSCs over 1200&#8197;hours.

         <title>Fano Resonance in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers the first direct observation of the Fano resonance effect in single&#8208;molecule junctions by the charge injection on the nitrogen atom using an EC&#8208;STM&#8208;BJ technique at room temperature, which provides a facile way to manipulate electron tunneling in the single&#8208;molecule junctions and opens a new avenue toward the design of interference&#8208;based molecular electronic devices.







Abstract
The Fano resonance in single&#8208;molecule junctions could be created by interaction with discrete and continuous molecular orbitals and enables effective electron transport modulation between constructive and destructive interference within a small energy range. However, direct observation of Fano resonance remains unexplored because of the disappearance of discrete orbitals by molecule&#8208;electrode coupling. We demonstrated the room&#8208;temperature observation of Fano resonance from electrochemical gated single&#8208;molecule conductance and current&#8211;voltage measurements of a para&#8208;carbazole anion junction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the negative charge on the nitrogen atom induces a localized HOMO on the molecular center, creating Fano resonance by interfering with the delocalized LUMO on the molecular backbone. Our findings demonstrate that the Fano resonance in electron transport through single&#8208;molecule junctions opens pathways for designs of interference&#8208;based electronic devices.

         <title>On Demand Flow Platform for the Generation of Anhydrous Dinitrogen Trioxide and Its Further Use in N&#8208;Nitrosative Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile continuous flow platform for the generation of concentrated dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) solution with accurate and tunable concentration is reported. It unlocks the use of N2O3 in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles in flow and batch.







Abstract
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a powerful and efficient nitrosating agent that comes with an unprecedented atom economy. However, the synthetic application of N2O3 is still underdeveloped mostly due to its inherent instability and the lack of reliable protocols for its preparation. This paper presents an open&#8208;source setup and procedure for the on&#8208;demand generation of anhydrous N2O3 solution (up to 1&#8197;M), which can be further used for reactions under batch and flow conditions. The accuracy and stability of N2O3 concentration are guaranteed with the absence of head&#8208;space in the setup and with the synchronization of the gas flows. The reliability of this protocol is demonstrated by &gt;30 worked examples in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles&#8212;a library of structurally diverse benzotriazoles and sydnones. Kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the N&#8208;nitrosative steps are also explored.

&lt;p&gt;Dinitrogen trioxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a powerful and efficient nitrosating agent that comes with an unprecedented atom economy. However, the synthetic application of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is still underdeveloped mostly due to its inherent instability and the lack of reliable protocols for its preparation. This paper presents an open-source setup and procedure for the on-demand generation of anhydrous N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solution (up to 1&#8197;M), which can be further used for reactions under batch and flow conditions. The accuracy and stability of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; concentration are guaranteed with the absence of head-space in the setup and with the synchronization of the gas flows. The reliability of this protocol is demonstrated by &amp;gt;30 worked examples in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles&#8212;a library of structurally diverse benzotriazoles and sydnones. Kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosative steps are also explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C Interactions Support a Robust Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Gold(I) Complex for OLEDs with Little Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off and Good Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
Robust mononuclear AuI emitters are prepared by harnessing intramolecular Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions. The new emitter displays appealing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as well as thermal and photo&#8208;stability, leading to high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off and good operational stability. This work shows the potential of secondary interactions for developing optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
The practical use of luminescent mononuclear gold(I) complexes as optoelectronic materials has been limited by their inferior stability. Herein we demonstrate a strategy to improve the stability of gold(I) complexes which display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). A highly rigid and groove&#8208;like &#963;&#8208;donating aryl ligand has been used to form dual Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. The secondary metal&#8208;ligand interactions have been authenticated by single&#8208;crystal structure, NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The TADF AuI complex exhibits appealing emission properties (photoluminescence quantum yield=76&#8201;%; delayed fluorescence lifetime=1.2&#8197;&#956;s) and much improved thermal and photo&#8208;stability. Vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) show promising electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 23&#8201;% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off even at 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. An estimated LT50 longer than 77&#8201;000&#8197;h with initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 reveals good operational stability. This work suggests a way for design of stable luminescent gold(I) complexes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Fibrous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to introduce self&#8208;healing properties to fibrous membrane materials owing to the complex healing mechanism and particular porous structure. In this Minireview self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes are introduced and described in detail in terms of design strategies and preparation methods. The current state of the art, existing challenges, and future outlook for this promising field are systematically summarized.







Abstract
Inspired by the self&#8208;healing function of living organisms, self&#8208;healing materials have been developed in recent decades to very high standards. As a new direction, self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes (SFMs) exhibit both the configuration of a porous structure and self&#8208;healing capability within one material. Different from nonporous self&#8208;healing materials, it is more challenging to introduce self&#8208;healing properties to porous fibrous membrane materials owing to the more complex healing mechanism and microstructure of SFMs. This Minireview focuses on the self&#8208;healing mechanisms, design principles, and preparation strategies of SFMs. The characteristics of SFM self&#8208;healing performance are introduced in detail, and insights and perspectives of SFM preparation and healing mechanisms are put forward. Furthermore, remaining challenges and future developments of SFMs are presented, where the ultimate goal is the design of highly efficient self&#8208;healing and superstable fibrous membranes.

         <title>Single&#8208;Fluorophore&#8208;Based Organic Crystals with Distinct Conformers Enabling Wide&#8208;Range Excitation&#8208;Dependent Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and generalizable molecular platform that exhibits three emission bands in the crystalline states. The emission maximum can be tuned over a wide range (&#8819;230&#8197;nm) by varying excitation wavelengths. Diverse conformations in S0 and three local minima in S1 are crucial to these unique luminescent properties.







Abstract
Achieving wide&#8208;range tunable emission colors, especially in the solid state of single&#8208;fluorophore materials, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a molecular design strategy that affords wide&#8208;range excitation&#8208;dependent emissions spanning over &#8776;230&#8197;nm in crystalline states. Under the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor configuration, we judiciously choose a rotatable acceptor fragment, o&#8208;carborane, to enrich conformational diversities in the crystalline state and generate conformation&#8208;dependent multicolor emissions. We further show that this molecular platform is generalizable in creating crystalline materials with multicolor emissions. Based on these materials, a high&#8208;capacity information storage device and a finite&#8208;state machine were fabricated to showcase multicolor displays and information storage.

         <title>Reductive Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;Bond Formation in Alumaboranes: Facile Scission of Polar Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of rare Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bonds is facilitated employing a peri&#8208;AlI2/BMes2 naphthalene scaffold, which upon reduction forms an alumaborane diethyl ether adduct. Reagents with polar multiple bonds (C=O, C&#8801;N, C=S) undergo complete scission with insertion of the heteroatom into Al&#8722;B bond. The findings help to understand the differences between Al&#8722;C bonds widely employed in aluminum organyls and scarcely studied alumaboranes with Al&#8722;B bonds.







Abstract
We present facile access to an alumaborane species with electron precise Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond. The reductive rearrangement of 1&#8208;(AlI2), 8&#8208;(BMes2) naphthalene (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) affords the alumaborane species cyclo&#8208;(1,8&#8208;C10H6)&#8208;[1&#8208;Al(Mes)(OEt2)&#8208;8&#8208;B(Mes)] with a covalent Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond. The Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond performs the reductive scission of multiple bonds: S=C(NiPrCMe)2 affords the naphthalene bridged motif B&#8722;S&#8722;Al(NHC), NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, while O=CPh2 is deoxygenated to afford an B&#8722;O&#8722;Al bridged species with incorporation of the remaining &#8801;CPh2 fragment into the naphthalene scaffold. The reaction with isonitrile Xyl&#8208;N&#8801;C (Xyl=2,6&#8208;Me2C6H4) proceeds via a proposed (amino boryl) carbene species; which adds a second equivalent of isonitrile to ultimately form the Al&#8722;N&#8722;B bridged species cyclo&#8208;(1,8&#8208;C10H6)&#8208;[1&#8208;Al(Mes)&#8208;N(Xyl)&#8208;8&#8208;B{C(Mes)=C&#8722;N&#8722;Xyl}] with complete scission of the C&#8801;N triple bond. The latter reaction is supported with isolated intermediates and by DFT calculations.

         <title>Formation and Reactivity of a Fleeting NiIII Bisphenoxyl Diradical Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiII(salen) complexes have been one of the most promising avenues for those aiming to generate high valent Ni species. The present work is a result of one such inquisitiveness where a NiII(salen) complex was treated with mCPBA to form a novel NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. Various spectroscopic tools and theoretical calculations further assisted our observation. This proposed three electron oxidized species showed oxidation reactivity.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450s and Galactose Oxidases exploit redox active ligands to form reactive high valent intermediates for oxidation reactions. This strategy works well for the late 3d metals where accessing high valent states is rather challenging. Herein, we report the oxidation of NiII(salen) (salen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;(1R,2R)&#8208;diamine) with mCPBA (meta&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid) to form a fleeting NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species, in CH3CN and CH2Cl2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses using UV/Vis, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies revealed oxidation events both on the ligand and the metal centre to yield a NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. DFT calculations found the electronic structure of the ligand and the d&#8208;configuration of the metal center to be consistent with a NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. This three electron oxidized species can perform hydrogen atom abstraction and oxygen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Visualization of Protein&#8208;Specific Glycation in Living Cells via Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a strategy for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation based on bioorthogonal chemical reporter and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout, which provide a powerful tool for analysing protein glycation and their corresponding biological functions in living cells.







Abstract
Due to the lack of suitable chemical tools, probing the protein&#8208;specific glycation is highly challenging. Herein, we present a strategy based on glycation chemical reporter and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation in living cells. We first developed a bioorthogonal glucose analogue, 6&#8208;azido&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (6AzGlc), as a novel glycation chemical reporter. Two types of DNA probes, glycation conversion probe and protein targeting probe, were designed to attach to glycation adducts and target proteins, respectively. After the protein was glycated by 6AzGlc, two DNA probes were sequentially applied to the target protein, triggering proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout. This strategy was successfully used to visualize glucose glycation of several proteins, including PD&#8208;L1 and integrin. More importantly, this strategy allowed us to analyze corresponding biological functions of glycated protein in the native environment.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Catalyst for the Fluorination of Acyl Chlorides at Parts&#8208;per&#8208;Million Catalyst Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst was synthesized via thermal decomposition of a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). The Co1&#8722;N4@NC catalyst generated a stable Co&#8722;F intermediate in situ through an oxidative fluorination pathway to replace the substitution fluorination of the unstable high&#8208;valent Co system. In the presence of Co&#8722;F intermediates, KF can be used to replace AgF. Co1&#8722;N4@NC exhibited ultrahigh catalytic activity for the fluorination of acyl chlorides.







Abstract
Improving the stability of sensitive catalytic systems is an emerging research topic in the catalysis field. However, the current design of heterogeneous catalysts mainly improves their catalytic performance. This paper presents a single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) strategy to improve the cobalt&#8208;catalysed fluorination of acyl chlorides. A stable Co&#8722;F intermediate can be formed through the oxidative fluorination of Co1&#8722;N4@NC SAC, which can replace the unstable high&#8208;valent cobalt catalytic system and avoid the use of phosphine ligands. In the SAC system, KF can be employed as a fluorinating reagent to replace the AgF, which can be applied to various substrates and scale&#8208;up conversion with high turnover numbers (TON=1.58&#215;106). This work also shows that inorganic SACs have tremendous potential for organofluorine chemistry, and it provides a good reference for follow&#8208;up studies on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between catalyst design and chemical reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for Concise Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Salinosporamide Family of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the total syntheses of salinosporamides and cinnabaramides via a strategy involving rapid construction of the highly decorated pyrrolidinone core of the natural products from the simple amino acid serine. The key to the success of this synthesis was to exploit the innate properties of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone as a stereochemical controller and unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Our first strategy for rapidly accessing pyrrolidinone cores of salinosporamides involved combined use of memory of chirality and dynamic kinetic resolution principles in aldol reactions of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone substrate, which was ultimately unsuccessful with respect to enantioselectivity. This failure led us to the revised strategy. The influence of the stereocenter in 5&#8208;oxazolidinone enabled selective installation of the C&#8208;2 stereocenter. The intramolecular aldol reaction of the C&#8208;2 stereodefined aldol substrate was successful. An unexpected hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was observed in hydrolyses of the bicyclic aldol products. This unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was utilized in preparing the pyrrolidinone core with excellent efficiency. Through this strategy, the concise total syntheses of salinosporamides A and B as well as cinnabaramides A, E, and F were achieved with high selectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies for the construction of bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembled ion channels as well as recent advances form the focus of this Minireview. The feasibility of these bio&#8208;inspired channels for exploring physiological events, the detection of molecules/ions, ion separation, and energy conversion is presented along with prospects for the future development of this vibrant field.







Abstract
Highly efficient biological ion channels with sophisticated transport characteristics in living organisms have inspired the design of artificial channels that are functionally comparable to those of their natural counterparts and applicable on a much larger scale. Self&#8208;assembly currently offers a facile approach for producing nanoconfined ion channels that exhibit smart ion&#8208;transport properties, including ion selectivity, gating, and rectification, and have shown great potential for various applications. In this Minireview, we give an overview of strategies for engineering bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembled ion channels. We focus on emerging channel assemblies based on different fabrication processes such as supramolecular assembly, nanosystem&#8208;based fabrication, and polymer&#8208;based integration. The applications of these bio&#8208;inspired channels in the exploration of physiological events, detection of molecules/ions, ion separation, and energy conversion are concisely presented. Finally, future developments and challenges of this booming research field are proposed.

We focus on emerging channel assemblies based on different fabrication processes such as supramolecular assembly, nanosystem-based fabrication, and polymer-based integration. The applications of these bio-inspired channels in the exploration of physiological events, detection of molecules/ions, ion separation, and energy conversion are concisely presented. Finally, future developments and challenges of this booming research field are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scaling Catalytic Contributions of Small Self&#8208;Cleaving Ribozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General base knockout in nucleolytic ribozymes using deazaguanosine&#8208;modified mutants paves the way to scale the relative contributions of the four main strategies (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;) applied in ribozyme general acid base catalysis.







Abstract
Nucleolytic ribozymes utilize general acid&#8208;base catalysis to perform phosphodiester cleavage. In most ribozyme classes, a conserved active site guanosine is positioned to act as general base, thereby activating the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group to attack the scissile phosphate (&#947;&#8208;catalysis). Here, we present an atomic mutagenesis study for the pistol ribozyme class. Strikingly, &#8220;general base knockout&#8221; by replacement of the guanine N1 atom by carbon results in only 2.7&#8208;fold decreased rate. Therefore, the common view that &#947;&#8208;catalysis critically depends on the N1 moiety becomes challenged. For pistol ribozymes we found that &#947;&#8208;catalysis is subordinate in overall catalysis, made up by two other catalytic factors (&#945; and &#948;). Our approach allows scaling of the different catalytic contributions (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;) with unprecedented precision and paves the way for a thorough mechanistic understanding of nucleolytic ribozymes with active site guanines.

         <dc:description>Herein, we synthesized new hetero&#8208;halogenated end groups with well&#8208;determined fluorinated and chlorinated substitutions (o&#8208;FCl&#8208;IC and FClF&#8208;IC), and synthesized regioisomer&#8208;free small molecular acceptors (SMAs) Y&#8208;Cl, Y&#8208;FCl, and Y&#8208;FClF with distinct hetero&#8208;halogenated terminals, respectively. The single&#8208;crystal structures and theoretical calculations indicate that Y&#8208;FClF exhibits more compact three&#8208;dimensional network packing and more significant &#960;&#8722;&#960; electronic coupling compared to Y&#8208;FCl. From Y&#8208;Cl to Y&#8208;FCl to Y&#8208;FClF, the neat films exhibit a narrower optical bandgap and gradually enhanced electron mobility and crystallinity. The PM6:Y&#8208;FClF blend film exhibits the strongest crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on molecular packing, desirable fibrous morphology with suitable phase segregation, and the highest and balanced charge mobilities among three blend films. Overall, the PM6:Y&#8208;FClF organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.65%, outperforming the PM6:Y&#8208;FCl and PM6:Y&#8208;Cl, which is the best PCE for reported hetero&#8208;halogens&#8208;based SMAs in binary OSCs. Our results demonstrate that difluoro&#8208;monochloro hetero&#8208;terminal is a superior regio&#8208;regular unit for enhancing the intermolecular crystal packing and photovoltaic performance of hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Cascade Reactions by a Cobalt&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Synergistic Nanocatalytic Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozyme, with Co&#8722;N coordination on N&#8208;doped porous carbon (Co&#8208;SAs@NC), displayed tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive cascade enzymatic activities with both catalase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like properties, specifically generating cytotoxic superoxide radicals from overexpressed H2O2. The nanocatalytic therapy led to a remarkably enhanced antitumor effect in vivo by further integration with doxorubicin.







Abstract
Nanocatalytic therapy, involving the nanozyme&#8208;triggered production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), has demonstrated potential in tumor therapy, but nanozymes still face challenges of activity and specificity that compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a strategy based on a single&#8208;atom nanozyme to initiate cascade enzymatic reactions in the TME for tumor&#8208;specific treatment. The cobalt&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozyme, with Co&#8722;N coordination on N&#8208;doped porous carbon (Co&#8208;SAs@NC), displays catalase&#8208;like activity that decomposes cellular endogenous H2O2 to produce O2, and subsequent oxidase&#8208;like activity that converts O2 into cytotoxic superoxide radicals to efficiently kill tumor cells. By incorporation with doxorubicin, the therapy achieves a significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vivo. Our findings show that cascade TME&#8208;specific catalytic therapy combined with chemotherapy is a promising strategy for efficient tumor therapy.

         <title>Phen&#8208;DC3 Induces Refolding of Human Telomeric DNA into a Chair&#8208;Type Antiparallel G&#8208;Quadruplex through Ligand Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phen&#8208;DC3 is one of the most widely used specific G&#8208;quadruplex ligands. This work reveals that Phen&#8208;DC3 intercalates in an antiparallel chair&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex adopted by human telomeric sequence, with the ligand positioned between two G&#8208;quartets on the one side, and a dynamic yet fully formed G&#8208;quartet capped by a T&#8208;A&#8208;A triad on the other side.







Abstract
Human telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures are attractive anticancer drug targets, but the target's polymorphism complicates the drug design: different ligands prefer different folds, and very few complexes have been solved at high resolution. Here we report that Phen&#8208;DC3, one of the most prominent G&#8208;quadruplex ligands in terms of high binding affinity and selectivity, causes dTAGGG(TTAGGG)3 to completely change its fold in KCl solution from a hybrid&#8208;1 to an antiparallel chair&#8208;type structure, wherein the ligand intercalates between a two&#8208;quartet unit and a pseudo&#8208;quartet, thereby ejecting one potassium ion. This unprecedented high&#8208;resolution NMR structure shows for the first time a true ligand intercalation into an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Aza&#8208;Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine&#8208;responsive Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene organic nanoparticles are designed to induce ferroptosis and serve as sonosensitizer. These nanoparticles promote ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic therapy, inducing cancer cell death and tumor growth suppression.







Abstract
The presence of apoptosis inhibition proteins renders the cancer cells resistant to apoptosis, severely compromising the antitumor efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Here, an intelligent anticancer nanoplatform based on an Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dye (denoted as Aza&#8208;BDY) is elaborately established for ferroptosis augmented SDT through cysteine (Cys) starvation. After endocytosis by tumor cells, Aza&#8208;BDY serves as both a ferroptosis inducing agent and a sonosensitizer for tumor treatment. The specific Cys response facilitates the disruption of redox homeostasis and initiation of cellular ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the released sonosensitizer causes efficient SDT and augments ferroptosis under ultrasound irradiation. Detailed in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Cys depletion and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation significantly induces cancer&#8208;cell death and suppresses tumor proliferation with a high inhibition rate of 97.5&#8201;%.

Meanwhile, the released sonosensitizer causes efficient SDT and augments ferroptosis under ultrasound irradiation. Detailed in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Cys depletion and singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation significantly induces cancer-cell death and suppresses tumor proliferation with a high inhibition rate of 97.5&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

First explorations of binary Ge/Sb Zintl anions indicated a situation between a &#8220;matching&#8221; one and one that tends to element segregation owing to a mismatch of atom sizes. Extraction of the ternary solid K12Ge3.5Sb6 allowed access to the so far missing P4&#8208;like anion (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722;, as well as to species that show tendencies for spatial separation of Ge and Sb atoms, &#8220;incomplete&#8221; (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; and &#8220;complete&#8221; (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;, as confirmed by DFT calculations and described by Stefanie Dehnen et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207232).

         <dc:description>
A ball&#8208;milling approach allows the efficient activation of calcium metal and thus makes the direct generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents feasible without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. By using this operationally simple method, Koji Kubota, Hajime Ito et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207118) developed a novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reaction mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles, which is typically difficult using conventional Grignard reagents.

         <title>Strong Anharmonicity&#8208;Induced Low Thermal Conductivity and High n&#8208;type Mobility in the Topological Insulator Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low lattice thermal conductivity and high electron mobility provide promising thermoelectric performance in a 3D topological insulator, Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S. The low thermal conductivity originates from the strong anharmonicity, while the high carrier mobility results from metallic suface states in the topological insulator.







Abstract
Intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) while maintaining the high carrier mobility (&#956;) is of the utmost importance for thermoelectrics. Topological insulators (TI) can possess high &#956; due to the metallic surface states. TIs with heavy constituents and layered structure can give rise to high anharmonicity and are expected to show low &#954;lat. Here, we demonstrate that Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S (BSTS), which is a 3D bulk TI, exhibits ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat of 0.46&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 along with high &#956; of &#8776;401&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Sound velocity measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that chemical bonding hierarchy and high anharmonicity play a crucial role behind such ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat. BSTS possesses low energy optical phonons which strongly couple with the heat carrying acoustic phonons leading to ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat. Further, Cl has been doped at the S site of BSTS which increases the electron concentration and reduces the &#954;lat resulting in a promising n&#8208;type thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of &#8776;0.6 at 573&#8197;K.

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Binding Sites in a Chemically Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel strategy by engineering abundant supramolecular binding sites into a chemically stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a) to achieve simultaneously high C2H2 storage and selectivity, breaking the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
Developing porous materials to overcome the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation remains a challenge. Herein, we report a stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a), featuring large cages decorated with high density of supramolecular binding sites to achieve both high C2H2 storage and selectivity. ZJU&#8208;50a exhibits one of the highest C2H2 storage capacity (192&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and concurrently high C2H2/CO2 selectivity (12) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on gas&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;50a crystal unveil that the incorporated supramolecular binding sites can selectively take up C2H2 molecule but not CO2 to result in both high C2H2 storage and selectivity. Breakthrough experiments validated its separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures, providing a high C2H2 recovery capacity of 84.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% purity. This study suggests a novel strategy of engineering supramolecular binding sites into MOFs to overcome the trade&#8208;off for this separation.

         <dc:description>Developing bioinspired camouflage materials that can adaptively change color in the visible and infrared (IR) regions is an intriguing but challenging task. Herein, we report an emerging strategy for fabricating dynamic visible and IR camouflage materials by controlled in&#8208;situ growth of novel photopolymerizable blue phase liquid crystals with cubic nanoarchitectures onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films. The resulting MXene&#8208;integrated 3D soft photonic crystals&#160;exhibit vivid structural colors and reversible switching between a bright colored state and a dark black state under a low DC electric field. As an illustration, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept pixelated devices that allow for pixel&#8208;controllable electrochromism are demonstrated. Furthermore, a free&#8208;standing electrochromic flexible film of such 3D soft photonic crystals is fabricated, where visible electrochromism and thermal camouflage are enabled by leveraging the superior electrothermal conversion and low mid&#8208;IR emissivity of MXene nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrolytically Stable Ionic Fluorogels for High&#8208;Performance Remediation of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of a library of ion exchange resins that are selective for PFAS removal from real water enabled the evaluation of structure&#8211;property relationships of the chemically stable polymer networks with high PFAS affinity. The granular Ionic Fluorogel resin is a potent PFAS remediation sorbent and demonstrated excellent performance in translationally relevant flow&#8208;through packed bed columns using natural water.







Abstract
PFAS are known bioaccumulative and persistent chemicals which pollute natural waters globally. There exists a lack of granular sorbents to efficiently remove both legacy and emerging PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations. Herein, we report a class of polymer networks with a synergistic combination of ionic and fluorous components that serve as granular materials for the removal of anionic PFAS from water. A library of Ionic Fluorogels (IFs) with systematic variation in charge density and polymer network architecture was synthesized from hydrolytically stable fluorous building blocks. The IFs were demonstrated as effective sorbents for the removal of 21 legacy and emerging PFAS from a natural water and were regenerable over multiple cycles of reuse. Comparison of one IF to a commercial ion exchange resin in mini&#8208;rapid small&#8208;scale column tests demonstrated superior performance for the removal of short&#8208;chain PFAS from natural water under operationally relevant conditions.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Metal Complexes for Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction: From Adjustment of Intrinsic Activity to Molecular Immobilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review focuses on molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) including metal bipyridines and macrocycle complexes, and summarizes the molecular engineering strategies developed to regulate the intrinsic catalytic efficiency and modify the electrode. Guidelines are provided for the rational design of ECO2RR catalytic systems.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is one promising method for storing intermittent clean energy in chemical bonds and producing fuels. Among various kinds of catalysts for ECO2RR, molecular metal complexes with well&#8208;defined structures are convenient for studies of their rational design, structure&#8211;reactivity relationships, and mechanisms. In this Review, we summarize the molecular engineering of several N&#8208;based metal complexes including Re/Mn bipyridine compounds and metal macrocycles, concluding with general modification strategies to devise novel molecular catalysts with high intrinsic activity. Through physical adsorption, covalent linking, and formation of a periodic backbone, these active molecules can be heterogenized into immobilized catalysts with more practical prospects. Finally, significant challenges and opportunities based on molecular catalysts are discussed.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Tetracyclic Pyridinium Alkaloid epi&#8208;Tetradehydrohalicyclamine&#8197;B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conquest of a polycyclic marine pyridinium alkaloid was only made possible by the remarkable chemoselectivity profile of contemporary transition metal catalysts that operate in the presence of basic sites. Ni/Ir photoredox catalysis, Mo&#8208;alkylidynes for alkyne metathesis, and an Ir&#8208;catalyzed lactam&#8208;selective hydrosilylation stand out in this regard.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of a tetracyclic marine pyridinium alkaloid hinged on recent advances in chemoselectivity management: While many classical methods failed to afford the perceptively simple pyridine&#8208;containing core of the target, nickel/iridium photoredox dual catalysis allowed the critical C&#8722;C bond to be formed in good yield. Likewise, ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) worked well in the presence of the unhindered pyridine despite the innately Lewis acidic Mo(+6) center of the alkylidyne catalyst. Finally, an iridium catalyzed hydrosilylation was uniquely effective in reducing a tertiary amide without compromising an adjacent pyridine and the lateral double bonds; this transformation is largely without precedent. The second strained macrocycle enveloping the core was closed by intramolecular N&#8208;alkylation with formation of the pyridinium unit; the reaction proceeded site&#8208; and chemoselectively in the presence of an a priori more basic tertiary amine.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials Based on Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole with an Efficient Narrowband Pure&#8208;Green Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining the multiple&#8208;resonance ability of the indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole unit with boron&#8208;nitrogen skeletons has led to compounds that show efficient green emission (CIE: 0.21, 0.71) and efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). OLEDs incorporating these multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials show a pure narrowband green emission (CIE: 0.22, 0.71) and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.2&#8201;%







Abstract
Herein, we report two multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (VTCzBN and TCz&#8208;VTCzBN) based on indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole unit and boron&#8208;nitrogen skeletons, whose emissions peaking at 496 and 521&#8197;nm with full width at half maximum of 34 and 29&#8197;nm, respectively. Meanwhile, fast rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing of above 106&#8197;s&#8722;1 are obtained due to small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps and large spin&#8208;orbital coupling values. Notably, planar molecular structures along the transition dipole moment direction endow them with high horizontal emitting dipole ratios of up to 94&#8201;%. Consequently, the corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) show the maximum external quantum efficiencies of 31.7&#8201;% and 32.2&#8201;%, respectively. Particularly, OLED with TCz&#8208;VTCzBN display ultra&#8208;pure green emission with Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinates of (0.22, 0.71), consistent with the green display standard of the National Television System Committee.

         <title>Dearomative Aminocarbonylation of Arenes via Bifunctional Coordination to Chromium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dearomative trifluoromethylative aminocarbonylation of arenes via bifunctional coordination to chromium has been firstly developed for amide construction, which expands the boundary of aminocarbonylations from conventional C=C bond substrates to arenes. Furthermore, a switchable 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of arene C&#8722;H bonds and concise synthesis of amide&#8208;type drug analogs were successfully achieved.







Abstract
Amides are ubiquitous in physical and life sciences. Given the significant abundance of arenes, dearomative aminocarbonylation of arenes would lead to a large and underexplored chemical space for amide discovery. However, such reactions are challenging due to the high degree of resonance stabilization and selectivity issues.

     alt="Dearomative Aminocarbonylation of Arenes via Bifunctional Coordination to Chromium"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dearomative trifluoromethylative aminocarbonylation of arenes via bifunctional coordination to chromium has been firstly developed for amide construction, which expands the boundary of aminocarbonylations from conventional C=C bond substrates to arenes. Furthermore, a switchable 1,2-difunctionalization of arene C&#8722;H bonds and concise synthesis of amide-type drug analogs were successfully achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amides are ubiquitous in physical and life sciences. Given the significant abundance of arenes, dearomative aminocarbonylation of arenes would lead to a large and underexplored chemical space for amide discovery. However, such reactions are challenging due to the high degree of resonance stabilization and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented dearomative trifluoromethylative aminocarbonylation of arenes via bifunctional coordination to chromium, providing a modular platform for the construction of amides possessing trifluoromethyl (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups and three-dimensional rings. Its versatility further enabled a switchable difluoromethylation or trifluoromethylation aminocarbonylation of arene C&#8722;H bonds. A possible mechanism was proposed based on control experiments. Finally, the synthetic utility was well demonstrated by diverse applications in the total synthesis of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-functionalized amide-type drugs, including praziquantel, nateglinide, maraviroc and alloyohimbane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Growth of Branched Organic Crystals: Recent Advances and Future Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dimensional hierarchical organic crystals with branched architectures are suitable fundamental building blocks in integrated photonic devices because of their inherent multichannel characteristics for the efficient generation and processing of optical signals. This Review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis and photonic applications of organic branched crystals as well as the challenges and prospects for their future development.







Abstract
The rapid development of information technology has resulted in a growing demand for low&#8208;dimensional photonic materials. Organic semiconductor materials play an important role in various photonic devices due to their adjustable physicochemical properties, while individual organic crystals do not exhibit the desired performance due to the limitations of their simple structure. Branched organic crystals with inherent multichannel characteristics based on &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are favorable components in optoelectronics. However, the preparation of branched organic crystals still faces great challenges before they can be applied in integrated optoelectronic devices. In this Review, the development and representative examples of branched organic crystals in terms of molecular design, synthesis, and advanced applications are discussed. We also provide a summary and outlook for the direction of future research on branched organic crystals as excellent candidates in photonic integrated circuits.

         <title>Less is More: A Shortcut for Anionocages Design Based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;Monourea Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergent hydrogen bonding motif of phosphotyrosine residues of proteins has inspired an advanced strategy for the design of a new type of anionocage based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;monourea coordination, which features more simple synthesis and more potential of functionalization than the former strategy based on (PO43&#8722;)&#8208;bisurea coordination, providing a proof of the design concept &#8220;Less is More&#8221;.







Abstract
Anionocages have been developed as a unique family of hydrogen bonded cages. However, strategies for constructing anionocages are mainly limited to that based on (PO43&#8722;)&#8208;bisurea coordination, neither the ligands nor the anions lack the simplicity and diversity of the maturely developed analogues based on metal coordination (i.e. metallocage). We report herein a more simple strategy for anionocages design based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;monourea coordination, utilizing monourea rather than bisurea as the hydrogen binding donor, and RPO32&#8722; rather than PO43&#8722; as the acceptor. Two fluorescent, quadruple helicate anionocages were constructed by a bis&#8208;monourea ligand, and dianions PhOPO32&#8722; (H1) or HOPO32&#8722; (H1A), respectively, which were capable of encapsulating a series of cation guests. As revealed by molecular modeling, H1 features remarkable guest&#8208;adaptive cavity breathing without change of the quadruple helicate topology, which allowed the encapsulation of different sized guests in an &#8220;induced fit&#8221; manner.

         <title>Molecular Doping of Flexible Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite&#8208;Polymer Thick Membranes for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular doping improves the conductivity of flexible lead&#8208;free MA3Bi2I9 perovskite membranes by four times. Flexible X&#8208;ray detector achieves a high sensitivity of 2065&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.71&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, a high mechanical robustness, which demonstrate potential in next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray detectors have broad applications in medicine and industry. Although flexible lead&#8208;free perovskite films are competitive because of their lightweight and low toxicity, they are less efficient due to low charge transport. Herein, we report low&#8208;toxicity, flexible X&#8208;ray detectors based on p&#8208;type doped MA3Bi2I9 (MA=methylammonium) perovskite&#8208;filled membranes (PFMs). Strong coordination between dopant 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4&#8208;TCNQ) and MA3Bi2I9 and the establishment of charge&#8208;transfer complex (CPX) improved the conductivity by four times. The flexible X&#8208;ray detector achieved a high sensitivity of 2065&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.71&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is among the highest values in all environmentally friendly flexible X&#8208;ray detectors. Importantly, the PFMs retained excellent charge transport under mechanical stress. All of those make flexible MA3Bi2I9 membranes more competitive as next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection.

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Donor&#8208;Acceptor Strategy Enables Fast Spin&#8208;Flip of Multiple Resonance Emitters for Suppressing Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;space&#8208;confined donor&#8208;acceptor (SCDA)&#8221; strategy is presented to boost the kRISC of multiple resonance emitters to &#8764;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, which enables to assemble high&#8208;performance OLEDs with a high EQEmax of 32.5&#8201;% and an alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 22.9&#8201;%).







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance boron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have experienced great success in assembling narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of MR&#8208;emitters (103&#8211;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) that will lead to severe device efficiency roll&#8208;off has received extensive attention and remains a challenging issue. Herein, we put forward a &#8220;space&#8208;confined donor&#8208;acceptor (SCDA)&#8221; strategy to accelerate RISC process. The introduction of SCDA units onto the MR&#8208;skeleton induces intermediate triplet states, which leads to a multichannel RISC process and thus increases kRISC. As illustrated examples, efficient MR&#8208;emitters have been developed with a sub&#8208;microsecond delayed lifetime and a high kRISC of 2.13&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, which enables to assemble high&#8208;performance OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) as high as 32.5&#8201;% and an alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 22.9&#8201;%).

&lt;p&gt;Multi-resonance boron-nitrogen-containing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters have experienced great success in assembling narrowband organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing rate (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt;) of MR-emitters (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) that will lead to severe device efficiency roll-off has received extensive attention and remains a challenging issue. Herein, we put forward a &#8220;space-confined donor-acceptor (SCDA)&#8221; strategy to accelerate RISC process. The introduction of SCDA units onto the MR-skeleton induces intermediate triplet states, which leads to a multichannel RISC process and thus increases &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt;. As illustrated examples, efficient MR-emitters have been developed with a sub-microsecond delayed lifetime and a high &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.13&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which enables to assemble high-performance OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) as high as 32.5&#8201;% and an alleviated efficiency roll-off (EQE&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt;: 22.9&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential Passivation for Lead&#8208;Free Tin Perovskite Solar Cells with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells (PKSCs) have attracted tremendous interest as a replacement for toxic lead&#8208;based PKSCs. Nevertheless, the efficiency is significantly low due to the rough surface morphology and high number of defects, which are caused by fast crystallization and easy oxidization. In this study, a facile and universal posttreatment strategy of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) is proposed. The results show that ACAC can reduce the trap density and enlarge the grain size (short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) enhancement), while EDA can bond the undercoordinated tin and regulate the energy level (open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) enhancement). A promising 13% efficiency is achieved with better stability. In addition, other combinations of diketones or aminues are selected, with similar effects. This study provides a universal strategy to enhance the crrstalinity and passivate defects while fabricating stable PKSCs with high efficiency.</dc:description>

Grafting N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on porous materials to realize high activity and recyclability is challenge. Yuan&#8208;Biao Huang, Rong Cao and co&#8208;workers develop a facile method in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207478) to utilize NHCs sites generated in situ from CO2&#8208;masked precursors that anchored on a covalent organic framework (COF) for sustainable catalytic CO2 conversion. The NHC&#8208;CO2 moieties can be transformed into NHC sites by heating in catalytic process, in which the CO2 likes as a mask to protect NHC sites and reversibly form NHC&#8208;CO2 after catalysis.

This rare instance of quartet&#8208;doublet emission, studied here in solid argon, is presumably promoted by efficient intersystem crossing from the originally photoexcited doublet (B  2  &#931;  +  ) to the adjacent second quartet state, 1  4  &#916;. Vibronic progressions were traced for the a  4  &#931;  +  &#8208;X  2  &#931;  +  and a  4  &#931;  +  &#8208;A  2  &#1055;  i  systems from their origins up to (v&#8217;=0)&#8594;(v&#8221;=5) and (v&#8217;=0)&#8594;(v&#8221;=2) bands, respectively.

         <title>Super Light&#8208;Sensitive Photosensitizer Nanoparticles for Improved Photodynamic Therapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective method for superficial cancer treatment. However, the limited light intensity in tissues, tumor hypoxia, and the low accumulation efficiency of photosensitizers (PSs) in tumors are still major challenges. Herein, we introduce super light&#8208;sensitive PS nanoparticles (designated HR NPs) that can increase singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) production and improve PS accumulation in tumors. HR NPs have the ability to produce a large amount of  1  O  2  under ultralow power density light (0.05 mW cm  &#8208;2  ) irradiation. More significantly, HR NPs have a long circulating time in tumor&#8208;bearing mice and can accumulate in tumors with high efficiency. When irradiated by light with a suitable wavelength, the nanoparticles exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy. This work will make it possible to cure solid tumors by PDT by enhancing the therapeutic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Treatment of Conjugated Protonated Polyanilines for High&#8208;performance Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The overall performance of dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is strongly linked to anions storage properties of cathodes. Whereas high energy/power densities and stabilities for DIBs are limited by cathodes. To overcome these barriers, we have designed a novel fluoridized&#8208;polyaniline&#8208;H+/carbon nanotubes (FPHC) as cathode for high&#8208;efficiency PF6&#8208;  storage. F&#8208;  in PF6&#8208;  is easy to form covalent bond with H on &#8208;NH&#8208; in FPHC, so that PF6&#8208;  can stably coordinate with FPHC, showing a symmetrical structure. FPHC cathode shows a highly reversible capacity of 73 mAh g&#8208;1  at 2 A g&#8208;1  after 2000 cycles, which provides a solid base for the advanced sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) (310 Wh kg&#8208;1/7720 W kg&#8208;1). Besides, the relative pouch&#8208;type SDIB can drive a vacuum cleaner model with an electric machine. This work may shed light on an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming strategy of robust cathodes for SDIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Perovskite Vertical Growth for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defects at the interfaces of perovskite (PVK) thin films are the main factors responsible for instability and low photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVK solar cells (PSCs). Here, a SnO2&#8208;MXene composite electron transport layer (ETL) is used in PSCs to improve interfacial contact and passivate defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface. The introduced MXene regulates SnO2 dispersion and induces a vertical growth of PVK. The lattice matching of MXene and perovskite suppresses the concentration of interfacial stress, thereby obtaining a perovskite film with low defects. Compared with SnO2&#8208;based device, the PCE of SnO2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based device is improved by 15% and its short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, unencapsulated device maintained about 90% of its initial efficiency even after 500 h of storage at 30&#8211;40% relative humidity in ambient air. The composite ETL strategy provides a route to engineer interfacial passivation between metal halide perovskites and ETLs.</dc:description>

Furthermore, unencapsulated device maintained about 90% of its initial efficiency even after 500 h of storage at 30&#8211;40% relative humidity in ambient air. The composite ETL strategy provides a route to engineer interfacial passivation between metal halide perovskites and ETLs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries via a Semi&#8208;Conductive Bipolar&#8208;Type Polymer Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries have received considerable attention owing to their green, low&#8208;cost and high safe nature. Unfortunately, organic materials generally exhibit insulator nature (~10  &#8208;10  S cm  &#8208;1  ), and most of reported promising performances of Zn&#8208;organic batteries are achieved with a low mass&#8208;loading (~2 mg cm  &#8208;2  ) in cathode, which is far away from practical application (10 mg cm  &#8208;2  ). Herein, we demonstrate a semi&#8208;conductive polymer poly(1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) cathode material for Zn batteries, which shows a moderate electronic conductivity (5.9 &#215; 10  &#8208;5  S cm  &#8208;1  ). Theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ analysis reveal that the cathode involves a bipolar&#8208;type charge storage mechanism. Accordingly, the Zn//PDAN cell exhibits a promising capacity (140 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8208;1  ) and a remarkable cycle stability (1000 cycles without capacity fading) at a high mass&#8208;loading (10 mg cm  &#8208;2  ). These encouraging results shed light on the design of advanced organic electrode.</dc:description>

Unfortunately, organic materials generally exhibit insulator nature (~10  -10  S cm  -1  ), and most of reported promising performances of Zn-organic batteries are achieved with a low mass-loading (~2 mg cm  -2  ) in cathode, which is far away from practical application (10 mg cm  -2  ). Herein, we demonstrate a semi-conductive polymer poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) cathode material for Zn batteries, which shows a moderate electronic conductivity (5.9 &#215; 10  -5  S cm  -1  ). Theoretical calculations and in-situ/ex-situ analysis reveal that the cathode involves a bipolar-type charge storage mechanism.

         <title>Moisture Accelerated Precursor Crystallization in Ambient Air for High&#8208;performance Perovskite Solar Cells toward Mass Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase&#8208;pure crystallized perovskite is considered as an excellent precursor for fabricating perovskite films with minimized defects and boosted stability. However, currently available protocols for synthesizing crystallized perovskite must be conducted in an inert atmosphere or with the presence of organic solvent as the reaction medium, which is adverse to mass production. Here, we report a fast synthesis of &#945;&#8208;phase crystallized perovskite powder assisted with moisture in ambient air. The moisture can promote the reaction between PbI  2  and organic salts and facilitate a complete phase transition as demonstrated by a joint experimental and theoretical study. Perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 24.07% can be achieved by using the phase&#8208;pure crystallized perovskite powder as the precursor. Notably, the &#945;&#8208;phase perovskite enables the precursor solution and the final device with enhanced stability toward long&#8208;term aging. This ambient&#8208;air&#8208;compatible method provides an effective avenue to produce high&#8208;quality precursor for photovoltaic application in a large&#8208;scale and reproducible manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Metal&#8208;Free Cyclopropanation and Aziridination of Alkenes with XH2 (X=N, C) by Thianthrenation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a general and practical protocol to aziridines and cyclopropanes using free XH2 (X=C or N) with alkenes by thianthrenation is presented under mild conditions. Free sulfonamides, amides, carbamates, amines, and acidic methylene with protons, are good precursors for three&#8208;membered ring formation, providing an attractive alternative for straightforward synthesis of aziridines and cyclopropanes from easily available starting materials.







Abstract
Three&#8208;membered cyclic structures are widely existing in natural products and serve as enabling intermediates in organic synthesis. However, the efficient and straightforward access to such structures with diversity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a general and practical protocol to aziridines and cyclopropanes synthesis using free XH2 (X=C or N) with alkenes by thianthrenation is presented. This metal&#8208;free protocol features the direct aziridination and cyclopropanation with unprotected XH2. Free sulfonamides, amides, carbamates, amines, and methylene with acidic protons, are good precursors, providing an attractive alternative for straightforward synthesis of aziridines and cyclopropanes from easily available starting materials.

         <title>Mechanistic Origin of Favorable Substituent Effects in Excellent Cu Cyclam Based HNO Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HNO has broad chemical and biomedical properties. Metal complexes and derivatives&#160;are widely used to make excellent HNO sensors. However, their favorable mechanistic origins are largely unknown. Cu cyclam is a useful platform to make excellent HNO sensors including imaging agents. A quantum chemical study of Cu cyclams with various substitutions was performed, which reproduced&#160;diverse&#160;experimental reactivities. Structural, electronic, and energetic profiles along reaction pathways show the importance of HNO binding and a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism for HNO reaction. Results reveal that steric effect is primary and electronic factor is secondary (if the redox potential is sufficient), but their interwoven effects can lead to unexpected reactivity, which looks mysterious experimentally but can be explained computationally. This work suggests rational substituent design ideas and recommends a theoretical study of a new design to save time and cost due to its subtle effect.</dc:description>

         <title>A Porphyrin&#8208;Based Organic Network Comprising Sustainable Carbon Dots for Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alder&#8208;Longo reaction between aldehyde groups of CDs based on furfuraldehyde (F&#8208;CDs) and dipyrrolo methane results in porphyrin patterns connecting the F&#8208;CDs. This gives a light&#8208;sensitive organic network. This can initiate photopolymerization following a photo&#8208;ATRP protocol upon 405 LED excitation. End&#8208;group fidelity was shown by block polymerization where CuBr2/TPMA, FeBr3/Br&#8722;, and a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst resulted in formation of polymer.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots (CDs) based on furfuraldehyde (F&#8208;CD) resulted in a photosensitive material after pursuing the Alder&#8208;Longo reaction. The porphyrin moiety formed connects the F&#8208;CDs in a covalent organic network. This heterogeneous material (P&#8208;CD) was characterized by XPS indicating incorporation of the respective C, N and O moieties. Time resolved fluorescence including global analysis showed contribution of three linked components to the overall dynamics of the excited state. Electrochemical and photonic properties of this heterogeneous material facilitated photopolymerization in a photo&#8208;ATRP setup where either CuBr2/TPMA, FeBr3/Br&#8722; or a metal free reaction setup activated controlled polymerization. Chain extension experiments worked in all three cases showing end group fidelity for activation of controlled block copolymerization using MMA and styrene as monomers. Traditional radical polymerization using a diaryl iodonium salt as co&#8208;initiator failed.

         <title>Next Generation Opto&#8208;Jasplakinolides Enable Local Remodeling of Actin Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural product jasplakinolide is widely used to stabilize F&#8208;actin. Based on extensive structure&#8208;activity relationship studies, we have developed a new generation of photoswitchable jasplakinolides that feature rationally designed red&#8208;shifted azobenzene photoswitches.

Short, local irradiation with blue light resulted in highly localized and reversible actin aggregation with subcellular precision.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sixteen oligosaccharides resembling the capsular polysaccharide of A. baumannii 17978 are the basis for serum and antibody screening to identify a vaccine lead.







Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is a opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for serious nosocomial infections that is becoming increasingly resistant against antibiotics. Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) that cover A. baumannii are a major virulence factor that play an important role in pathogenesis, are used to assign serotypes and provide the basis for vaccine development. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of A. baumannii 17978 were printed onto microarray slides and used to screen sera from patients infected with A. baumannii as well as a monoclonal mouse antibody (mAb C8). A synthetic oligosaccharide emerged from glycan array screening as lead for the development of a vaccine against A. baumannii 17978. Tetrasaccharide 20 is a key epitope for recognition by an antibody and is a vaccine lead.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Multiple C(sp2)&#8722;H Insertions of Malonate Metal Carbenes for Late&#8208;Stage Functionalizations of Azahelicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral quinacridines react chemo&#8208; and regioselectively with &#945;&#8208;diazomalonates under RuII/RhII catalysis, up to four times, achieving a stepwise late&#8208;stage multi&#8208;functionalization of the [4]helicene scaffold. Absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging are readily tuned. Density&#8208;functional theory elucidates the carbene insertion selectivity and clarifies the importance of conformations in the optical response.







Abstract
Chiral quinacridines react up to four times, step&#8208;by&#8208;step, with &#945;&#8208;diazomalonates under RuII and RhII catalysis. By selecting the catalyst, [CpRu(CH3CN)3][PF6] (Cp=cyclopentadienyl) or Rh2(oct)4, chemo and regioselective insertions of derived metal carbenes are achieved in favor of mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;functionalized malonate derivatives, respectively, (r.r.&gt;49&#8201;:&#8201;1, up to 77&#8201;% yield, 12 examples). This multi&#8208;introduction of malonate groups is particularly useful to tune optical and chemical properties such as absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging. Density&#8208;functional theory further elucidates the origin of the carbene insertion selectivity and also showcases the importance of conformations in the optical response.

         <title>Open&#8208;Bandgap Graphene&#8208;Based Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Using Oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) Interfacial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amine&#8208;functionalized oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) (OPE) was introduced as an interface on wafer&#8208;scale graphene in the form of self&#8208;assembled monolayers through anion&#8208;based reaction. The band gap was opened by electron transfer from OPE to graphene via covalent bonding. This property offers high efficiency for graphene&#8208;based transistor applications.







Abstract
Organic interfacial compounds (OICs) are required as linkers for the highly stable and efficient immobilization of bioprobes in nanobiosensors using 2D nanomaterials such as graphene. Herein, we first demonstrated the fabrication of a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) via a microelectromechanical system process after covalent functionalization on large&#8208;scale graphene by introducing oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene)amine (OPE). OPE was compared to various OICs by density functional theory simulations and was confirmed to have a higher binding energy with graphene and a lower band gap than other OICs. OPE can improve the immobilization efficiency of a bioprobe by forming a self&#8208;assembly monolayer via anion&#8208;based reaction. Using this technology, Magainin I&#8208;conjugated OGMFET (MOGMFET) showed a high sensitivity, high selectivity, with a limit of detection of 100&#8197;cfu&#8201;mL&#8722;1. These results indicate that the OPE OIC can be applied for stable and comfortable interfacing technology for biosensor fabrication.

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Salt for Ultrarapid Adsorption/Desorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting by Dual Hydrogen Bond System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we explored the application of crystalline porous organic salts (CPOSs) in atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) for the first time and synthesized a novel CPOS (CPOS&#8208;6), which showed excellent AWH performance attributed to its unique dual hydrogen bond system.







Abstract
In recent years, the porous sorbent&#8208;assisted atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) method has emerged as an effective approach for solving water crises without geographical restrictions. However, there is a limited array of porous adsorbent materials that can be used for AWH, which are inadequate to meet the needs under different climatic conditions. In light of this, herein, we synthesize a new crystalline porous organic salt (CPOS; denoted as CPOS&#8208;6) possessing a dual hydrogen bond system and verify its applicability toward AWH for the first time. Unlike other reported CPOSs, CPOS&#8208;6 displays an S&#8208;shaped water sorption isotherm owing to the presence of the dual hydrogen bond system. Under simulated drought conditions in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, CPOS&#8208;6 exhibits long&#8208;term water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycling stability, low water desorption temperature, and ultrarapid adsorption&#8208;desorption kinetics. The results confirm that CPOS&#8208;6 is an effective sorbent material for AWH.

         <title>Physical and Chemical Cues at the Nano&#8211;Bio Interface for Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunomodulation has made tremendous progress in fighting diseases. In the past decade, it was demonstrated that nanomaterials can directly induce immunomodulation. To summarize this emerging research field, we systematically discuss a series of physical and chemical cues at the nano&#8211;bio interface in order to better understand nanomaterials&#8208;regulated immunosignaling pathways as well as the outcomes in disease control and treatment.







Abstract
Immunomodulation has made remarkable progress in fighting infectious disease and cancer. Conventionally, immunomodulation largely relies on chemical/biochemical agents, which, unfortunately, suffer from sever off&#8208;target adverse effects. Recent insights into nano&#8211;bio interactions suggest that nanomaterials can directly participate in immunomodulation. A range of physical and chemical cues at the nano&#8211;bio interface have been harnessed to regulate diverse immuno&#8208;signaling for disease control and treatment. In this Minireview, we summarize recent studies on the physical and chemical cues enabled by intrinsic nanomaterials to trigger immunological signaling. First, we discuss physical cues mediated by surface topography, hydrophobicity, charge, and heat at the nano&#8211;bio interface for immunomodulation.

&lt;p&gt;Immunomodulation has made tremendous progress in fighting diseases. In the past decade, it was demonstrated that nanomaterials can directly induce immunomodulation. To summarize this emerging research field, we systematically discuss a series of physical and chemical cues at the nano&#8211;bio interface in order to better understand nanomaterials-regulated immunosignaling pathways as well as the outcomes in disease control and treatment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunomodulation has made remarkable progress in fighting infectious disease and cancer. Conventionally, immunomodulation largely relies on chemical/biochemical agents, which, unfortunately, suffer from sever off-target adverse effects. Recent insights into nano&#8211;bio interactions suggest that nanomaterials can directly participate in immunomodulation. A range of physical and chemical cues at the nano&#8211;bio interface have been harnessed to regulate diverse immuno-signaling for disease control and treatment. In this Minireview, we summarize recent studies on the physical and chemical cues enabled by intrinsic nanomaterials to trigger immunological signaling. First, we discuss physical cues mediated by surface topography, hydrophobicity, charge, and heat at the nano&#8211;bio interface for immunomodulation. Then, various nanomaterials enabled chemical cues, such as metal species and oxidative species are outlined. Finally, our perspectives on challenges and possible future directions are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dehydrogenation of Ammonia Borane by Platinum&#8208;Nickel Dimers: Regulation of Heteroatom Interspace Boosts Bifunctional Synergetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt1Ni1/C3N4 dimeric catalyst exhibits a much higher activity than Pt1/C3N4 in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane for hydrogen generation. A bifunctional synergy is revealed in which the bridging OH in Pt1Ni1 oxo dimers promotes H2O dissociation, while Pt1 facilitates the cleavage of the B&#8722;H bond, thus cooperatively accelerating hydrogen production.







Abstract
Regulation of the atom&#8208;atom interspaces of dual&#8208;atom catalysts is essential to optimize the dual&#8208;atom synergy to achieve high activity but remains challenging. Herein, we report an effective strategy to regulate the Pt1&#8208;Ni1 interspace to achieve Pt1Ni1 dimers and Pt1+Ni1 heteronuclear dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts (HDSACs) by tailoring steric hindrance between metal precursors during synthesis. Spectroscopic characterization reveals obvious electron transfers in Pt1Ni1 oxo dimers but not in Pt1+Ni1 HDSAC. In the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB), the H2 formation rates show an inverse proportion to the Pt1&#8208;Ni1 interspace. The rate of Pt1Ni1 dimers is &#8776;13 and 2&#8197;times higher than those of Pt1 and Pt1+Ni1 HDSAC, manifesting the interspace&#8208;dependent synergy. Theoretical calculations reveal that the bridging OH group in Pt1Ni1 dimers promotes water dissociation, while Pt1 facilitates the cleavage of B&#8722;H bonds in AB, which boosts a bifunctional synergy to accelerate H2 production cooperatively.

         <title>Fluorinated Copolypeptide&#8208;Stabilized Microbubbles with Maleimide&#8208;Decorated Surfaces as Long&#8208;Term Ultrasound Contrast Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic fluorinated copolypeptides are used to stabilize perfluorocarbon&#8208;filled microbubbles (MBs) with the formation of highly stable ultrasound (US) contrast agents. Moreover, the US signals can be remarkably enhanced by the in situ reaction of peripheral maleimide moieties with plasma proteins without compromising the stability of MBs, outperforming commercially available SonoVueTM MBs in in vivo US imaging applications.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;filled microbubbles (MBs) have been clinically used as ultrasound (US) contrast agents for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, it remains a great challenge to resolve the dilemma of stability and contrast enhancement of MBs. Herein, amphiphilic copolypeptides bearing fluorinated blocks are synthesized to stabilize perfluorocarbon (PFC)&#8208;filled MBs, exhibiting unique stability under both long&#8208;term storage and US imaging conditions. The fluorinated inner layer reduces the internal Laplace pressure and greatly improves the stability of MBs, which can be further reinforced by crosslinking of the dipropargyl&#8208;containing middle blocks. To overcome the suppressed nonlinear oscillation of polymer shells, maleimide groups are introduced onto the surface of MBs, enabling in situ reaction with plasma proteins to enhance second harmonic signals without compromising the stability of MBs, conferring better US imaging performance than that of SonoVueTM MBs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated and Robust Superhydrophobic Modification on Covalent Organic Framework for Crude&#8208;Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schiff base condensation and 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions are used to develop and decorate a new covalent organic framework (COF) to associate superhydrophobicity, that performs at severe settings. The embedded superhydrophobicity was used for cleaning oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions, irrespective of nature of selected oils and used surfactants.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) having high specific surface area, tunable pore size and high crystallinity are mostly post modified following fluorine&#8208;based and complex synthetic approaches to achieve a bio&#8208;inspired liquid wettability, i.e. superhydrophobicity. Herein, a facile, non&#8208;fluorinated and robust chemical approach is introduced for tailoring the water wettability of a new COF&#8212;which was prepared through Schiff&#8208;base condensation reaction. A silane precursor was readily reacted with selected alkyl acrylates through 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reaction, prior to grafting on the prepared C4&#8208;COF for tailoring different water wettability&#8212;including robust superhydrophobicity. The superhydrophobic C4&#8208;COF (SH&#8208;C4&#8208;COF) that displayed significantly enhanced (&gt;5&#8197;times; from 220&#8197;wt.&#8201;% to 1156&#8197;wt.&#8201;%) oil&#8208;absorption capacity, was extended to address the relevant challenges of &#8220;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; emulsion separation, rapidly (&lt;1&#8197;minute) and repetitively (50&#8197;times) at diverse and harsh conditions.

         <title>Integrating Light&#8208;Harvesting Ruthenium(II)&#8208;based Units into Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional metal covalent organic frameworks (3D MCOFs) with stp topology were constructed by integrating ruthenium(II)&#8208;based units in the skeleton, which exhibited superior chemical stability, strong light&#8208;harvesting ability and excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (20&#8201;308&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
Three metal covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), namely RuCOF&#8208;ETTA, RuCOF&#8208;TPB and RuCOF&#8208;ETTBA, were synthesized by incorporating the photosensitive RuII tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) unit into the skeleton. Interestingly, each RuCOF contains three isostructural covalent organic frameworks that interlock together with the RuII centers serving as point of registry. The covalently linked network coupling with uniformly distributed RuII units allowed the RuCOFs to exhibit superior chemical stability, strong light&#8208;harvesting ability, and high photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution (20&#8201;308&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). This work illustrates the potential of developing versatile MCOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts from functionalized metal complex building unit and further enriches the MCOFs family.

         <title>Missing&#8208;linker Defects in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The defect engineering strategy is developed for the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of facilitated transport covalent organic framework membranes with missing&#8208;linker defects for efficient CO2 separation.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with tunable ordered channels and free organic groups hold great promise in molecular separations owing to the synergy of physical and chemical microenvironments. Herein, we develop a defect engineering strategy to fabricate COF membranes for efficient CO2 separation. Abundant amino groups are in situ generated on the COF nanosheets arising from the missing&#8208;linker defects during the reactive assembly of amine monomer and mixed aldehyde monomers. The COF nanosheets are assembled to fabricate COF membranes. Amino groups, as the CO2 facilitated transport carriers, along with ordered channels endow COF membrane with high CO2 permeances exceeding 300&#8197;GPU and excellent separation selectivity of 80 for CO2/N2, and 54 for CO2/CH4 mixed gas under humidified state. Our defect engineering strategy offers a facile approach to generating free organic functional groups in COF membranes and other organic framework membranes for diverse chemical separations.

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of Methyl Esters and CO in Lignin Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complete utilization of lignin: the methoxy groups in lignin react with carboxylic acids to generate methyl carboxylates (applied to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals), and the remaining carbon atoms of lignin react with oxygen to form CO predominantly, which may be used directly in carbonylation reactions.







Abstract
Lignin is an abundant renewable carbon source. Due to its complex structure, utilization of lignin is very challenging. Herein, we describe an efficient strategy for the simultaneous utilization of lignin, in which the methoxy groups in lignin react with carboxylic acids to generate methyl carboxylates and the other alkyl and phenyl carbons react with oxygen to predominantly form CO that can be used directly in carbonylation reactions. The method was applied to the methylation of various functionalized aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids, including natural compounds, to produce valuable chemicals, including pharmaceuticals. No solid or liquid residues remain after the reaction. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that a well&#8208;ordered C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bond activation sequence takes place to realize total transformation of lignin. This work opens a way for transformation of the entire lignin polymer into valuable products, exemplified by the synthesis of the pharmaceutical, Ramipril, on a gram scale.

         <title>Mild and Chemoselective Carboxylic Acid Reduction Promoted by Borane Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although considerable advances have been made in developing chemoselective transformations of ubiquitous carboxylic acid groups, many challenges still exist. For instance, their selective reduction is problematic if both more nucleophilic and more electrophilic groups are present in the starting material. Here, we address this problem with a simple and mild protocol using bench&#8208;stable reagents at ambient temperatures. This platform is able to tolerate a diverse range of functionality, leaving ketones, esters, nitro&#8208;groups, olefins, nitriles and amides untouched. A combination of experimental and computational mechanistic experiments demonstrate that this reaction proceeds  via  hidden borane catalysis with small quantities of  in situ  generated BH  3  playing a key role in the exquisite selectivity that is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Making Polyisoprene Self&#8208;Healable through Microstructure Regulation by Rare&#8208;Earth Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of self&#8208;healing polymers from commodity olefins is of great interest and importance but has remained a challenge to date. We report here for the first time the synthesis of self&#8208;healing polymers by catalyst&#8208;controlled polymerization of a simple commodity diene, isoprene. We found that polyisoprenes having an appropriate mixture (ca. 70/30) of 3,4&#8208; and cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;microstructures synthesized by using a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst could act as excellent self&#8208;healing elastomers without any external intervention. The unprecedented self&#8208;healability could be ascribed to nanoscale heterogeneities formed by microphase separation of the relatively hard 3,4&#8208;segments from a flexible cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;segment matrix. The hydrogenated polyisoprenes (without C=C bonds) with the analogous microstructures also exhibited excellent mechanical and self&#8208;healing properties, further demonstrating that even simple polyolefins can be made self&#8208;healable if the microstructures are appropriately regulated.</dc:description>

Abstract
Metal&#8208;based compounds have been widely used for biomedical applications. Their unique characteristics make them attractive for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. However, numerous issues including toxicity, poor aqueous solubility, and unfavorable biodistribution hamper their widespread use. To overcome these drawbacks, the concept of metal&#8208;based prodrugs emerged. This field is particularly developed for applications in oncology. More precisely, tumor&#8208;associated stimuli (e.g., pH variation, redox activity, enzyme overexpression, etc.) have been exploited to trigger the selective delivery of active metal&#8208;based drugs to the tumor site. The main advances in this area are discussed in this Review.

         <title>Synergistic Manipulation of Hydrogen Evolution and Zinc Ion Flux in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous Zn&#8208;COF@Zn anodes have been fabricated to synergistically manipulate the H2 evolution and Zn2+ flux, during which the closely related H2 qualification/inhibition and Zn dendrite&#8208;growth in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries have been studied.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries have attracted much attention because of their high theoretical&#8208;capacity, safety, and low&#8208;cost, yet the H2&#8208;evolution, qualification or inhibition mechanism investigations that are closely related to the dendrite&#8208;growth are rare and challenging. Herein, a series of zincophilic metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (e.g., Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF, Zn&#8208;DAAQ&#8208;COF, and Zn&#8208;DAA&#8208;COF) have been explored as model&#8208;platforms to manipulate the H2&#8208;evolution and Zn2+ flux. Best of them, Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF based cell only produces 0.002&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;H2, which is &gt;2 orders of magnitude lower than bare Zn. Noteworthy, it affords high stability for 3000&#8197;cycles (overpotential, &lt;79.1&#8197;mV) at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric&#8208;cell and enhanced cycling&#8208;stability up to 6000&#8197;cycles at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the assembled full&#8208;battery. Besides, mechanistic characterizations show that Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF can enhance the energy&#8208;barrier of H2&#8208;evolution and homogenize the ion&#8208;distribution or electric&#8208;filed to achieve high performance.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Triggered Mechanical Actuation in Polymer Composite Films Based on Crystalline Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of smart materials, which can efficiently mimic biological systems through the introduction of soft components, is of great importance in the emerging fields of sensors and actuators. However, fabricating soft and stimuli responsive materials with a defined mechanism to tune and precisely control the triggered response has been considerably challenging. Herein, a smart composite film that can mechanically respond to vapors trigger then readily restores its original shape upon the removal of the stimuli is reported. This actuating composite film was prepared by mixing the highly elastic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (  PVDF  ) polymer with the flexible and crystalline organic cages (  Oba&#8208;cage  ) at variable concentrations. The mechanism of the mechanical response could be accurately recorded due to the ordered cage crystals. Interestingly, 50 wt% of the  Oba&#8208;cage  in the polymer matrix (i. e. 1:1 weight ratio) shows a very fast and reversible vapor triggered stretching and bending in less than 2 seconds. The adsorption and desorption of the organic vapors (tetrahydropyran, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and ethyl acetate) by the  Oba&#8208;cage_50@PVDF  film can be repeated many times with no noticeable loss in performance. This work highlights the importance of designing smart materials at the molecular level to precisely control the response or reaction upon the introduction of different triggers, which can ultimately lead to a monumental leap in the field of soft robotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Dynamic Polymer Networks Enabled by Woven Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crosslinking plays a crucial role in determining mechanical properties of polymer materials. Although various crosslinks based on covalent or noncovalent bonds have been adopted, it remains an enormous challenge to develop a crosslink which could endow corresponding polymer network with robust yet dynamic properties. Herein, we report a crosslink simultaneously having dynamic property and woven geometry, and the polymer network with woven crosslinks (WPN) could integrate the merits of covalent polymer network (CPN) and supramolecular polymer network (SPN). In specific, the WPN not only exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue property to those of CPN, but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity and ductility, similar to those of SPN. Particularly, its toughness and puncture resistance are much superior to those of the others. Besides, the dynamicity of woven crosslink also imparts good performances of self&#8208;healing and processability to WPN.</dc:description>

         <title>Sactipeptide Engineering by Probing the Substrate Tolerance of a&#160;Thioether&#8208;Bond&#8208;Forming Sactisynthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sactipeptides are ribosomally synthesized peptides containing a unique sulfur to &#945;&#8208;carbon crosslink. Catalyzed by sactisynthases,&#160;this thioether pattern endows sactipeptides with enhanced structural, thermal, and proteolytic stability, which makes them attractive scaffolds&#160;for the development of novel biotherapeutics. Herein, we report the in&#8208;depth study on the substrate tolerance of the sactisynthase AlbA to&#160;catalyze the formation of thioether bridges in sactipeptides. We identified a possible modification site within the sactipeptide subtilosin A allowing&#160;for peptide engineering without compromising formation of thioether bridges. A panel of natural and hybrid sactipeptides was produced to study&#160;the AlbA&#8208;mediated formation of thioether bridges, which were identified mass&#8208;spectrometrically. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we re&#8208;engineered&#160;subtilosin A to a thioether&#8208;bridged, specific streptavidin targeting peptide, opening the door for the functional engineering of sactipeptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;responsive Tubular Conjugated Polymer 2D Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creation of new 2D architectures has attracted significant attention in the field of self&#8208;assembly for structural diversity and new functionalization. Although numerous 2D polymer nanosheets have been reported, 2D nanosheets with tubular channels have been unexplored. Herein, we describe a new strategy for the fabrication of stimulus&#8208;responsive conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with hollow cavities. Amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes self&#8208;assembled in an aqueous solution in a columnar manner to afford bilayered 2D nanosheets with intrinsically tubular nanochannels. UV&#8208;induced polymerization resulted in the generation of blue&#8208;colored tubular conjugated polydiacetylene 2D nanosheets. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling with FRET phenomenon and colorimetric DNA sensing were demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets. In addition, the free NH  2  containing polymerized 2D nanosheet was utilized for conductivity behavior and grafting on graphene oxide (GO)</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Separation of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1 upon Specific RNA&#8208;Binding Observed by Magnetic Resonance
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ensemble model of free dispersed full&#8208;length heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) was generated from magnetic resonance data based on site&#8208;directed spin labelling and from a small&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray scattering curve. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with this model provides insight into the interplay of specific single&#8208;stranded RNA recognition by hnRNP A1 and its liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation.







Abstract
Interaction of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) with specific single&#8208;stranded RNA and its relation to liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) were studied in vitro by magnetic resonance based on site&#8208;directed spin labelling. An ensemble model of dispersed hnRNP A1 in the absence of RNA was derived from distance distributions between spin labelled sites and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. This model revealed a compact state of the low&#8208;complexity domain and its interaction with the RNA recognition motifs. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR spectroscopy confirmed this interaction. Addition of RNA to dispersed hnRNP A1 induced liquid&#8208;droplet formation. Such LLPS depended on RNA concentration and sequence, with continuous wave EPR spectroscopy showing an influence of RNA point mutations on local protein dynamics. We propose that an interplay of sequence&#8208;specific RNA binding and LLPS contributes to regulation of specific RNA segregation during stress response.

         <title>Facile Access to Far&#8208;Red Fluorescent Probes with Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Effects for In Vivo Two&#8208;Photon Microscopy of the Mouse Cerebrovascular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes formed between aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) acceptors and arylamine donors showed through&#8208;space charge transfer as well as a &#8220;twist+twist&#8221; interaction between the acceptor and the donor. Owing to these properties, the complexes served as far&#8208;red fluorescent nanoprobes with two&#8208;photon excitation. The probe was applied to in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebrovascular system.







Abstract
Much effort has been devoted to the generation of fluorescent probes by synthetic approaches. In this study, we developed a facile strategy to construct far&#8208;red fluorescent probes based on through&#8208;space charge transfer within complexes of acceptors and donors and their &#8220;twist+twist&#8221; interactions. Owing to their rare two&#8208;photon excitation property, the complexes could be used for in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebrovascular system.

         <title>Novel Poxin Stable cGAMP&#8208;Derivatives Are Remarkable STING Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dideoxy&#8208;cyclic&#8208;dinucleotide analogs of cGAS/STING second messenger 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP are prepared using a new and concise synthetic combination of phosphoramidite and phosphotriester chemistry. The dideoxy analogs are found to exhibit remarkable in cellulo and in vitro properties, are stable against degradation by poxvirus immune nucleases, and exhibit superior tumor growth control in a mouse model.







Abstract
2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP is a cyclic A&#8208; and G&#8208;containing dinucleotide second messenger, which is formed upon cellular recognition of foreign cytosolic DNA as part of the innate immune response. The molecule binds to the adaptor protein STING, which induces an immune response characterized by the production of type I interferons and cytokines. The development of STING&#8208;binding molecules with both agonistic as well as antagonistic properties is currently of tremendous interest to induce or enhance antitumor or antiviral immunity on the one hand, or to treat autoimmune diseases on the other hand. To escape the host innate immune recognition, some viruses encode poxin endonucleases that cleave 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP. Here we report that dideoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP (1) and analogs thereof, which lack the secondary ribose&#8208;OH groups, form a group of poxin&#8208;stable STING agonists. Despite their reduced affinity to STING, particularly the compound constructed from two A nucleosides, dideoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cAAMP (2), features an unusually high antitumor response in mice.

         <title>Formation of a Strong Heterogeneous Aluminum Lewis Acid on Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al(OC(CF3)3)3(PhF) reacts with partially dehydroxylated silica to form very strong Lewis acid sites. The well&#8208;defined aluminum Lewis acids are significantly stronger than common molecular Lewis acids and engage in alkyl abstraction reactions that are uncommon using well&#8208;defined supported Lewis acids.







Abstract
Al(OC(CF3)3)(PhF) reacts with silanols present on partially dehydroxylated silica to form well&#8208;defined &#8801;SiOAl(OC(CF3)3)2(O(Si&#8801;)2) (1). 27Al&#8197;NMR and DFT calculations with a small cluster model to approximate the silica surface show that the aluminum in 1 adopts a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry by coordinating to a nearby siloxane bridge and a fluorine from the alkoxide. Fluoride ion affinity (FIA) calculations follow experimental trends and show that 1 is a stronger Lewis acid than B(C6F5)3 and Al(OC(CF3)3)(PhF) but is weaker than Al(OC(CF3)3) and iPr3Si+. Cp2Zr(CH3)2 reacts with 1 to form [Cp2ZrCH3][&#8801;SiOAl(OC(CF3)3)2(CH3)] (3) by methide abstraction. This reactivity pattern is similar to reactions of organometallics with the proposed strong Lewis acid sites present on Al2O3.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Antimony&#8208;Rich Polyoxometalate with Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antitumor Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel soluble and water&#8208;stable giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) has been developed, which shows the largest Sb&#8722;Ln&#8722;W cluster and has the greatest number of Sb centers in a cluster yet found in POM chemistry. Importantly, the Sb&#8208;rich POM can exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor and anti&#8208;metastatic activities in vitro and in vivo without causing adverse effects, making it a promising candidate for a antitumor agent.







Abstract
Herein, a giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) {Sb21Tb7W56} is reported, which contains the largest number of Sb atoms in a POM so far. The Sb&#8208;rich POM has many interesting structural features and is a rare example of a soluble and water&#8208;stable giant POM. Biomedical studies indicate that the Sb&#8208;rich POM exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor activity against various cancer cell lines by reactivating the P53&#8208;dependent apoptotic processes and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane. In addition, this Sb&#8208;rich POM was capable of suppressing the growth and metastasis of a breast cancer in vivo. This work demonstrates that Sb&#8208;rich POMs are promising candidates for the development of new anticancer drugs.

         <title>Electrochemically Initiated Synthesis of Methanesulfonic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of methanesulfonic acid was achieved from only methane and oleum in an electrochemical reactor. At the boron&#8208;doped diamond anode the species is formed, which initiates the catalytic cycle where methane is selectively sulfonated to the product. A concentration of 3.7&#8197;M (approximately 62&#8201;% yield) was achieved at 70&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8197;bar methane pressure in 22&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The direct sulfonation of methane to methanesulfonic acid was achieved in an electrochemical reactor without adding peroxide initiators. The synthesis proceeds only from oleum and methane. This is possible due to in situ formation of an initiating species from the electrolyte at a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode. Elevated pressure, moderate temperature and suitable current density are beneficial to reach high concentration at outstanding selectivity. The highest concentration of 3.7&#8197;M (approximately 62&#8201;% yield) at 97&#8201;% selectivity was reached with a stepped electric current program at 6.25&#8211;12.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 70&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8197;bar methane pressure in 22&#8197;hours. We present a novel, electrochemical method to produce methanesulfonic acid, propose a reaction mechanism and show general dependencies between parameters and yields for methanesulfonic acid.

         <title>Central Unit Fluorination of Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CH molecules with newly modification site on central unit of Y&#8208;series electron acceptors has been designed and synthesized to afford better&#8208;performed organic solar cells (OSCs). Further fluorination on the largely unexplored central unit enabled significantly improved photovoltaic performance with over 18% efficiency for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs..







Abstract
Halogenation of terminal of acceptors has been shown to give dramatic improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Similar significant results could be expected from the halogenation of the central units of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Y&#8208;series acceptors. Herein, a pair of acceptors, termed CH6 and CH4, featuring a conjugation&#8208;extended phenazine central unit with and without fluorination, have been synthesized. The fluorinated CH6 has enhanced molecular interactions and crystallinity, superior fibrillar network morphology and improved charge generation and transport in blend films, thus affording a higher PCE of 18.33&#8201;% for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs compared to 16.49&#8201;% for the non&#8208;fluorinated CH4. The new central site offers further opportunities for structural optimization of Y&#8208;series molecules to afford better&#8208;performed OSCs and reveals the effectiveness of fluorination on central units.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Nonpolar Pore Surfaces for the One&#8208;Step Acquisition of C2H4 from a C2H4 and C2H6 Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;organic framework FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) which has nonpolar pore surfaces can directly give polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures at different gas flow rates, temperatures, and relative humidity. This separation is possible because it adsorbs C2H6 rather than C2H4 between 273 and 303&#8197;K.







Abstract
Because C2H4 plays an essential role in the chemical industry, economical and energy&#8208;efficient separation of ethylene (C2H4) from ethane (C2H6) is extremely important. With the exception of energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation, there are few one&#8208;step methods to obtain polymer&#8208;grade (&#8805;99.95&#8201;% pure) C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures. Here we report a highly stable metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) (FJI&#8208;H=Hong's group in Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter) which features one&#8208;dimensional hexagonal nonpolar pore surfaces constructed by aromatic rings and alkyl groups. This FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) adsorbs C2H6 rather than C2H4 between 273 and 303&#8197;K. Practical breakthrough experiments with C2H4 containing 1&#8201;% C2H6 have shown that FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) can realize the acquisition in one&#8208;step of polymer&#8208;grade, 99.95&#8201;% pure C2H4 under various conditions including different gas flow rates, temperatures and relative humidity.

         <title>Bright and Photostable Fluorescent Metal Nanocluster Supraparticles from Invert Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supraparticles of gold, silver and copper nanoclusters are formed by drying the water droplets in invert emulsions, resulting in a profoundly enhanced photoluminescence emission and resistance to photobleaching. The supraparticle structure greatly enhances the performance, where the inhibition of the twisted intermolecular charge transfer is one of the responsible causes.







Abstract
Fluorescent supraparticles of gold, silver and copper nanoclusters are synthesized by simply drying of invert emulsions, resulting in a dozen&#8208;fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield (up to &#8776;80&#8201;%) and a significant improvement in photostability. The inhibition of the ligand twisting during the intramolecular charge transfer is found to be responsible for the enhancement, especially for the gold nanocluster supraparticles. This research provides a general, flexible, and easy method for producing highly luminescent and photostable metal nanocluster&#8208;based materials that promise practical applications in white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nitric Oxide for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (Fe SAC) is developed for high&#8208;efficient and controlled generation of nitric oxide (NO). The effectiveness of NO generation system underscores a great promise to expedite NO research in both therapeutic and mechanistic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) constitutes one of the most versatile therapeutics for biomedical applications. The efficient and on&#8208;demand NO generation essentially dictates its concentration dependent therapeutic activity. Here, we report an electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (i.e., Fe SAC), for high&#8208;efficient and controlled NO generation. The Fe SAC shows superior catalytic ability in electrochemical reduction of nitrite, with maximal NO generation rate achieving 2.1&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;(min&#8201;&#956;g)&#8722;1. Theoretical studies suggest the significant decrease of Gibbs&#8208;free energy of NO2&#8722; adsorption on single&#8208;iron atom accounts for its high catalytic efficiency. Moreover, ample amount of NO can be controllably generated in a potential dependent manner. For antibacterial application, the generated NO overwhelmingly disrupts both gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive strains, highlighting a great promise to expedite NO research in both basic and applied sciences.

Enter stereogradient PLA: A tripodal zirconium complex catalyzes the polymerization of L&#8208;lactide contaminated with meso&#8208;lactide to yield stereogradient poly(lactic acid) (PLA) as described by Moshe Kol et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207652). The stereogradient copolymers exhibit enhanced crystallinities relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers derived from tin octanoate, and may alleviate the need for L&#8208;lactide purification.

         <title>Enantioselective Biocascade Catalysis with a Single Multifunctional Enzyme&#160;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalytic cascade processes are powerful since they offer direct access to complex chiral molecules from simple substrates and in a single step. In biocatalysis, cascades are generally designed by combining multiple enzymes, each catalyzing individual steps of a reaction sequence. Herein, we report a different strategy for biocatalytic cascades based on a single multifunctional enzyme that can promote multiple stereoselective steps of a domino process by mastering distinct catalytic mechanisms of substrate activation in a sequential way. Specifically, we have used an engineered 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme with the ability to form both enamine and iminium ion intermediates and combine these mechanisms of catalysis in a complex sequence. This approach allowed us to activate aldehydes and enals toward the synthesis of enantiopure cyclohexene carbaldehydes bearing multiple stereogenic centers. The multifunctional 4&#8208;OT enzymes could successfully promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanistic features and activation sequences. This study demonstrates that biocatalytic strategies can match and even surpass in efficiency the potential of organocatalytic cascade catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Germanium Bromide Perovskites with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ge&#8208;based hybrid perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) due to the geometry and lone&#8208;pair induced non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Here, we report a new family of hybrid three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Ge&#8208;based bromide perovskites  A  GeBr  3  ,  A  = CH  3  NH  3  (MA), CH(NH  2  )  2  (FA), Cs and FAGe  0.5  Sn  0.5  Br  3  , crystallizing in polar space groups. These compounds exhibit tunable SHG responses, where MAGeBr  3  shows the strongest SHG intensity (5 &#215; Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate, KDP). Structural and theoretical analysis indicate the high SHG efficiency is attributed to the displacement of Ge  2+  and preferable alignment of polar MA  +  cations along the [111] direction. This work provides new structural insights for designing and fine&#8208;tuning the SHG properties in hybrid metal halide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Diatomic Pd&#8208;Cu Metal&#8208;Phosphorus Sites for Complete N&#8801;N Bond Formation in Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synergistic effect of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysis in the reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrogen has been widely discussed, but it is still not clear how this effect works at the atomic scale, hindering the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Here, for the first time, 2D phosphorene was used as a giant P ligand to confine high&#8208;density PdCu dual&#8208;atom to form a unique PdCuP  4  coordination structure, and this catalyst achieves 96.3% NO  3  &#8722;  removal rate and 95.2% N  2  selectivity. In&#8208;situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the PdCu dual&#8208;atom form covalent&#8208;like bonds with adjacent P atoms, reducing the adsorption energy of the reactants. The synergistic effect of PdCu dual&#8208;atom promotes the breaking of N&#8208;O bond, and the short bond distance of ~ 3&#197; between PdCu atoms accelerates the transfer of NO  2  &#8722;  , and eventually the two Pd&#8208;N adjacent to the surface of Pd rapidly combine to form N  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Edge Functionalized Top&#8208;down Chiral Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of supramolecular assemblies of heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale is an open challenge in science. Herein, new chiral graphene quantum dots (GQDs) prepared by amidation reaction introducing chiral amide groups and pyrene moieties into the periphery of GQDs are described. The analytical and spectroscopic data show an efficient chemical functionalization and the morphological study of the supramolecular ensembles using SEM and AFM microscopies reveals the presence of highly ordered fibers of several micrometers length. Fluorescence studies, using emission spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, reveal that the fibers stem from the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of both pyrenes and GQDs, together with the hydrogen bonding interaction of the amide groups. Circular dichroism analysis supports the chiral nature of the supramolecular aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Periodically Interrupting Bonding Behavior to Reformat Delocalized Electronic States of Graphdiyne for Improved Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#1087; electron configuration plays a pivotal role in metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, and its delocalization degree overwhelmingly dominates catalytic activity. However, precise and targeted regulation of inherent &#960; electrons still remain challenging. Here, one chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy is proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY) as a concept&#8208;of&#8208;proof. The delocalized electrons are expected to be periodically reformatted for substantially enhancing &#960; electron delocalization. Via theoretical screening and well&#8208;designed experiments, periodical interruption of Csp&#8208;Csp2 bonds in GDY can render sp&#8208;C sites with decent activity, ultimately yielding top&#8208;ranking electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing external decoration. The as&#8208;proposed concept endows a universal prescription to push the limit of delocalization degree, thus shedding novel light on the rational design of decent metal&#8208;free catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>3,3&#8208;Difluoroallyl Sulfonium Salts: Practical and Bench&#8208;Stable Reagents for Highly Regioselective gem&#8208;Difluoroallylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective introduction of the difluoromethylene group into organic molecules has important applications in producing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, the general and efficient methods that can construct both C(sp2)&#8208;CF2R and C(sp3)&#8208;CF2R bonds remain challenging. Here, we disclose a new type of practical and bench&#8208;stable difluoroalkylating reagent 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl sulfonium salt (DFAS) that can be practically prepared from inexpensive and bulk chemical feedstock 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene. This reagent allows highly regioselective gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of various organozinc reagents, including aryl, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl zinc reagents, via copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with high efficiency. The reaction can also be extended to a series of substituted DFASs. Application of the approach leads to the short synthesis of complex analogs, showing the prospect of DFASs in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Atom Ru Monolithic Electrode for Efficient Chlorine Evolution and Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating single&#8208;atom electrodes via atomic dispersion of active metal atoms into monolithic metal supports is of great significance to advancing the lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation of the electrochemical technologies. Here, we report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to fasten ligand&#8208;free isolated Ru atoms on the amorphous layer of monolithic Ti support by regulating the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution activity, three orders of magnitude higher mass activity than that of commercial dimensionally stable anode, and also selectively reduced nitrate to ammonia with an unprecedented ammonia yield rate of 22.2 mol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8722;1  at &#8722;0.3 V. Furthermore, the Ru single atom monolithic electrode can be scaled up from 2 &#215; 2 cm to 25 &#215; 15 cm at least, thus demonstrating great potential for industrial electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, Molecular Recognition and Chirality Sensing of Methylene&#8208;Bridged Naphthotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic hosts with a well&#8208;defined cavity are particularly appealing for supramolecular chemistry, but they are still rare. In this research, we reported a new class of macrocyclic hosts, namely methylene&#8208;bridged naphthotubes, with well&#8208;defined cavities. They were synthesized through TFA&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions between alkoxy&#8208;substituted bisnaphthalenes and paraformaldehyde. A configurational selection was observed. Three&#8208;membered macrocycles possess a single cavity, while four&#8208;membered macrocycles adopt a double&#8208;cavity conformation or a self&#8208;filling conformation depending on the alkoxy length. The small homologue shows quite strong binding affinities (up to 108 M&#8208;1) to organic cations, which is better than structurally similar but flexible macrocycles. This demonstrates the advantage of a well&#8208;defined cavity in molecular recognition. Moreover, these naphthotubes can be used as chirality sensors for chiral organic cations through different chirality transfer mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Salt&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Reinforced Carbonate Electrolyte for Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The instability of carbonate electrolyte with metallic Li greatly limits its application in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Here, a "salt&#8208;in&#8208;salt" strategy is applied to boost the LiNO3 solubility in the carbonate electrolyte with Mg(TFSI)2 carrier, which enables the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for excellent Li metal anode performance and also maintains the cathode stability. In the designed electrolyte, both NO3&#8208; and PF6&#8208; anions participate in the Li+&#8208;solvent complexes, thus promoting the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Our designed electrolyte has achieved a superior Li CE of 99.7 %, enabling the high&#8208;loading NCM811||Li (4.5 mAh cm&#8208;2) full cell with N/P ratio of 1.92 to achieve 84.6% capacity retention after 200 cycles. The enhancement of LiNO3 solubility by divalent salts is universal, which will also inspire the electrolyte design for other metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Electrophilic Sulfenylation of N&#8208;Aryl Aminoquinone Derivatives Catalyzed by Chiral SPINOL&#8208;Derived Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N&#8208;aryl aminoquinone derivatives has been achieved for the first time. This transformation is enabled by a new chiral 6,6&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted SPINOL&#8208;derived sulfide catalyst, which was first synthesized and then successfully explored for catalyzing enantioselective reactions. Various axially chiral sulfur&#8208;containing diarylamine derivatives were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. A class of relatively flexible stereogenic C&#8722;N axes was easily constructed. The experimental results and a computational study suggested that an intramolecular N&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;S hydrogen bond is important for the stability of the C&#8722;N axis, which is consistent with our hypothesis. Density functional theory calculations revealed the origin of atroposelectivity and underscored the importance of catalyst rigidity in this sulfenylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A broadly applicable diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers is reported herein. Using a copper(II)&#8208;BOX catalytic system, bridged bicyclic lactones are obtained in very high yields (up to 99% yield) and enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) from diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers. Mechanistic experiments as well as DFT calculations indicate the occurrence of a stepwise mechanism. The synthetic potential of the bridged bicyclic lactones is showcased by the enantioselective synthesis of polyfunctional cyclohexenes and cyclohexadienes, as well as a carbasugar unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocyclic Hemithioindigos: Highly Advantageous Properties as Molecular Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A survey of heterocyclic hemithioindigo photoswitches is presented identifying a number of structural motives with outstanding property profiles. The highly sought&#8208;after combination of pronounced color change, quantitative switching in both directions, exceptional high quantum yields, and tunable high thermal stability of metastable states can be realized with 4&#8208;imidazole, 2&#8208;pyrrole, and 3&#8208;indole&#8208;based derivatives. In the former, an unusual preorganization using isomer selective chalcogen&#8208; and hydrogen bonding allows to precisely control geometry changes and tautomerism upon switching. Heterocyclic hemithioindigos thus represent highly promising photoswitches with advanced capabilities that will be of great value to anyone interested in establishing defined and reversible control at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Confinement Hydrogel Network Enables Continuously Regenerative Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft matter catalyst system allowing controllable manipulation of the organized nanostructure and surface property holds the potential for renewable energy. Here we demonstrate the construction of a continuously regenerative hydrogel photocatalyst that confines the metal&#8208;thiolate coordination induced nanocavity into robust micro&#8208;sized spongy network for water splitting. Thanks to low vaporization enthalpy and fast proton mobility of water molecules confining in nanocavities, the composite delivers outstanding photocatalytic H  2  production (TOF of 4568 H2  h&#8208;1  ), nearly 4.5 times higher than that on the catalyst without confinements. Incorporating with conductive polymers, the TOF is substantially improved to 7819 H2  h&#8208;1  . Impressively, continuous regeneration is for the first time achieved with H2  production retention improved from 24% to 72% by regulating optically&#8208;active catalyst surfaces. This optical regeneration method provides new avenues for sustainable solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of single&#8208;chain random heteropolymers (RHPs)&#8208;derived artificial ion channels were fabricated by a facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; polymerization method, which simultaneously revealed high K  +  selectivity and controllable pH&#8208;gated behaviors. The benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 moieties appended on lateral chains of RHPs can form ion&#8208;permeable nanopores and transport K  +  over Na  +  through the lipid bilayers. The ion permeation selectivity was significantly enhanced by incorporating a cholesterol group to serve as a membrane anchor. Interestingly, similar to natural gated protein channels, on&#8211;off switchable characteristics were also realized by integrating an additional acid&#8208;sensitive alkylamine group into the RHP&#8208;derived channel. The unique design strategies have endowed the RHP&#8208;derived ion channels with facile synthetic procedures, desirable membrane compatibility, high K  +  selectivity, and tunable pH&#8208;gated properties. This work provides an entry point for future design of novel functional nanochannels.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectively Coupling Ru Single Atoms to PtNi Concavities for High Performance Methanol Oxidation via d&#8208;Band Center Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom tailored metal nanoparticles represent a new type of catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a single atom&#8208;cavity coupling strategy to regulate performance of single atom tailored nano&#8208;catalysts. Selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) was conducted to deposit Ru single atoms on the surface concavities of PtNi nanoparticles (Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi). Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi exhibits a record&#8208;high activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with 2.01 A mg  &#8208;1  Pt  . Also, Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi showcases a significant durability with only 16% activity loss. Operando electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations demonstrate Ru single atoms coupled to cavities accelerate the CO removal by regulating  d  &#8208;band centre position. Further, the high diffusion barrier of Ru single atoms in concavities accounts for excellent stability. The developed Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi via single atom&#8208;cavity coupling opens an encouraging pathway to design highly efficient single atom&#8208;based (electro)catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Phase Transitions on Diffusive Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase transitions of lipid bilayer membranes should affect passive transport of molecules. While this hypothesis has been used to design drug&#8208;releasing thermosensitive liposomes, the effect has yet to be quantified. Herein, we use time&#8208;resolved second harmonic light scattering to measure transport of a molecular cation across membranes of unilamellar liposomes composed of the total lipid extract of E. coli from 9&#186;C to 36&#186;C, in which two distinct phase transitions (gel to liquid&#8208;disordered phase) have been identified. While the transport rate slowly increases with temperature as a diffusion process, dramatic jumps are observed at 14.7&#186;C and 27.6&#186;C, the known phase transitions. The transport rate constant measured as (7.3&#177;0.8)&#215;10&#8208;3 s&#8208;1 in the liquid&#8208;disordered phase at 36&#186;C is 35&#8208;times faster than (2.1&#177;0.2)&#215;10&#8208;4 s&#8208;1 of the gel phase at 9&#186;C. For the mixed&#8208;phase between these two phases, the measured rates are consistent with a structure of gel domains among a liquid&#8208;disordered bulk.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phase transitions of lipid bilayer membranes should affect passive transport of molecules. While this hypothesis has been used to design drug-releasing thermosensitive liposomes, the effect has yet to be quantified. Herein, we use time-resolved second harmonic light scattering to measure transport of a molecular cation across membranes of unilamellar liposomes composed of the total lipid extract of E. coli from 9&#186;C to 36&#186;C, in which two distinct phase transitions (gel to liquid-disordered phase) have been identified. While the transport rate slowly increases with temperature as a diffusion process, dramatic jumps are observed at 14.7&#186;C and 27.6&#186;C, the known phase transitions. The transport rate constant measured as (7.3&#177;0.8)&#215;10-3 s-1 in the liquid-disordered phase at 36&#186;C is 35-times faster than (2.1&#177;0.2)&#215;10-4 s-1 of the gel phase at 9&#186;C. For the mixed-phase between these two phases, the measured rates are consistent with a structure of gel domains among a liquid-disordered bulk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Layer Metal Clusters on 2D Ordered Mesoporous TiO2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sulfhydryl monomicelles interfacial assembly strategy is presented for the synthesis of fully exposed single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt clusters on 2D mesoporous TiO  2  (SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO  2  ) nanosheets. This synthesis features the introduction of the sulfhydryl group in monomicelles to finely realize the controllable co&#8208;assembly process of Pt precursors within ordered mesostructures. The resultant SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO  2  shows uniform SAL Pt clusters (~ 1.2 nm) anchored in ultrathin 2D nanosheets (~ 7 nm) with a high surface area (139 m  2  g  &#8208;1  ), a large pore size (~ 25 nm) and a high dispersion (~ 99%). Moreover, this strategy is universal for the synthesis of other SAL metal clusters (Pd and Au) on 2D mTiO  2  with high exposure and accessibility. When used as a catalyst for hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene, the SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO  2  shows a high catalytic activity (TOF up to 2424 h  &#8208;1  ), 100% selectivity for 4&#8208;aminostyrene, good stability, and anti&#8208;resistance to thiourea poisoning under relatively mild conditions (25 &#176;C, 10 bar).</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photoreduction of Diluted CO2 to Tunable Syngas by Ni&#8208;Co Dual Sites through d&#8208;band Center Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2  into syngas is a promising way to address the energy and environmental challenges. Here we report the integration of Ni&#8208;Co dual sites on Ni doped Co3O4  ultrathin nanosheets assembled double&#8208;hollow nanotube (Ni&#8208;Co3O4  NSDHN) for efficient photoreduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2  .  Quasi  in&#8208;situ  spectra and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the declining of  d  &#8208;band center of Ni&#8208;Co dual sites enables the electrons accumulation in the  dxz  /dyz  &#8208;2&#960;  * and  dz2  &#8208;5&#963;  orbitals. As a result, the binding strength of *CO is weakened and the *H adsorption site is modulated from metal sites to an oxygen site. Remarkably,  Ni&#8208;Co3O4  NSDHN  exhibits superior diluted CO2  photoconversion activity and controllable selectivity under the irradiation of visible light or even natural sunlight. A syngas evolution rate of 170.0 mmol g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  with an apparent quantum yield of 3.7% and continuously adjustable CO/H2  ratios from  1:10 to 10:1  are achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;trap Engineering toward Remarkable Crystallographic Reorientation and Efficient Cation Migration of Zn Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn batteries are considered as potential candidates in future power sources, however suffer problems of rampant dendrite/by&#8208;product on Zn anodes, torpid Zn2+ transfer/diffusion and poor energy density. Inspired by the host&#8208;guest interaction chemistry, an anion&#8208;trap agent &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) is introduced into the Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte to induce dominant Zn (002) deposition and improve Zn2+ migration behaviors. The anion ClO4&#8208; is revealed to be trapped inside the cavity of &#946;&#8208;CD, impairing barriers for Zn2+ migration and significantly elevate the Zn2+ transference number to 0.878. Meanwhile, the &#946;&#8208;CD@ClO4&#8208; complex shows the function in preferential growth of the Zn (002), blocking the approach of dendrite growth. Above combined functions lead to substantial enhancement in long&#8208;term stability and cell capacity, as proved by 10 times longer life of Zn||Zn symmetric cells and 57% capacity increasement of Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cells (at 0.1 A g&#8208;1) compared with that of pure Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Alkyl&#8208;Carbamoylation of Internal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective reductive dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkenes has been developed to enable the formation of vicinal stereogenic centers. This protocol allows for facile synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinones bearing vicinal or quaternary stereocenters with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. DFT calculations suggest that the enantiodetermining step is intramolecular migratory insertion with a carbamoyl&#8208;NiI intermediate.







Abstract
Herein, we leverage the Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkenes with alkyl iodides to enable the synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinones bearing vicinal stereogenic centers. The application of newly developed 1&#8208;NapQuinim is critical for formation of two contiguous stereocenters in high yield, enantioselectivity, and diastereoselectivity. This catalytic system also improves both the yield and enantioselectivity in the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams. Computational studies reveal that the enantiodetermining step proceeds with a carbamoyl&#8208;NiI intermediate that is reduced by the Mn reductant prior to intramolecular migratory insertion. The presence of the t&#8208;butyl group of the Quinim ligand leads to an unfavorable distortion of the substrate in the TS that leads to the minor enantiomer. Calculations also support an improvement in enantioselectivity with 1&#8208;NapQuinim compared to p&#8208;tolQuinim.

         <title>Structural and Dynamic Analysis of Sulphur Dioxide Adsorption in a Series of Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework materials have been investigated for reversible SO2 uptake. The incorporation of atomically&#8208;dispersed CuII, amine or heteroatomic sulphur sites enhances the uptake of SO2 at low concentrations. This work confirms that control of pore environments is an important approach for optimising the adsorption of SO2 at low concentrations.







Abstract
We report reversible high capacity adsorption of SO2 in robust Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials. Zr&#8208;bptc (H4bptc=biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid) shows a high SO2 uptake of 6.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, reflecting excellent capture capability and removal of SO2 at low concentration (2500&#8197;ppm). Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the introduction of amine, atomically&#8208;dispersed CuII or heteroatomic sulphur sites into the pores enhance the capture of SO2 at low concentrations. The captured SO2 can be converted quantitatively to a pharmaceutical intermediate, aryl N&#8208;aminosulfonamide, thus converting waste to chemical values. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared micro&#8208;spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering enable the visualisation of the binding domains of adsorbed SO2 molecules and host&#8211;guest binding dynamics in these materials at the atomic level. Refinement of the pore environment plays a critical role in designing efficient sorbent materials.

&lt;p&gt;We report reversible high capacity adsorption of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in robust Zr-based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials. Zr-bptc (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;bptc=biphenyl-3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;-tetracarboxylic acid) shows a high SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake of 6.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, reflecting excellent capture capability and removal of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at low concentration (2500&#8197;ppm). Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the introduction of amine, atomically-dispersed Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; or heteroatomic sulphur sites into the pores enhance the capture of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at low concentrations. The captured SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be converted quantitatively to a pharmaceutical intermediate, aryl N-aminosulfonamide, thus converting waste to chemical values. In situ X-ray diffraction, infrared micro-spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering enable the visualisation of the binding domains of adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and host&#8211;guest binding dynamics in these materials at the atomic level. Refinement of the pore environment plays a critical role in designing efficient sorbent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfur&#8211;Phenolate Exchange: SuFEx&#8208;Derived Dynamic Covalent Reactions and Degradation of SuFEx Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur(VI)&#8211;phenolate exchange (SuPhenEx) reaction between sulfonimidates and phenols has been shown to generate new sulfonimidates that undergo dynamic covalent reactions with other phenols. The fast, high&#8208;yielding, and enantiospecific reactions are useful for both asymmetric synthesis and the degradation of SuFEx polymers. The wide scope of the reaction extends the usefulness of SuFEx and related click reactions.







Abstract
The products of the SuFEx reaction between sulfonimidoyl fluorides and phenols, sulfonimidates, are shown to display dynamic covalent chemistry with other phenols. This reaction was shown to be enantiospecific, finished in minutes at room temperature in high yields, and useful for both asymmetric synthesis and sustainable polymer production. Its wide scope further extends the usefulness of SuFEx and related click chemistries.

         <title>Tailoring Phase Alignment and Interfaces via Polyelectrolyte Anchoring Enables Large&#8208;Area 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored P3CT&#8208;BA polyelectrolyte is demonstrated to be an efficient hole&#8208;transporting layer for large&#8208;area 2D perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency approaching 18&#8201;%, and large&#8208;area (2&#215;3&#8197;cm2, 5&#215;5&#8197;cm2) 2D perovskite devices are also reported with an impressive efficiency of 14.81&#8201;% and 11.13&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper phase 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit improved lifetime while still facing challenges such as phase alignment and up&#8208;scaling to module&#8208;level devices. Herein, polyelectrolytes are explored to tackle this issue. The contact between perovskite and hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) is important for decreasing interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination and scalable fabrication of uniform 2D perovskite films. Through exploring compatible butylamine cations, we first demonstrate poly(3&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybutyl)thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)&#8208;butylamine (P3CT&#8208;BA) as an efficient HTL for 2D PSCs due to its great hydrophilicity, relatively high hole mobility and uniform surface. More importantly, the tailored P3CT&#8208;BA has an anchoring effect and acts as the buried passivator for 2D perovskites. Consequently, a best efficiency approaching 18&#8201;% was achieved and we further first report large&#8208;area (2&#215;3&#8197;cm2, 5&#215;5&#8197;cm2) 2D perovskite minimodules with an impressive efficiency of 14.81&#8201;% and 11.13&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;oxo Nodes of MOFs with Tunable Electronic Properties Provide Effective &#8901;OH Species for Enhanced Methane Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts modified with various ligands can directly convert CH4 into oxygenates with 100&#8201;% selectivity by using H2O2 as an oxidant under mild conditions. The Zr&#8208;oxo nodes have different electronic properties that affected the anchoring of &#8901;OH species to form effective Zroxo&#8722;&#8901;OH sites. These sites promote the activation of the C&#8722;H bond of CH4.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane to high value&#8208;added oxygenates under mild conditions has attracted extensive interest. However, the over&#8208;oxidation of target products is usually unavoidable due to the easily excessive activation of C&#8722;H bond on the sites of supported metal species. Here, we identified the most efficient Zr&#8208;oxo nodes of UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane with H2O2. These nodes were modified by three types of benzene 1, 4&#8208;dicarboxylates (NH2&#8208;BDC, H2BDC, and NO2&#8208;BDC). Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that these ligands can effectively tune the electronic properties of Zr&#8208;oxo nodes and the H2BDC ligand led to optimal electronic density of Zr&#8208;oxo nodes in UiO&#8208;66. Thus the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H catalyst promoted the formation of &#8901;OH species that adsorbed on Zr&#8208;oxo nodes, and facilitated the activation of methane with a lower energy barrier and subsequent conversion to hydroxylation oxygenates with 100&#8201;% selectivity.

         <title>Lysosome Interference Enabled by Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Assembly of DNA Nanoframeworks inside Cells</title>

Proton&#8208;driven dynamic assembly of DNA nanoframeworks inside cells couples with the lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways/lysosomal maturation to give the rational modulation of lysosomal functions. These include lysosomal acidity reduction and hydrolase activity attenuation, thereby improving the delivery efficiency of nucleic acid drugs.







Abstract
Coupling materials chemistry systems to biological processes is a promising way to rationally modulate lysosomal functions. A proton&#8208;driven dynamic assembly of a DNA nanoframework inside cells coupled with the lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways/lysosomal maturation, gives the rational modulation of lysosomal functions, which we term &#8220;lysosome interference&#8221;. Through lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis, the DNA nanoframework with acid&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;i&#8208;motif enters the lysosome and assembles into an aggregate in a process triggered by lysosomal acidity. The aggregate is suitable for long&#8208;term retention. The consumption of protons resulted in lysosomal acidity reduction and hydrolase activity attenuation, thus hindering the degradation of nucleic acid drugs in the lysosome and improving gene silencing effects. This study shows a new way to achieve lysosome interference by coupling the subcellular microenvironment with a precisely programmable assembly system.

         <title>Impact of Strain Relaxation on 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual strain in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite films is investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. Strain relaxation facilitated by the organic spacer cations leads to improved film quality, suppressed recombination, and enhanced device performance under external stress.







Abstract
Although the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached the commercial standards, the unsatisfactory stability limits their further application. Hydrophobic interface and encapsulation can block the damage of water and oxygen, while the instability induced by intrinsic residual strain remains inevitable. Here, the residual strain in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite film is investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. It's found that the spacer cations contribute to the residual strain even though they are not in the inorganic cages. Benefited from strain relaxation, the film quality is improved, leading to suppressed recombination, promoted charge transport and enhanced efficiency. More significantly, the strain&#8208;released devices maintain 86&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after being kept in air with 85&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) for 1080&#8197;h, 82&#8201;% under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 804&#8197;h and 86&#8201;% after continuous heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1080&#8197;h.

         <title>Trojan Nanobacteria System for Photothermal Programmable Destruction of Deep Tumor Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trojan nanobacteria for tumor targeting and inhibition have been constructed in which the photothermal nanoparticles are loaded inside the bacteria. The bacteria target the tumor region and penetrate deep tumor tissues. The photothermal effect inhibits the tumor growth and deactivates the bacteria. The use of bacteria allows for genetic modification which adds additional therapeutic modalities against tumor growth.







Abstract
A novel bacteria&#8208;based drug delivery system, termed &#8220;Trojan nanobacteria system&#8221;, has been developed in which nanoagents are internalized into engineered bacteria through bacteria&#8208;specific maltodextrin (MD) transporters. Compared to the method of attaching nanoagents to bacterial surfaces, this Trojan system features higher payloads and better stability. In cancer therapy, Trojan nanobacteria can specifically discriminate the tumor region and then penetrate deep tumor tissues. Once in the tumor, the Trojan nanobacteria systems are able to destroy deep tumor tissues due to the combined effects of antitumor protein expression (e.g., tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945;, TNF&#8208;&#945;) and photothermal properties.

         <title>Biodegradable Ca2+ Nanomodulators Activate Pyroptosis through Mitochondrial Ca2+ Overload for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable Ca2+ nanomodulators (CaNMs) that can activate pyroptosis for cancer immunotherapy are reported. The CaNMs decompose under low pH to release Ca2+ and curcumin (CUR), leading to a sudden surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ ions. This Ca2+ overload triggers an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the release of cytochrome&#8197;C, activation of caspase&#8208;3, and cleavage of GSDME, causing cell bubbling and pyrolysis.







Abstract
Pyroptosis provides a new direction and broad prospects for cancer immunotherapy. However, the development of a nanoplatform as a pyroptosis inducer is limited, and the discovery of a new type of nano&#8208;pyroptosis inducer for cancer immunotherapy is still imminent. Herein, biodegradable Ca2+ nanomodulators (CaNMs) are prepared as pyroptosis inducers for cancer immunotherapy via mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. The obtained CaNMs can decompose under low pH to release Ca2+ and curcumin, leading to a sudden surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ ions, eventually resulting in pyroptosis. We not only confirm the occurrence of mitochondrial Ca2+ overload&#8208;triggered pyroptosis for the first time but also reveal the robust immune responses via CaNMs, along with remarkably suppressing tumor proliferation and lung metastasis. This work will provide new strategies and inspiration for pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cancer treatments, greatly contributing to the further development of Ca2+ nanomodulators.

         <title>Molecularly Precise, Bright, Photostable, and Biocompatible Cyanine Nanodots as Alternatives to Quantum Dots for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine nanodots constructed by step&#8208;by&#8208;step divergent synthesis of cyanine dye&#8208;cored polylysine dendrimers possess many of the merits of quantum dots and organic fluorophores, including precise structure, well&#8208;defined size, strong and stable fluorescence, and a customizable fluorescence spectrum. A strategy is described for synthesis of various precise fluorescent nanoparticles with optical properties that are relevant to biomedical applications.







Abstract
Fluorescent imaging with fluorophores has become a powerful way to explore complex biological systems and visualize nanoparticles for drug delivery. However, it is challenging to develop fluorophores with ideal physical and optical properties. We report a method to synthesize cyanine nanodots with a single&#8208;molecule structure, well&#8208;defined particle size, customizable fluorescent spectrum, and bright and stable fluorescence. These cyanine nanodots are acquired by the divergent synthesis of cyanine&#8208;dye&#8208;cored polylysine (PLL) dendrimers. We demonstrated the feasibility of the method by synthesizing cyanine 3 (Cy3), cyanine 5 (Cy5), or cyanine 7 (Cy7) cored single&#8208;molecule nanodots up to eight generations with a size of around 11&#8197;nm. We show that these cyanine nanodots are capable of multiple biomedical applications, including multicolor cellular tracing and cancer imaging. These cyanine nanodots possess many merits of organic dots and quantum dots that are promising for future application.

         <title>Umpolung in a Pair of Cobalt(III) Terminal Imido/Imidyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward access to a CoIII terminal imidyl radical complex was provided by one&#8208;electron oxidation of a CoIII terminal imido precursor. Oxidation of the CoIII terminal imido to its imidyl redox isomer facilitates intramolecular migratory insertion reactions of the imido with an NHC ligand by a switch of mechanism through umpolung of the imido ligand.







Abstract
Reaction of the CoI complex [(TIMMNmes)CoI](PF6) (1) (TIMMNmes=tris&#8208;[2&#8208;(3&#8208;mesityl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;methyl]amine) with mesityl azide yields the CoIII imide [(TIMMNmes)CoIII(NMes)](PF6) (2). Oxidation of 2 with [FeCp2](PF6) provides access to a rare CoIII imidyl [(TIMMNmes)Co(NMes)](PF6)2 (3). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy confirm the molecular structure of 3 and its S=
 ground state. ENDOR, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and computational analyses indicate a ligand&#8208;based oxidation; thus, an imidyl&#8208;radical electronic structure for 3. Migratory insertion of one ancillary NHC to the imido ligand in 2 gives the CoI N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (4) within 12&#8197;h. Conversely, it takes merely 0.5&#8197;h for 3 to transform to the CoII congener (5). The migratory insertion in 2 occurs via a nucleophilic attack of the imido ligand at the NHC to give 4, whereas in 3, a nucleophilic attack of the NHC at the electrophilic imidyl ligand yields 5. The reactivity shunt upon oxidation of 2 to 3 confirms an umpolung of the imido ligand.

Single-crystal X-ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy confirm the molecular structure of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and its &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=
 ground state. ENDOR, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and computational analyses indicate a ligand-based oxidation; thus, an imidyl-radical electronic structure for &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. Migratory insertion of one ancillary NHC to the imido ligand in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; gives the Co&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic imine (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) within 12&#8197;h. Conversely, it takes merely 0.5&#8197;h for &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; to transform to the Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; congener (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). The migratory insertion in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; occurs via a nucleophilic attack of the imido ligand at the NHC to give &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, whereas in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, a nucleophilic attack of the NHC at the electrophilic imidyl ligand yields &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. The reactivity shunt upon oxidation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; confirms an umpolung of the imido ligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Adaptive Rhodium Catalyst to Control the Hydrogenation Network of Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive rhodium&#8208;based catalyst for controlled hydrogenation of nitroarenes to hydroxylamines and anilines is presented. Both product platforms could be accessed under mild conditions and excellent yields using molecular hydrogen as the reducing agent. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to shed light on the mode of functioning of the catalyst and elucidate the origin of adaptivity.







Abstract
An adaptive catalytic system that provides control over the nitroarene hydrogenation network to prepare a wide range of aniline and hydroxylamine derivatives is presented. This system takes advantage of a delicate interplay between a rhodium(III) center and a Lewis acidic borane introduced in the secondary coordination sphere of the metal. The high chemoselectivity of the catalyst in the presence of various potentially vulnerable functional groups and its readiness to be deployed at a preparative scale illustrate its practicality. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to shed light on the mode of functioning of the catalyst and elucidate the origin of adaptivity. The competition for interaction with boron between a solvent molecule and a substrate was found crucial for adaptivity. When operating in THF, the reduction network stops at the hydroxylamine platform, whereas the reaction can be directed to the aniline platform in toluene.

         <title>A General and Efficient Solution to Monofluoroalkylation: Divergent Synthesis of Aliphatic Monofluorides with Modular Synthetic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method allows preparation of diverse monofluorides based on the monofluoroalkyl triflate scaffold. Both nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydromonofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes and copper&#8208;catalyzed monofluoroalkylation of Grignard reagents were studied. Further utilities including conversion into conventional fluoroalkylating reagents and construction of monofluoro&#8208;alkoxy, &#8208;alkylamino motifs.







Abstract
Monofluoroalkanes are important in many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and functional materials. However, the lack of easily available and transformable monofluoroalkylating reagents that facilitate a broad array of transformations has hampered the application of monofluoroalkylation. Herein, we report a general and efficient method of preparing diverse aliphatic monofluorides with monofluoroalkyl triflate as the synthetic scaffold. Using both nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydromonofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes and copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation, the general diversification of the monofluoroalkylating scaffold has been exhibited. The broad utility of this monofluoroalkylating reagent is shown by concise conversion into various conventional fluoroalkylating reagents and construction of monofluoro&#8208;alkoxy, &#8208;alkylamino motifs with commercially available heteroatom&#8208;based coupling partners.

         <title>A Traceless Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation on Native Antibodies Enables Efficient One&#8208;Step Payload Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A traceless one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) has been established using a novel thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer design with an optimized Fc&#8208;binding ligand, which enables ligand self&#8208;release during payload assembly. This strategy exhibits excellent compatibility with various toxins, linkers, and IgG subclasses, implying the potential for broad applications in ligand&#8208;directed protein modifications.







Abstract
Direct chemical modification of native antibodies in a site&#8208;specific manner remains a great challenge. Ligand&#8208;directed conjugation can achieve the selective modification of antibodies, but usually requires multiple extra steps for ligand release and cargo assembly. Herein, we report a novel, traceless strategy to enable the facile and efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) by harnessing a thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer reagent. The designed reagent, consisting of an optimized Fc&#8208;targeting ligand, a thioester bridge and a toxin payload, directly assembles the toxin precisely onto the K251 position of native IgGs and simultaneously self&#8208;releases the affinity ligand in one step. With this method, we synthesized a series of K251&#8208;linked ADCs from native Trastuzumab. These ADCs demonstrated excellent homogeneity, thermal stability, and both in vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;tumor activity. This strategy is equally efficient for IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subtypes.

         <title>Doping&#8208;Mediated Energy&#8208;Level Engineering of M@Au12 Superatoms (M=Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir) for Efficient Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of diphosphine&#8208;protected M@Au12 superatoms (M=Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir) were synthesized and characterized. The photoluminescence quantum yield and photocatalytic activity of the M@Au12 superatoms were enhanced by doping with Pt, Rh, or Ir.







Abstract
We synthesized a series of MAu12(dppe)5Cl2 (MAu12; M=Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, or Ir; dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane), which have icosahedral M@Au12 superatomic cores, and systematically investigated their electronic structures, photoluminescence (PL) and photocatalytic properties. The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was expanded when doping an M element positioned at the lower left of the periodic table. The PL quantum yield was enhanced with an increase in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and reached 0.46&#8211;0.67 for MAu12 (M=Pt, Rh, or Ir) under deaerated conditions. The bright PLs from MAu12 (M=Pt, Rh, or Ir) were assigned to phosphorescence based on quenching by O2. MAu12 (M=Pt, Rh, or Ir) acted as a more efficient and stable photocatalyst than Au13 for intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of bisenone via the oxidative quenching cycle. This study provides rational guides for designing photoluminescent and photocatalytic gold superatoms by the doping of heterometal elements.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Adaptive Chiral [1]Rotaxane for Thermo&#8208;Rulable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of covalently &#8220;potting&#8221; an emitter into a flexible chiral macrocycle was proposed to achieve steerable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities in solid state. The concept benefits from the adaptive confinement of the emitter in the nanocavity of the self&#8208;assembled nanoarchitectures.







Abstract
It remains a formidable challenge to realize thermo&#8208;rulable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we propose a new strategy by covalently &#8220;potting&#8221; the emitter into a flexible chiral macrocycle as an adaptive chiral [1]rotaxane to address this issue. Different from its included analogue, the potted emitter [DS] showed adaptive conformers with tunable CPL in varied solvents. Significantly, upon controlled self&#8208;assembly, [DS] formed a channel&#8208;type nanoarchitecture ([DS]A), which exhibited an extraordinary thermo&#8208;rulable CPL between 25&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, the glum was large as 0.024 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which was amplified to 0.040 at 90&#8201;&#176;C with a decrease of QY (from 92&#8201;% to 80&#8201;%). By comparison, the assemblies of cage&#8208;type [DS]B and the unpotted emitter showed irreversible or unanswered thermal behaviors. The work demonstrated the thermo&#8208;rulable and durable CPL for the first time and provided an insightful understanding of thermal effect on high&#8208;temperature and switchable CPL materials.

         <title>Over 70&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Enabled by Potassium Dopant&#8208;Tuned Interaction between Copper Sites and Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium doping of Cu2Se nanosheet arrays on copper foam serves as a versatile method for tuning the interaction between Cu sites and reaction intermediates. This approach enables CO2 electroreduction to ethanol as a single liquid product with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 70.3&#8201;% and an extraordinary stability for 130&#8197;h at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V.







Abstract
It is highly desired yet challenging to steer the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2ER) toward ethanol with high selectivity, for which the evolution of reaction intermediates on catalytically active sites holds the key. Herein, we report that K doping in Cu2Se nanosheets array on Cu foam serves as a versatile way to tune the interaction between Cu sites and reaction intermediates in CO2ER, enabling highly selective production of ethanol. As revealed by characterization and simulation, the electron transfer from K to Se can stabilize CuI species which facilitate the adsorption of linear *COL and bridge *COB intermediates to promote C&#8722;C coupling during CO2ER. As a result, the optimized K11.2%&#8208;Cu2Se nanosheets array can catalyze CO2ER to ethanol as a single liquid product with high selectivity in a potential area from &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.2&#8197;V. Notably, it offers a Faradaic efficiency of 70.3&#8201;% for ethanol production at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V with as is stable for 130&#8197;h.

         <title>Low&#8208;Pt NiNC&#8208;Supported PtNi Nanoalloy Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysts&#8212;In Situ Tracking of the Atomic Alloying Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
During thermal annealing treatment, carbon&#8208;encapsulated Ni NPs, rather than NiNx single sites, serve exclusively as the Ni atom source for PtNi alloy formation. Despite this low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt&#8208;mass activities compared to conventional, carbon&#8208;supported 20&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%Pt Pt&#8208;loaded benchmark PtNi alloy catalysts.







Abstract
We report and analyze a synthetic strategy toward low&#8208;Pt platinum&#8208;nickel (Pt&#8208;Ni) alloy nanoparticle (NP) cathode catalysts for the catalytic electroreduction of molecular oxygen to water. The synthesis involves the pyrolysis and leaching of Ni&#8208;organic polymers, subsequent Pt NP deposition, followed by thermal alloying, resulting in single Ni atom site (NiNC)&#8208;supported PtNi alloy NPs at low Pt weight loadings of only 3&#8211;5&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Despite low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt&#8208;mass activities compared to conventional 20&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;% benchmark PtNi catalysts. Using in situ microscopic techniques, we track and unravel the key stages of the PtNi alloy formation process directly at the atomic scale. Surprisingly, we find that carbon&#8208;encapsulated metallic Ni@C structures, rather than NiNx sites, act as the Ni source during alloy formation. Our materials concepts offer a pathway to further decrease the overall Pt content in hydrogen fuel cell cathodes.

         <title>Tuning Proapoptotic Activity of a Phosphoric&#8208;Acid&#8208;Tethered Tetraphenylethene by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Isomerization and Switchable Protein Interactions for Cancer Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered trans&#8208;cis isomerization of a phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene can be tuned by interaction with albumin. The trans and cis isomers show different interactions toward alkaline phosphatase and albumin, and have different cellular uptake efficiency and proapoptotic activity. Thus, on&#8208;demand activating and deactivating the proapoptotic effect has been achieved in vitro and in vivo by using visible light and proteins as switching elements.







Abstract
We herein report a phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene (T&#8208;P) capable of adapting its geometric configuration and biological activity to the microenvironment upon light irradiation for apoptosis modulation. Different from most ultraviolet&#8208;responsive isomerization, T&#8208;P undergoes cis&#8208;trans isomerization under visible light irradiation, which is biocompatible and thus photo&#8208;modulation is possible in living biosystems. By using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and albumin as dual targets, T&#8208;P isomers display different protein binding selectivity, cancer&#8208;cell internalization efficiency and apoptosis&#8208;inducing ability. The proapoptotic activity was found to be kinetically controlled by the enzymatic reaction with ALP and regulated by co&#8208;existing albumin. Motivated by these findings, two&#8208;way modulation of proapoptotic effect and on&#8208;demand boosting anticancer efficacy were realized in vitro and in vivo using light and endogenous proteins as multiple non&#8208;invasive switching stimuli.

         <title>Creating Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Defective Boron Carbon Nitride for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>

Defect&#8208;controlled boron carbon nitride (BCN) is synthesized with electron&#8208;deficient B atoms and electron&#8208;rich N atoms in defects, forming frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) to promote the electrocatalytic N2 reduction to ammonia.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on metal&#8208;free catalysts is an attractive alternative to the industrial Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts still suffer from low Faraday efficiencies and low ammonia yields. Herein, we present a molecular design strategy to develop a defective boron carbon nitride (BCN) catalyst with the abundant unsaturated B and N atoms as Lewis acid and base sites, which upgrades the catalyst from a single &#8220;Lewis acid catalysis&#8221; to &#8220;frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) catalysis.&#8221; 14N2/15N2 exchange experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FLPs can adsorb an N2 molecule to form a six&#8208;membered ring intermediate, which enables the cleavage of N2 via a pull&#8211;pull effect, thereby significantly reducing the energy barrier to &#8722;0.28&#8197;eV. Impressively, BCN achieves a high Faraday efficiency of 18.9&#8201;%, an ammonia yield of 20.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat., and long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Pentacoordinated&#8208;Zirconium Catalyst with Axial Oxygen Ligand for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Zr&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst with a stable pentacoordinated structure and high single&#8208;atom Zr loading is discovered. With the high&#8208;loading catalyst, the assembled zinc&#8211;air battery delivers a record&#8208;high power density among those of single&#8208;atom catalyst&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), as promising alternatives to Pt&#8208;based catalysts, suffer from the limited choice of center metals and low single&#8208;atom loading. Here, we report a pentacoordinated Zr&#8208;based SAC with nontrivial axial O ligands (denoted O&#8722;Zr&#8722;N&#8722;C) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The O ligand downshifts the d&#8208;band center of Zr and confers Zr sites with stable local structure and proper adsorption capability for intermediates. Consequently, the ORR performance of O&#8722;Zr&#8722;N&#8722;C prominently surpasses that of commercial Pt/C, achieving a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and outstanding durability (92&#8201;% current retention after 130&#8208;hour operation). Moreover, the Zr site shows good resistance towards aggregation, enabling the synthesis of Zr&#8208;based SAC with high loading (9.1&#8197;wt%). With the high&#8208;loading catalyst, the zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) delivers a record&#8208;high power density of 324&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 among those of SAC&#8208;based ZABs.

The 3D analogue of 9,10&#8208;diazido&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodiboraanthracene exists as a monomer in both the solid and solution state. It is thermally stable up to 230&#8201;&#176;C, representing a rare example of an azido borane with boosted Lewis acidity and stability in one. Apart from the classical acid&#8208;base and Staudinger reactions, it is capable of E&#8722;H bond activation (E=B, Si, Ge).







Abstract
Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) inorganic analogue of 9,10&#8208;diazido&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodiboraantracene, which turned out to be a monomer in both the solid and solution state, and thermally stable up to 230&#8201;&#176;C, representing a rare example of azido borane with boosted Lewis acidity and stability in one. Apart from the classical acid&#8208;base and Staudinger reactions, E&#8722;H bond activation (E=B, Si, Ge) was investigated. While the reaction with B&#8722;H (9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) led directly to the 1,1&#8208;addition on N&#945; upon N2 elimination, the Si&#8722;H (Et3SiH, PhMe2SiH) activation proceeded stepwise via 1,2&#8208;addition, with the key intermediates 5int and 6int being isolated and characterized. In contrast, the cooperative Ge&#8722;H was reversible and stayed at the 1,2&#8208;addition step.

A chimeric antibody&#8208;nucleic acid T&#8208;cell engager (CAN&#8208;TE) redirecting T cells to precisely target and potently kill the cancer cells by coupling 1)&#8197;a dynamic DNA circuit with high&#8208;order logic function for smart cell recognition or 2)&#8197;a multivalent aptameric DNA nanostructure to control the targeting avidity for tunable immune response is reported.







Abstract
Synthetically directing T&#8208;cells against tumors emerges as a promising strategy in immunotherapy, while it remains challenging to smartly engage T cells with tunable immune response. Herein, we report an intelligent molecular platform to engineer T&#8208;cell recognition for selective activation to potently kill cancer cells. To this end, we fabricated a hybrid conjugate that uses a click&#8208;type DNA&#8211;protein conjugation to equip the T cell&#8208;engaging antibody with two distinct programmable DNA nanoassemblies. By integrating multiple aptameric antigen&#8208;recognitions within a dynamic DNA circuit, we achieved combinatorial recognition of triple&#8208;antigens on cancer cells for selective T&#8208;cell activation after high&#8208;order logic operation. Moreover, by coupling a DNA nanostructure, we precisely defined the valence of the antigen&#8208;binding aptamers to tune avidity, realizing effective tumor elimination in vitro and in vivo. Together, we present a versatile and programmable strategy for synthetic immunotherapy.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Programmable AgAuS&#8208;Primed Conductive Nanowelding Wires&#8208;Up Wet Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;based, DNA&#8208;programmable, and highly efficient nanowelding process generates conductive threads in self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle &#8220;molecules&#8221; and &#8220;polymers&#8221;. The process starts with a gap&#8208;specific Ag2S deposition in pre&#8208;formed gold nanostructures. It ends with Ag2S&#8208;directed gold&#8208;atom diffusion and a reduction of the resulting AgAuS primer phase to give conductive Au/Ag alloyed junctions.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanomaterials, directed by molecular or supramolecular interactions, is a powerful strategy to build nanoscale devices. Despite many advantages of such solution&#8208;based processes, a big challenge is to realize interparticle ohmic contacts toward facilitated charge transport over a long distance. We report a new concept of primed nanowelding to thread solution&#8208;borne nanoparticles in prescribed assemblies. The process starts with a gap&#8208;specific deposition of Ag2E (E=S, Se) materials in pre&#8208;assembled gold structures, which spontaneously transform into AgAuE semiconductors via directional gold diffusion. Treatment with tributylphosphine generates alloyed Au/Ag welding spots that conductively wire&#8208;up nanoparticles into discrete &#8220;molecules&#8221; and micron&#8208;long &#8220;polymers&#8221;. This method is compatible with DNA programming and delivers a possible way to solve the problem of the carrier&#8208;transport dilemma in solution&#8208;processed nanostructures for better&#8208;functioning nanodevices.

Despite many advantages of such solution-based processes, a big challenge is to realize interparticle ohmic contacts toward facilitated charge transport over a long distance. We report a new concept of primed nanowelding to thread solution-borne nanoparticles in prescribed assemblies. The process starts with a gap-specific deposition of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E (E=S, Se) materials in pre-assembled gold structures, which spontaneously transform into AgAuE semiconductors via directional gold diffusion. Treatment with tributylphosphine generates alloyed Au/Ag welding spots that conductively wire-up nanoparticles into discrete &#8220;molecules&#8221; and micron-long &#8220;polymers&#8221;. This method is compatible with DNA programming and delivers a possible way to solve the problem of the carrier-transport dilemma in solution-processed nanostructures for better-functioning nanodevices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Consequences of Noncovalent Interfacial Contacts between Nanoparticles and Giant Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticle interaction induces morphological changes in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) upon binding to surface&#8208;immobilized hCAII. Nanoparticle size, receptor/ligand surface densities, overall receptor/ligand concentrations, and ratios affect the strength of adhesion. Adhesion strength determines the interaction outcome, namely, weak/strong inter&#8208;GUV adhesion and GUV lysis.







Abstract
Biological membrane fluidity enables shape reform upon a functionally complementary encounter between a biomolecule and a synthetic nanoparticle. Nanomedicine uses ligand&#8208;cell surface receptor affinities for nanoparticle targeting. However, due to toxicity concerns, the nature of the nanoparticle&#8211;biomembrane interaction needs exploration to realize ligand surface density and receptor&#8211;ligand interaction effects on subsequent uptake/other interaction outcomes. In this study, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) were surface&#8208;immobilized with a hCAII model receptor to study nanoparticle&#8211;complementary surface ligand interactions. We find interaction strength impacts morphological outcomes, namely, inter&#8208;GUV adhesion, lysis, and GUV swallowing. Nanoparticle size, receptor/ligand surface densities, overall receptor/ligand concentrations and ratios affect the strength of adhesion, and thus the outcome. Interaction energy effects on GUV morphological outcomes offer fundamental insights into the design of abiological materials for interacting with biological materials.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroaryloxy&#8208; and Hydroalkoxycarbonylation of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly enantioselective inter&#8208; and intramolecular Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkoxycarbonylation yields various enantioenriched polysubstituted cyclopropanecarboxylic derivatives with quaternary carbon stereocenters.







Abstract
The asymmetric Reppe carbonylation reactions provide a straightforward access to &#945;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds. The reported paradigms predominantly adopted precious palladium as the catalyst. Here we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carbonylation of cyclopropenes with phenyl formate and CO/ROH, respectively. This asymmetrical synthetic protocol features high atom economy, good functional group tolerance, which rapidly constructs polysubstituted cyclopropanecarboxylic derivatives with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by facile conversion of the chiral products into bioactive molecules such as (&#8722;)&#8208;Tranylcypromine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Lemborexant.

         <title>Design of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Fast and Robust Organic Solvent Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) is prepared as a membrane for highly permselective and robust organic solvent nanofiltration. The membrane has an unprecedented methanol permeance. High&#8208;performance purification of active pharmaceutical ingredients is also realized by the 3D COF membrane.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) has become increasingly important in petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries, demanding superior and robust membranes. Herein, we report advanced OSN processes by designing three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) membranes through moderated interfacial crystallization. Nanoporous supports work as the moderator allowing the crystallization of 3D COF membranes. The 3D COF features sub&#8208;nanometer and anti&#8208;swelling channels, affording a sharp selectivity to fine targets with an exceptionally high and stable methanol permeance. Thus&#8208;synthesized membrane exhibits a record stability against high&#8208;concentration feeds and long&#8208;term operation for &#8776;1000&#8197;h. Moreover, we unambiguously demonstrate that our membrane holds excellent practicality in purifying active pharmaceutical ingredients from organic liquids. This work reveals the great potential of distinctive 3D COFs in producing prominent OSN membranes for industrial applications.

         <title>Directed Dehydration as Synthetic Tool for Generation of a New Na4SnS4 Polymorph: Crystal Structure, Na+ Conductivity, and Influence of Sb&#8208;Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dehydration of Na4SnS4&#8901;14&#8201;H2O at moderate temperature generates the new, kinetically stabilized Na4SnS4 polymorph exhibiting enhanced ionic conductivities compared to the thermodynamically stabilized form. Co&#8208;decomposition with Na3SbS4&#8901;9&#8201;H2O enables an easy, fast, and scalable avenue to obtain the solid solution Na4&#8722;xSn1&#8722;xSbxS4 allowing methodical investigations of Sb&#8208;substitution effects in these solid&#8208;state electrolytes.







Abstract
We present the convenient synthesis and characterization of the new ternary thiostannate Na4SnS4 (space group 
) by directed removal of crystal water molecules from Na4SnS4&#8901;14&#8201;H2O. The compound represents a new kinetically stable polymorph of Na4SnS4, which is transformed into the known, thermodynamically stable form (space group 
) at elevated temperatures. Thermal co&#8208;decomposition of mixtures with Na3SbS4&#8901;9&#8201;H2O generates solid solution products Na4&#8722;xSn1&#8722;xSbxS4 (x=0.01, 0.10) isostructural to the new polymorph (x=0). Incorporation of Sb5+ affects the bonding and local structural situation noticeably evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction, 119Sn and 23Na NMR, and 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates an enormous improvement of the ionic conductivity with increasing Sb content for the solid solution (&#963;25&#176;C=2&#215;10&#8722;3, 2&#215;10&#8722;2, and 0.1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for x=0, 0.01, and 0.10), being several orders of magnitude higher than for the known Na4SnS4 polymorph.

         <title>Efficient Production of L&#8208;Homophenylalanine by Enzymatic&#8208;Chemical Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route involving both enzymatic and spontaneous chemical reactions was designed for the synthesis of L&#8208;homophenylalanine from inexpensive building blocks. One enzyme in the cascade, EcQOR, was identified as the first ene reductase to catalyze the reduction of an unsaturated aromatic keto acid. This study shows the potential of introducing spontaneous chemical reactions into enzymatic cascades for the synthesis of valuable chemicals.







Abstract
L&#8208;Homophenylalanine (L&#8208;HPA) is a vital building block for the synthesis of numerous chiral drugs. However, the high cost of starting materials limits the industrial production of L&#8208;HPA. In this study, an enzymatic&#8208;spontaneous chemical cascade route for L&#8208;HPA production was designed based on retrosynthetic analysis. This route, using simple benzaldehyde and pyruvate as starting materials, is extremely cost&#8208;effective. The enzymes were screened and further assembled in E.&#8197;coli, and TipheDH was identified as the rate&#8208;limiting enzyme. Therefore, TipheDH was engineered to improve its specific activity (by 82&#8201;%) and expression level (by 254&#8201;%), thus generating the best strain (W14). W14 exhibited the optimum enzyme activity ratio (1.7&#8201;:&#8201;1.1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1.8) and demonstrated production of 100.9&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 of L&#8208;HPA (with 94&#8201;% conversion, &gt;99&#8201;% ee) in a 5&#8208;L reactor. This route effectively exploits the power of cascades and offers insight into avenues for synthesizing other valuable chemicals from inexpensive building blocks.

         <title>para&#8208;Selective Radical Trifluoromethylation of Benzamide Derivatives via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of benzamide derivatives was developed that makes use of iminium intermediates. The iminium species, formed in situ from Tf2O, pyridine and amides, feature greatly enhanced reactivity at the para&#8208;position towards radical&#8208;type nucleophilic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes via a radical pathway has attracted considerable attention recently. However, a major challenge of C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation is the lack of site&#8208;selectivity on the phenyl ring especially para&#8208;selectivity. Herein we show a new strategy for para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of benzamide derivatives using iminium activation. The reaction undergoes a radical&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution instead of a radical&#8208;type electrophilic substitution owing to iminium activation as a result of lowering the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital). A wide range of substrates are compatible with this method giving almost exclusive para&#8208;trifluoromethylated products.

         <title>Dual Reactivity of a Geometrically Constrained Phosphenium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometrically constrained phosphenium cation 1+ was synthesized and its reactivity was studied. While 1+ reacts with MeOH and Et2NH via P&#8208;center/ligand assisted path, its reaction with Et3SiH proceeds via oxidative addition type reaction affording new PV intermediate. The ability of 1+ to activate Si&#8722;H bond was tested in catalytic hydrosilylation of benzaldehyde, where 1+ closely mimics transition metal behaviour.







Abstract
A geometrically constrained phosphenium cation in bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine based NNN pincer type ligand (1+) was synthesized, isolated and its preliminary reactivity was studied with small molecules. 1+ reacts with MeOH and Et2NH, activating the O&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds via a P&#8208;center/ligand assisted path. The reaction of 1+ with one equiv. of H3NBH3 leads to its dehydrogenation producing 5. Interestingly, reaction of 1+ with an excess H3NBH3 leads to phosphinidene (PI) species coordinating to two BH3 molecules (6). In contrast, [1+][OTf] reacts with Et3SiH by hydride abstraction yielding 1&#8208;H and Et3SiOTf, while [1+][B(C6F5)4] reacts with Et3SiH via an oxidative addition type reaction of Si&#8722;H bond to P&#8208;center, affording a new PV compound (8). However, 8 is not stable over time and degrades to a complex mixture of compounds in matter of minutes. Despite this, the ability of [1+][B(C6F5)4] to activate Si&#8722;H bond could still be tested in catalytic hydrosilylation of benzaldehyde, where 1+ closely mimics transition metal behaviour.

         <title>Tug&#8208;of&#8208;War between Two Distinct Catalytic Sites Enables Fast and Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of organocatalysts featuring two distinct catalytic sites in one molecule was illustrated in the ROCOP of epoxides with anhydride, giving excellent selectivity and activity. A chain tug&#8208;of&#8208;war mechanistic pathway is proposed to rationalize the simultaneous enhancement in monomer activation and nucleophilic attack, thus giving rise to outstanding catalytic performance.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations have emerged as a powerful approach towards the creation of sustainable polymers. Typical H&#8208;bonding catalysts for ring&#8208;opening are subject to a single catalytic site. Here we describe a H&#8208;bond&#8208;donor/Lewis&#8208;acidic&#8208;boron organocatalyst featuring two distinct catalytic sites in one molecule. The ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides with anhydride mediated by these modular, and tunable catalysts achieves high selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% polyester selectivity) and markedly higher activity compared to either of the di&#8208;thiourea analogues or any combinations of them. Calculations and experimental studies reveal that the superior catalytic performance arises from tug&#8208;of&#8208;war between two differentiated catalytic sites: thiourea pulls off the propagating chain&#8208;end from boron center, simultaneously enhancing the role of monomer activation and also nucleophilicity of the propagation intermediates.

         <title>Phenacyl Bromide as a Single&#8208;Component Photoinitiator: Photoinduced Step&#8208;Growth Polymerization of N&#8208;Methylpyrrole and N&#8208;Methylindole</title>

Photoinduced step&#8208;growth polymerization of N&#8208;methylpyrrole and N&#8208;methylindole was accomplished using phenacyl bromide as single&#8208;component photoinitiator under near&#8208;UV irradiation.







Abstract
The synthesis of step&#8208;growth polymers by photoinduced methods is a challenging issue in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a single component near UV responsive photopolymerization system for step&#8208;growth polymerization of N&#8208;methylpyrrole (MPyr) and N&#8208;methylindole (MIn) by using phenacyl bromide (PAB). The obtained high molecular weight conjugated polymers were characterized by spectral and chromatographic methods. Detailed laser flash photolysis and spectroscopic studies revealed that polymerization proceeds by successive photoinduced cleavage of PAB followed by electron transfer, proton release and coupling processes. After photolysis, chain growth continues also in daylight or dark by acidic oxidation. The structural features of the polymers were investigated.

     alt="Phenacyl Bromide as a Single-Component Photoinitiator: Photoinduced Step-Growth Polymerization of N-Methylpyrrole and N-Methylindole"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoinduced step-growth polymerization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyrrole and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylindole was accomplished using phenacyl bromide as single-component photoinitiator under near-UV irradiation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of step-growth polymers by photoinduced methods is a challenging issue in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a single component near UV responsive photopolymerization system for step-growth polymerization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyrrole (MPyr) and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylindole (MIn) by using phenacyl bromide (PAB). The obtained high molecular weight conjugated polymers were characterized by spectral and chromatographic methods. Detailed laser flash photolysis and spectroscopic studies revealed that polymerization proceeds by successive photoinduced cleavage of PAB followed by electron transfer, proton release and coupling processes. After photolysis, chain growth continues also in daylight or dark by acidic oxidation. The structural features of the polymers were investigated. PAB single component photoinitiator enables an efficient, rapid, room temperature step-growth polymerization process of MPyr and MIn that can be applied to other conjugated monomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Rational Design and Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral C2&#8208;Arylpyrrole&#8208;Derived Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile C1&#8208;symmetric biaryl amino alcohol scaffold, NPNOL, has been rationally designed. For the enantioselective synthesis of NPNOL, the chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed asymmetric Attanasi reaction was utilized. Density functional theory calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity. NPNOL could serve as a new platform for the development of chiral ligands and catalysts.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl diols have achieved great success in asymmetric catalysis. By contrast, axially chiral biaryl amino alcohols are far less developed. Herein, we have rationally designed a versatile C1&#8208;symmetric biaryl amino alcohol scaffold 1&#8208;(1&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (NPNOL) on the basis of axially chiral C2&#8208;arylpyrrole framework. For its enantioselective synthesis, the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Attanasi reaction between 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and azoalkenes had been established. By using this practical method, a wide range of NPNOLs were readily prepared in high yields and excellent atroposelectivities (38 examples, up to 89&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity. The easy transformations of NPNOL&#8208;derived products into organocatalysts/ligands and their preliminary applications in asymmetric catalytic reactions demonstrated the promising utility of NPNOL.

         <title>BTDAzo: A Photoswitchable TRPC5 Channel Activator
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TRPs (Transient Receptor Potentials) are important sensory ion channels with roles in perception including of heat, cold, and electrophiles, as well as in signaling and mineralostasis. Here the first photopharmaceutical TRPC5 ligand, BTDAzo, is developed, which achieves outstanding photoswitchability of TRPC5 currents in physiological models including brain slice, without crosstalk to the related TRPC4 channel.







Abstract
Photoswitchable reagents can be powerful tools for high&#8208;precision biological control. TRPC5 is a Ca2+&#8208;permeable cation channel with distinct tissue&#8208;specific roles, from synaptic function to hormone regulation. Reagents giving spatiotemporally&#8208;resolved control over TRPC5 activity may be key to understanding and harnessing its biology. Here we develop the first photoswitchable TRPC5&#8208;modulator, BTDAzo, to address this goal. BTDAzo can photocontrol TRPC5 currents in cell culture, as well as controlling endogenous TRPC5&#8208;based neuronal Ca2+ responses in mouse brain slices. BTDAzos are also the first reported azo&#8208;benzothiadiazines, an accessible and conveniently derivatised azoheteroarene with strong two&#8208;colour photoswitching. BTDAzo&#8242;s ability to control TRPC5 across relevant channel biology settings makes it suitable for a range of dynamically reversible photoswitching studies in TRP channel biology, with the aim to decipher the various biological roles of this centrally important ion channel.

         <title>Monitoring Reaction Intermediates to Predict Enantioselectivity Using Mass Spectrometry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereomeric intermediates can be separated by ion mobility mass spectrometry. Monitoring of the kinetics of the intermediates allows the prediction of the overall reaction enantioselectivity. The experiments can be performed in a small scale and do not require an isolation of the products.







Abstract
Enantioselective reactions are at the core of chemical synthesis. Their development mostly relies on prior knowledge, laborious product analysis and post&#8208;rationalization by theoretical methods. Here, we introduce a simple and fast method to determine enantioselectivities based on mass spectrometry. The method is based on ion mobility separation of diastereomeric intermediates, formed from a chiral catalyst and prochiral reactants, and delayed reactant labeling experiments to link the mass spectra with the reaction kinetics in solution. The data provide rate constants along the reaction paths for the individual diastereomeric intermediates, revealing the origins of enantioselectivity. Using the derived kinetics, the enantioselectivity of the overall reaction can be predicted. Hence, this method can offer a rapid discovery and optimization of enantioselective reactions in the future. We illustrate the method for the addition of cyclopentadiene (CP) to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde catalyzed by a diarylprolinol silyl ether.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe for Imaging Fluctuations of Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) in the Alzheimer's Disease Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining the ONOO&#8722;&#8208;initiated cascade reactions of a novel chemical trigger and a new NIR emissive Rhodol fluorophore, an activity&#8208;based NIR fluorescent probe for ONOO&#8722; in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains was constructed. Real&#8208;time imaging of ONOO&#8722; in AD mice and age&#8208;dependent accumulation of ONOO&#8722; in AD mouse brains have been demonstrated with the probe.







Abstract
Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To reveal the ONOO&#8722; influx in AD brains, an activatable activity&#8208;based fluorescence probe Rd&#8208;DPA3 was designed by a structure&#8208;modulated strategy. Taking advantage of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;initiated two&#8208;step cascade reactions of a novel chemical trigger, Rd&#8208;DPA3 specifically responds to ONOO&#8722; in 0.3&#8197;mM of other reactive oxygen species (ROS) and varied proteins, and gives an intensive fluorescence enhancement (F/F0=50). Moreover, with its mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, Rd&#8208;DPA3 can be used to efficiently monitor the alternations of intracellular ONOO&#8722; levels in cerebral cells during oxidative stress. Significantly, due to NIR emission and good blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) crossing ability, Rd&#8208;DPA3 is suitable for in vivo imaging of cerebral ONOO&#8722; influx and illustrating an age&#8208;dependent accumulation of ONOO&#8722; in AD mice brains.

         <title>A SLC35C2 Transporter&#8208;Targeting Fluorescent Probe for the Selective Detection of B Lymphocytes Identified by SLC&#8208;CRISPRi and Unbiased Fluorescence Library Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a systematic SLC&#8208;CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of CDyB was identified as the SLC35C2 transporter based on a gating&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (GOLD) mechanism. Gene expression analysis and knock&#8208;out experiments confirmed that the SLC35C2 transporter acted as the target responsible for the selectivity of CDyB for B&#8208;cells over T&#8208;cells.







Abstract
T and B lymphocytes are two major adaptive immune cells in the human defense system. To real&#8208;time monitor their diverse functions, a live&#8208;cell&#8208;selective probe for only one cell type is need to investigate the complex interaction of the immune cells. Herein, a small&#8208;molecule probe CDyB for live B cells is developed by an unbiased fluorescence library screening. The cell selectivity was confirmed by multiparametric single&#8208;cell analysis using CyTOF. Through a systematic SLC&#8208;CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of CDyB was identified as SLC35C2 transporter based on a gating&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (GOLD) mechanism. The gene expression analysis and knock&#8208;out experiments validated that the SLC35C2 transporter was the target for CDyB distinction. Interestingly, when CDyB was applied to study B cell development, the CDyB fluorescence and SLC35C2 expression were positively correlated with the B cell maturation process, and not involved in the T cell development.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric &#945;&#8208;Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 Compounds with Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity Originating from Ag9Te2 Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;temperature crystal structure of &#945;&#8208;Ag9GaTe6 shows a hexagonal structure. Highly disordered Ag atoms vibrate in&#8208;harmonically leading to an intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, the deficiency of Ga in Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 compounds effectively optimizes the electronic transport properties. All these factors contribute to an improved thermoelectric Figure of Merit ZT value of 1.13 at 623&#8197;K for Ag9Ga0.95Te6.







Abstract
We have determined the complex atomic structure of high&#8208;temperature &#945;&#8208;Ag9GaTe6 phase with a hexagonal lattice (P63mc space group, a=b=8.2766&#8197;&#197;, c=13.4349&#8197;&#197;). The structure has outer [GaTe4]5&#8722; tetrahedrons and inner [Ag9Te2]5+ clusters. All of the Ag ions are disorderly distributed in the lattice. Seven types of the Ag atoms constitute the cage&#8208;like [Ag9Te2]5+ clusters. The highly disordered Ag ions vibrate in&#8208;harmonically, producing strong coupling between low frequency optical phonons and acoustic phonons. This in conjunction with a low sound velocity of 1354&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1 leads to an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.20&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 673&#8197;K. Meanwhile, the deficiency of Ga in Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 compounds effectively optimizes the electronic transport properties. Ag9Ga0.91Te6 attains a highest power factor of 0.40&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 673&#8197;K. All these contribute to a much&#8208;improved ZT value of 1.13 at 623&#8197;K for Ag9Ga0.95Te6, which is 41&#8201;% higher than that of the pristine Ag9GaTe6 sample.

         <title>Highly Regioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective hydroboration of unsymmetrical internal alkynes featuring unique regioselectivity, broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility was realized by using cobalt catalysts modified with newly developed cyclopropane&#8208;based diphosphine ligands. The current protocol enabled the synthesis of novel alkenyl borates and improved the synthetic efficiency of bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Herein, we report the development of new Co complexes that have cyclopropane&#8208;based diphosphine ligands and can catalyze highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective hydroboration reactions of unsymmetrical internal alkynes. These reactions exhibited unusual regioselectivity: specifically, reactions of aryl alkyl internal alkynes showed excellent cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;addition selectivity, and reactions of dialkyl internal alkynes gave excellent cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;addition selectivity. Highly regioselective hydroboration of unsymmetrical dialkyl internal alkynes cannot be achieved by other known methods. The reactions described herein are highly synthetically useful, particularly for the stereoselective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenylborates and alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a CoI&#8722;H species is a plausible active catalyst and the rigid structure of the cyclopropane skeleton of the ligands and the crowded reaction pocket were responsible for the unprecedented regioselectivity.

         <title>Third&#8208;Generation Covalent TMP&#8208;Tag for Fast Labeling and Multiplexed Imaging of Cellular Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The third&#8208;generation TMP&#8208;tag3 is developed. It features optimized synthesis, fluorogenic labeling, and fast cellular intake. It performs well in comparative studies with HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag. The 18&#8197;kD&#8208;protein tag is compatible with loop insertion. The TMP&#8208;tag3 supplements and supplants the existing self&#8208;labeling protein tags, adding an orthogonal channel for multiplexed labeling and nanoscopic imaging.







Abstract
Self&#8208;labeling protein tags can introduce advanced molecular motifs to specific cellular proteins. Here we introduce the third&#8208;generation covalent TMP&#8208;tag (TMP&#8208;tag3) and showcase its comparison with HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag. TMP&#8208;tag3 is based on a proximity&#8208;induced covalent Michael addition between an engineered Cys of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) and optimized trimethoprim (TMP)&#8211;acrylamide conjugates with minimal linkers. Compared to previous versions, the TMP&#8208;tag3 features an enhanced permeability when conjugated to fluorogenic spirocyclic rhodamines. As a small protein, the 18&#8208;kD eDHFR is advantageous in tagging selected mitochondrial proteins which are less compatible with bulkier HaloTag fusions. The proximal N&#8722;C termini of eDHFR also enable facile insertion into various protein loops. TMP&#8208;tag3, HaloTag, and SNAP&#8208;tag are orthogonal to each other, collectively forming a toolbox for multiplexed live&#8208;cell imaging of cellular proteins under fluorescence nanoscopy.

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling in Catalytic Hydrolysis and Alcoholysis of Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;giant&#8221; kinetic isotope effect (KIE=346) has been observed for the generation of hydrogen from the hydrolysis of silanes catalyzed by a silyl&#8208;iridium(III) complex. This and other experimental evidence together with theoretical calculations have been used to demonstrate the participation of hydrogen quantum tunneling in this catalytic process.







Abstract
An unprecedented quantum tunneling effect has been observed in catalytic Si&#8722;H bond activations at room temperature. The cationic hydrido&#8208;silyl&#8208;iridium(III) complex, {Ir[SiMe(o&#8208;C6H4SMe)2](H)(PPh3)(THF)}[BArF4], has proven to be a highly efficient catalyst for the hydrolysis and the alcoholysis of organosilanes. When triethylsilane was used as a substrate, the system revealed the largest kinetic isotopic effect (KIESi&#8722;H/Si&#8722;D=346&#177;4) ever reported for this type of reaction. This unexpectedly high KIE, measured at room temperature, together with the calculated Arrhenius preexponential factor ratio (AH/AD=0.0004) and difference in the observed activation energy [(E
&#8722;E
)=34.07&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1] are consistent with the participation of quantum tunneling in the catalytic process. DFT calculations have been used to unravel the reaction pathway and identify the rate&#8208;determining step. Aditionally, isotopic effects were considered by different methods, and tunneling effects have been calculated to be crucial in the process.

         <title>Construction of Benzocyclobutenes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Triplet Biradical Atom Transfer of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzocyclobutanol and benzocyclobutylamine derivatives have been obtained by visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced triplet biradical atom transfer of olefins. The reaction mechanism was investigated by deuterium&#8208;labeling and kinetic quenching experiments, as well as DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a method that provides an array of benzocyclobutanol and benzocyclobutylamine derivatives with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeds by engaging triplet biradical atom transfer of olefinic compounds in the activation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. The reaction mechanism involves the generation of triplet excited state of diarylethylene derivative and subsequent HAT process, and then the further ring&#8208;closing reaction affording the product via an electrocyclization process. The plausible mechanism is supported by control and deuterium labeling experiments, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#8901;H2O Perovskite for Flexible Transparent X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#8901;H2O perovskites are prepared that have multiple hydrogen bonds which improve the lattice stiffness for better endurance of X&#8208;ray radiation. Importantly, the flexible X&#8208;ray detector realizes the highest sensitivity of 3708&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with improved operational stability and has potential in pixelated matrix imaging.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskites are of interest for their chemical diversity and eco&#8208;friendly properties, and recently have been used for X&#8208;ray detection with superior carrier behavior. However, the size and shape complexity of the organic components results in difficulties in evaluating their stability in high&#8208;energy radiation. Herein, we introduce multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond metal&#8208;free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#8901;H2O perovskite, where H2O leads to more hydrogen bonds appearing between organic molecules and the perovskite host. As suggested by the theoretical calculations, multiple hydrogen bonds promote stiffness of the lattice, and increase the diffusion barrier to inhibit ionic migration. Then, low trap density, high &#956;&#964; products and structural flexibility of PAZE&#8208;NH4Br3&#8901;H2O give a flexible X&#8208;ray detector with the highest sensitivity of 3708&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 0.19&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and superior spatial resolution of 5.0&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Sunk&#8208;Cost Bias and Knowing When to Terminate a Research Project</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An awareness of sunk&#8208;cost bias provides an antidote to the scientific optimism that exacerbates the tendency to continue research projects when the likelihood of success is minimal. A survey of academic and industrial practices, as summarized in the sunk&#8208;cost bias decision matrix, captures how implementing controls facilitates data&#8208;driven decisions to terminate or continue research while avoiding emotionally driven decisions that can sap resources.







Abstract
Scientific research is an open&#8208;ended quest where success usually triumphs over failure. The tremendous success of science obscures the tendency for the non&#8208;linear discovery process to take longer and cost more than expected. Perseverance through detours and past setbacks requires a significant commitment that is fueled by scientific optimism; the same optimism required to overcome challenges simultaneously exacerbates the very human tendency to continue a line of inquiry when the likelihood of success is minimal, the so&#8208;called sunk&#8208;cost bias. This Viewpoint Article shows how the psychological phenomenon of sunk&#8208;cost bias influences medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists by comparing how the respective industrial and academic practitioners approach sunk&#8208;cost bias; a series of interviews and illustrative quotes provide a rich trove of data to address this seldom discussed, yet potentially avoidable research cost. The concluding strategies recommended for mitigating against sunk&#8208;cost bias should benefit not only medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists but a wide array of chemistry practitioners.

Ring&#8208;current strengths are a useful aromaticity measure that is obtained indirectly through the ring&#8208;current model using experimental 1H&#8208;NMR data. The computation of ring currents provides direct visual aid and reveals that the ring&#8208;current model overestimates the ring&#8208;current strength of large molecular rings. Ring&#8208;current plots show that c&#8208;P6[b6]&#8901;T66+ (left) is much less aromatic than benzene (right).







Abstract
A recent article by Anderson and co&#8208;workers challenges our conclusions on the aromaticity of the four oxidation states of a butadyine&#8208;linked six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring, based on the experimental 1H&#8208;NMR data and some recent calculations they have performed using the BLYP35 functional. Here, we show that BLYP35 should be taken with caution and demonstrate that the indirect evidence of a ring current from experimental 1H&#8208;NMR data is not a definite proof of aromaticity.

&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;T6&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; (left) is much less aromatic than benzene (right).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent article by Anderson and co-workers challenges our conclusions on the aromaticity of the four oxidation states of a butadyine-linked six-porphyrin nanoring, based on the experimental &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR data and some recent calculations they have performed using the BLYP35 functional. Here, we show that BLYP35 should be taken with caution and demonstrate that the indirect evidence of a ring current from experimental &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR data is not a definite proof of aromaticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Porphyrin nanoring template complexes provide a wealth of experimental NMR spectroscopy data, which are sensitive to global ring currents and which can be used to answer this question. Both experiment and theory confirm that nanoring cations are globally (anti)aromatic based on magnetic shielding evidence, and consistent with H&#252;ckel's rule.







Abstract
A recent Research Article in this journal by Matito and co&#8208;workers claimed that none of the oxidation states of a butadiyne&#8208;linked six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring exhibit global aromaticity or antiaromaticity. Here we show that this conclusion is incorrect. Experimental data from NMR spectroscopy for a whole family of nanorings provide strong evidence for global ring currents. The NMR data reveal these ring currents directly, without needing analysis by density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, DFT calculations reproduce the experimental results when a suitable functional is used.

An efficient polyelectrolyte hole&#8208;transport layer was explored for 2D perovskite solar cells by using a compatible butylamine cation, as reported by Jianyu Yuan and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202205111). The tailored polyelectrolyte has an anchoring effect and acts as a passivator for 2D perovskites, which can improve 2D perovskite phase alignment and interfacial charge transfer efficiency, and finally enables high&#8208;efficiency and large&#8208;area 2D perovskite solar cells.

Flying elephants and delicate cargo. Electrospray ionization of proteins has been likened to making molecular elephants fly. In their Communication (e202202075), Helen&#8197;J. Cooper and co&#8208;workers demonstrate mass spectrometry detection and imaging of a non&#8208;covalent complex formed in&#8197;vivo, comprising an endogenous protein and an exogenously administered drug molecule, directly from liver tissue. These methods will provide greater insight into protein&#8211;drug complexes in support of drug research and development.

         <title>Cover Picture: A Stable and Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Isolated Active Sites for Highly Selective Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 36/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of CO2 to acetate provides a promising strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and store renewable energy, but acetate is usually a by&#8208;product. A covalent organic framework with isolated active sites for the highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to acetate is reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202206470). The copper&#8211;phthalocyanine active site with high electron density is conducive to the key step of C&#8722;C coupling of *CH3 with CO2 to produce acetate, and can avoid the coupling of *CO with *CO or *CHO to produce ethylene and ethanol.

A covalent organic framework with isolated active sites for the highly selective electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to acetate is reported by Pei-Qin Liao and co-workers in their Communication (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202206470"&gt;e202206470&lt;/a&gt;). The copper&#8211;phthalocyanine active site with high electron density is conducive to the key step of C&#8722;C coupling of *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce acetate, and can avoid the coupling of *CO with *CO or *CHO to produce ethylene and ethanol.

Atomically precise doping is a promising approach for functionalizing gold superatoms. In their Research Article (e202207290), Tatsuya Tsukuda and co&#8208;workers synthesized a series of M@Au12 superatoms (M=Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, or Ir) and investigated their photophysical and photochemical properties. Doping an M element positioned at the lower left of the periodic table led to a remarkable enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield and photocatalytic activities for intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of bisenone.

         <title>Spotting Trends in Organocatalyzed and Other Organomediated (De)polymerizations and Polymer Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest trends in polymer synthesis, depolymerization, and postpolymerization functionalization are reviewed, whereby organocatalysis and other organomediated methods take center stage. With today's growing emphasis on sustainability, we describe how transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategies offer fresh opportunities to access novel functional materials and also to valorize postconsumer plastic waste.







Abstract
Organocatalysis has evolved into an effective complement to metal&#8208; or enzyme&#8208;based catalysis in polymerization, polymer functionalization, and depolymerization. The ease of removal and greater sustainability of organocatalysts relative to transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based ones has spurred development in specialty applications, e.g., medical devices, drug delivery, optoelectronics. Despite this, the use of organocatalysis and other organomediated reactions in polymer chemistry is still rapidly developing, and we envisage their rapidly growing application in nascent areas such as controlled radical polymerization, additive manufacturing, and chemical recycling in the coming years. In this Review, we describe ten trending areas where we anticipate paradigm shifts resulting from novel organocatalysts and other transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. We highlight opportunities and challenges and detail how new discoveries could lead to previously inaccessible functional materials and a potentially circular plastics economy.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Monohydrosilane: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monohydrosilanes, which bear a Si&#8722;H bond, have been widely leveraged as chiral reagents for alcohol resolution, chiral auxiliaries, mechanistic probes, as well as potential optoelectronic materials. This Minireview comprehensively summarizes the synthesis and synthetic applications of silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, particularly the advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
Optically active organosilanes have been demonstrated to be versatile chiral reagents in synthetic chemistry since the early seminal contributions by Sommer and Corriu. Among these silicon&#8208;containing chiral architectures, monohydrosilanes, which bear a Si&#8722;H bond, hold a unique position because of their facile transformations through stereospecific Si&#8211;carbon or Si&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;formation reactions. In addition, those compounds have also been leveraged as chiral reagents for alcohol resolution, chiral auxiliaries, mechanistic probes, as well as potential optoelectronic materials. This Minireview comprehensively summarizes the synthesis and synthetic applications of silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, particularly the advances in the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of this class of functional molecules.

         <title>Azo Compounds as Active Materials of Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azo&#8208;containing compounds are promising active materials for rechargeable batteries and anolytes for redox flow batteries. The interaction between the N=N group and the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, the introduction of insoluble carboxylate groups, and polymerization lead to excellent battery performances. Azo molecules also showed excellent performance as both aqueous and organic anolyte of redox flow batteries.







Abstract
The rapid evolution of electrical devices and the increasing demand for the supply of sustainable energy necessitate the development of high&#8208;performance energy storage systems such as rechargeable and redox flow batteries. However, these batteries typically contain inorganic active materials, which exhibit several critical drawbacks hindering further development. In this regard, azo compounds are promising alternatives, offering the benefits of fast kinetics, multi&#8208;electron redox reactions, and tunable (via structural adjustment) battery performance.

     alt="Azo Compounds as Active Materials of Energy Storage Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azo-containing compounds are promising active materials for rechargeable batteries and anolytes for redox flow batteries. The interaction between the N=N group and the &#960;-conjugated structure, the introduction of insoluble carboxylate groups, and polymerization lead to excellent battery performances. Azo molecules also showed excellent performance as both aqueous and organic anolyte of redox flow batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid evolution of electrical devices and the increasing demand for the supply of sustainable energy necessitate the development of high-performance energy storage systems such as rechargeable and redox flow batteries. However, these batteries typically contain inorganic active materials, which exhibit several critical drawbacks hindering further development. In this regard, azo compounds are promising alternatives, offering the benefits of fast kinetics, multi-electron redox reactions, and tunable (via structural adjustment) battery performance. Herein, we review the use of azo compounds as the active materials of rechargeable and redox flow batteries, discuss certain aspects of material design and electrochemical reaction mechanisms, and summarize the corresponding perspectives and research directions to facilitate further progress in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Operando Visualization and Dynamic Manipulation of Electrochemical Processes at the Electrode&#8211;Solution Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in operando visualization method for investigating the dynamic processes occurring at the electrode&#8211;solution interface at the mesoscale is demonstrated. A novel microfabricated electrochemical cell (MEC) combined with a laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) fluorescence detection system was developed to observe high&#8208;resolution and fast&#8208;response ion accumulation and depletion in the diffusion layer.







Abstract
Revealing the dynamic processes at the electrode&#8211;solution interface is imperative for understanding electrochemical phenomena. Most techniques have been developed to sense the electrode surface changes at the nanoscale, but provide limited information on potential&#8208;induced interfacial ion redistribution at the mesoscale. Herein, we present an in operando visualization method utilizing a microfabricated electrochemical cell combined with a laser scanning confocal microscope to observe high&#8208;resolution and fast&#8208;response interfacial processes. We report potential&#8208;induced formation and transformation of the Nernst diffusion layer, demonstrating that pulsed voltage dynamically perturbs the interface and promotes ion diffusion. This provides an additional insight into developing a dynamic manipulation method to control the electrochemical process. Our novel visualization method can easily be applied to monitor different ionic behaviors in electrochemical reactions at the mesoscale.

Chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions are used for the first time to organize photoreactive systems, here (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpen) molecules, into rectangular motifs favoring cyclobutane formation through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photodimerizations, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of strong and directional ChB donors such as selenocyanate moieties toward topochemical reactions.







Abstract
The face&#8208;to&#8208;face association of (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpen) molecules into rectangular motifs stabilized for the first time by chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions is shown to provide photoreactive systems leading to cyclobutane formation through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photodimerizations. The chelating chalcogen bond donors are based on original aromatic, ortho&#8208;substituted bis(selenocyanato)benzene derivatives 1&#8211;3, prepared from ortho&#8208;diboronic acid bis(pinacol) ester precursors and SeO2 and malononitrile in 75&#8211;90&#8201;% yield. The very short intramolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se distance in 1&#8211;3 (3.22&#8211;3.24&#8197;&#197;), a consequence of a strong intramolecular ChB interaction, expands to 3.52&#8211;3.54&#8197;&#197; in the chalcogen&#8208;bonded adducts with bpen, a distance (&lt;4&#8197;&#197;) well adapted to the face&#8208;to&#8208;face association of the bpen molecules into the reactive position toward photochemical dimerization.

A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized 1,4&#8208;diborabenzene ligand enables the isolation of thermally stable two&#8208;legged parent piano&#8208;stool Fe0 and Ru0 complexes. The iron complex reacts with P4 and As4 to yield mixed diborabenzene&#8208;cyclo&#8208;E4 sandwich complexes with planar E42&#8722; ligands. Computational analyses confirm the strong electron&#8208;donating capacity of the DBB ligand and show that the E4 ligand is bound by four equivalent Fe&#8722;P &#963; bonds.

         <title>H2O2&#8208;Responsive NIR&#8208;II AIE Nanobomb for Carbon Monoxide Boosting Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The upregulated expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) impairs the therapeutic efficacy of photothermal therapy (PTT). Inhibition of HSPs repair is crucial for improving the efficiency of low&#8208;temperature PTT. The AIE nanobomb PBPTV@mPEG(CO) could be triggered by the over&#8208;expressed hydrogen peroxide in the tumor microenvironment and release CO to inhibit the upregulated expression of HSPs during low&#8208;temperature PTT to enhance the antitumor efficiency.







Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT), which circumvents the limitations of conventional PTT (e.g., thermotolerance and adverse effects), is an emerging therapeutic strategy which shows great potential for future clinical applications. The expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) can dramatically impair the therapeutic efficacy of PTT. Thus, inhibition of HSPs repair and reducing the damage of nearby normal cells is crucial for improving the efficiency of low&#8208;temperature PTT. Herein, we developed a nanobomb based on the self&#8208;assembly of NIRII AIE polymer PBPTV and carbon monoxide (CO) carrier polymer mPEG(CO). This smart nanobomb can be exploded in a tumor microenvironment in which hydrogen peroxide is overexpressed and release CO into cancer cells to significantly inhibit the expression of HSPs and hence improve the antitumor efficiency of the low&#8208;temperature PTT.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries Using a Urea&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Kinetically Favorable One&#8208;Electron Li2O2 Oxidation Pathways</title>

A new electrolyte solvent&#8212;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylurea (TMU) is proposed for lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Benefiting from its strong Li+&#8208;solvating ability and the absence of &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms, a kinetically favorable one&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation pathway can occur in the charge process, and the hydrogen extraction side reactions can be effectively suppressed. Consequently, the TMU&#8208;based LOBs exhibit a low charge overpotential and a long cycle life.







Abstract
Glymes are the most widely used electrolyte solvents in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs) due to their relatively high stability. However, their associated LOBs have long been plagued by large charge overpotential, which is closely related to the sluggish two&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation mechanism. Here, we report a new electrolyte solvent&#8212;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylurea (TMU) for LOBs with high performance and an alternative mechanism, where a kinetically favorable one&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation pathway can happen in the urea electrolyte system, thus leading to a much lower charge overpotential (&#8776;0.51&#8197;V) compared to the tetraglyme&#8208;based LOBs (&#8776;1.27&#8197;V). Besides, TMU also exhibits good stability since it does not contain any &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms that are vulnerable to be attacked by superoxide species, thus suppressing the hydrogen abstraction side reactions. Consequently, the TMU&#8208;based LOBs can stably work for more than 135&#8197;cycles, which is four times that of the tetraglyme&#8208;based LOBs (&#8776;28&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Synergy of Weakly&#8208;Solvated Electrolyte and Optimized Interphase Enables Graphite Anode Charge at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte and a high&#8208;quality SEI by room&#8208;temperature formation process, which enables graphite electrode with a fast&#8208;charging 6C&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature operation. Moreover, the Gr||LiFePO4 full cell exhibits a capacity retention of 78&#8201;% at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and a high discharge capacity of 37&#8201;% even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Graphite anode suffers from great capacity loss and even fails to charge (i.e. Li+&#8208;intercalation) under low temperature, mainly arising from the large overpotential including sluggish de&#8208;solvation process and insufficient ions movement in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, an electrolyte is developed by utilizing weakly solvated molecule ethyl trifluoroacetate and film&#8208;forming fluoroethylene carbonate to achieve smooth de&#8208;solvation and high ionic conductivity at low temperature. Evolution of SEI formed at different temperatures is further investigated to propose an effective room&#8208;temperature SEI formation strategy for low&#8208;temperature operations. The synergetic effect of tamed electrolyte and optimized SEI enables graphite with a reversible charge/discharge capacity of 183&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and fast&#8208;charging up to 6C&#8208;rate at room temperature. Moreover, graphite||LiFePO4 full cell maintains a capacity retention of 78&#8201;% at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, and 37&#8201;% even at a super&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. This work offers a progressive insight towards fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>PEG&#8208;Functionalized Hollow Multishelled Structures with On&#8208;Off Switch and Rate&#8208;Regulation for Controllable Antimicrobial Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel functionalized hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) has hierarchical shells as multilevel responsive bodies and uses polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a gated regulator. The interaction between PEG&#8208;functionalized shells endows them with a pH&#8208;responsive switch and rate&#8208;regulator capability. These features allow rapid release of molecules wrapped in the outer shell, and controlled diffusion of antimicrobials stored in the inner shell.







Abstract
The construction of responsive antimicrobial carriers with multifunctional and controllable release is an attractive but challenging proposition. Recently developed hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) offers structural advantages, such as easily modifiable surfaces and mutually influenced shells. Herein, we report a novel pH&#8208;responsive antimicrobial carrier having hierarchical shells as multilevel responsive bodies using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a gated regulator. The interaction between PEG&#8208;functionalized shells endows them with a pH&#8208;responsive switch and rate&#8208;regulator capability. These features are present in the form of rapid release of molecules wrapped in the outer shell, and controlled diffusion of antimicrobials stored in the inner shell by electrostatic interaction, resulting in a long&#8208;lasting mildew resistance for up to 71&#8197;days. The versatility of the hierarchical interactions of HoMSs will inspire the design of promising smart drug carriers.

         <title>Drug Repurposing by Siderophore Conjugation: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Siderophore&#8208;Methotrexate Conjugates as Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugation of methotrexate (Mtx) with a siderophore to construct &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; antibacterial conjugates is reported. The most potent conjugate exhibited over 1000&#8208;fold improved activity against Gram&#8208;positive Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram&#8208;negative Yersinia enterocolitica compared with Mtx, while possessing 2313&#8208;fold reduced human cytotoxicity, resulting in 2.08&#215;106&#8208;fold improvements in the therapeutic index.







Abstract
Drug repurposing is considered a promising strategy to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Methotrexate (Mtx), a classical anticancer drug, could strongly inhibit bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). However, its poor permeability into bacteria and potent human cytotoxicity make it unsuitable as an antibacterial. Herein, we reported the conjugation of Mtx with a siderophore to construct &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; antibacterials. The most potent conjugate 8 with nanomolar minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values exhibited over 1.00&#215;103&#8208;fold improved activity against Gram&#8208;positive Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Gram&#8208;negative Yersinia enterocolitica (Y. enterocolitica) compared with Mtx, while possessing 2.31&#215;103&#8208;fold reduced human cytotoxicity, resulting in 2.08&#215;106&#8208;fold improvements in the therapeutic index. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study verifies that siderophore conjugation is an effective strategy for developing new antibacterials from anticancer drugs.

The intact protein&#8211;drug complex formed in vivo between endogenous liver fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) and the small molecule therapeutic bezafibrate was detected in ex vivo liver tissue from orally dosed rats by native ambient mass spectrometry. The spatial distribution of the protein&#8211;drug complex was imaged by nanospray desorption electrospray ionization.







Abstract
Here, we demonstrate detection by mass spectrometry of an intact protein&#8211;drug complex directly from liver tissue from rats that had been orally dosed with the drug. The protein&#8211;drug complex comprised fatty acid binding protein 1, FABP1, non&#8208;covalently bound to the small molecule therapeutic bezafibrate. Moreover, we demonstrate spatial mapping of the [FABP1+bezafibrate] complex across a thin section of liver by targeted mass spectrometry imaging. This work is the first demonstration of in situ mass spectrometry analysis of a non&#8208;covalent protein&#8211;drug complex formed in vivo and has implications for early stage drug discovery by providing a route to target&#8208;drug characterization directly from the physiological environment.

         <title>A Stable and Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Isolated Active Sites for Highly Selective Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to multiple active sites, an isolated active site with high electron density may be more suitable for electroreduction of CO2 towards the C2 product acetate, and can avoid the coupling of *CO with *CO or *CHO to produce ethylene and ethanol.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to acetate provides a promising strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and store renewable energy, but acetate is usually a by&#8208;product. Here, we show a stable and conductive two&#8208;dimensional phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF) as an electrocatalyst for reduction of CO2 to acetate with a single&#8208;product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 90.3(2)% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and a current density of 12.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8197;M KHCO3 solution. No obvious degradation was observed over 80&#8197;hours of continuous operation. Combined with the comparison of the properties of other catalysts with isolated metal active sites, theoretical calculations and in situ infrared spectroscopy revealed that the isolated copper&#8208;phthalocyanine active site with high electron density is conducive to the key step of C&#8722;C coupling of *CH3 with CO2 to produce acetate, and can avoid the coupling of *CO with *CO or *CHO to produce ethylene and ethanol.

         <title>Crystal Structure Based Mutagenesis of Cattleyene Synthase Leads to the Generation of Rearranged Polycyclic Diterpenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of the diterpene synthase CyS was solved, providing the structural basis for cattleyene biosynthesis. A CySC59A mutant generated diterpenes with novel carbon skeletons. The remarkable cyclization mechanism of one of these products was characterized by isotopic labeling experiments.







Abstract
The crystal structures of cattleyene synthase (apo&#8208;CyS), and CyS complexed with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) were solved. The CySC59A variant exhibited an increased production of cattleyene and other diterpenes with diverse skeletons. Its structure showed a widened active site cavity explaining the relaxed selectivity. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed a remarkable cyclization mechanism involving several skeletal rearrangements for one of the novel diterpenes.

         <title>Dearomative Ring Expansion of Polycyclic Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A missing link between dearomative cyclopropanation and ring expansion of polycyclic (hetero)arenes has been established by utilizing an arenophile&#8208;based strategy. This two&#8208;step protocol enables the direct conversion of aromatic compounds into (aza)benzocycloheptatrienes, which are important structural motifs in natural products and biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Benzocycloheptenes constitute a common structural motif embedded in many natural products and biologically active compounds. Herein, we report their concise preparation from non&#8208;activated polycyclic arenes using a two&#8208;step sequence involving dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with arenophile in combination with palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation, followed by cycloreversion&#8208;initiated ring expansion. The described strategy provides a working alternative to the Buchner reaction, which is limited to monocyclic arenes. Overall, this methylene&#8208;insertion molecular editing approach enables rapid and direct conversion of simple (hetero)arenes into a range of substituted (aza)benzocycloheptatrienes, which can undergo a myriad of downstream functionalizations.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Oxidative Addition and Reductive Elimination of H2 Across a Gallium&#8208;Zinc Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydrogen reversibly adds across the Ga&#8722;Zn bond of a heterobimetallic cation. Oxidative addition is favoured in THF solution where the hydrogenation products are stabilized, but in fluorobenzene, reductive elimination of H2 is promoted by the Lewis&#8208;acidic zinc hydride cation.







Abstract
H2 adds reversibly across the metal&#8208;metal bond of [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;Zn(tmeda)(thf)][BAr4F] (BDI=[HC{C(CH3)N(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)}2]&#8722;, TMEDA=N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine, BAr4F&#8722;=[B(C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CF3)2)4]&#8722;). Due to the stabilising effect of solvent coordination, hydrogenation products [(BDI)GaH2] and [(tmeda)ZnH(thf)][BAr4F] are favoured in THF solution, but THF&#8208;free mixtures of [(BDI)GaH2] and [(tmeda)ZnH(OEt2)][BAr4F] are predisposed towards entropically driven dehydrogenation to [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;Zn(tmeda)][BAr4F] in fluorobenzene solution.

         <title>A Mechanochemical, Catalyst&#8208;Free Cascade Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diols and 1,4&#8208;Iodoalcohols Using Styrenes and Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>

         <dc:description>
Efficient mechanochemical electrophilic functionalization reactions of unsaturated compounds with hypervalent iodine reagents have been developed. These green and sustainable mechanochemical protocols enable the synthesis of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized molecules that are otherwise difficult to achieve via standard solution&#8208;phase methods. Our mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds in an intermolecular fashion.







Abstract
A mechanochemical and solvent/catalyst&#8208;free functionalization of olefins with hypervalent iodine reagents has been developed, enabling the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dioxygenated compounds. Under similar reaction conditions with the addition of molecular iodine, 1,4&#8208;iodoalcohols can be synthesized. These valuable products are non&#8208;trivial to achieve via standard solution&#8208;phase methods. Mechanistic study reveals that the hypervalent iodine reagent might dimerize at solid state with the help of mechanical force. The active monomeric form of hypervalent iodine reagent might trigger the 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization reactions in an intermolecular cascade manner.

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of 1,4&#8208;Nonadjacent Stereocenters via Hydroalkylation of Racemic Allylic Alcohols Enabled by Copper/Ruthenium Relay Catalysis</title>

An unprecedented stereodivergent hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols and racemic ketimine esters enabled by dual Cu/Ru relay catalysis has been developed. Merging the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric borrowing&#8208;hydrogen reaction with a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition into a one&#8208;pot procedure provided a route to highly functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxyesters bearing 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
An unprecedented hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols and racemic ketimine esters enabled by Cu/Ru relay catalysis has been developed via merging the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric borrowing&#8208;hydrogen reaction with a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition in a one&#8208;pot procedure. The current method enables the efficient preparation of highly functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxyesters bearing 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters in good yields with high levels of diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The full complement of the four stereoisomers of hydroalkylation products could be readily accessed by orthogonal permutations of two chiral metal catalysts. The current work highlights the power of relay catalysis for the stereodivergent construction of 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters that were otherwise inaccessible.

         <title>Methyl Substitution Destabilizes Alkyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical stability decreases, and not increases, from methyl to primary to secondary to tertiary. This is not conflicting with the fact that the C&#8722;H bond becomes weaker along the corresponding series H3C&#8722;H, MeH2C&#8722;H, Me2HC&#8722;H, and Me3C&#8722;H. The resolution to this seeming contradiction is that the parent MemH3&#8722;mC&#8722;H is destabilized even more upon methyl substitution than the radical MemH3&#8722;mC&#8901;.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically investigated how methyl substituents affect the stability of alkyl radicals MemH3&#8722;mC&#8901; and the corresponding MemH3&#8722;mC&#8722;X bonds (X&#8201;=&#8201;H, CH3, OH; m&#8201;=&#8201;0&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;3) using density functional theory at M06&#8208;2X/TZ2P. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in physical organic chemistry is that alkyl radicals are stabilized upon an increase in their degree of substitution from methyl&lt;primary&lt;secondary&lt;tertiary, and that this is the underlying cause for the decrease in C&#8722;H bond strength along this series. Here, we provide evidence that falsifies this model and show that, on the contrary, the MemH3&#8722;mC&#8901; radical is destabilized with increasing substitution. The reason that the corresponding C&#8722;H bond nevertheless becomes weaker is that substitution destabilizes the sterically more congested MemH3&#8722;mC&#8722;H molecule even more.

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Highly Efficient High Salinity Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polyzwitterionic hydrogel as highly efficient solar evaporator is developed for high&#8208;salinity solar desalination. The hydrogel evaporator could achieve a rapid solar evaporation rate of 4.14&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with high energy efficiency (&#8776;94&#8201;%) in 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% brine. This polyzwitterionic hydrogel offers insight to design next&#8208;generation solar evaporators for high&#8208;salinity brine.







Abstract
Interfacial solar vapor generation (SVG) is regarded as a promising and sustainable strategy for clean water production. While many materials have demonstrated excellent evaporation rates under one sun, it remains challenging to design solar evaporators without compromising SVG performance in high&#8208;salinity brines (&#8805;10&#8197;wt&#8201;%). Herein, polyzwitterionic hydrogels (PZHs) are proposed as a novel platform for high&#8208;salinity solar desalination. Taking advantage of the unique anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, PZHs can trap salt ions from the brine water to form a more hydrated polymer network, leading to enhanced SVG performance. PZHs exhibit an exceptional solar evaporation rate of 4.14&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% brine, which is &#8776;20&#8201;% higher than that in pure water. It is anticipated that salt&#8208;responsive PZHs may provide insights for the design of next&#8208;generation solar desalination systems.

         <title>Work&#8208;function&#8208;induced Interfacial Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Os&#8208;OsSe2 Heterostructures for Active Acidic and Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional favorable charge balance is generated at Os&#8208;OsSe2 interfaces. The built&#8208;in electric field provides highly efficient HER active sites, accelerating the kinetics toward water electrolysis for hydrogen production.







Abstract
Theoretical calculations unveil that the formation of Os&#8208;OsSe2 heterostructures with neutralized work function (WF) perfectly balances the electronic state between strong (Os) and weak (OsSe2) adsorbents and bidirectionally optimizes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Os sites, significantly reducing thermodynamic energy barrier and accelerating kinetics process. Then, heterostructural Os&#8208;OsSe2 is constructed for the first time by a molten salt method and confirmed by in&#8208;depth structural characterization. Impressively, due to highly active sites endowed by the charge balance effect, Os&#8208;OsSe2 exhibits ultra&#8208;low overpotentials for HER in both acidic (26&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and alkaline (23&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) media, surpassing commercial Pt catalysts. Moreover, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen device assembled with Os&#8208;OsSe2 further highlights its potential application prospects. Profoundly, this special heterostructure provides a new model for rational selection of heterocomponents.

&lt;p&gt;Theoretical calculations unveil that the formation of Os-OsSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures with neutralized work function (WF) perfectly balances the electronic state between strong (Os) and weak (OsSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) adsorbents and bidirectionally optimizes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Os sites, significantly reducing thermodynamic energy barrier and accelerating kinetics process. Then, heterostructural Os-OsSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is constructed for the first time by a molten salt method and confirmed by in-depth structural characterization. Impressively, due to highly active sites endowed by the charge balance effect, Os-OsSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits ultra-low overpotentials for HER in both acidic (26&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and alkaline (23&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) media, surpassing commercial Pt catalysts. Moreover, the solar-to-hydrogen device assembled with Os-OsSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; further highlights its potential application prospects. Profoundly, this special heterostructure provides a new model for rational selection of heterocomponents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Au20(tBu3P)8: A Highly Symmetric Metalloid Gold Cluster in Oxidation State 0</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretically long&#8208;studied Au20 cluster was synthesized by a wet chemistry approach, solely stabilized by phosphine ligands. The presented superatom cluster possesses a high symmetrical structure and an oxidation state of the gold atoms of &#177;0.







Abstract
Metalloid gold clusters have unique properties with respect to size and structure and are key intermediates in studying transitions between molecular compounds and the bulk phase of the respective metal. In the following, the synthesis of the all&#8208;phosphine protected metalloid cluster Au20(tBu3P)8, solely built from gold atoms in the oxidation state of 0 is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a highly symmetric hollow cube&#8208;octahedral arrangement of the gold atoms, resembling gold bulk structure. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations illustrated the cluster can be described as a 20&#8208;electron superatom. Optical properties of the compound have shown molecular&#8208;like behavior.

         <title>(4+3) Annulation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and Azadienes: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Azepanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azepanones are important and widespread seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, but their synthesis is challenging. A convergent method to access these scaffolds was developed relying on a (4+3) annulation reaction of azadienes and donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Good to excellent yields and high diastereoselectivity were achieved using Yb(OTf)3 as the catalyst. Asymmetric induction was possible with Cu(OTf)2 in the presence of a trisoxazoline (Tox) ligand.







Abstract
Azepanes are important seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, which are present in numerous natural and synthetic compounds. However, the development of convergent synthetic methods to access them remains challenging. Herein, we report the Lewis acid catalyzed (4+3) annulative addition of aryl and amino donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes. Densely substituted azepane derivatives were obtained in good to excellent yields and with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction occurred under mild conditions with ytterbium triflate as the catalyst. The use of copper triflate with a trisoxazoline (Tox) ligand led to an enantioselective transformation. The obtained cycloadducts were convenient substrates for a series of further modifications, showing the synthetic utility of these compounds.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Triggered Polar Polymorph Formation: &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3, a Promising Next&#8208;Generation Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key mechanism of additives in the formation of noncentrosymmetric solids has been clarified for the first time based on a new metastable &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3, which exhibits excellent mid&#8208;IR NLO properties including the strongest SHG responses and the largest band gap for a rare&#8208;earth iodate, a sufficient birefringence, and a wide optical transparency window.







Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) solids have attracted interest for their potential in ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical (NLO) devices, but their synthesis remains a major challenge. In this study, the additive Li2CO3 triggers formation of an NCS precursor at an early nucleation stage, and plays a crucial role in the successful polymorphism transformation. The resultant metastable &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3 is a promising mid&#8208;infrared NLO crystal, with the strongest second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (2.2&#215;KTiOPO4 @ 2100&#8197;nm, 16&#215;KH2PO4 @ 1064&#8197;nm) and the largest optical band gap (4.52&#8197;eV) for a rare&#8208;earth iodate, as well as sufficient birefringence (&#916;n=0.219 @ 546&#8197;nm) for type I phase&#8208;matching, and wide optical transparency, which are induced by optimal alignment of the iodate anions. This study reveals the key role of additives in the growth of polar NCS solids, a discovery with implications for the strategic design of new NCS polymorphism materials with exceptional NLO properties.

         <title>An Organo&#8208;Palladium Host Built from a Dynamic Macrocyclic Ligand: Adaptive Self&#8208;Assembly, Induce&#8208;Fit Guest Binding, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial hosts with rich conformational dynamics are attractive to supramolecular chemists due to their adaptive guest binding properties and enzyme&#8208;like catalytic functions. We report here the adaptive self&#8208;assembly and host&#8208;guest catalysis of a new water&#8208;soluble organo&#8208;palladium host (Pd  2  L  2  ) built from a pyridinium&#8208;bonded macrocyclic ligand (L) and  cis  &#8208;blocked palladium corners (Pd). While direct self&#8208;assembly with L and Pd gives rise to a dynamic mixture of products, both neutral polyaromatic hydrocarbons and an anionic polyoxometalate cluster (W  10  O  32  4&#8208;  ) can template the sole formation of the Pd  2  L  2  host. Guest&#8208;adaptive conformational changes and induced&#8208;fit cavity deformation on the Pd  2  L  2  host have been clearly observed on the crystal structures. Moreover, the installation of the electron&#8208;rich W  10  O  32  4&#8208;  cluster within the cationic redox&#8208;active host (W  10  O  32  &#8834;Pd  2  L  2  ) facilitates efficient and selective C&#8208;H photooxidation of toluene derivatives to aldehyde products under mild conditions, representing an ideal platform for green supramolecular catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2||Graphite Batteries Operating at &#8208;60 &#730;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rechargeability of contemporary lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is challenging at low temperatures, mainly due to the hurdles faced by graphite anodes. Herein, by exploiting the Li&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite, its low&#8208;temperature rechargeability is boosted. Experimental characterizations aided by theoretical calculations demonstrate that the co&#8208;intercalation process is featured by low interfacial resistance with a small charge transfer activation energy (0.23 eV atom&#8208;1  ) and an extremely low diffusion energy barrier (0.09 eV atom&#8208;1  ) which leads to nearly temperature&#8208;independent diffusion coefficients of the solvated Li&#8208;ion in graphite, enabling graphite to be stably charged&#8208;discharged at &#8208;60 &#730;C with 73.7% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity. Consequently, the full&#8208;cell consisting of a LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2  cathode and a graphite anode shows impressive rechargeability under &#8208;60 &#730;C. This work provides an alternative approach to develop low&#8208;temperature rechargeable LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Hydrazides by One&#8208;Pot Sequential Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first catalytic enantioselective and diastereoselective synthesis of atropisomeric hydrazides was achieved using a sequential catalysis protocol. This strategy is based on a one&#8208;pot sequence of two organocatalytic cycles featuring the enamine amination of branched aldehydes followed by nitrogen alkylation under phase&#8208;transfer conditions. The resulting axially chiral hydrazides were obtained directly from commercially available reagents in high yields and with good stereocontrol. The permutation of organocatalysts allowed easy access to all stereoisomers, enabling a stereodivergent approach to enantioenriched atropisomeric hydrazides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetically versatile electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;electron systems are urgently needed for organic electronics, yet their design and synthesis are challenging due to the low reactivity from large electron affinities. In this work, we report a benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8&#8208;gh]quinoline diamide (BQQDA) &#960;&#8208;electron system. The electron&#8208;rich condensed amide as opposed to the generally&#8208;employed imide provides a suitable electronic feature for chemical versatility to tailor the BQQDA &#960;&#8208;electron system for various electronic applications. We demonstrate an effective synthetic method to furnish the target BQQDA parent structure, and highly selective functionalization can be performed on bay positions of the &#960;&#8208;skeleton. In addition, thionation of BQQDA can be achieved under mild conditions. Fine&#8208;tuning of fundamental properties and supramolecular packing motifs are achieved via chemical modifications, and the cyanated BQQDA organic semiconductor demonstrates a high air&#8208;stable electron&#8208;carrier mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Reforming of Polyol&#8208;based Biomass into CO and H2 over Nitrogen&#8208;doped WO3 with Built&#8208;in Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO and H2  evolution from renewable and abundant biomass represent a sustainable way,  but is challenged to be produced under mild conditions. Herein, we propose to produce CO and H2  from biomass via a divided photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell at room temperature. Nitrogen doped tungsten trioxide (N&#8208;WO3  ) photoanode reforms biopolyols to CO and H+  , and platinum cathode reduces H+  to H2  , achieving CO evolution rate of 45 mmol m&#8722;2  h&#8722;1  (&gt;75 % gas selectivity) and H2  evolution rate of 237 mmol m&#8722;2  h&#8722;1  with purity &gt;99.99% from glycerol. The nitrogen doping induces structure polarity of WO3  photoanode, leading to the formation of an internal electric field which promotes the separation and transfer of the photoinduced charges and improves PEC efficiency. A wide range of biopolyols, such as ethylene glycol, xylose, fructose, glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and inulin were effectively converted into CO and H2  . This work provides a promising method to produce highly pure H2  together with CO from biomass.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose to produce CO and H2  from biomass via a divided photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell at room temperature. Nitrogen doped tungsten trioxide (N-WO3  ) photoanode reforms biopolyols to CO and H+  , and platinum cathode reduces H+  to H2  , achieving CO evolution rate of 45 mmol m&#8722;2  h&#8722;1  (&amp;gt;75 % gas selectivity) and H2  evolution rate of 237 mmol m&#8722;2  h&#8722;1  with purity &amp;gt;99.99% from glycerol. The nitrogen doping induces structure polarity of WO3  photoanode, leading to the formation of an internal electric field which promotes the separation and transfer of the photoinduced charges and improves PEC efficiency. A wide range of biopolyols, such as ethylene glycol, xylose, fructose, glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and inulin were effectively converted into CO and H2  . This work provides a promising method to produce highly pure H2  together with CO from biomass.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The quest of the active species in copper&#8208;mediated difluoromethylation of aryl halides led to the discovery of a powerful difluoromethylating reagent [Ph  4  P]  +  [Cu(CF  2  H)  2  ]  &#8211;  2  . Complex  2  was able to difluoromethylate a variety of electrophiles including electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides, heteroaryl iodides, activated heteroaryl bromides, chloride and aryl bromides with a directing group, as well as other electrophiles such as alkenyl iodide, benzyl bromides, allyl bromides, alkyl iodide, allyl carbonates and acid chloride. In addition, in the presence of an oxidant, complex  2  reacted with various lithium nbutyl arylboronic acid pinacol esters, alkyne and heteroarene. Moreover, complex  2  could transmetalate the difluoromethyl reagent to other metals such as [Ph  4  P]  +  [CuCl  2  ]  &#8211;  and [(DPPF)PdCl  2  ].</dc:description>

Vibrational frequency and TDDFT calculations (LH20t&#8208;D3(BJ), def2&#8208;SVP, COSMO (CH  2  Cl  2  )) on ([{Cp*(dppe)RuC&#926;C}  2  (&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;C  &#173;6  &#173;H  3  &#8208;n&#8208;OMe)]  +  (n = 2, 4, 5) models are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The stronger ground state coupling is attributed to the change in composition of the b&#8208;HOSO brought about by the 4&#8208;OMe group, which is  ortho  or  para  to each of the metal fragments. The intensity of the IVCT transition increases with the greater overlap of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO and &#946;&#8208;LUSO, whilst the relative phases of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO and &#946;&#8208;LUSO in the 4&#8208;OMe substituted complex are consistent with predictions of constructive quantum interference from molecular circuit rules.</dc:description>

         <title>Static and Dynamic Gradient Based Directional Transportation of Neutral Molecules in Swollen Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Materials which selectively transport molecules offer powerful opportunities for concentrating and separating chemical agents. Here, utilizing static and dynamic chemical gradients, transport of molecules within swollen crosslinked polymers is demonstrated. Using an ~200 &#181;m static hydroxyl to hexyl gradient, the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate (DECP) is directionally transported and concentrated 60&#8208;fold within 4 hours. To accelerate transport kinetics, a dynamic gradient (a &#8216;travelling wave&#8217;) is utilized. Here, the non&#8208;polar dye pyrene was transported. The dynamic gradient is generated by an ion exchange process triggered by the localized introduction of an aqueous NaCl solution, which converts the gel from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. As the hydrophilic region expands, associated water enters the gel, and pyrene is pushed ahead of the expansion front. The dynamic gradient provides about 10&#8208;fold faster transport kinetics than the static gradient.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidative Azidation/Heterocyclization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides under Buffer Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the aromatic tryptophan (Trp) side chain plays a pivotal role in influencing the structure and function of peptides and proteins, it has become an attractive target for the late&#8208;stage modification of these important biomolecules. In this work, we report an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides containing Trp side chain  via  manganese&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical azidation/heterocyclization. This electrochemical oxidative strategy provides access to azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]indole&#8208;containing peptides with broad functional group tolerances, high site&#8208;selectivity, and good yields of products (up to 87%) under mild buffer conditions. Moreover, the modified Trp&#8208;containing peptides bearing azide functionality are promising building blocks, paving the way for the construction of various derivatives such as &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as attractive platforms for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. In this study, we have implemented a gradient heating strategy to synthesize a sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based COF, COF&#8208;JLU100, exhibiting high crystallinity, large surface area, good durability and carrier mobility for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The Pt&#8208;doped COF&#8208;JLU100 demonstrated a high hydrogen evolution rate of over 100,000 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for water splitting under visible&#8208;light illumination (&#955; &gt; 420 nm). Experimental and theoretical studies corroborate that the cyano&#8208;vinylene segments in COF&#8208;JLU100 extend the &#960;&#8208;delocalization and enable fast charge transfer and separation rates as well as good dispersion in water. Moreover, COF&#8208;JLU100 can be prepared by low&#8208;cost and easily available monomers and has excellent stability, which is desirable for practical solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Be4B12+: A Covalently Bonded Archimedean Beryllo&#8208;Borospherene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene is reported herein theoretically. Boron motif undergoes drastic structural changes upon gradual beryllium doping in BenB12+ (n = 1&#8208;4) stoichiometries. The global minimum of the Be4B12+ cluster is a highly closed Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene in a 2A1 electronic ground state, composed of four B3 triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms. Beryllium can form strong bonding with boron clusters through strong electrostatic and covalent interaction. The bonding between a beryllium atom and Be3B12 unit is best described as a Be+ in a 2P excited state forming a strong and polarized electron&#8208;sharing bond with Be3B12 followed by several dative interactions by employing its vacant s, p, and very high&#8208;lying d orbitals. Counterintuitively, for an s&#8208;block element, the p orbitals of beryllium are the most crucial atomic orbitals for bonding rather than s orbitals.</dc:description>

Counterintuitively, for an s-block element, the p orbitals of beryllium are the most crucial atomic orbitals for bonding rather than s orbitals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hybrid Antiperovskite with Strong Linear and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiperovskites have been studied since the 1980s because of their rich physical and chemical properties, but their linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses remain largely unknown. Here we report a new polar crystal, Cs3Cl(HC3N3S3) (I), which features a quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional antiperovskite structure composed of ClCs6  polyhedra and A&#8208;site [HC3N3S3]2&#8208;  rings. To our best knowledge, this kind of antiperovskite structure is reported for the first time. Remarkably,  I  exhibits a very strong nonlinear optical response up to 11.4 times that of the benchmark KH2PO4  and an exceptionally large birefringence of 0.52. The first&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that [HC3N3S3]2&#8208;  is the &#8220;material gene&#8221; while the antiperovskite structural feature makes it in a favorable arrangement. This work provides a new structural platform for the rational design of integrated optoelectronic materials with linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Carboxylation of Organic Halides in the Presence of Catalytic Amounts of an Organomediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an electroreductive carboxylation of organic carbon&#8208;halogen bonds (X = Br and Cl) promoted by catalytic amounts of naphthalene as an organic mediator is reported. This transformation proceeds smoothly under mild conditions with a broad substrate scope of 59 examples, affording the valuable and versatile carboxylic acids in moderate to excellent yields without the need of costly transition metal, wasted stoichiometric metal reductants, or sacrificial anodes. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural product and drug derivatives demonstrate its synthetic utility. Mechanistic studies confirmed the activation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds  via  single&#8208;electron transfer and the key role of naphthalene in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic and Stereoselective Transformations with Easily Accessible and Purchasable Allyl and Alkenyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereochemically defined organofluorine compounds are vital to drug discovery and many applicable catalytic strategies have been introduced for accessing these entities stereoselectively. One entails incorporation of a fluorine atom (C&#8211;F bond formation) or an organofluorine moiety (e.g., CF  3  or CF  2  H) , and another exploits commercially available compounds with one or more fluorine atoms. Here, our aim is to present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art regarding the use of alkenyl and allylic fluorides in preparation of stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules. Allylic and alkenyl fluorides may be purchased or generated from a commercially available acid, carboxylate salt, ester, aldehyde hydrate, or ketone bearing several fluorine atoms next to a carbonyl group. We underscore the untapped potential of purchasable organofluorine compounds, many allylic and alkenyl fluorides, as launching points for development of stereoselective processes that are of value to therapeutic science.</dc:description>

         <title>Torsional Strain&#8208;Independent Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile bridged biaryls is emerging as a powerful strategy for atropisomer synthesis. However, the reported examples suffer from an inherent challenge as the reactivity is highly dependent on the torsional strain of the biaryl substrates, which significantly narrows down the scope and hampers the application.  Herein, we report our discovery and development of a torsional strain&#8208;independent reaction between biaryl thionolactones and activated isocyanides. By employing auto&#8208;tandem silver catalysis, a universal synthesis of both  tri  &#8208; and  tetra  &#8208;  ortho  &#8208;substituted thiazole&#8208;containing biaryls was realized in high yields with high enantioselectivities. In addition, these products could be facilely converted to a novel type of bridged biaryls bearing an eight&#8208;membered lactone. Mechanistic studies were carried out to elucidate the cause of this unusual torsional strain&#8208;independent reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination of Electron&#8208;Rich Aryl Fluorides by an Anionic Rhodium&#8208;Gallium Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex catalyzed the hydrodefluorination of challenging C&#8722;F bonds in electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides and trifluoroarenes when irradiated with violet light in the presence of H  2  , a stoichiometric alkoxide base, and a crown&#8208;ether additive. Based on theoretical calculations, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is delocalized across both the Rh and Ga atoms, becomes singly occupied upon excitation, thereby poising the Rh&#8722;Ga complex for photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Stoichiometric and control reactions support that the C&#8722;F activation is mediated by the excited anionic Rh&#8208;Ga complex. After SET, the proposed neutral Rh(0) intermediate was detected by EPR spectroscopy, which matched the spectrum of an independently synthesized sample. Deuterium&#8208;labeling studies corroborate the generation of aryl radicals during catalysis and their subsequent hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction from the THF solvent to generate the hydrodefluorinated arene products. Altogether, the combined experimental and theoretical data support an unconventional bimetallic excitation that achieves the activation of strong C&#8722;F bonds and uses H  2  and base as the terminal reductant.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Fluorination of Selenium and Tellurium Compounds using a Thermally Stable Phosphonium SF5&#8208; Salt Accessible from SF6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated group 16 moieties are attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry but only few synthetic methods are available to prepare them. Herein, we report a new oxidative fluorination reagent capable of stabilizing reactive fluorinated anions. It consists of an SF  5  &#8722;  anion and a chemically inert phosphonium cation and is exceptionally thermally stable. Accordingly, it was used to generate the SeF  5  &#8722;  and TeF  5  &#8722;  anions from the elemental chalcogens and to prepare the unknown tetrafluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;  5  &#8208;selenates PhSeF  4  &#8722;  and &#8208;tellurates PhTeF  4  &#8722;  from the corresponding diphenyl dichalcogenides. In addition, we show that further derivatization of PhTeF  4  &#8722;  by oxidation to  trans  &#8208;PhTeF  4  O  &#8722;  and subsequent alkylation gives access to a new class of  trans  &#8208;(alkoxy)(phenyl)tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;  6  &#8208;tellanes (  trans  &#8208;PhTeF  4  OR), thus providing an approach to introduce the functional group into organic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Reimplementing Guest Shape Sorting of Nonporous Adaptive Crystals via Substituent&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Solid&#8208;Vapor Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Postsynthetic modification (PSM) has been widely used in porous crystalline materials to gain better performance in adsorptive separation of gases or hydrocarbons. We here report that guest adsorption selectivity in a kind of nonporous crystalline materials, namely nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs), can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor PSM method. Before PSM, NACs of pillar[4]arene[1]quinone  EtP4Q1  show negligible selectivity for C  5  hydrocarbons. PSM with a larger substituent, cyclopentylamine, onto  EtP4Q1  NACs does not improve the selectivity, while  EtP4Q1  NACs after PSM with a slightly smaller substituent, cyclobutylamine, is endowed with very high preference of  n  &#8208;pentane over cyclopentane. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions among the host compounds and host&#8722;guest interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate are the two major factors in determining the guest selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Modulated Release of a Cytotoxic Photosensitizer Using Photogenerated Reactive Oxygen Species and Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry is of particular interest in drug delivery systems. However, high levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells are hardly distinguished from GSH in normal cells, resulting in unmanageable cytotoxic drug release. This study investigates the spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled irreversible degradation of Ir&#8208;based photosensitizer (TIr3)&#8208;encapsulating nanogels (IrNG) through the hyperoxidation of resulting intracellular thiols using reactive oxygen species (ROS). A highly cytotoxic TIr3 was stably encapsulated within IrNG through hydrophobic interactions and reversible crosslinking between its disulfide bonds and thiols in the absence of light, resulting in high biocompatibility under normal cellular conditions. However, upon photoirradiation, TIr3 generated high levels of ROS, irreversibly oxidizing the thiols to induce electrostatic repulsion between the polymer molecules, resulting in the TIr3 release and induction of cancer cell apoptosis.</dc:description>
