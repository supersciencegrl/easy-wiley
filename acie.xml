         <title>Coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking electrolytes for fast lithium&#8208;ion conduction and solid&#8208;state battery applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable batteries paired with lithium (Li) metal anodes are considered to be promising high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, the use of highly reactive Li metal and the formation of Li dendrites during battery operation would cause safety concerns, especially with the employment of highly flammable liquid electrolytes. Herein, a general strategy by engineering coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking networks is proposed to achieve high&#8208;performance solid polymer electrolytes. Through the coordination of metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with cellulose&#8208;based copolymers, the Li+&#8208;conducted hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP&#8208;Li) polymer network is capable of enabling the rapid transport of Li+. In addition to the high Li+ conductivity (1.02&#215;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte also exhibits a high Li+ transference number (0.75) and a wide electrochemical stability window. Benefiting from the thermally stable and mechanically strong CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte film, the short&#8208;circuiting of the symmetric batteries is prevented even after 3200 h of cycling and a high specific energy of 300 Wh kg&#8722;1 is achieved for the Li&#8211;metal battery. The solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;air batteries fabricated with CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte also show good cycling performance (500 cycles) and high discharge capacity (15740 mAh g&#8722;1). The proposed coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking strategies offer an alternative route to design high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation sustainable battery chemistries.</dc:description>

         <title>An Advanced 3D Crosslinked Conductive Binder for Silicon Anodes: Leveraging Glycerol Chemistry for Superior Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon (Si) anodes hold great promise for high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet their practical application is hindered by severe volume expansion and mechanical degradation. To tackle these challenges, we present an innovative 3D crosslinked conductive polyoxadiazole (POD) binder engineered with glycerol (GL) to form a robust network of covalent and hydrogen bonds. This unique chemical architecture not only enhances adhesion and mechanical resilience to effectively dissipate the stresses induced by Si&#8217;s volumetric changes but also constructs a robust conductive framework to facilitate electron transfer. The dynamic interplay between strong covalent and flexible hydrogen bonds in the POD&#8208;c&#8208;GL binder enables superior structural integrity and stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) during cycling. The Si@POD&#8208;c&#8208;GL anode exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance, including a high initial Coulombic efficiency, impressive rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability, with an extremely low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.022% per cycle for 1000 cycles. This work highlights the potential of harnessing in&#8208;situ crosslinking chemistry to develop advanced binders, paving the way for the next generation of high&#8208;performance silicon anodes in LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Benzo&#8208;Phenoselenazine Derivatives for Multi&#8208;Subcellular Biomolecule Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elucidating the subcellular localization of RNAs and proteins is fundamental to understanding their biological functions. Genetically encoded proteins/enzymes provide an attractive approach to target many proteins of interest, but are limited to specific cell lines. Although small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based methods have been explored, a comprehensive system for profiling multiple locations in living cells, comparable to fusion&#8208;protein techniques, is yet to be established. In this study, we introduce a novel proximity labeling strategy employing a suite of small molecules derived from benzophenoselenazine (e.g., selenium&#8208;containing Nile Blue [SeNB]), which achieves proximity labeling through singlet oxygen generation upon near&#8208;infrared light activation in the presence of propargylamine. These SeNB compounds allow for&#160;selective labeling of RNAs and proteins within living cells, exhibiting a distinct preference for organelle membranes, which are systematically investigated via in vitro, computational, and in cellulo examinations. Our findings highlight the capabilities of SeNB derivatives as wash&#8208;free and genetics&#8208;free approaches to illuminate the subcellular localization of biological molecules with deep penetration and high spatial resolution. Moreover, SeNB derivatives are capable of elucidating inter&#8208;organelle interactions at the molecular level, as evidenced by proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, thus holding significant potential for advancing our understanding of cellular processes related to disease progression and therapeutic development.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (CROPISA) of 2&#8208;oxazolines: From block copolymers to one&#8208;step gradient copolymer nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has emerged as a powerful method for the straightforward synthesis of polymer nanoparticles. In this study, we describe for the first time the synthesis of poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) nanoparticles by dispersion cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (CROPISA) in n&#8208;dodecane. Specifically, a n&#8208;dodecane&#8208;soluble aliphatic poly(2&#8208;(3&#8208;ethylheptyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEHOx) block was chain&#8208;extended with poly(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PPhOx). While the PhOx monomer is soluble in n&#8208;dodecane, its polymerization leads to n&#8208;dodecane&#8208;insoluble PPhOx, which leads to in situ self&#8208;assembly of the formed PEHOx&#8208;b&#8208;PPhOx copolymers. The polymerization kinetics and micellization upon second block formation were studied, and diverse nanoparticle dispersions were prepared, featuring varying block lengths and polymer concentrations, leading to dispersions with distinctive morphologies and physical properties. Finally, we developed a single&#8208;step protocol for the synthesis of polymer nanoparticles directly from monomers via gradient copolymerization CROPISA, which exploits the significantly greater reactivity of EHOx compared to that of PhOx during the statistical copolymerization of both monomers. Notably, this approach provides access to formulations with monomer compositions otherwise unattainable through the block copolymerization method. Given the synthetic versatility and application potential of poly(2&#8208;oxazolines), the developed CROPISA method can pave the way for advanced nanomaterials with favorable properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohol Self&#8208;Aggregation: the Preferred Configurations of the Ethanol Trimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An atomic&#8208;level knowledge of the aggregation of archetypal molecular systems is essential to accurately model supramolecular structures and the transition from gas to liquid phase. The structures and forces involved in ethanol aggregation have been investigated using chirped&#8208;pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and extensive quantum chemical calculations. Four isomers of ethanol trimer have been observed and identified based on comparisons between experimental and predicted spectroscopic parameters, and considering collisional relaxation in the supersonic expansion. All observed isomers exhibit O&#8722;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups forming a six&#8208;membered ring. Additionally, secondary C&#8722;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bonds and H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H dispersion contacts participate in&#160;the stabilization of the complexes with remarkably similar energy contributions. Structures where there is a mixture of gauche and trans conformations of ethanol are favored, with gauche conformations being predominant and no evidence of homochirality synchronization. Our results underscore the critical changes involved in aggregation as the size of the system increases and shed light on the unique properties and behavior of ethanol in chemical and biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Characterization and Molecular Basis of a Multi&#8208;site Halogenase in Naphthacemycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogenases are spurring a growing interest in the fields of biosynthesis and biocatalysis. Despite various halogenases have been identified in numerous natural product biosynthetic pathways, the mechanisms for multiple halogenations and site&#8208;selectivity remain largely unclear. In this study, we biochemically characterize FasV, a FAD&#8208;dependent halogenase (FDH) that catalyzes five successive chlorinations in the biosynthesis of naphthacene&#8208;containing aromatic polyketide naphthacemycin. This multiple halogenation reaction is elucidated occurring in an orderly fashion, as evidenced by enzyme kinetics, time&#8208;course assays, and computational simulations. Crystallographic analyses and mutagenesis studies reveal previously unrecognized amino acid residues, including T53, L81, F93, and I212, that are crucial for controlling regioselectivity and substrate specificity. Based on this, a I212T mutant is generated to exclusively catalyze selective monohalogenation. We propose a novel dual&#8208;activation mechanism, and demonstrate that FasV&#8217;s larger binding pocket makes it a valuable biocatalyst for other substrate with diverse structure. Therefore, this study provides new insights into multi&#8208;site polyhalogenases and highlights the potential for engineering FasV&#8208;like FDHs for biocatalytic applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Halogenases are spurring a growing interest in the fields of biosynthesis and biocatalysis. Despite various halogenases have been identified in numerous natural product biosynthetic pathways, the mechanisms for multiple halogenations and site-selectivity remain largely unclear. In this study, we biochemically characterize FasV, a FAD-dependent halogenase (FDH) that catalyzes five successive chlorinations in the biosynthesis of naphthacene-containing aromatic polyketide naphthacemycin.

We propose a novel dual-activation mechanism, and demonstrate that FasV&#8217;s larger binding pocket makes it a valuable biocatalyst for other substrate with diverse structure.

         <title>Property Prediction of Bio&#8208;Derived Block Copolymer Thermoplastic Elastomers Using Graph Kernel Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the diversity of bio&#8208;based polymers is needed to address the combined problems of plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The magnitude of the problems necessitates rapid discovery of new materials; however, identification of appropriate chemistries maybe slow using current iterative methods. Machine learning (ML) methods could significantly expedite new material discovery and property identification. Here, PolyAGM, a ML algorithm using graph kernel methods, is introduced and used to predict the properties of block copolymers and identify the responsible structural &#8216;motifs&#8217;. It applies a &#8220;fingerprinting&#8221; method to convert Graph representations of polymers into numerical vectors. The Graphs explicitly encode the entire copolymer of atoms and bonds such that the sequencing of chemical features and polymer chain length are included, alongside relevant stereochemical information. PolyAGM gives predictions for both thermal and mechanical properties that are in good agreement with experimental measurements. This work focuses on predicting the properties of bio&#8208;derived ABA&#8208;block polymer thermoplastic elastomers, but the general fingerprinting technique of PolyAGM should be relevant to other application fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Fused Cyanoindone: A Superior Building Block for Designing Ultra&#8208;Narrow Bandgap Electron Acceptor with Long&#8208;Range Ordered Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are great demands of developing ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors for multifunctional electronic devices, particularly semi&#8208;transparent organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for building&#8208;integrated applications. However, current ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap materials applied in OPVs, primarily based on electron&#8208;rich cores, exhibit defects of high&#8208;lying energy levels and inferior performance. We herein proposed a novel strategy by designing the benzothiazole&#8208;fused cyanoindone (BTC) unit with ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability as the terminal to synthesize the acceptor BTC&#8208;2. The BTC unit imparts red&#8208;shifted absorption up to 1000 nm to BTC&#8208;2, attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and the quinoid resonance effect. Additionally, BTC&#8208;2 features deep&#8208;lying energy levels with the highest occupied molecular orbital level of &#8211;5.81 eV, due to the ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of BTC. Furthermore, BTC&#8208;2 exhibits long&#8208;range ordering in both molecular packing and macroscopic blend morphology, resulting from shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder packing of two BTC units, leading to an ultra&#8208;long exciton lifetime over 1.1 ns. These superiorities facilitated a 17.17% efficiency in the binary OPV device with an extremely high photocurrent of 30.34 mA cm&#8722;2, representing the best performance for ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors, and a record light utilization efficiency of 4.88% in binary semi&#8208;transparent systems. Overall, BTC is a superior building block for designing ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridged Carbolong Modulating Interfacial Charge Transfer Enhancement for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient regulation of perovskite/C60 interface is crucial to improving the long&#8208;term stability of the inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, precise methods for controlling the perovskite/C60 interface have yet to be thoroughly explored. Herein, we develop a carbolong chemical manipulation strategy to improve the interface contact of perovskite/C60 due to versatile functional groups and excellent optoelectronic properties of carbolong metallaaromatics. And constructing an electron&#8208;transfer bridge enhances the interfacial interaction and accelerates interfacial electron transfer. The carbolong manipulation results in optimized energy level alignment, suppressed nonradiative recombination, and improved electronic contact. An impressive efficiency of 25.80% is demonstrated, with open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor of 1.19 V and 84.53%, respectively. The unsealed devices retain more than 98% of their original efficiency after 1400 h of maximum power point tracking under illumination and demonstrate remarkable thermal stability, maintaining 93% of their initial efficiency after 2500 h at 85&#176;C in a nitrogen atmosphere. And the encapsulated carbolong&#8208;modified module achieved a high efficiency of 20.72% (active area of 25.25 cm&#178;) with robust operation stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Structure&#8208;Fluorogenic Property Relationship of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Derived Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;embedded fluorescent probes, known for their fluorogenicity following bioorthogonal inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (iEDDA) reactions, are extensively used in bioimaging. Despite significant research on fluorogenic Tz probes, there has been limited systematic exploration of their fluorogenic responses with various dienophiles. In this study, we elucidate the structure&#8208;fluorogenic property relationship of bioorthogonal Tz probes. We synthesized a series of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Tz (SFTz) probes designed to exhibit differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon iEDDA reactions with three dienophiles: trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Our findings revealed that the fluorogenic properties of the SFTz probes are highly dependent on the structures of dienophile&#8208;Tz adducts. By systematically modifying the electronic properties and employing quantum chemical calculations, we developed a series of SFTz probes with optimal dienophile&#8208;dependent fluorescence. These probes enabled simultaneous dual&#8208;color imaging of different cellular targets using a single probe, providing a robust approach for advanced bioimaging applications that require precise and efficient multicolor labeling strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Azopyridine Polymers in Organic Phase Change Materials for High Energy Density Photothermal Storage and Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer (3&#8208;PAZOPY with an unprecedented untra&#8208;high energy density of 430&#8197;J/g forms a stable uniform two&#8208;phase hybrid composite system with the organic phase change material octanoic acid (OA) through a combination of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. This system, serving as a noval solar photothermal fuels (STFs), is capable of simultaneously storing both photochemical and phase change energy, which holds significant potential for applications in household consumers energy distribution and utilization systems, as well as in photothermal&#8208;assisted insulation strategies.







Abstract
Azo&#8208;compounds molecules and phase change materials offer potential applications for sustainable energy systems through the storage and controllable release photochemical and phase change energy. Developing novel and highly efficient Azo&#8208;based solar thermal fuels (STFs) for photothermal energy storage and synergistic cooperation with organic phase change materials present significant challenges. Herein, three types of (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;) azopyridine polymers hinged with flexible alkyl chain are synthesized, in which meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer exhibits striking photothermal storage capacity of 430&#8197;J/g, providing a feasibility solution for developing high energy density Azo&#8208;based STFs. Furthermore, a stable two&#8208;phase hybrid system was innovatively constructed by combining the meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer with organic phase change materials leveraging hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions to collectively harness phase change energy and photothermal energy. The organic phase change material not only supplies additional phase change latent heat but also serves as a solvent, offering abundant free volume for the photo&#8208;induced isomerization of the azopyridine chromophores, which successfully circumvents the low charging efficiency in the condensed state and reliance on solvent&#8208;assisted charging in traditional Azo&#8208;based STFs. This study demonstrates the energy distribution and utilization for household consumers and the photothermal&#8208;assisted insulation strategy, achieving more extensive potential implementation for STFs.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence Inversion Driven by Dichroic Competition of Achiral Dyes in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) materials holds significant potential for achieving three&#8208;dimensional (3D) anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multi&#8208;level information encryption. However, constructing phototunable CLCs systems with easy fabrication and fast response remains a great challenge. Herein, we exploit an excitation&#8208;dependent CLCs (ExD&#8208;CLCs) material by establishing dynamically photoresponsive dichroic competition between two achiral dyes: a negative dichroic dye (SP&#8208;COOH) and a positive dichroic dye (Nile Red, NR) within a CLCs medium. The ExD&#8208;CLCs exhibits a negative CPL signal (glum = &#8208;0.16) at 650 nm when excited at 365 nm. Remarkably, under excitation at 430 nm, the CPL signal is inverted, and the glum value increases to +0.26. Notably, the helical superstructure and handedness of the ExD&#8208;CLCs remain unchanged during this reversal process. The CPL signal reversal is driven by the dichroic competition between the SP&#8208;COOH dimer, which displays strong negative dichroism in its open&#8208;ring isomer form and silent negative dichroism in its closed&#8208;ring isomer form, and the NR dye, which exhibits static positive dichroism. Leveraging these excitation&#8208;dependent CPL properties, the quadruplex numerical anti&#8208;counterfeiting using ExD&#8208;CLCs is achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymeric Iodine Transport Layer Enabled High Areal Capacity Dual Plating Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity of zinc&#8208;iodine battery is limited by the low conductivity of iodine. In this work, a polymeric conductive PVA hydrogel cathode was proposed. The unique &#8220;confined transport&#8221; of iodide/polyiodides ions in the hydrogel can effectively enhance the areal capacity with suppressed polyiodide shuttle effect.







Abstract
Iodine cathode in aqueous battery has drawn great attention due to its high energy density and high safety. However, iodine has extremely low conductivity of 1&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which usually results in low specific capacity. In this work, a PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer was designed to enhance the areal capacity of zinc&#8208;iodine cell. The areal capacity of PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer modified CNT cathode showed twice as higher capacity than that of pure CNT film in a dual&#8208;plating cell, The significant enhancement of the capacity was attributed to the fast iodine transport in the PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer. Besides, the strong interaction between PVA chain and polyiodide anions prevented the shuttle effect. The PVA modified CNT cathode could stably operate for over 3000&#8197;hours with remarkably higher capacity and cycle life. We analyzed the uniquely fast transport behavior of polyiodides in PVA hydrogel by in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ optical micrography, as well as DFT calculations. It was found that the strong binding force together with lower dissociation energy of iodine on PVA chain is the dominate reason for reduced shuttle effect and fast polyiodide transport. As a result, the assembled PVA&#8208;I2 pouch cells showed excellent performance in both dual&#8208;plating cells and conventional&#8208;type cells.

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Controlled Dynamic DNA Assembly Enables Temporally&#8208;Selective Orthogonal Regulation of cGAS&#8211;STING Stimulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endogenous and exogenous tandem&#8208;regulated DNA assembly strategy is designed to achieve on&#8208;demand orthogonally controlled stimulation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. The approach utilizes an engineered DNA motif with an enzymatically responsive moiety and a photocleavable linker into DNA motif, enabling enzyme&#8208;mediated activation and light&#8208;triggered termination of cGAS stimulation through dynamic DNA assembly.







Abstract
Despite advances in the controlled reconfiguration of DNA structures for biological applications, the dearth of strategies that allow for orthogonal regulation of immune pathways remains a challenge. Here, we report for the first time an endogenous and exogenous tandem&#8208;regulated DNA assembly strategy that enables orthogonally controlled stimulation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. A DNA motif containing two palindromic sequences is engineered with an abasic site (AP)&#8208;connected blocking sequence to inhibit its self&#8208;assembly function, while apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;triggered enzymatic cleavage of the AP site enables the reconfiguration and self&#8208;assembly of DNA motif into long double&#8208;stranded structures, thus realizing allosteric activation of the catalytic activity of cGAS to produce 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP for STING stimulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that APE1&#8208;regulated DNA assembly allows for cell&#8208;selective activation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. Furthermore, by re&#8208;engineering the DNA motif with a photocleavable group, enzyme&#8208;triggered DNA assembly allows the cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation to operate (switched &#8220;ON&#8221;), whereas light&#8208;mediated fragmentation of the double&#8208;stranded DNA enables termination of such stimulation (switched &#8220;OFF&#8221;), thereby achieving orthogonal control over immune regulation. This work highlights an endogenous and exogenous tandem regulated strategy to modulate the cGAS&#8211;STING pathway in an orthogonally controlled manner.

         <title>Activating Oxygen via the 3&#8208;Electron Pathway to Hydroxyl Radical by La&#8722;O4 Single&#8208;atom on WO3 for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective oxygen activation to hydroxyl radicals via 3&#8197;e&#8722; pathway using single atomically dispersed La based on WO3 fabricated with oxygen vacancies to weaken La&#8722;O coordination strength (denoted as LaO4&#8722;WOv) is achieved. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4&#8722;WOv with 0.077&#8197;min&#8722;1 of rate constant. This work builds a catalyst for manipulating oxygen activation towards water purification as a representative application.







Abstract
Shifting photocatalytic oxygen activation towards 3&#8208;electron (e&#8722;) pathway to hydroxyl radicals, instead of the normal 1&#8197;e&#8722; to superoxide radicals, becomes increasingly important for pollution degradation since hydroxyl radicals possess a high oxidation potential (2.80&#8197;V). Here, we demonstrate a selective oxygen activation to hydroxyl radicals via 3&#8197;e&#8722; pathway using single atomically dispersed La based on WO3 fabricated with oxygen vacancies to weaken La&#8722;O coordination strength (denoted as LaO4&#8722;WOv). Unsaturated&#8208;state La overcomes the rate&#8208;limited step of 2&#8197;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction towards to hydrogen peroxide via tuning binding free energy of key reaction intermediate *OOH, stepped by easy generation of hydroxyl radicals via 1&#8197;e&#8722;. This strategy alters the activation of oxygen process from 1&#8197;e&#8722; to 3&#8197;e&#8722;. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals over LaO4&#8722;WOv produces 3.8 and 3.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 35 and 8&#8197;times that of detected over WO3, respectively. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4&#8722;WOv with 0.077&#8197;min&#8722;1 of rate constant, 38&#8197;times that of WO3. Degradation efficiencies keep greater than 98&#8201;% following five repeats, revealing a practical&#8208;utilization&#8208;level robust stability. This work builds an unsaturated&#8208;state transition metal site for manipulating oxygen activation towards an effective water purification as a representative application.

A suite of new ligandable lysines have been characterized, thus offering insights for exploring new functional and targetable residues.

Due to the high abundance and diverse functions of lysine residues, both in the interior and on the surface of proteins, the development of new methods to characterize their reactivity and ligandability could significantly expand the pool of druggable targets. To date, only a limited number of aminophilic electrophiles have been assessed for interactions with the lysine proteome, resulting in a substantial fraction remaining inaccessible to current probes. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform for in&#8208;depth profiling of lysines. We quantified over 7000&#8197;covalently modifiable lysine residues, which significantly expands the coverage of ligandable lysines in the whole proteome. Chemical proteomics enabled the mapping of more than 100&#8197;endogenous kinases, thus providing a comprehensive landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines within the kinome. Moreover, we identified a suite of new ligandable lysines such as K60 of ENO1 and K31 of PPIA, offering insights for exploring new functional and targetable residues. These findings could provide valuable clues for the development of targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs).

         <title>Hypercrosslinked Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Electrolyte with High Transference Number and Fast Conduction of Li Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of hypercrosslinked MOP (HCMOP) solid&#8208;state electrolyte was prepared using cationic MOPs, PEI macromonomer and polyelectrolyte units. Owing to the three&#8208;component synergistic effect, Li&#8208;HCMOP has excellent mechanical strength and can realize a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity, a high Li&#8208;ion transference number and a low activation energy. This work highlights an effective idea of high&#8208;performance MOP&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes applied in LMBs.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high Li&#8208;ion transference numbers and fast ionic conductivity are urgently needed for technological innovations in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. To promote the dissociation of ion pairs and overcome the mechanical brittleness and interface defects caused by traditional fillers in polymeric electrolytes, we designed and fabricated a cationic hypercrosslinking metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (HCMOPs) polymer as SSE. Benefiting a three&#8208;component synergistic effect: cationic MOPs, branched polyethyleneimine macromonomer and polyelectrolyte units, the Li&#8208;HCMOP electrolyte possesses a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity, a high Li&#8208;ion transference number and a low activation energy. The LiFePO4/Li battery exhibits high capacity with superior rate performance and cycling stability. Moreover, soluble MOPs serve as high crosslinking nodes to provide excellent mechanical strength for electrolytes and good compatibility with polymers. This work highlights an effective idea of high&#8208;performance MOP&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes applied in LMBs.

         <title>T&#8208;shaped 14 Electron Rhodium Complexes: Potential Active Species in C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) complexes with PNP pincer ligands have been isolated. They react with C&#8722;H bonds of unactivated substrates such as ethylene and benzene, leading to the oxidative C&#8722;H addition products. Depending on the size of the alkyl groups on the phosphorus atom, the reactivity towards C&#8722;H bonds can be fine&#8208;tuned.







Abstract
Two T&#8208;shaped 14&#8208;electron rhodium complexes 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b, &#8220;framed&#8221; and thus stabilized by PNP pincer ligands have been synthesized. The bis(t&#8208;butyl)phosphine derived PNPtBu&#8208;rhodium complex 2&#8201;a was isolated from pentane as the more stable cyclometalated Rh(III) hydrido complex and found to be in equilibrium with the T&#8208;shaped 14e&#8722; Rh(I) complex 2&#8201;aT which itself could be directly crystallized upon change of the solvent. The cyclometallation is suppressed using an adamantyl substituted PNPAd ligand to give the analogous T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) species 2&#8201;b, stabilized through an agostic interaction with one of the adamantyl C&#8722;Hs. Depending on the solvent, complex 2&#8201;a reacted with ethylene either by &#960;&#8208;coordination (4&#8201;a) or C&#8722;H activation giving a hydrido&#8208;vinyl Rh(III) species 4&#8201;b, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex 2&#8201;b was found to reversibly C&#8722;H activate arenes to form the hydrido&#8208;aryl Rh(III) complexes.

         <title>Skeletal Nitrogen Functionalization of Isostructural 2D Conjugated MOFs for Enhancement of the Dual&#8208;Ion Storage Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skeletal nitrogen introduction strategy has been developed to fine&#8208;tune the dual&#8208;ion storage properties of isostructural 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs). The faradaic charge storage in isostructural MOFs can be improved by introducing additional aromatic nitrogen sites which synergistically act as cation adsorption sites and favor anion&#8208;adsorption to the metal sites energetically.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. However, a viable path to realize superior dual&#8208;ion storage in 2D c&#8208;MOFs has remained elusive. Here, we report the synthesis of Cu2(Nx&#8722;OHPTP) 2D c&#8208;MOFs (x=0,1,2; OHPTP=octahydroxyphenanthrotriphenylene) with precise aromatic carbon&#8208;nitrogen arrangements, based on the &#960;&#8208;conjugated OHPTP ligand incorporated with one or two nitrogen atoms. The skeletal nitrogen modification in Cu2(Nx&#8722;OHPTP) allows the synergistic introduction of additional redox sites, and thus substantially favors the unique dual&#8208;ion adsorption capacity. Consequently, the Cu2(N2&#8722;OHPTP) cathode exhibits a largely enhanced electrochemical performance for dual&#8208;ion storage (i.e., Li+ and Cl&#8208;) with a high specific capacity of 53.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is twice that of Cu2(N0&#8722;OHPTP) and 1.3&#8197;times that of Cu2(N1&#8722;OHPTP). Furthermore, the Cu2(N2&#8722;OHPTP) electrode displays a favorable rate performance of 52&#8201;% and good cycling stability of 96&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles. We identify N&#8208;centered redox sites as additional Li+ adsorption sites by combining ex situ and in situ spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. In addition, calculations underline the synergistic enhancement of the Cl&#8722; adsorption energy by about 1.0&#8197;eV at the more electron&#8208;poor CuO4 linkages after N&#8208;incorporation. This work paves the way for the precise design of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with superior electrochemical properties, advancing their application in dual&#8208;ion storage applications.

         <title>Zwitterionic 2&#8208;Phosphaethene&#8208;thiolates [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ as PCS Building Blocks (LC=NHC, LP=PR3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PCS building blocks: This work presents the facile synthesis of zwitterionic salts [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)][OTf], which function as convenient, regioselective and multifaceted synthons of the PCS moiety. DFT calculations support a zwitterionic composition with a negative PCS moiety and two cationic P&#8208; and C&#8208;bound substituents. Depending on the nature of the C&#8208;bound substituent, different reactivity can be addressed in cycloaddition and reduction reactions.







Abstract
The zwitterionic compounds [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ (3+, LC=NHC, LP=PR3), featuring cationic substituents at the phosphorus and carbon atoms, are synthesized as their triflate salts at a multi&#8208;gram scale from the reaction of Lewis base adducts of CS2, namely LC/P&#8722;CS2 (4), with a combination of [(LCP)4][OTf]4 (1[OTf]4) and Ph3P. The feasibility of using 3+ as PCS building blocks is showcased in their reactions with representative electrophiles (MeOTf) and nucleophiles (MesMgBr, Ph3PCH2), leading to selective functionalization of the PCS core at the S&#8208; and P&#8208;terminus, respectively. Additionally, it is reported that 3+ can function as ambident nucleophiles with AgOTf (2 equivalents), affording unprecedented linear coordination polymer [Ag2(OTf)3&#8208;&#956;2:&#954;P,&#954;S&#8722;((LC)P=CS(PCy3))]+ (6&#8201;b), where the PCS moiety acts as a bridging ligand in transition metal complexes for the first time. Reduction of 3+ facilitates the cleavage of the P&#8208; and C&#8208;bound substituents leading to the formation of the [PCS]&#8722; anion. Moreover, cycloaddition reactions of 3+ with 1[OTf]4 are shown to selectively yield five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered polyphosphorus heterocycles. Preliminary results suggest the possibility of activating the C&#8722;S bond in [(LC)P=CS(LC)]+, resulting in the formation of [(LC)P=C(LC)&#8722;P(LC)][OTf]2, 12[OTf]2, which may serve as a synthon for the PCP unit in future studies.

     alt="Zwitterionic 2-Phosphaethene-thiolates [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ as PCS Building Blocks (LC=NHC, LP=PR3)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PCS building blocks&lt;/b&gt;: This work presents the facile synthesis of zwitterionic salts [(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)P=CS(L&lt;sub&gt;C/P&lt;/sub&gt;)][OTf], which function as convenient, regioselective and multifaceted synthons of the PCS moiety. DFT calculations support a zwitterionic composition with a negative PCS moiety and two cationic &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-bound substituents. Depending on the nature of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-bound substituent, different reactivity can be addressed in cycloaddition and reduction reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zwitterionic compounds [(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)P=CS(L&lt;sub&gt;C/P&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=NHC, L&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;=PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), featuring cationic substituents at the phosphorus and carbon atoms, are synthesized as their triflate salts at a multi-gram scale from the reaction of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;Lewis&lt;/span&gt; base adducts of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, namely L&lt;sub&gt;C/P&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), with a combination of [(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][OTf]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;[OTf]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P. The feasibility of using &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as PCS building blocks is showcased in their reactions with representative electrophiles (MeOTf) and nucleophiles (MesMgBr, Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), leading to selective functionalization of the PCS core at the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-terminus, respectively. Additionally, it is reported that &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can function as ambident nucleophiles with AgOTf (2 equivalents), affording unprecedented linear coordination polymer [Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;,&#954;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;((L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)P=CS(PCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;))]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;6&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;), where the PCS moiety acts as a bridging ligand in transition metal complexes for the first time. Reduction of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; facilitates the cleavage of the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-bound substituents leading to the formation of the [PCS]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion. Moreover, cycloaddition reactions of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;[OTf]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are shown to selectively yield five- and eight-membered polyphosphorus heterocycles. Preliminary results suggest the possibility of activating the C&#8722;S bond in [(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)P=CS(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in the formation of [(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)P=C(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8722;P(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)][OTf]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;[OTf]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which may serve as a synthon for the PCP unit in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Schematic illustration of FeMn for simultaneously activating both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds to maximize the utilization of various substituents of native lignin reforming into syngas over InGaN nanowires.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered lignin reforming offers a carbon&#8208;neutral route for syngas production. This study explores a dual non&#8208;precious iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst to simultaneously activate both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds for maximizing the utilization of various substituents of native lignin to yield syngas. The cocatalyst, integrated with InGaN nanowires on a Si wafer, affords a measurable syngas evolution rate of 42.4&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 from native lignin in distilled water with a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% and tunable H2/CO ratios under concentrated light, leading to a considerable light&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency of 11.8&#8201;%. The high FeMn atom efficiency arising from the 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructure of InGaN enables the achievement of a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 220896&#8197;mol syngas per mol FeMn per hour. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the synergetic iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst supported by InGaN nanowires enables simultaneous activation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds with comparable minimized dissociation energies, thus promising to maximally utilize different substituents of &#8722;OCH3, and &#8722;CH2CH2CH3 in lignin for syngas production. Moreover, the dual Fe&#8208;Mn cocatalyst demonstrates a most energetically favorable route for the consecutive release of hydrogen from &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;OH by the oxidative holes while inhibiting the reversion of hydrogen and hydroxyl into water.

         <title>Chiral Rotaxane&#8208;Branched Dendrimers as Relays in Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems with Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral artificial light&#8208;harvesting system that shows sequentially amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances has been constructed from chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers. This approach not only leads to efficient amplification of the CPL performances but will also allow the construction of novel chiral luminescent materials.







Abstract
Starting from AIEgen&#8208;functionalized chiral [2]rotaxane building block, we have successfully synthesized a new class of chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers through controllable divergent strategy for the first time, based on which novel chiral artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHSs) were successfully constructed in aqueous phase by sequentially introducing achiral donor and acceptor. More importantly, accompanied by the two&#8208;step F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process in the resultant artificial LHSs, the sequentially amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances were achieved, highlighting that the chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers could serve as excellent relay for both energy transfer and chirality transmission. Impressively, compared with the sole chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers, the dissymmetry factors (glum) values of the resultant artificial LHSs were amplified by one order of magnitude up to 0.038, enabling their further applications in information storage and encryption. The proof&#8208;of concept study provides not only a feasible approach for the efficient amplification of CPL performances but also a novel platform for the construction of novel chiral luminescent materials.

         <title>Dual Regulation of Sensitizers and Cluster Catalysts in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Boost H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizer/catalyst dual regulation strategy was proposed based on POM@MOF molecular platform to construct the highly efficient catalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Impressively, the resulting Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6 can efficiently drive water splitting into H2 with a TON of 326923, representing a record value among all the POM@MOF composites.







Abstract
Photocatalytic efficiency is closely correlated to visible&#8208;light absorption ability, electron transfer efficiency and catalytic center activity of photocatalysts, nevertheless, the concurrent management of these factors to improve photocatalytic efficiency remains underexplored. Herein, we proposed a sensitizer/catalyst dual regulation strategy on the polyoxometalate@Metal&#8722;Organic Framework (POM@MOF) molecular platform to construct highly efficient photocatalysts. Impressively, Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6, obtained by coupling strong sensitizing [Ir(coumarin 6)2(bpy)]+ with Ni&#8722;Sb9 POM with extremely exposed nickel site [NiO3(H2O)3], can drive H2 evolution with a turnover number of 326923, representing a record value among all the POM@MOF composite photocatalysts. This performance is over 34&#8197;times higher than that of the typical Ni4P2@UiO&#8722;Ir constructed from [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ and Ni4P2 POM. Systematical investigations revealed that dual regulation of sensitizing and catalytic centers endowed Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6 with strong visible&#8208;light absorption, efficient inter&#8208;component electron transfer and high catalytic activity to concurrently promote H2 evolution. This work opens up a new avenue to develop highly active POM@MOF photocatalysts by dual regulation of sensitizing/catalytic centers at the molecular level.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of Cu&#8208;ATRP catalysis with photocatalysts (PCs) that absorb visible and/or NIR light exhibits synergistic action at the ppm/ppb concentration level. It leads to very well&#8208;defined polymers with rates depending on the amount and quantum efficiency of PC but controlled polymer architecture defined by the Cu&#8208;catalysts. Thus, they can act much better together, providing robustness, oxygen tolerance, and access to new materials.







Abstract
Photomediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (photoATRP) is an activator regeneration method, which allows for the controlled synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers via light irradiation. Traditional photoATRP is often limited by the need for high&#8208;energy ultraviolet or violet light. These could negatively affect the control and selectivity of the polymerization, promote side reactions, and may not be applicable to biologically relevant systems. This drawback can be circumvented by an introduction of the catalytic amount of photocatalysts, which absorb visible and/or NIR light and, therefore, controlled, regenerative ATRP can be performed with the dual&#8208;catalytic cycle. Herein, a critical summary of recent developments in the field of dual&#8208;catalysis concerning Cu&#8208;catalyzed ATRP is provided. Contributions of involved species are examined mechanistically, followed by challenges and future directions towards the next generation of advanced functional macromolecular materials.

         <title>Propeller&#8208;Shaped Blatter&#8208;Based Triradicals: Distortion&#8208;Free Triangular Spin System and Spin&#8208;State&#8208;Dependent Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of propeller&#8208;shaped C3v&#8208; and Cs&#8208;symmetric triradicals are described. The triradicals were antiferromagnetic equilateral triangle spin systems with J/kB~&#8722;120&#8197;K, leading to the thermal equilibrium of the doublet/quartet states at room temperature. The spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent absorption feature, spin&#8208;selective excitation, and spin&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state dynamics are discussed.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of triptycene&#8208;based C3v&#8208; and Cs&#8208;symmetric stable triradicals. SQUID magnetometry showed the propeller&#8208;shaped triradicals were both an antiferromagnetic equilateral triangle spin system with small spin&#8208;spin interactions J/kB~&#8722;120&#8197;K and &#8722;106&#8197;K, leading to ca. 4/6 coexistence of the doublet/quartet states in thermal equilibrium at room temperature. The triradicals exhibited characteristic NIR absorption bands reaching 1000&#8197;nm, which was solely ascribed to the triradical in the doublet state by variable&#8208;temperature spectroscopic studies and quantum chemical calculations. Taking advantage of the spin&#8208;specific absorption feature, we found that the triradicals in the low&#8208;spin state undergo symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer, while those in the high&#8208;spin state fall into a monoradical&#8208;like excited state.

         <title>Confinement Microenvironment Regulation of Carbon Dots in Zeolite for Multi&#8208;Mode Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel matrix&#8208;controlling strategy is presented in CDs&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite system to regulate the microenvironment of CDs by doping limited Mn2+ in zeolite. Mn&#8208;coordinated CDs (C&#8208;CDs) induce green phosphorescence, and non&#8208;coordinated CDs (NC&#8208;CDs) exhibit temperature&#8208;related blue or red phosphorescence due to energy transfer. Finally, multi&#8208;mode time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color evolution with temperature variation in a single system is achieved.







Abstract
Matrix immobilization has been proven to be a favored method for enhancing the phosphorescence of carbon dots (CDs), however, it remains a significant challenge to realize time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence colors (TDPC) by embedding CDs with single emission center. In this study, we present a novel matrix&#8208;controlling strategy to regulate the microenvironment of CDs by doping limited Mn2+ in zeolite. The surrounding environment influences the surface state of the CDs, leading to the formation of different excitons. At low temperatures, Mn&#8208;coordinated CDs (C&#8208;CDs) show fast&#8208;decaying green phosphorescence, while non&#8208;coordinated CDs (NC&#8208;CDs) exhibit inherent slow&#8208;decaying blue phosphorescence. Notably, the energy transfer occurs between NC&#8208;CDs and Mn2+ to produce an ultrafast&#8208;decaying red phosphorescence, with the intensity of the red component increasing as the temperature rises. The interplay of these luminescent centers with distinct decay rates activates fascinating multi&#8208;mode TDPC behavior as the temperature changes, resulting in dynamic afterglow evolutions from red to green at 298&#8197;K, orange to green at 273&#8197;K, and green to cyan to blue at 77&#8197;K. Leveraging the diverse luminescence of CDs@MnAPO&#8208;5, a multi&#8208;dimensional dynamic afterglow color pattern was developed for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Halogen Radical&#8208;Activated Perovskite&#8208;Substrate Buried Heterointerface for Achieving Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Tin&#8208;Based Solar Cells with Efficiencies Surpassing 14&#8201;%</title>

         <dc:description>
The highly active halogen radicals simultaneously modified the ITO surface and chemically bridged the ITO/perovskite heterointerfaces for largely reducing the interfacial energy barrier and optimizing the interfacial carrier dynamics in hole transport layer&#8208;free Sn perovskite solar cells, achieving a record efficiency of 14.20&#8201;%.







Abstract
Sn&#8208;based perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising environmentally&#8208;friendly photovoltaic materials owing to their low toxicity and exceptional optoelectronic properties. Nonetheless, the low&#8208;cost production and stable operation of Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still largely limited by the costly hole transport materials and the under&#8208;optimized interfaces between hole transport layer (HTL) and Sn perovskite layer. Here, we innovatively developed a chlorine radical chemical bridging (Cl&#8208;RCB) strategy that enabled to remove the HTL and optimize the indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite heterointerface for constructing high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based PSCs with simplified structures. The key is to modify the commercially&#8208;purchased ITO electrode with highly active chlorine radicals that could effectively mitigate the surface oxygen vacancies, alter the chemical constitutions, and favorably down&#8208;shifted the work function of ITO surface to be close to the valence band of perovskites. As a result, the interfacial energy barrier has been largely reduced by 0.20&#8197;eV and the interfacial carrier dynamics have been optimized at the ITO/perovskite heterointerface. Encouragingly, the efficiency of HTL&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based PSCs has been enhanced from 6.79&#8201;% to 14.20&#8201;%, which is on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conventional HTL&#8208;containing counterparts (normally &gt;14&#8201;% efficiency) and representing the record performance for the Sn perovskite photovoltaics in the absence of HTL. Notably, the target device exhibited enhanced stability for up to 2000&#8197;h. The Cl&#8208;RCB strategy is also versatile to be used in Pb&#8208;based and mixed Sn&#8722;Pb HTL&#8208;free PSCs, achieving efficiencies of 22.27&#8201;% and 21.13&#8201;%, respectively, all representing the advanced device performances for the carrier transport layer&#8208;free PSCs with simplified device architectures.

A series of bent perylenediimides (B&#8208;PDIs) with systematically varied bending angles were designed and synthesized by modulating the lengths of linear alkyl chains bridging the two nitrogen atoms of each PDI. This study unveils the curvature&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly and excited&#8208;state decay behavior of these B&#8208;PDIs.







Abstract
The properties of &#960;&#8208;functional materials are predominantly influenced by both their molecular structures and interactions between &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent advancements have focused on modifying the geometry or topology of &#960;&#8208;molecules from planar to nonplanar conformations to tailor molecular properties. However, the interactions among nonplanar &#960;&#8208;molecules remain largely unexplored, likely due to the significant reduction in contact surfaces arising from their curved structures. Herein, we investigated the electro&#8208;optical properties and &#960;&#8208;stacking behaviors of a series of bent perylenediimides (B&#8208;PDIs) with gradual changes in bending angles, achieved by altering the lengths of linear alkyl chains connecting the two nitrogen positions of each PDI. Curvature&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly of these bent PDIs is observed, which is primarily driven by dipole&#8208;dipole interactions rather than dispersion forces. More importantly, fine&#8208;tuning intermolecular coupling through bending enables excited&#8208;state symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation in [n]B&#8208;PDIs (n = 16, 12) in the crystalline solid state.

         <title>Bridging Electrolyte Bulk and Interfacial Chemistry: Dynamic Protective Strategy Enable Ultra&#8208;Long Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior service lifespan aqueous Zn battery was built by taking advantage of the biomass&#8208;derived chitin nanocrystals colloid electrolyte to bridge electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry for achieving dynamic protective strategy. This unique strategy not only enables continuous optimization of electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry within the battery but also facilitates self&#8208;repairing of mechanical damages both internally and externally, resulting in building comprehensive, persistent, and dynamic protection for aqueous Zn batteries.







Abstract
The main bottleneck of rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) is their limited cycle lifespans stemming from the unhealthy electrolyte bulk and fragile interface, especially in the absence of dynamic protection mechanism between them. To overcome this limitation, benefitting from their synergistic physical and chemical properties, chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) are employed as superior colloid electrolyte to bridge electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry for ultra&#8208;long lifespan AZBs. This unique strategy not only enables continuous optimization of the electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry within the battery but also facilitates self&#8208;repairing of mechanical damage both internally and externally, thereby achieving comprehensive, persistent, and dynamic protection. As a result, the modified zinc (Zn) cells present high Zn plating/stripping coulombic efficiencies of 97.71&#8201;% ~99.81&#8201;% from 5 to 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and remarkably service lifespan up to 8,200&#8197;h (more than 11&#8197;months). Additionally, the Zn//MnO2 full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 70.1&#8201;% after 3,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This dynamic protective strategy to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry may open up a new avenue for building better AZBs and beyond.

         <title>Iodide Anion Enables a Reductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling for Preparing Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of iminium ions with a range of electrophilic substrates to prepare tertiary amines. This reaction is mediated by the underexplored single&#8208;electron reducing power of the iodide counter anion, which is investigated both experimentally and through quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The reducing power of iodide anion is an underexplored property that can be used for the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of organic molecules. Herein we harness this trait for the preparation of tertiary amines through the combination of two simple reagents: an electrophilic&#8208;carbon precursor and an iminium iodide in a dual role &#8211; both as nitrogen&#8208;containing building block and as reducing agent. The underlying mechanism of this new C&#8722;C bond&#8208;formation paradigm is explored through a combination of experiment and quantum chemical calculations.

A directing group&#8208;controlled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed, regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantiospecific anti&#8208;carboxylation of unactivated, internal allenes has been developed via the synergistic interplay of a rationally designed bidentate directing group, palladium catalyst, and a multifunctional acetate ligand.

Abstract
We report herein a directing group&#8208;controlled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed, regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantiospecific anti&#8208;carboxylation of unactivated, internal allenes enabled via the synergistic interplay of a rationally designed bidentate directing group, palladium catalyst, and a multifunctional acetate ligand. The corresponding trans allyl ester was obtained in excellent yields with exclusive &#948;&#8208;regioselectivity and anti&#8208;carboxypalladation stereocontrol. The acetate ligand of the palladium catalyst controls the regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity in the desired transformation. The potential of this concept has been demonstrated by the development of the chiral version of this transformation by using axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer with good yields and enantioselectivities. Detailed investigations, including kinetic studies, order studies, and DFT studies, were performed to validate the ligand&#8208;assisted nucleopalladation process and the rationale behind the observed racemization of chiral allenes. The studies also indicated that the anti&#8208;carboxypalladation step was the rate&#8208;limiting as well as the stereo&#8208; and enantiodetermining step.

         <title>Ethane Triggered Gate&#8208;Opening in a Flexible&#8208;Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Ultra&#8208;High Purity Ethylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a flexible&#8208;robust MOF Zn(ad)(min) that features a unique localized flexible gate to priority adsorb the cross&#8208;section well&#8208;matched ethane molecules, thus achieving the unprecedented ethane adsorption capacity (62.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), ethane/ethylene uptake ratio 3.34 (298&#8197;K and 0.1&#8197;bar), and the remarkable ultra&#8208;high purity ethylene (&gt;99.995&#8201;%) productivity up to 39.2&#8197;L/kg at ambient condition.







Abstract
Priority recognition separation of inert and larger ethane molecules from high&#8208;concentration ethylene mixtures instead of the traditional thermodynamic or size sieving strategy is a fundamental challenge. Herein, we report ethane triggered gate&#8208;opening in the flexible&#8208;robust metal&#8208;organic framework Zn(ad)(min), the 3&#8208;methylisonicotinic acid ligand can spin as a flexible gate when adsorbing the cross&#8208;section well&#8208;matched ethane molecule, achieving an unprecedented ethane adsorption capacity (62.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ethane/ethylene uptake ratio (3.34) under low&#8208;pressure region (0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K). The ethane&#8208;induced structural transition behavior has been uncovered by a collaboration of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in situ variable pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations, elucidating the synergetic mechanism of cross&#8208;section matching and multiple supramolecular interactions within the tailor&#8208;made pore channels. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have revealed the outstanding separation performance of Zn(ad)(min) during the production of ultra&#8208;high purity ethylene (&gt;99.995&#8201;%) with a productivity of up to 39.2&#8197;L/kg under ambient conditions.

&lt;p&gt;We report a flexible-robust MOF Zn(ad)(min) that features a unique localized flexible gate to priority adsorb the cross-section well-matched ethane molecules, thus achieving the unprecedented ethane adsorption capacity (62.6&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ethane/ethylene uptake ratio 3.34 (298&#8197;K and 0.1&#8197;bar), and the remarkable ultra-high purity ethylene (&amp;gt;99.995&#8201;%) productivity up to 39.2&#8197;L/kg at ambient condition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priority recognition separation of inert and larger ethane molecules from high-concentration ethylene mixtures instead of the traditional thermodynamic or size sieving strategy is a fundamental challenge. Herein, we report ethane triggered gate-opening in the flexible-robust metal-organic framework Zn(ad)(min), the 3-methylisonicotinic acid ligand can spin as a flexible gate when adsorbing the cross-section well-matched ethane molecule, achieving an unprecedented ethane adsorption capacity (62.6&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ethane/ethylene uptake ratio (3.34) under low-pressure region (0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K). The ethane-induced structural transition behavior has been uncovered by a collaboration of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in situ variable pressure X-ray diffraction and theoretical calculations, elucidating the synergetic mechanism of cross-section matching and multiple supramolecular interactions within the tailor-made pore channels. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have revealed the outstanding separation performance of Zn(ad)(min) during the production of ultra-high purity ethylene (&amp;gt;99.995&#8201;%) with a productivity of up to 39.2&#8197;L/kg under ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nano&#8208;Springe Enriched Hierarchical Porous MOP/COF Hybrid Aerogel: Efficient Recovery of Gold from Electronic Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable zirconium metal based Metal&#8208;organic Polyhedra threaded chemically stable Covalent Organic Framework has been fabricated at ambient condition in the form of a crystalline hybrid hierarchically aerogel for selective recovery of gold from e&#8208;waste.







Abstract
Extraction of gold from secondary resources such as electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) has become crucial in recent times to compensate for the gradual scarcity of the noble metal in natural mines. However, designing and synthesizing a suitable material for highly efficient gold recovery is still a great challenge. Herein, we have strategically designed rapid fabrication of an ionic crystalline hybrid aerogel by covalent threading of an amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic polyhedra with an imine&#8208;linked chemically stable covalent organic framework at ambient condition. The hierarchically porous ultra&#8208;light aerogel featuring imine&#8208;rich backbone, high surface area, and cationic sites have shown fast removal, high uptake capacity (2349&#8197;mg/g), and excellent selectivity towards gold sequestration. Besides, the aerogel can extract ultra&#8208;trace gold&#8208;ions from different terrestrial water bodies, aiming towards safe drinking water. This study demonstrates the great potential of the composite materials based on a novel approach to designing a hybrid porous material for efficient gold recovery from complex water matrices.

         <title>Structural and Functional Characterization of an Amidase Targeting a Polyurethane for Sustainable Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Global plastic production exceeded 400 million tons in 2022, urgently demanding improved waste management and recycling strategies for a circular plastic economy. While the enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become feasible on industrial scales, efficient enzymes targeting other hydrolysable plastic types such as polyurethanes (PURs) are lacking. Recently, enzymes of the amidase signature (AS) family, capable of cleaving urethane bonds in a polyether&#8208;PUR analog and a linear polyester&#8208;PUR, have been identified. Herein, we present high&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the AS enzyme UMG&#8208;SP3 in three states: ligand&#8208;free, bound with a suicidal inhibitor mimicking the transition state, and bound with a monomeric PUR degradation product. Besides revealing the conserved core and catalytic triad akin to other AS family members, the UMG&#8208;SP3 structures show remarkable flexibility of loop regions. Particularly, Arg209 in loop 3 adopts two induced&#8208;fit conformations upon ligand binding. Through structure&#8208;guided kinetic studies and enzyme engineering, we mapped structural key elements that determine the enhanced hydrolysis of urethane and amide bonds in various small molecules including a linear PUR fragment analog. Our findings contribute critical insights into urethanase activity, aiding PUR degradation campaigns and sustainable plastic recycling efforts in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Site Portable Lithium Detection in Mining and Recycling Industries Based on a DNAzyme Fluorescent Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel applications of a DNAzyme sensor have been developed for the on&#8208;site detection of lithium in the lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) industry. Simple methods to detect lithium in brine and rock mining applications, and in LIB recycling applications, have been designed and successfully implemented using the highly selective lithium DNAzyme sensor and portable fluorometers.







Abstract
The global demand for lithium has soared in recent years due to the wide use of lithium batteries. To meet this demand, we herein report developing novel on&#8208;site sample preparation methods for the extraction of Li+ from relevant materials, including brine water, spodumene rock, as well as lithium&#8208;ion battery electrodes, and a DNAzyme&#8208;based fluorescent sensor for sensitive and robust detection of Li+ in these samples down to 1.4&#8197;mM (10&#8197;ppm) using a portable fluorometer. The system can distinguish key threshold lithium levels that indicate economic value across several industries, including 200&#8197;ppm Li+ for brine mining, 6&#8201;% Li2O or SC6 for rock mining, and Li+&#8208;specific aging in LIBs. The methods developed and demonstrated in this work will allow highly selective, on&#8208;site, portable detection of lithium in both environmental samples to identify new lithium resources and in battery electrodes to guide recycling strategies in order to meet the global demand for lithium.

         <title>Enhancing Mechanical Durability and Long&#8208;Term Stability in Organic Solar Cells via Flexible Linker&#8208;Sequential Block Copolymerized Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) hold great promise for improving both the efficiency and mechanical robustness of flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) owing to their facile molecular tunability and advantageous one&#8208;pot copolymerization. However, despite the excellent crystallinity imparted by their highly conjugated polymer backbone, MCDs often struggle to retain photovoltaic performance under large external deformations, limiting their applicability in wearable devices. Herein, we developed a novel series of flexible linker&#8208;sequential blockMCDs (Fs&#8208;MCDs), specifically PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTB, PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTH, and PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD, by precisely incorporating flexible functional groups into the conjugated polymer skeleton. This design strategy introduced highly effective tensile active sites, resulting in remarkable mechanical durability, with PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD achieving crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) values of 49.88% in pristine films and 31.29% in blends. &#160;The nearly 50% COS in pristine films represents one of the highest values reported for Fs&#8208;MCD&#8208;based OSCs, marking a significant milestone in advancing f&#8208;OSC. Additionally, PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD demonstrated excellent photovoltaic performance, with efficiencies of 18.09% in rigid binary and 19.05% in ternary, as well as 16.63% in flexible OSCs, and impressive device stability in invert OSC (T80 = 9,078 h). This unique molecular design strategy provides a promising avenue for synergistically improving the photovoltaic performance, mechanical properties, and device stability of f&#8208;OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Formation of Octa&#8208;substituted Cyclobutanes by the [2+2] Photocycloaddition of Stiff&#8208;stilbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of new molecules with specific structural motifs is a primary goal in synthetic chemistry. In this context, cyclobutanes (CBs), the highly strained ring systems, are of great interest because of their wide applications from pharmaceutical chemistry to materials science. The [2+2] photocycloaddition is the most straightforward approach for CBs; however, access to fully substituted cyclobutanes presents a significant challenge due to the steric hindrance imposed by eight substituents. Here, we report an efficient synthesis of structurally unique, octa&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from stiff&#8208;stilbene precursors, which is enabled by adaptable anion coordination through hydrogen bonding networks. The synthesized spiro&#8208;benzocyclopentyl&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal structures. DFT calculations indicate that these cyclobutanes have high ring&#8208;strain energies (~20.1 kcal/mol) and can be completely converted back to stiff&#8208;stilbenes. Such a reversible cycloaddition/reversion process offers a promising platform for applications in responsive and energy storage materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fighting Antimicrobial Resistance: Innovative Drugs in Antibacterial Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the fight against bacterial infections, particularly those caused by multi&#8208;resistant pathogens, the need for new antibacterials is undoubted in scientific communities. and is by now also widely perceived by the general population. However, the antibacterial research landscape has changed considerably over the past years. The majority of big pharma companies has left the field and thus, the decline in R&amp;D on antibacterials severely impacts the drug pipeline. In past years, antibacterial research increasingly relies on smaller companies or academic research institutions, which mostly have only limited financial resources, to carry a drug discovery and development process from the beginning and through the clinical phases. This review formulates the requirements for an antibacterial in regard of targeted pathogens and resistance mechanisms. Strategies are shown for the discovery of new antibacterial structures originating from natural sources, chemical synthesis and more recent AI approaches. This is complemented by principles for the computer&#8208;aided design of antibacterials and the refinement of a lead structure. The second part of the article comprises a compilation of promising antibacterial molecules classified according to bacterial target areas. Aspects of the origin, the antibacterial spectrum, resistance and the current development status of the presented drug molecules are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilisation of a Strontium Hydride with a Monodentate Carbazolyl Ligand and its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular strontium hydride 2[(dtbpCbz)SrH(L)]2 (L = benzene, toluene) was isolated and stabilized by employing a sterically demanding carbazole ligand (dtbpCbz = 1,8&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;ditert&#173;butyl&#173;phenyl)&#8208;3,6&#8208;ditertbutylcarbazolyl). Compound 2 was synthesized via phenylsilane metathesis with the corresponding amide (dtbpCbz)SrN(SiMe3)2 and characterized by 1H&#160;NMR, XRD and vibrational spectroscopy methods. We further investigated the stoichiometric reactivity of 2 towards carbon monoxide, azobenzene and trimethylsilylacetylene, showing three distinct reactivity pathways: addition, reduction and deprotonation. The reaction of 2 with carbon monoxide yields the ethenediolate complex 4 via addition, while with azobenzene reduction of the N&#8208;N double bond and release of hydrogen were observed, affording a heteroleptic strontium complex with a radical azobenzenyl ligand (5). The terminal alkyne is deprotonated by the hydride moiety to give the acetylide complex 6.</dc:description>

         <title>Selection of Plastic&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers for Microplastics Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are critical materials for modern technological applications, yet environmental contamination by microplastics has become a growing concern. In this study, DNA aptamers were isolated for two of the most abundant plastic materials: polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS). These aptamers contain approximately 90% cytosine and thymine but only 10% purine content. Among them, the PVC&#8208;1 aptamer binds to PVC with six&#8208;fold higher capacity than a random sequenced DNA. Among the tested plastic materials, PVC and PS exhibited the highest specific binding capacity. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled PVC&#8208;1 aptamer, PS/PVC microplastics as low as 1 mg were detected, and the aptamer was selective for microplastics over other environmentally relevant materials, such as silica. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the aptamer attempted to maximize contact with the plastic surface for adsorption. This plastic&#8208;binding aptamer is expected to find applications in environmental monitoring and has fundamental implications for surface&#8208;binding aptamers.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Fixation and Release Cycle Featuring a Trinuclear Zinc Complex for Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 capture technology can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. CO2 capture driven by electrochemical reactions is attractive because the operation is carried out at normal temperature and pressure and involves a simple input system using electrical energy. Although promising metal complexes with high CO2 fixation performance have been reported, there are few studies on systems that combine electrochemical reactions and metal complexes. Here, we demonstrated stable CO2 fixation&#8208;release cycles using an electrochemical system with trinuclear Zn(II) complex (Zn3L) as the CO2 fixative and an ionic liquid as a supporting electrolyte for the stable operation. This system showed a faster CO2 fixation rate than that of an aqueous alkaline solution at the same concentration. Continuous release and refixation of CO2 were achieved by decomposition and reconstruction of the complex structure induced by H+ and OH&#8722; supplied from a bipolar membrane equipped in the electrolytic cell. The CO2 fixation&#8208;release cycle was demonstrated even for dilute CO2 (450 ppm) in air, where the CO2 capture rate reached approximately 46% of CO2 contained in the air under an air flow condition of 200 mL&#11825;min&#8722;1. This case, combining electrochemical drive and metal complexes, will provide a new option for CO2 capture technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Restraining Planar Gliding in Single&#8208;Crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 Cathodes by Combining Bulk and Surface Modification Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The delamination cracking from planar gliding along the (003) facets and anisotropic lattice strain perpendicular to the (003) facets inevitable lead to degradation of Ni&#8208;rich single&#8208;crystal cathode materials, adversely affecting their cyclability. Herein, we rationally design a single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (SC90) cathode with robust chemo&#8208;mechanical properties, in which coherently grown MgO6 octahedra and BO4 tetrahedra are incorporated into the lattice, and a stabilizing Mg3(BO3)2 layer is concurrently formed on the particle surface. Multiscale in/ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that introducing the MgO6 and BO4 units leads to a &#8220;pinning effect&#8221; within the layered structure. This in turn strongly mitigates mechanical degradation by reducing planar gliding and delamination cracking over extended cycling. Moreover, the Mg3(BO3)2 coating maintains fast lithium diffusion by suppressing parasitic reactions at the cathode|electrolyte interface. The tailored SC90 cathode exhibits a capacity retention of ~88% after 300 cycles at 5C rate, significantly outperforming the pristine counterpart (~60%). Additionally, a pouch&#8208;type full cell with a graphite anode sustains a specific discharge capacity of 177 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles, with 90% capacity retention. This work highlights the &#8220;pining effect&#8221; in preventing unfavorable slab sliding and structural deterioration, offering new insights for designing advanced ultrahigh Ni single&#8208;crystal cathodes.</dc:description>

However, due to the bottlenecks in detecting low&#8208;abundance secreted proteins and extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins (collectively referred to as the secretome) against a background of high&#8208;abundance proteins in serum&#8208;containing culture medium, the comprehensive investigation of the secretome at the single&#8208;cell level using nanoLC&#8208;MS/MS still remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel single&#8208;cell secretome profiling (SCSP) method by integrating the metabolic labeling of newly synthesized proteins, click chemistry&#8208;based enrichment, and in situ digestion of the labeled secretome in an alkyne&#8208;functionalized capillary micro&#8208;reactor, followed by nanoLC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. By this method, an average of 389 protein groups were quantified from the secretome of single HeLa cells (n&#8201;=&#8201;17), with a total of 752 protein groups confidently identified in the single&#8208;cell secretome, which is a significant increase compared to the previously reported targeted analysis limited to dozens of secreted proteins by antibody recognition. These results indicated that our developed SCSP method would provide a powerful tool to gain insights into secretion heterogeneity and intercellular communication at the single&#8208;cell level.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemically Powered Rotary Molecular Motor Based on Reversible Oxazepine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While biological machines are powered mainly by chemical transformations, chemically driven artificial rotary motor systems are very limited. Here, we report an aniline&#8208;phenol&#8208;based rotary molecular motor that operates via an information ratchet mechanism. The 360&#176; directional rotation about a single covalent bond can be chemically driven by reversible oxazepine formation. Both the oxazepine formation and hydrolysis steps are kinetically gated via dynamic kinetic resolution, arising from the kinetic bias of chiral catalysts for enantiomers. Given the 95% ee (97.5:2.5) and 88% ee (94:6) of the individual gating steps of motor analogues, the overall directionality ratio could be calculated to be 91.7:8.3 (97.5% x 94% &#8776; 91.7%), which means that the motor will make one mistake (backward rotation) approximately every 11 to 12 turns.</dc:description>

         <title>High Charge Carrier Mobility in Porphyrin Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy experiments show that charge carriers, generated by an optical pulse (h&#957;), on a &#960;&#8208;conjugated porphyrin nanoribbon are exceptionally mobile. The porphyrin nanoribbons are polydisperse polymers synthesized by nickel(0)&#8208;mediated Yamamoto coupling followed by oxidative planarization, and have an average degree of polymerization of up to 37 repeat units (length 31&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Polydisperse edge&#8208;fused nickel(II) porphyrin nanoribbons have been synthesized by Yamamoto coupling followed by gold(III)&#8208;mediated fusion, with average degrees of polymerization of up to 37 repeat units (length 31&#8197;nm). Time&#8208;resolved optical&#8208;pump terahertz spectroscopy measurements indicate that photo&#8208;generated charge carriers have dc mobilities of up to 205&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in these nanoribbons, exceeding the values previously reported for most other types of nanoribbon or &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer.

         <title>Fluorinated Squareimines for Molecular Sieving of Aromatic over Aliphatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squareimines are a new class of electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles with a unique rectangular structure that facilitates interactions with the electron&#8208;deficient panels, enabling selective separation of aromatic hydrocarbons from aliphatic mixtures. By using dynamic covalent imine chemistry, crystalline material NDI2F42 is obtained in high yields, with this material demonstrating rapid adsorption and high selectivities for the sieving of aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The development of more energy&#8208;efficient separation technologies is essential. Especially the separation of cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons from their aromatic counterparts remains a significant challenge due to azeotrope formation and similar physical properties, often requiring energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we introduce a novel class of electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles with a unique rectangular structure to optimise interactions within the pore, enabling the highly selective molecular sieving of aromatic compounds from mixtures. Utilising dynamic covalent imine chemistry, the squareimine NDI2F42&#8208;based crystalline functional material is directly obtained from the reaction mixture in a single self&#8208;assembly step in high yields of 83&#8201;%, alongside the larger NDI2F82 congener, which can be obtained in 69&#8201;% yield. In vapour sorption and diffusion experiments, NDI2F42 demonstrates rapid adsorption kinetics with selectivities of 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 for benzene over cyclohexane and 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 for toluene over methylcyclohexane, while single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies indicate that the selectivity is primarily governed by directed interactions between the electron&#8208;deficient panels and aromatic guests.

         <title>Applicable Descriptors under Weak Metal&#8208;Oxygen d&#8211;p Interaction for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New descriptors are presented for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in ionic systems. Through first&#8208;principles calculations, the limitations of the most widely used and crucial descriptors d&#8208;band center and charge transfer energy, are demonstrated. Novel descriptors, &#955;1 and &#955;2, are proposed for more accurate OER performance predictions. Their application to multi&#8208;component and high&#8208;entropy oxides offers insights into designing more efficient catalytic materials.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in water electrolysis and renewable energy conversion processes. Descriptors are utilized to elucidate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of OER catalytic materials, yet each descriptor exhibits specificity to particular systems. Currently, there is a lack of effective descriptors to describe the relationship between electronic structure and OER performance in ionic systems. This study reveals for the first time that widely used OER descriptors, the d&#8208;band center and charge transfer energy, are limited in their effectiveness for oxide systems dominated by ionic bonds, in which ionic interactions significantly enhance or suppress the catalytic activity. Furthermore, composite descriptors tailored for ionic systems are proposed, with findings extended to complex multi&#8208;component and high&#8208;entropy oxides. The results indicate that the metal d&#8208;band unoccupied states parameter and the active states parameter can serve as effective OER descriptors for ionic catalytic materials. This work addresses the gap in OER descriptors for ionic systems, offering a new theoretical foundation and guidance for the development of efficient OER catalytic materials.

Detailed information is obtained for the reversible H+&#8208;transfer interconverting reactive &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxodicopper(II) and &#956;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxodicopper(II) species, including the structural characterization of H&#8208;bond donor adducts and a DFT mapping of the correlated H+&#8208;transfer and &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8594;&#956;1,1&#8208;peroxo rearrangement. This establishes a mechanistic basis for a key component of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactivity involving biorelevant Cu2/O2 intermediates.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonds involving the oxygen atoms of intermediates that result from copper&#8208;mediated O2 activation play a key role for controlling the reactivity of Cux/O2 active sites in metalloenzymes and synthetic model complexes. However, structural insight into H&#8208;bonding in such transient species as well as thermodynamic information about proton transfer to or from the O2&#8208;derived ligands is scarce. Here we present a detailed study of the reversible interconversion of a &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxodicopper(II) complex ([1]+) and its &#956;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo congener ([2]+) via (de)protonation, including the isolation and structural characterization of several H&#8208;bond donor (HBD) adducts of [1]+ and the determination of binding constants. For one of these adducts a temperature&#8208;dependent &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxo/&#956;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo equilibrium associated with reversible H+&#8208;translocation is observed, its thermodynamics investigated experimentally and computationally, and effects of H&#8208;bonding on spectroscopic parameters of the CuII2(&#956;1,2&#8208;O2) species are revealed. DFT calculations allowed to fully map and correlate the trajectories of H+&#8208;transfer and &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8594;&#956;1,1&#8208;peroxo rearrangement. These findings enhance our understanding of two key intermediates in bioinspired Cu2/O2 chemistry.

         <title>Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Access to Enantioenriched Chiral Aziridine Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective hydrophosphination of 2H&#8208;azirines is reported based on a newly discovered Mn(I) catalyst that plays an important role in both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the process. Various valuable aziridine phosphines can now be accessed in high yields and enantiopurities. DFT calculations provide mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Herein, we present the first catalytic asymmetric nucleophilic addition of diarylphosphines to 2H&#8208;azirines, facilitated by a chiral Mn(I) complex. This method not only provides access to novel class of derivatives of the aziridine core &#8211; a structural motif recognized for its antitumor and antibacterial properties &#8211; but also introduces a phosphine moiety alongside the generation of an NH moiety within a strained three&#8208;membered ring. The discovery of this new Mn(I) complex that both enables the reaction and induces stereoselectivity is pivotal, as it underscores the significant potential of this earth&#8208;abundant metal in advancing asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Leveraging Ligand Desymmetrization to Enrich Structural Diversity of Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Toxic Chemical Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the ligand desymmetrization approach, a flexible tetratopic carboxylate ligand with a tetrahedral geometry was designed to construct four Zr&#8208;based MOF structures, in which the ligand configurations and Zr6 cluster connectivities can be controlled by varying solvents and modulators.







Abstract
The discovery of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel structures provides significant opportunities for developing porous solids with new properties and enriching the structural diversity of functional materials for various applications. The rational design of building units with specific geometric conformations is essential to direct the construction of MOFs with unique properties. Herein, we leverage a ligand desymmetrization approach to construct a series of new MOFs. A flexible tetratopic carboxylate ligand with a tetrahedral geometry was designed and assembled with a Zr6 cluster, generating four Zr&#8208;based MOF structures: NU&#8208;2600, NU&#8208;2700, NU&#8208;2800, and NU&#8208;1802, in which the ligand configurations and Zr6 cluster connectivities can be controlled by varying solvents and modulators during synthesis. Except for NU&#8208;1802, these represent entirely new topologies. Notably, NU&#8208;1802 exhibits structural flexibility, with up to a 74&#8201;% reduction in the unit cell volume as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Given their microporous structures, we studied the adsorption behaviors of n&#8208;hexane and 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide to explore the structure&#8211;property relationships of these MOFs. Overall, this work highlights ligand desymmetrization as a powerful method to enrich MOF structural diversity and access complex MOFs with non&#8208;default topologies suitable for applications such as toxic gas capture.

         <title>Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Stereotactic Anchoring and Spatial Separation of Porphyrins for Amplified Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Pyroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;solvent strategy was employed to synthesize a porphyrin&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF) with novel crystal structure and unique morphology. The exquisite configuration ensured the orderly anchoring and precise spatial separation of porphyrin molecules, effectively circumventing the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions. This unique structural design endows Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF with excellent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capabilities, and under ultrasound activation, it can effectively induce tumor cell pyroptosis and activate immune responses.







Abstract
Ultrasound&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is pivotal in specifically inducing pyroptosis of tumor cells. However, the effectiveness of pyroptosis is generally hindered by the constraints of ROS generation efficiency. Herein, a new porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF) was rationally designed via an innovative dual&#8208;solvent strategy to amplify ROS generation for ultrasound&#8208;controlled pyroptosis. The crystal structure of Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF was elucidated by continuous rotation electron diffraction technique, revealing its regular and rigid conformation. The porphyrin molecules were precisely oriented and firmly confined within the scaffold, effectively restricting intramolecular motion. The ample distance of 6.8&#8197;&#197; between two porphyrin molecules, combined with the interaction region indicator visualization, confirmed the absence of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in the Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF framework, thereby avoiding the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. Furthermore, the permanent porosity and expansive surface area of Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF enhanced its interaction with oxygen. These ingenious structural features endowed Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF with a unique ability to generate a large amount of singlet oxygen under ultrasound activation. Meanwhile, the impetus of ultrasound also accelerated the rate of the Fenton reaction catalyzed by iron ions, significantly boosting the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Benefiting from the dual amplification of ROS, Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF could efficiently induce tumor cells pyroptosis under ultrasound stimulation, thereby intensifying the potency of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Electrostatically Dominated Pre&#8208;Organization in Cyclodextrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interactions have been found to dominate the pre&#8208;organization of carboxylate anionic guests inside the tunnels of cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic frameworks. These interactions are so strong that they override the influence of all other noncovalent bonding interactions present in the tunnels.







Abstract
Electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged entities play a key role in pre&#8208;organizing substrates and stabilizing transition states of reactions in enzymes. The use of electrostatic interactions to pre&#8208;organize ions in nanoconfined pores, however, has not been investigated to its full potential. Herein, we describe how carboxylate anions can be pre&#8208;organized at the behest of their electrostatic interactions with K+ cations in nanoconfined tunnels present in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic frameworks, i.e., CD&#8208;MOFs. Several carboxylate anions, which are all much smaller than the cavities of the tunnels, were visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallography when nanoconfined in CD&#8208;MOFs, despite the large voids present in the tunnels. These anions were found to be aligned within a planar array defined by four K+ cations, positioned around the periphery of the tunnels. The strong electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate anions and the K+ cations dictate the orientation of the anions and override the influence of all other possible noncovalent bonding interactions between them and the tunnels. Consequently, the aligned pairs of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin rings constituting the tunnels become distorted, resulting in them having lower symmetry and fewer disordered carboxylate anions in the solid state. Our findings offer a transformative strategy for controlling the packing and orientation of ions in nanoconfined environments.

&lt;p&gt;Electrostatic interactions have been found to dominate the pre-organization of carboxylate anionic guests inside the tunnels of cyclodextrin metal-organic frameworks. These interactions are so strong that they override the influence of all other noncovalent bonding interactions present in the tunnels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged entities play a key role in pre-organizing substrates and stabilizing transition states of reactions in enzymes. The use of electrostatic interactions to pre-organize ions in nanoconfined pores, however, has not been investigated to its full potential. Herein, we describe how carboxylate anions can be pre-organized at the behest of their electrostatic interactions with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations in nanoconfined tunnels present in &#947;-cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic frameworks, i.e., CD-MOFs. Several carboxylate anions, which are all much smaller than the cavities of the tunnels, were visualized by X-ray crystallography when nanoconfined in CD-MOFs, despite the large voids present in the tunnels. These anions were found to be aligned within a planar array defined by four K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations, positioned around the periphery of the tunnels. The strong electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate anions and the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations dictate the orientation of the anions and override the influence of all other possible noncovalent bonding interactions between them and the tunnels.

         <title>Modulating the Band Structure of Two&#8208;Dimensional Black Phosphorus via Electronic Effects of Organic Functional Groups for Enhanced Hydrogen Production Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that organic functional groups can modulate the band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus (BP). By modifying BP&#8242;s surface, these groups alter charge density and shift band&#8208;edge positions, enabling continuous tuning of BP's valence and conduction bands. This approach achieves high hydrogen evolution reaction rates under visible light, offering a flexible, cost&#8208;effective strategy for enhancing BP&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
Electronic effects of organic functional groups play a fundamental role in determining the rate and/or direction of organic chemical reactions. The implementation of this concept in selective organic catalysis is achieved by tuning the electronic effects of organic functional groups to alter the corresponding reactivity. However, this approach has hardly been applied to modulate the band structure of inorganic materials. Here, we show that modulating the electronic band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus (BP) is possible via the electronic effects of organic functional groups covalently modified on its surface. Organic functional group can either donate or withdraw charge density from BP surface, which will alter the bonding/anti&#8208;binding orbitals occupancy and thus shift the band&#8208;edge positions of functionalized BP downward/upward. Therefore, the valence&#8208;band maxima and the conduction&#8208;band minima of functionalized BP can be continuously tuned by changing the binding group with different Hammett parameters. Finally, unexpectedly high hydrogen evolution reaction rates under visible light are achieved using functionalized BP heterojunctions as photocatalysts. This work underscores the significant role of electronic effects in chemically controlling BP's band structure, offering greater flexibility and affordability beyond physical method limits.

         <title>Subtle Modifications in Interface Configurations of Iron/Cobalt Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts Determine Molecular CO2 Reduction Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strain has an adverse or conducive effect on catalytic activity. Strained cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine improves *CO binding for subsequent hydrogenation, attaining methanol Faradaic efficiency up to 52&#8201;%. However, strained iron phthalocyanine exacerbates *CO poisoning, leading to inferior CO production. We proposed *CO binding strength as an indicator for activity prediction.







Abstract
Strain engineering has emerged as a powerful approach in steering material properties. However, the mechanism and potential limitations remain poorly understood. Here we report that subtle changes in molecular configurations can profoundly affect, conducively or adversely, the catalytic selectivity and product turnover frequencies (TOFs) of CO2 reduction reaction. Specifically, introducing molecular curvature in cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine improves the multielectron reduction activity by favorable *CO hydrogenation, attaining methanol Faradaic efficiency up to 52&#8201;%. In stark contrast, strained iron phthalocyanine exacerbates *CO poisoning, leading to decreased TOFCO by &gt;50&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;VRHE and a rapid current decay. The uniform dispersion is crucial for optimizing electron transfer, while activity is distinctly sensitive to the local atomic environment around the active sites. Specifically, local strain either enhances binding to intermediates or poisons the catalytic sites. Our comprehensive analysis elucidates the intricate relationship between molecular structure and activities, offering insights into designing efficient heterogeneous molecular interfaces.

         <title>A Microrobotic System Based on Engineered Bacteria for Targeted Self&#8208;Driven Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform composed of engineered bacteria is developed to perform photochemical reactions for photodynamic therapy in a self&#8208;driven manner. One E. coli strain was genetically modified to produce 5&#8208;ALA and KatG, enabling the generation of PpIX and oxygen within tumors. Another E. coli strain was engineered to autonomously emit bioluminescence under the regulation of quorum sensing, to excite the photosensitizer formed in tumors.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used clinically to treat superficial tumors for decades. However, its effectiveness against deep&#8208;seated tumors has been limited by the inefficient delivery of the key components &#8208;light, photosensitizer, and oxygen&#8208; required for the photochemical reactions in PDT. Here, we present a novel platform that enables the photochemical reaction to occur in a self&#8208;driven manner, eliminating the need for external delivery of these components and instead orchestrating their endogenous generation within tumors. This was achieved by genetically modifying probiotic Escherichia coli to host three modules &#8208; Lux, Hem1, and KatG &#8208; responsible for light production, photosensitizer biosynthesis, and oxygen generation, respectively. The system is self&#8208;driven, relying solely on substrates within E. coli cells and tumors. The modules exhibited prolonged activity for days within in vivo mouse models, enabling metronomic PDT that induced an immune response. This research holds promise for revolutionizing PDT and overcoming the enduring challenges encountered in its application for treating deep&#8208;seated tumors.

         <title>A C156 Molecular Nanocarbon: Planar/Rippled Nanosheets Hybridization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hybrid nanocarbon composed of dissimilar naonosheets, has been synthesized. This hybrid possesses electronic properties similar to its components and exhibits a highly curved structure with configurational stability. This curved structure was found to accommodate C60 with a binding constant as high as 105&#8197;M&#8722;1. Moreover, this hybrid displays unusual anti&#8208;Kasha fluorescence emission and undergoes singlet fission in the thin film.







Abstract
A novel hybrid nanocarbon consisting of one rippled and two planar nanosheets has been synthesized and characterized. Two meso pairs of [5]helicenes are formed along the long molecular axis of the hybrid to connect rippled and planar subunits, leading to a stable conformation. It is shown that the hybrid possesses the individual electronic properties of the rippled and planar subunits. Compared to the rippled subunit, such hybrid has a better geometric match to C60 and complexes with C60 in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry, with the association constant on the order of 105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The hybrid displays unusual anti&#8208;Kasha fluorescence emission. The transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the singlet fission (SF) from higher level singlet excited states (Sn) is operative in the film of the hybrid.

Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,4&#8208;hydroarsination of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters is achieved in moderate to excellent yields with high to excellent enantioselectivity, based on the proposed nucleophilic [Cu]&#8722;AsPh2 species. As for &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, a 1,4&#8208;hydroarsination/enantioselective protonation event occurs smoothly in satisfying results. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amide, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphine sulfide are well applied in the present catalytic system. Finally, some control experiments show that HAsPh2 is activated through coordination with the copper(I) catalyst and HAsPh2 exhibits inferior soft Lewis basicity to HPPh2 in the presence of a copper(I)&#8208;bisphosphine complex.

         <title>Nanomaterials&#8208;Induced PANoptosis: A Promising Anti&#8208;Tumor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we delve into the foundational concept and underlying mechanisms of PANoptosis, emphasizing its pivotal role in oncology. We subsequently outline the most recent advancements in nanomedicine pertaining to PANoptosis&#8208;driven anticancer therapies. Furthermore, we explore the existing challenges and potential future directions for the clinical translation of PANoptosis&#8208;based treatments.







Abstract
Malignant tumors pose a significant threat to global public health. Promoting programmed cell death in cancer cells has become a critical strategy for cancer treatment. PANoptosis, a newly discovered form of regulated cell death, integrates key molecular components of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, activating these three death pathways simultaneously to achieve synergistic multi&#8208;mechanistic killing. PANoptosis significantly inhibits cancer cell growth and resistance and activates strong anti&#8208;tumor immune response, making tumor&#8208;specific induction of PANoptosis a potential cancer therapeutic strategy. Currently, cancer treatment research related to PANoptosis is focused mainly on the development of small molecules and cytokines. However, these approaches still face limitations in terms of metabolic stability and tumor specificity. The unique physicochemical properties and biological activities of nanomaterials hold significant promise for optimizing PANoptosis induction strategies. This review summarizes the concept and mechanisms of PANoptosis, highlights the latest applications of nanoagents in PANoptosis&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer therapy, and discusses the challenges and future directions for clinical translation. It is hoped that this review will inspire further exploration and development of PANoptosis&#8208;based cancer treatments, providing new perspectives for researchers in the field.

         <title>Single Atomic Cu&#8208;C3 Sites Catalyzed Interfacial Chemistry in Bi@C for Ultra&#8208;Stable and Ultrafast Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8211;C3 sites have been innovatively designed by the simple pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic framework. The Cu&#8211;C3 sites can serve as both a modulator to catalyze the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase and a promoter to facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of Na+, which endow the sample with high&#8208;efficient sodium ion storage performance.







Abstract
Regulating interfacial chemistry at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface by designing catalytic electrode material is crucial and challenging for optimizing battery performance. Herein, a novel single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8722;C3 site (Bi@SA Cu&#8722;C) have been designed via the simple pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic framework. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations indicate the Cu&#8722;C3 sites accelerate the dissociation of P&#8722;F and C&#8722;O bonds in NaPF6&#8208;ether&#8208;based electrolyte and catalyze the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase. In addition, the Cu&#8722;C3 sites with delocalized electron around Cu trigger an uneven charge distribution and induce an in&#8208;plane local electric field, which facilitates the adsorption of Na+ and reduces the Na+ migration energy barrier. Consequently, the obtained Bi@SA Cu&#8722;C achieves a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reversible capacity, ultrahigh rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling durability. The as&#8208;constructed full cell delivers a high capacity of 351&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 corresponding to an energy density of 265&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work provides a new strategy to realize high&#8208;efficient sodium ion storage for alloy&#8208;based anode through constructing single&#8208;atom modulator integrated catalysis and promotion effect into one entity.

         <title>Electron Transfer Mediator Modulates Type II Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Photosensitizers for Type I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal electron transfer&#8208;based strategy is introduced to modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). This approach enables the conversion of existing Type&#8197;II MOFs into Type&#8197;I MOFs with hypoxic tolerance to function effectively under low&#8208;oxygen conditions, providing new insight into the development of Type&#8197;I MOFs.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a minimally invasive and effective local treatment, heavily depends on photosensitizer (PS) performance and oxygen availability. Despite the use of PS&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to address the solubility and aggregation issues of PSs, the inherent hypoxic intolerance of mainstream Type&#8197;II PDT remains challenging. Herein, we report an electron transfer strategy for the fabrication of hypoxia&#8208;tolerant Type&#8197;I MOFs by encapsulating thymoquinone (TQ) into existing Type&#8197;II MOFs. With TQ serving as an effective electron transfer mediator, it facilitates the electron transfer process from the MOF ligand PS to oxygen, establishing the Type&#8197;I pathway and attenuating the original Type&#8197;II pathway. Four representative porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs are synthesized to demonstrate the proposed strategy. Our findings reveal that TQ@MOF&#8208;1 nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit enhanced anticancer activity under hypoxic conditions and superior in vivo antitumor efficacy compared to parent MOF&#8208;1 NPs. This work offers an effective and universal strategy to modulate ROS generation in PS&#8208;based MOFs, endowing hypoxic tolerance with improved PDT performance against solid tumors.

         <title>Mechanics&#8208;Photophysics Correlation in Tough, Stretchable and Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescence Ionogels Deciphered by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) spectra to establish mechanics&#8208;DMA&#8208;photophysics correlation for ionogels. This resembles parallel and sequential processing of human brain from sensation to cognition. This work provides an enabling strategy towards the early indication of performance of ionogels without laborious characterization.







Abstract
The development of tough, stretchable and long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials holds great significance for manufacturing and processing photoluminescent materials, but limited techniques are available to profile their mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation. Here we report glassy ionogels, and their mechanical properties and photophysical properties are fused by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), functioning like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking sensory perception and cognition. Depending on two special temperatures presented in DMA curves, Tloss (the peak of loss modulus (E&#8221;)) and Tg (glass transition temperature), the ionogels can vary from being either tough with persistent phosphorescence, extensible with effective phosphorescence or resilience with inefficient phosphorescence. Leveraging this method, we achieve stretchable and long&#8208;lived RTP ionogels with tensile yield strength of 53&#8197;MPa, tensile strain of 497&#8201;%, Young's modulus of 782&#8197;MPa, toughness of 111.2&#8197;MJ/m3, and lifetime of 113.05&#8197;ms. Our work provides a simple yet powerful method to reveal the mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation of RTP ionogels, to predict their performance without laborious synthesis and characterization, opening new avenues for applications of RTP materials, including applications in harsh conditions (257&#8197;K or 347&#8197;K), shape memory and shape reconstruction.

         <title>Idealizing Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Film Competitive by Surface Lattice Etching&#8208;Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a novel in situ lattice etching&#8208;reconstruction strategy enabled by hot organic esters with low polarity to idealize air&#8208;processed perovskite films for competitive solar cells regardless of humidity. Arising from the dynamic dissolution of nanoimpurities and selective recrystallization of Br&#8208;rich phase on the defective perovskite surface, we deliver a champion PCE of 15.37&#8201;% for all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br cell with excellent stability.







Abstract
Air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells are desirable for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing application in the future, yet the presence of moisture and oxygen goes against perovskite crystallization and deteriorates phase stabilization, leading to the formation of substantial defective nano&#8208;impurities, especially on the vulnerable surface. Here, we propose a strategy to simultaneously remove superficial defect layer and solidify the surface by soaking air&#8208;fabricated perovskite film into low&#8208;polar organic esters at elevated temperature to trigger an in situ dynamic surface lattice disassemble and reconstruction process. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results indicate that the inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite is first dissolved and then the Br&#8208;rich phase is recrystallized at solid&#8211;liquid interface owing to the balance between weak solubility and high&#8208;temperature induced annealing process, thus hardening the soft surface and releasing the lattice tensile stress, which benefits the minimization of interfacial recombination and improvement of the structural stability. As a result, we prepare a carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br device in complete air without precise control on humidity, achieving a champion efficiency of 15.37&#8201;% with excellent resistance to harsh attackers. This method offers a promising avenue for overcoming the limit of processing conditions on advancing perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Selective Zeolites for Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation&#8208;Carbonylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zeolite&#8208;based compartmentalized approach for one&#8208;step carbonylation reactions with CO2 is developed. We show that zeolite shape&#8208;selectivity is key to impede unwanted hydrogenation of olefinic substrates and that our catalytic tandem concept enables an equilibrium shift of the low temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction, ultimately resulting in the efficient formation of aldehydes, esters and amides.







Abstract
The valorization of carbon dioxide as a C1 building block in C&#8722;C bond forming reactions is a critical link on the road to carbon&#8208;circular chemistry. Activation of this inert molecule through reduction with H2 to carbon monoxide in the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction can be followed by a wide spectrum of consecutive carbonylation reactions, but the RWGS is severely equilibrium limited at the moderate temperatures of carbonylations. Here we successfully reconcile both reactions in one pot, while avoiding incompatibilities through a zeolite&#8208;based compartmentalized approach. More specifically, Pt encapsulated in a small&#8208;pore LTA zeolite selectively generates carbon monoxide in mild reaction conditions; an ensuing one&#8208;pot carbonylation reaction allows to shift the equilibrium through continuous consumption of CO. Moreover, the zeolite encapsulation avoids undesired reactions like hydrogenation of the olefin reactant through a molecular sieving effect. This strategy was first studied in&#8208;depth for Rh&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydroformylation with CO2/H2, affording aldehydes in good yields with high regioselectivities. The methodology was then extended to a variety of carbonylations using CO2 for the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals.

         <title>Anomeric Amide&#8208;Enabled Alkene&#8208;Arene and Alkene&#8208;Alkene Aminative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the prominence of C&#8722;N bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions as a strategy to assemble molecular fragments, aminative coupling approaches, in which two fragments are assembled directly at the heteroatom, represents a rarely exploited retrosynthetic strategy. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and implementation of an anomeric amide reagent capable of promoting highly regioselective aminative alkene&#8208;arene and alkene&#8208;alkene coupling reactions. This transformation follows a sequence of catalyst&#8208;free chloroamination, N&#8208;deprotection, and formal nitrene functionalization, all in one&#8208;pot. Due to the simplicity of both the protocol and the building blocks required, high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was employed to rapidly and efficiently explore a wide range of chemical space and determine the limits of reactivity. In addition, alternative reactivity modes from the functionalized intermediates delivered by this protocol demonstrate the divergent nature of this aminative coupling strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Sensitive Layered Hybrid Double Perovskites Driven by a Dual&#8208;Ion&#8208;Woven Supramolecular Framework for X&#8208;ray Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A promising candidate for X&#8208;ray detection is layered hybrid double perovskites (LHDPs) with excellent structural stability, but their sensitivity is generally limited by unsatisfactory interlayer charge transport. Herein, employing one ethylenediamine (EDA) chain as a structural inducer, we successfully obtain unusual Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) phase LHDPs, (EDABr)4AgBiBr8 and (EDABr)4CuBiBr8, featuring a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#8208;like (RP&#8208;like) interlayer. Thanks to the bridging of bromine anions, organic cations are linked via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds, where two ionic spacers are orderly woven into a supramolecular framework. Consequently, the RP&#8208;like interlayer space is regulated by the dual&#8208;ion&#8208;woven supramolecular framework with embedded charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bond networks, remarkably enriching interlayer interactions and boosting charge transport. Through theoretical calculations, structural roles of the supramolecular framework are elucidated by extra orbital contribution and large diffusion barrier of Br anions. As proof of concept, the sensitivity of RP&#8208;like devices up to 5250 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 is a record&#8208;high of LHDP&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors for now, while a low detection limit (91 nGyair s&#8722;1) and outstanding radiation&#8208;resistant capability (50 Gyair) are achieved. Moreover, an oriented membrane device is prepared to demonstrate high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray tomography. These findings offer a brand&#8208;new interlayer&#8208;modulation strategy for the construction of sensitive and stable scintillation semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Mechanism of Nucleation and Growth Enables Synthesis of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Desired Macroscopic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By combining in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, Zr K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that the properties of the final MOF are influenced by H2O and HCl via affecting the nucleation and crystal growth at the molecular level. The nucleation implies hydrolysis of monomeric zirconium chloride complexes into zirconium&#8208;oxo species, and this process is promoted by H2O and inhibited by HCl, allowing to control crystal size by adjusting H2O/Zr and HCl/Zr ratios. The rate&#8208;determining step of crystal growth is represented by the condensation of monomeric and oligomeric zirconium&#8208;oxo species into clusters, or nodes, with the structure identical to that in secondary building units (SBU) of UiO&#8208;66 framework. The rapid crystallization in the absence of HCl leads to formation of defective secondary building units with missing zirconium atoms, providing a pathway to control the number of defects in UiO&#8208;66 crystals. Remarkably, we have shown that assembling of the metal nodes and linkers into the UiO&#8208;66 structure is not the rate&#8208;limiting step, and the degree of deprotonation of the linker has no direct effect on the crystallization kinetics or crystal size of product.</dc:description>

Herein, we present an in&#160;situ approach to creating optical heterojunctions using hydration&#8208;mediated flexible molecular crystals. These hydrated multi&#8208;component molecular solids&#160;display strong blue emitting optical waveguides with minimal optical loss (0.005 dB/&#956;m) and excellent flexibility (elastic modulus: 3.87 GPa). The water&#8208;mediated process enables the molecular microwires with tunable elastic and plastic deformation, as well as reversible uptake and release of lattice water, facilitating the formation of flexible heterojunctions. Spectral analysis and theoretical modeling reveal that these microwires exhibit both photochromism and color&#8208;tunable dual emission (fluorescence and phosphorescence), expanding their utility in photonic information encoding. Therefore, this work introduces a hydration&#8208;mediated molecular engineering strategy for fabricating crystalline heterojunctions with on&#8208;demand processability and controllable emission sequences, enabling optical signal manipulation at the micro/nanoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Activity Shifts of Tin&#8208;Based Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: pH&#8208;Dependent Behavior of Single&#8208;Atom versus Polyatomic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin (Sn)&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce formic acid, but the intricate influence of the structural sensitivity in single&#8208;atom Sn (e.g., Sn&#8208;N&#8208;C) and polyatomic Sn (e.g., SnOx and SnSx; x=1,2) on their pH&#8208;dependent performance remains enigmatic. Herein, we integrate large&#8208;scale data mining (with &gt;2,300 CO2RR catalysts from available experimental literature during the past decade), ab initio computations, machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamic simulations, and pH&#8208;field coupled microkinetic modelling to unravel their pH dependence. We reveal a fascinating contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8208;N4&#8208;C and polyatomic Sn exhibits opposite behaviors due to their differing dipole moment changes upon *OCHO formation. Such response leads to an intriguing opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8208;N4&#8208;C and polyatomic Sn. Subsequent experimental validations of turnover frequency and current density under both neutral and alkaline conditions well aligned with our theoretical predictions. Most importantly, our analysis suggests the necessity of distinct optimization strategies for *OCHO binding energy on different types of Sn&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning Assisted Prediction of Donor Numbers: Guiding Rational Fabrication of Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolytes are of interest in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, how the intrinsic electron&#8208;donating capability of polymer segments involved in coordination affects lithium&#8208;ion dissociation/transmission and rationally guides the design and fabrication of electrolytes is a highly exploratory topic. This study proposes a workable method that integrates machine learning with density functional theory to predict donor numbers (DN) for polymer building units. Using this approach, polymer chains with optimized DN are designed, effectively modulating the solvation structure of lithium&#8208;ion. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the positive impact of polymer chains on rapid transport of lithium ions. Experimental validation of the proposed zwitterionic polymer electrolyte (ZPE) showcases satisfactory parameters: ion conductivity (0.59 mS cm&#8208;1), ion migration numbers (0.82), and activation energy (0.016 eV). Electrochemical analysis on Li|ZPE|Li symmetric batteries demonstrate sustained plating/stripping performance exceeding 3000 hours at a current density of 0.2 mA cm&#8208;2. Assembled NCM|ZPE|Li batteries exhibit stable cycling over 1400 cycles at 4.3 V, with a capacity retention ratio of 92.3%. Moreover, even under ultra&#8208;high voltages of 4.5 V and 4.7 V, NCM|ZPE|Li batteries display stable cycling performances. This approach offers a paradigmatic strategy for polymer molecule design, advancing sustainable battery technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bead&#8208;Based DNA Synthesis and Sequencing for Integrated Data Storage Using Digital Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA is considered as a prospective candidate for the next&#8208;generation data storage medium, due to its high coding density, long cold&#8208;storage lifespan, and low energy consumption. Despite these advantages, challenges remain in achieving high&#8208;fidelity, fully integrated, and cost&#8208;efficient DNA storage system. In this study, a homemade digital microfluidics&#8208;based compact DNA data storing pipeline is orchestrated to complete the entire process from synthesis to sequencing. The synthetic half employs phosphoramidite chemistry on 200&#8208;nm magnetic beads, where the dimethyltrityl protecting group is removed by droplet manipulation of trichloroacetic acid. The sequencing counterpart relies on pyrophosphate releasing originated from polymerase&#8208;catalyzed primer extension, which leads to photon&#8208;countable chemiluminescence signal in 2.5&#8208;&#956;L drops of trienzyme cascading reactions. Further resequencing plus plurality voting can improve the nucleobase accuracy beyond 95%. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial, semantic information is saved in DNA via the Huffman coding&#160;and&#160;Reed&#8208;Solomon error&#8208;correction, and then robustly retrieved from this streamlined platform. As a result, it took a total of 6.5 h to writing and reading 8.3 bytes of data,&#160;equal to a storaging speed of 48 min/byte, much quicker than the previously reported. This bead&#8208;based miniaturized device promises an unattended protocol for achieving high&#8208;throughput, full&#8208;packaged, and above all, neatly precision DNA storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Passivation of Perovskite Films via Gradual Additive Release for Enhanced Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modifying perovskites with functional additives has proven effective in refining the crystallization process and passivating the defects of perovskite films, thereby ensuring high photovoltaic efficiencies. However, conventional methods that involve pre&#8208;mixing additives into the precursor solution often face challenges due to discrepancies in the spatial distribution of slow&#8208;diffused additives relative to dynamically formed defect sites, resulting in limited passivation effectiveness. To address this issue, this study innovatively proposes a dynamic passivation strategy that utilizes a pre&#8208;passivator to gradually release active additives during the thermal crystallization process of perovskite films. By leveraging the principle of energy minimization, these timely&#8208;released additives can interact precisely and selectively with the high&#8208;energy defect sites generated during crystallization, thus facilitating efficient additive utilization and in situ real&#8208;time defect passivation. Through analysis of crystallization kinetics and carrier dynamic, it is demonstrated that this dynamic passivation approach significantly improves film quality and prolongs carrier lifetime, outperforming traditional pre&#8208;mixing tactics. Consequently, the final perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33%, along with exceptional stability. This work provides strong support of tailored additive strategies aimed at further enhancing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells and their subsequent commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Depth&#8208;of&#8208;Discharge Dependent Capacity Decay Induced by the Accumulation of Oxidized Lattice Oxygen in Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>More and more basic practical application scenarios have been gradually ignored/disregarded, in fundamental research on rechargeable batteries, e.g. assessing cycle life under various depths&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DODs). Herein, although benefit from the additional energy density introduced by anionic redox, we critically revealed that lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathodes present anomalously poor capacity retention at low&#8208;DOD cycling, which is essentially different from typical layered cathodes (e.g. NCM), and pose a formidable impediment to the practical application of LRLO. We systemically demonstrated that DOD&#8208;dependent capacity decay is induced by the anionic redox and accumulation of oxidized lattice oxygen (On&#8208;). Upon low&#8208;DOD cycling, the accumulation of On&#8208; and the persistent presence of vacancies in the transition metal (TM) layer intensified the in&#8208;plane migration of TM, exacerbating the expansion of vacancy clusters, which further facilitated detrimental out&#8208;of&#8208;plane TM migration. As a result, the aggravated structural degradation of LRLO at low&#8208;DOD impeded reversible Li+ intercalation, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Furthermore, prolonged accumulation of On&#8208; persistently corroded the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, especially negative for pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cells with the shuttle effect. Once the &#8220;double&#8208;edged sword&#8221; effect of anionic redox being elucidated under practical condition, corresponding modification strategies/routes would become distinct for accelerating the practical application of LRLO.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Electron Oxidation Triggered by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excited Enzymes for Asymmetric Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By integrating enzymatic catalysis with photocatalysis, photoenzymatic catalysis emerges as a powerful strategy to enhance enzyme catalytic capabilities and provide superior stereocontrol in reactions involving reactive intermediates. Repurposing naturally occurring enzymes using visible light is among the most active directions of photoenzymatic catalysis. This Minireview focuses on a cutting&#8208;edge strategy in this direction, namely single&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation triggered non&#8208;natural biotransformations catalyzed by photoexcited enzymes. These straightforward transformations feature a unique radical mechanism initiated by single&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation, achieving redox&#8208;neutral non&#8208;natural C&#8208;C, C&#8208;O, and C&#8208;S bond formations, and expanding the chemical toolbox of enzymes. By highlighting recent advances in this field and emphasizing their catalytic mechanisms and synthetic potentials, innovative approaches for further photobiomanufacturing are anticipated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Piperazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (glycine anhydride, GA) has recently emerged as a valuable precursor for high&#8208;performance &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer semiconductors in organic electronics. We utilized GA to design a novel bisindolin&#8208;dihydropiperazine (IDHP)&#8208;based conjugated polymer, PIDHPTT, for aqueous chemical sensing. In the isatin&#8208;flanked monomer, GA exists as a non&#8208;conjugated lactam (DHP&#8208;NH) but converts to a conjugated lactim (DHP&#8208;OH) form within the polymer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that this conversion is driven by energy minimization via extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Neighboring DHP units in the lactim form facilitate this process through &#960;&#8208;bridges, demonstrating a vinylogous effect, which has previously only been observed in small molecules. This is the first study to report such a long&#8208;range vinylogous effect in a polymer due to the collective synergy of numerous functional groups. The OH groups in the lactim DHP interact more strongly with fluoride ions than other halides. PIDHPTT exhibits significant changes in optical absorption, electrochemical impedance, and charge transport in response to fluoride ions, which differ from responses to other halides. A water&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistor based on PIDHPTT shows excellent sensitivity and selectivity for fluoride ions, demonstrating the potential of this polymer design for chemical sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanocarriers Made of Natural Fatty Acids: Modulation of Their Release Profiles through Photo&#8208;Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural fatty acids are attractive carrier materials for drug delivery, but their rapid dissolution and degradation in vivo calls for new strategies to enhance their stability. Here we report a simple and versatile method capable of photo&#8208;crosslinking carriers made of natural fatty acids for drug delivery under controlled release. By optimizing the crosslinking density, the nanoscale carriers show a high drug loading efficiency, together with a stable network structure for minimal degradation in a body fluid mimic. Fluorescence microscopy analysis also reveals the exceptional intracellular stability of the crosslinked network, resulting in negligible cytotoxicity toward A549 cells up to 24 h when loaded with a potent anticancer drug. We further extend this strategy to microscale carriers fabricated using electrospray. Upon photo&#8208;crosslinking, the carriers show a retarded release of nerve growth factor, resulting in slower neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion. This work holds promise for addressing the efficacy and safety issues critical to nanomedicine and related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from co&#8208;Reduction of N2 and CO2 on Z&#8208;Schematic SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Z&#8208;schematic SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 catalyst is efficient for urea photosynthesis from CO2 and N2 reduction. It has dual active sites for adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2 and the accelerated kinetics for C&#8722;N coupling reaction. The energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step is reduced on SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4.







Abstract
The photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and N2 is a sustainable method for urea synthesis under mild conditions. However, high&#8208;yield synthesis of urea is a challenge due to the sluggish kinetics of the C&#8722;N coupling reaction. Herein, we have successfully engineered a Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst, SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4, for boosting photocatalytic urea synthesis via enhancing the initial CO2 and N2 adsorption step and reducing the energy barrier for the C&#8722;N coupling reaction. A high urea yield of 8054.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved on SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4, which was significantly higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst, with accelerated charge transfer by FeS, not only had dual active sites for the chemical adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2, but also retained the high conduction band (&#8722;1.50&#8197;eV) and accelerated supply of electrons and protons, which are responsible for its good photoreduction activity and significantly reduced energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of C&#8722;N coupling reaction.

         <title>Rapid, Non&#8208;Invasive, Accurate Diagnosis and Efficient Clearance of Metastatic Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile theranostic nanosystem (FLAGC) is reported for rapid, non&#8208;invasive, accurate diagnosis and efficient clearance of metastatic lymph nodes. FLAGC is easily drained to sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) for precise localization. FLAGC is then specifically lit up by the low pH and over&#8208;expressed myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in an accurate diagnosis of metastatic SLNs by chemical resonance energy transfer (CRET) luminescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window. Further, the tumor was efficiently eradicated through Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT). Our findings offer a new paradigm for identifying and eliminating clinically positive lymph nodes.







Abstract
Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently the standard procedure for clinical cancer diagnosis and treatment, but still faces the risks of false negatives and tumor metastasis, as well as time&#8208;consuming pathological evaluation procedure. Herein, we proposed a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) theranostic nanosystem (FLAGC) for rapid, non&#8208;invasive, accurate diagnosis and efficient clearance of metastatic lymph nodes in breast cancer. Initialized by chlorin e6 (Ce6), a pH&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic amino acid fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;L&#8208;histidine (Fmoc&#8208;His) was assembled with Gd3+, luminol, and AgAuSe quantum dots (AAS QDs) to form FLAGC. In FLAGC, luminol and AAS QDs form a NIR&#8208;II chemical resonance energy transfer (CRET) system (Luminol&#8208;AAS); Ce6 initiates the assembly and also serves as a photosensitizer. Upon subcutaneous injection, FLAGC is easily drained into SLNs, achieving their precise localization. Subsequently, the acidity of tumor microenvironment triggers the rapid disassembly of FLAGC, exposing Luminol&#8208;AAS. myeloperoxidase (MPO) secreted by tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and neutrophils in SLNs mediates the oxidation of luminol, lighting up AAS QDs through the CRET process for precise diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes. Moreover, highly efficient clearance of positive lymph nodes is achieved through Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy. Our strategy provides a new paradigm for identifying and eliminating clinically metastatic lymph nodes.

         <title>Stereoselective Radical Acylfluoroalkylation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have realized the stereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of bicyclobutanes via radical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, which constitutes a practical method to assemble fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes. It is noteworthy that the covalent&#8208;based organocatalytic strategy achieved diastereoselective radical&#8208;radical cross coupling, with dispersion and electrostatic interactions playing a crucial role in stereoinduction.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes are prominent structural components in natural products and drug molecules. With the advent of strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven synthesis, ring&#8208;opening reactions of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) provide an attractive pathway to construct these three&#8208;dimensional structures. However, the stereoselective difunctionalization of the central C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bonds remains challenging. Reported herein is a covalent&#8208;based organocatalytic strategy that exploits radical NHC catalysis to achieve diastereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of BCBs under mild conditions. The Breslow enolate acts as a single electron donor and provides an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical with appropriate steric hindrance, which effectively distinguishes between the two faces of transient cyclobutyl radicals. This operationally simple method tolerates various fluoroalkyl reagents and common functional groups, providing a straightforward access to polysubstituted cyclobutanes (75 examples, up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.). The combined experimental and theoretical investigations of this organocatalytic system confirm the formation of the NHC&#8208;derived radical and provide an understanding of how stereoselective radical&#8208;radical coupling occurs.

     alt="Stereoselective Radical Acylfluoroalkylation of Bicyclobutanes via N-Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have realized the stereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of bicyclobutanes via radical N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, which constitutes a practical method to assemble fluoroalkyl-substituted cyclobutanes. It is noteworthy that the covalent-based organocatalytic strategy achieved diastereoselective radical-radical cross coupling, with dispersion and electrostatic interactions playing a crucial role in stereoinduction.

         <title>Mineralizing Biofilm towards Sustainable Conversion of Plastic Wastes to Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of inorganic materials with biological machinery to convert plastics into fuels offers a promising strategy to alleviate environmental pollution and energy crisis. Herein, we develop a type of hybrid living material via biomineralization of CdS onto Shewanella oneidensis&#8208;based biofilm, which is capable of sustainable hydrogen production from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) wastes under daylight. We reveal that the formed biofilm microstructure provides an independent anaerobic microenvironment that simultaneously supports cellular viability, maintains hydrogenase activity, and preserves the functional stability of CdS, giving rise to the efficient plastic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency as high as 3751 &#956;mol H2 g&#8208;1 PLA. Besides, by genetically engineering transmembrane pili conduit and incorporating conductive nanomaterials to strengthen the electron transfer across cellular interface and biofilm matrices, we show that the conversion efficiency is further enhanced to 5862 &#956;mol H2 g&#8208;1 PLA. Significantly, we exhibit that a long&#8208;term sustainable plastic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion of 63 d could be achieved by periodically replenishing PLA wastes. Overall, by the synergistic integration of biotic&#8208;abiotic characteristics the developed biofilm&#8208;based biomineralized hybrid living material is anticipated to provide a new platform toward the efficient conversion of plastic wastes into valuable fuels, and bridge the gap between environmental contamination and green energy production.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;rapid Synthesis of High&#8208;entropy MAX Phases and Their Derivative MXenes for Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized high&#8208;entropy MAX phases within 15 minutes, including a new phase (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2)4AlC3 and three 413&#8208;type phases. The varied stacking modes among MX slabs in high&#8208;entropy MAX phases and the distinct topological transformations to their derivative MXenes were observed. TiVNbMoC3 electrode demonstrates superior lithium&#8208;ion storage capabilities with 725&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, triggering the edification to the application of high&#8208;entropy MXenes for energy domain.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials hold immense promise for energy storage, owing to their varied compositions and unforeseen physicochemical properties, yet, which poses challenges in synthesis due to tendentious phase separation and extended sintering durations. Herein, an ultra&#8208;rapid strategy based on spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques is proposed to synthesize high&#8208;entropy MAX phases within 15&#8197;minutes, including a new phase of (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2)4AlC3 and several phases of 413&#8208;type TiVNbMoAlC3, TiVCrMoAlC3 and (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)4AlC3, achieving utmost purity level up to 99.54&#8201;%. Under high temperature, the overfeed of Al with low melt point (~660&#8201;&#176;C) can foster a liquid environment, which remits the immiscibility among starting materials and benefits to diffusion dynamics to some extents. Theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the thermodynamic preponderance of high&#8208;entropy MAX phases in the intricate multi&#8208;element systems. Meanwhile, the varied stacking modes among MX slabs in high&#8208;entropy MAX phases and the distinct topological transformations to their derivative MXenes can be observed directly at the atomic level. Moreover, four high&#8208;entropy MXenes as electrode materials were investigated for rechargeable batteries. Among them, TiVNbMoC3 electrode demonstrates superior lithium&#8208;ion storage capabilities with 725&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1, triggering the edification to the application of high&#8208;entropy MXenes for energy domain.

         <title>Hubbard Gap Closure&#8208;Induced Dual&#8208;Redox Li&#8208;Storage Mechanism as the Origin of Anomalously High Capacity and Fast Ion Diffusivity in MOFs&#8208;Like Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;redox Li&#8208;storage mechanism is first decoded as the origin of anomalously high capacity and fast diffusivity in MOFs&#8208;like POM electrode, where enhanced V&#8208;t2g orbital occupation, Hubbard gap closure and interlayer conjugated configuration essentially contribute to the high capacity, accelerated rate capability and superior cycle stability.







Abstract
MOFs&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POMs) electrodes, harvesting combined advantages of interlocking porosity and multi&#8208;electron transfer reaction, have already emerged as promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet the origins of the underlying redox mechanism in such materials remain a matter of uncertainty. Of critical challenges are the anomalously high storage capacities beyond their theoretical values and the fast ion diffusivity that cannot be satisfactorily comprehended in the theory of crystal lattice. Herein, for the first time we decode t2g electron occupation&#8208;regulated dual&#8208;redox Li&#8208;storage mechanism as the true origin of extra capacity in POMs electrodes. The lattice and electronic transition of active centers and reaction intermediates were systematically decoupled through density functional theory (DFT) and a suite of structural spectroscopic investigations, such as X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES), soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) and 7Li solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Enhanced V&#8208;t2g orbital occupation by Li coordination significantly triggers the Hubbard gap closure and reversible Li deposition/dissolution at surface region. Conjugated V&#8722;O&#8208;Li configuration at interlayers endow Li+ ion pathways along pore walls as the dominant contribution to the low migration barrier and fast diffusivity. As a result, remarkable cycle stability (~100&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), extremely high specific capacity (1200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and excellent rate performance (404&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) were achieved, providing new understandings on the underlying mechanism of POMs electrodes and pivotal guidance for dual&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Quinoline Substituted Anthracene Isomers: A Case Study for Simultaneously Optimizing High Mobility and Strong Luminescence in Herringbone&#8208;Packed Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;property relationship in high mobility emissive materials was revealed that a centroid distance of about 7&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8211;6.5&#8197;&#197; along &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction is beneficial for achieving high mobility and strong emission in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates simultaneously based on four quinoline&#8208;anthracene isomers. This relationship also demonstrates the broad applicability and universal potential in other organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is significant for advancing optoelectronic devices with simplified architecture and enhanced performance. The herringbone&#8208;packed structure is regarded as the ideal arrangement for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission in organic semiconductors. However, it remains a great challenge that the relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic property is still elusive. Herein, four quinoline&#8208;substituted anthracene isomers were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoline groups to anthracene core. Their intermolecular interactions and packing mode in the herringbone&#8208;packed structures were regularly tuning by subtle changing the nitrogen position on quinoline group, resulting in the superior integration of optoelectronic properties.

&lt;p&gt;The structure&#8211;property relationship in high mobility emissive materials was revealed that a centroid distance of about 7&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; along CH-&#960; direction and 6&#8211;6.5&#8197;&#197; along &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction is beneficial for achieving high mobility and strong emission in herringbone-packed aggregates simultaneously based on four quinoline-anthracene isomers. This relationship also demonstrates the broad applicability and universal potential in other organic semiconductors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is significant for advancing optoelectronic devices with simplified architecture and enhanced performance. The herringbone-packed structure is regarded as the ideal arrangement for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission in organic semiconductors. However, it remains a great challenge that the relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic property is still elusive. Herein, four quinoline-substituted anthracene isomers were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoline groups to anthracene core. Their intermolecular interactions and packing mode in the herringbone-packed structures were regularly tuning by subtle changing the nitrogen position on quinoline group, resulting in the superior integration of optoelectronic properties. Through a comprehensive analysis of aggregation states and optoelectronic properties, we revealed that in herringbone-packed aggregates, a centroid distance of approximately 7&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; along CH-&#960; direction and 6&#8211;6.5&#8197;&#197; along &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction is beneficial for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission. These properties are closely related to the molecular twist angles, which are influenced by intramolecular interactions. This structure&#8211;property relationship has been further validated in other herringbone-packed high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, demonstrating its broad applicability and universal potential. This work figures out the practical molecular design principle for high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Induced C&#8722;C Coupling for C2H4 Photosynthesis from Atmospheric&#8208;Concentration CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Loading highly active metal clusters on a semiconductor nanosheet can enable the introduced metal atom and the metal atom in substrate materials to construct the heteroatom pair sites. Having two different metal atoms on the interface as active sites may effectively accelerate C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4 for CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
Producing ethylene (C2H4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction under mild conditions is primarily restricted by the difficulty of C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we designed highly active metal atom clusters anchored on semiconductor nanosheets, which established heteroatom sites on the interface to steer C&#8722;C coupling, realizing air&#8208;concentration CO2 photoreduction into C2H4 in pure water. As an example, the Pd nanoclusters loaded on ZnO nanosheets are prepared, demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field image. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the C&#8722;C coupling step over the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets, while quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy illustrates the active sites of Pd and Zn atoms on the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets during CO2 photoreduction. Density functional theoretical calculations unveil the transition state energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling of CO* and COH* intermediates are only 0.998&#8197;eV, hinting the easy C&#8722;C coupling to produce C2 fuels. Therefore, the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets realize C2H4 photosynthesis by atmospheric&#8208;concentration CO2 reduction with the formation rate of 1.03&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, while the ZnO nanosheets only acquired the carbon monoxide product.

         <title>GlutaR: A High&#8208;Performance Fluorescent Protein&#8208;Based Sensor for Spatiotemporal Monitoring of Glutamine Dynamics In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visualization of the metabolism of glutamine in vivo: Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle. GlutaR, a genetically encoded fluorescence sensor of glutamine, displays excellent selectivity and sensitivity, which enable to report dynamic and precise changes of glutamine levels in cells, live mice, and quantification of free subcellular organelle glutamine concentrations with high spatiotemporal resolution.







Abstract
Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle, and is integral to a wide variety of functions in cancer cells. However, the inability to monitor the subcellular distribution of glutamine in real&#8208;time has obscured understanding of glutamine metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor and demonstrate how this GlnBP&#8208;cpYFP fusion &#8220;GlutaR sensor&#8221; undergoes glutamine&#8208;induced conformational changes reflected in detectable fluorescence responses. Obtained after iterative screening of approximately 1,600 variants, GlutaR exhibits a ratiometric readout, fast response kinetics, and high responsivity (R488/405 of ~1000&#8201;%), and we demonstrate its selectivity for monitoring glutamine fluctuations in multiple cell types. Additionally, using digitonin permeabilization of GlutaR HeLa cells, we generated a calibration curve and performed in situ titration to quantify free glutamine concentrations in subcellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria). Subsequently, we applied GlutaR to investigate how chemical and genetic inhibition of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutaminase (GLS) differentially alter glutamine levels in subcellular compartments. Finally, we demonstrate GlutaR's ability to monitor dynamic glutamine levels in muscle and liver tissues of diabetic mice in vivo. These findings collectively demonstrate GlutaR as a versatile tool for the spatiotemporal characterization of glutamine metabolism in living cells and tissues.

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Olefins on Anorthic NaCoFe Alloy Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active (FexCoy)5C2 structure is developed through the synergistic effect of electronic (sodium) and structural (cobalt) promoters. This strategy facilitates the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into olefins at a low temperature of 240&#8201;&#176;C, achieving the highest STY of olefins at low temperatures, even better than a significant proportion under high&#8208;temperature operating conditions. Additionally, it retains the capability to synthesize olefins at 180&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to olefins (CTO) represents an ideal pathway towards carbon neutrality. However, most current CTO catalysts require a high&#8208;temperature condition of 300&#8211;450&#8201;&#176;C, resulting in high energy consumption and possible aggregation among active sites. Herein, we developed an efficient iron&#8208;based catalyst modified with high&#8208;sodium content (7&#8201;%) and low&#8208;cobalt content (2&#8201;%), achieving a CO2 conversion of 22.0&#8201;% and an olefin selectivity of 55.9&#8201;% at 240&#8201;&#176;C and 1000&#8197;mL/g/h, and it is even active at 180&#8201;&#176;C and 4000&#8197;mL/g/h with more than 25&#8201;% olefins in hydrocarbons. The catalyst was kept stable under continuous operating conditions of 500&#8197;hours. Numerous characterizations and calculations reveal high content of sodium as an electronic promoter enhances the stability of the active anorthic Fe5C2 phase at low temperatures. Further incorporating the above catalyst with cobalt, as a structural promoter, causes Fe species to form a FexCoy alloying phase, which in turn facilitates the formation of higher active anorthic (FexCoy)5C2 phase, different from the conventional carbides and alloy carbides. An in&#8208;depth investigation of the synergistic effects of structural and electronic promoters can improve catalyst performance, increase reaction efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and provide profound insights for understanding and optimizing CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Simultaneous Fabrication of P and M Helices in One&#8208;Component Chiral System by Methanol&#8208;Water Mediated Dual Assembly Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system. The conformation of L&#8208;phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH3OH. Addition of H2O into above CH3OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self&#8208;assembly pathways, due to the synchronous process of 1)&#8197;self&#8208;assembly of folded LBpyF into M&#8208;helices and 2)&#8197;H2O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self&#8208;assembly of them into P&#8208;helices.







Abstract
The synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures stemmed from same building units is ubiquitous in nature and vital to living systems, but achieving it in artificial systems remains a challenge. Herein, we report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system.

&lt;p&gt;We report a methanol-water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one-component chiral system. The conformation of L-phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH. Addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into above CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self-assembly pathways, due to the synchronous process of 1)&#8197;self-assembly of folded LBpyF into M-helices and 2)&#8197;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self-assembly of them into P-helices.

&lt;p&gt;The synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures stemmed from same building units is ubiquitous in nature and vital to living systems, but achieving it in artificial systems remains a challenge. Herein, we report a methanol-water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one-component chiral system. The conformation of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH due to the hydrogen bonds as well as C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between LBpyF and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH.

         <title>An Expeditious Synthesis of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Imide&#8208;Based Graphene Nanoribbons and Their Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the bay region of polyperylene with mono and diimide functional groups has enabled the synthesis of robust graphene nanoribbons. These nanoribbons are solution&#8208;processable and show good NIR absorption and photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with low band gap and strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption are potential candidates for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. In this context, imide&#8208;based GNRs are promising, but there are no rational design principles that yield these robust GNRs with strong NIR absorption. Here, we demonstrate a rational synthesis route to achieve NIR&#8208;absorbing imide&#8208;based robust GNRs by exploring the bay region of polyperylene (PP). Using the oxidative Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, we have successfully introduced mono and diimide functional groups on PP. After cyclodehydrogenation, the resultant GNRs, benzoperylene imide GNR (BPI&#8208;GNR) and coronene diimide GNR (CDI&#8208;GNR), show oscillatory edge geometry with strong NIR absorption (up to 1000&#8197;nm) and optical band gap of ~1.3&#8197;eV. Computational studies also indicate that imide substituents play an important role in fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties of GNRs. Moreover, these GNRs are solution&#8208;processable and can be made into thin films via spray coating. Owing to the strong NIR absorption and imide substitutions, BPI and CDI&#8208;GNRs show good photothermal conversion with excellent cyclic stability.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Maleimide&#8208;Based Dual Functionalization of Protein N&#8208;Termini</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maleimides can target the N&#8208;termini of proteins instead of cysteine by the use of 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde and copper(II) salt under non&#8208;denaturing conditions. The methodology requires no mutagenesis of proteins and enables the high&#8208;yield attachment of various functional groups to proteins with various N&#8208;terminal amino acids through a simple operation using commercially available maleimides.







Abstract
Maleimide derivatives are privileged reagents for chemically modifying proteins through the Michael addition reaction with cysteine due to their selectivity, operational simplicity, and commercial availability. However, since accessible free cysteine is rarely found in natural proteins, it is highly desirable to find alternative targets to enable direct bioconjugation of proteins with maleimides. In this study, we have developed an operationally simple and straightforward method for the N&#8208;terminal modification of proteins without the need for mutagenesis via a copper(II)&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with maleimides and 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PCA) derivatives under non&#8208;denaturing conditions at pH&#8197;6 and 37&#8201;&#176;C in aqueous media. Our method utilizes commercially available maleimides to attach diverse functionalities to various N&#8208;terminal amino acids. We demonstrate the preparation of a ternary protein complex cross&#8208;linked at the N&#8208;termini and dually modified trastuzumab equipped with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a cytotoxic agent, and a Cy5 fluorophore (MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab). MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab retained human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) recognition activity and exerted cytotoxicity against HER2&#8208;positive cells. Furthermore, MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab allowed successful visualization of HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells in mouse tumors. This straightforward method will expand the accessibility of protein conjugates with well&#8208;defined structures in a wide range of research fields.

         <title>Multimode Luminescence Tailoring in PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 Organic&#8211;inorganic Hybrid Metal Halide via Rigid Benzene Ring Induced Local Lattice Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scheme. Schematic illustration of combining organic compunds PMA+ (C7H10N+) with the inorganic [NaCl6]&#8208;[InCl6] layer to form a novel and highly efficient luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide PMA4NaInCl8 (PNIC) with Sb3+ doping. The dual emission of PNIC:Sb3+ can be adjusted from cyan to yellow by multimode regulation of temperature and excitation energy.







Abstract
Low dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halide materials have attracted extensive attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties. However, low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) caused by parity&#8208;forbidden transition hinder their further application in optoelectronic devices. Herein, a novel yellow&#8208;emitting PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 (C7H10N+, PMA+) low&#8208;dimensional OIMHs single crystal with a PLQY as high as 88&#8201;% was successfully designed and synthesized, originating from the fact that the doping of Sb3+ effectively relaxes the parity&#8208;forbidden transition by strong spin&#8208;orbit (SO) coupling and Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) interaction. The as&#8208;prepared crystal shows an efficient dual emission peaking 495 and 560&#8197;nm at low temperature, which are ascribed to different levels of 3P1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Sb3+ in [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedral caused by JT deformation. Moreover, wide&#8208;range luminescence tailoring from cyan to orange can be achieved through adjusting excitation energy and temperature because of flexible [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedral in the PNIC lattice. Based on a relative stiff lattice environment, the 560&#8197;nm yellow emission under 350&#8197;nm light excitation exhibits abnormal anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 8 to 400&#8197;K owing to the suppression of non&#8208;radiative transition. The multimode luminescence regulation enriches PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 great potential in the field of optoelectronics such as temperature sensing, low temperature anti&#8208;counterfeiting and WLED applications.

         <title>Meso/Microporous Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Featuring Curved Fe&#8722;N4 Sites Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ZnO&#8208;assisted ZIF derivation approach is developed to synthesize an atomically dispersed meso/microporous Fe&#8722;N/C catalyst with curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites onto the tubular carbon walls, showing excellent oxygen reduction performance in both acidic and alkaline media. When used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn&#8208;air batteries, it demonstrates outstanding cell/battery performance.







Abstract
Zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are among the most efficient precursors for the synthesis of atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N/C materials, which are promising catalysts for enhancing the performance of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) and proton exchange fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, existing ZIF&#8208;derived Fe&#8722;N/C electrocatalysts mostly consist of microporous materials, leading to insufficient mass transport and inadequate battery/cell performance. In this study, we synthesize an atomically dispersed meso/microporous Fe&#8722;N/C material with curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites, denoted as FeSA&#8722;N/TC, through the pyrolysis of hemin&#8208;modified ZIF films on ZnO nanorods, obtained from the self&#8208;assembly reaction between Zn2+ from ZnO hydrolysis and 2&#8208;methylimidazole.

     alt="Meso/Microporous Single-Atom Catalysts Featuring Curved Fe&#8722;N4 Sites Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel ZnO-assisted ZIF derivation approach is developed to synthesize an atomically dispersed meso/microporous Fe&#8722;N/C catalyst with curved Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active sites onto the tubular carbon walls, showing excellent oxygen reduction performance in both acidic and alkaline media. When used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn-air batteries, it demonstrates outstanding cell/battery performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are among the most efficient precursors for the synthesis of atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N/C materials, which are promising catalysts for enhancing the performance of Zn-air batteries (ZABs) and proton exchange fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, existing ZIF-derived Fe&#8722;N/C electrocatalysts mostly consist of microporous materials, leading to insufficient mass transport and inadequate battery/cell performance. In this study, we synthesize an atomically dispersed meso/microporous Fe&#8722;N/C material with curved Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active sites, denoted as FeSA&#8722;N/TC, through the pyrolysis of hemin-modified ZIF films on ZnO nanorods, obtained from the self-assembly reaction between Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from ZnO hydrolysis and 2-methylimidazole. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the curved Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active sites can weaken the intermediate adsorptions, resulting in lower free energy barriers and enhanced performance during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, FeSA&#8722;N/TC exhibits exceptional ORR performance with half-wave potentials of 0.925&#8197;V in alkaline media and 0.825&#8197;V in acidic media. When used as the cathodic catalyst in PEMFCs and ZABs, FeSA&#8722;N/TC achieves high peak power densities (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PEMFC: 1100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Air PEMFC: 715&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;; liquid-state ZAB: 228&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;; solid-state ZAB: 112&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling Surface Reconstruction as the Primary Trigger for Capacity Loss in Ultra&#8208;High Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanical failures, such as cracks and nanopores,  along with the associated surface reconstruction, have long been regarded as the primary causes of capacity decay in ultra&#8208;high Ni layered oxides. However, the impact of these failures on performance degradation has not yet been effectively elucidate and distinguished. Herein, we develop ultra&#8208;high Ni cathodes with tailored morphological structures by incorporating B and Mo to optimize lithiation kinetics, which can suppress lattice strain, particle cracking, and surface reconstruction during charging/discharging. And the role of chemo&#8208;mechanical failures in capacity loss is systematically investigated. Surprisingly, contrary to the traditional view, structural and electrochemical characterizations of the cycled cathodes demonstrate that intragranular cracks, intergranular cracks, and nanopores are not the primary contributing factors of capacity loss. Instead, surface reconstruction triggers rapid capacity decay. Notably, compared to nanopores, intragranular cracks expose a significantly larger quantity of active substances, thereby promoting interfacial side reactions and accelerating surface structural reconstruction during cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer in Hybrid Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Enables Boosted Interface Stability and Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex interactions between the inorganic solid electrolyte (ISE) and the liquid electrolyte (LE) give rise to challenges of achieving durable interface stability in hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (HQSE), and the influence on the involved ISE surface ionic conductivity also needs to be investigated. Here, 4&#8208;chlorobenzenesulfonic acid (CBSA) is utilized to establish a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the surface of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12&#160;(LLZTO), which is then incorporated into PEGDA&#8208;based in&#8208;situ polymerized HQSE. The results show that the introduction of CBSA significantly improves the LLZTO/LE interface stability with the optimized solvation structure, resulting in a favorable ionic conductivity (1.19 mS cm&#8208;1) and an increasing Li+ transference number (0.647). Mechanisms for the promotion of ionic conduction and interfacial stability of SAM&#8208;HQSE are unveiled through the density functional theory (DFT) combined with Raman spectra and 7Li solid&#8208;state nuclear&#8208;magnetic&#8208;resonance. There are no short&#8208;circuits in the Li|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Li cells after 1000 h. The Li|SAM&#8208;HQSE|LFP cells or Graphite|SAM&#8208;HQSE|LFP pouch cells respectively achieve the capacity retention of 91.2% and 87.0% with the 0.5.C&#8208;rate for 500 and 300 cycles. This facile and effective strategy proposed in this work make it accessible for constructing the stable surface micro&#8208;environments of LLZTO where boost and homogenize the Li+ conduction in a hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte system.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Delocalized Ni Active Sites in Spinel Catalysts Enable Efficient Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has attracted much attention as an efficient alternative reaction to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its low required overpotential. Despite significant progress in efficient nickel&#8208;based catalysts, the fundamental issues regarding product selectivity control and dissociation mechanism during the UOR process have not been clarified. Here, we report that tuning the electron delocalization strength of Ni sites significantly affects the OH&#8208; binding sites, altering urea molecule dissociation patterns in alkaline systems. Using spinel NiCo2O4 as a model catalyst, the charge delocalization strength of nickel active centers is influenced by the degree of phosphorus&#8208;substituted anions. Specifically, complete phosphorus&#8208;substituted spinel enhances N2 selectivity to over 26.8% with a peak current density of 300 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2, while partial phosphorus&#8208;substituted spinel achieves a Faraday efficiency of 78.1% for liquid products (NOx&#8208;). Experiments and theory reveal that strong charge delocalization at Ni sites favors remote&#8208;site attack on urea molecules by hydroxide ions, whereas weak delocalization prefers nearby&#8208;site attack, enhancing UOR efficiency and suppressing OER in both pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Intratumoral Transforming Boron Nanosensitizers for Amplified Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an advanced binary tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;selected heavy&#8208;particle radiotherapy used for treating invasive malignant tumors. However, its clinical applications have been impeded by the rapid metabolism and insufficient tumor&#8208;specific accumulation of boron agents. To tackle this issue, we develop a smart boron nanosensitizer (BATBN) capable of transforming its size in response to cancer biomarker for optimal balance between penetration and retention of boron&#8208;10 for BNCT. BATBN comprises an ultrasmall boron quantum dots (BQD) core (4 nm) conjugated with cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, which facilitates its cellular uptake and deep tumor penetration. In the tumor microenvironment, the tumor biomarker can specifically initiate a self&#8208;condensation reaction of BATBN, leading to the formation of larger&#8208;sized nanoaggregates. Due to such a specific intratumoral transformation, BATBN demonstrate a 2.4&#8208;fold increase in intratumoral boron concentration and a 5.0&#8208;fold increase in tumor retention time compared to the BQDs. Thus, the relative tumor volume of the BATBN&#8208;treatment group is 2.7&#8208;fold smaller than that of BQDs in preclinical tumor models after 21 days of neutron irradiation treatment. This study presents a supramolecular strategy to endow BNCT agents with the biomarker&#8208;activated size interconversion, permitting precise and efficient BNCT for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiroptical Response of Carbon Nanocages Enhanced by Achiral Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Opening up [60]fullerene makes itself inherently chiral without loss of congenital &#960;&#8208;conjugation. An immoderately large aperture on [60]fullerene, however, renders the molecule less rigid and therefore it would reduce dissymmetry factors. Herein, we examined supramolecular technique in geometrical reinforcement of chiral open&#8208;[60]fullerenes by encasing achiral guests such as Ar,&#8208;CO2, and CH3CN. At a lowest&#8208;energy transition, we confirmed a guest&#8208;dependency on chiroptical responses with increasing a dissymmetry factor by nearly twice to three times. It should be noted that the guests play a negligible role in electronic structures of the carbon cages. Instead, they are engaged in preclusion of an orifice shrinking not to reduce chiroptical response.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of Interpenetration&#8208;Free Mesoporous Aromatic Frameworks by Manipulating Catalysts as Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reticular chemistry allows the design and synthesis of mesoporous networks by extending the size of the building blocks. However, interpenetration of the nets easily happens against the designed mesoporous networks, thereby falling short of achieving the intended specific surface area and pore size. Controlling the framework interpenetration has always been a challenge in the synthesis section of reticular chemistry. In this work, based on our previously reported type of highly porous aromatic frameworks (named PAF&#8208;1), we extended the tetrahedral building blocks to target an iso&#8208;reticular mesoporous PAF&#8208;333. A series of Ni(0) ligands with different sizes were employed to confirm that suitable&#8208;sized catalyst ligands could successfully inhibit skeleton interpenetration in the coupling reaction through the steric hindrance effect. The obtained mesoporous PAF&#8208;333 possessed a pore size of approximately 3.2 nm matching well with the value from the predicted non&#8208;interpenetrated structure. PAF&#8208;333 showed great high&#8208;pressure hydrogen and methane storage potential with a 13.4 wt% H2 uptake at 77 K, 100 bar and a 0.537 g g&#8208;1 CH4 uptake at 298 K, 98 bar, ranking at the top of the reported porous adsorbents in the gas storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence with Bis&#8208;pyclen Yb(III) Chelates: Crown vs. Linear Polyether Linkers in Discrete Heteropolynuclear Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligands combining 2 lateral bis&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;phosphonated&#8208;pyclens were synthesized, using a linear pegylated linker L2 or a K22 crown&#8208;ether L3. A functionalized pyridyl&#8208;phosphonated&#8208;pyclen L1 was also prepared as a mononuclear analogue. Coordination behavior of lanthanide cations was studied via NMR titration with Lu for L1, UV&#8208;Vis and luminescence spectroscopy with Yb for L2/L3. Strong coordination of two Yb atoms enabled isolation and spectroscopic characterization of dinuclear complexes in H2O and D2O. Excited state lifetime at 980nm revealed strong protection of Yb cations, with no coordinated water. Upon titration of the isolated dinuclear Yb complexes with Tb cations cooperative upconversion (UC) sensitization of Tb in the visible was observed (excitation of Yb, 980nm, D2O). In absence of Tb, the Yb complexes also exhibited cooperative luminescence with a weak emission band around 500nm upon NIR Yb excitation. UC with Tb was only observed after thermal treatment, suggesting a slow kinetic of formation of the UC species. [Yb2TbL3] showed weak Tb centered UC emission, while the dinuclear complex of L2 displayed more intense UC emission up to two equivalents of Tb, forming [(Yb2L2)Tbx] (x=1&#8208;2), with the tetranuclear heterometallic complex being the most intense emitter. Log&#8208;Log plot analysis confirmed the 2&#8208;photon nature of the UC process.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymeric carbon nitride edged with spatially isolated Donor and Acceptor for Sunlight&#8208;driven H2O2 Synthesis and In&#8208;situ Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;site H2O2 activation attracts much attention in energy conversion and environment remediation et al, yet remains challenging in its highly efficient and sustainable synthesis. Herein, we grafted a pair of spatially isolated donor (methoxyphenyl unit) and acceptor (anthraquinone unit) in polymeric carbon nitride edges, which induce directional electron&#8208;hole transfer to the two spatially separated dual active centers. Specifically, photogenerated electrons in the anthraquinone unit facilitate the 2e&#8208; ORR, while the methoxyphenyl unit, which gathers photogenerated holes, enables rapid 4e&#8208; WOR. More impressively, the anthraquinone unit also exhibits strong proton extraction capabilities to boost the generation of *OOH intermediates and H2O2. Consequently, the reported donor&#8208;plyometric carbon nitrite&#8208;acceptor (DPA) polymer shows a remarkable H2O2 yield of 6497.1 &#956;M h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 in pure water, surpassing traditional DP and PA catalysts. Because of its high efficiency, the H2O2 product can efficiently degrade and mineralize various organic contaminants in a continuous&#8208;flow self&#8208;Fenton reactor under sunlight irradiation. Our work presents an unprecedented approach to designing photocatalysts with efficient H2O2 synthesis and practical application from a molecular engineering perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>A Kinetic Scout Approach Accelerates Targeted Protein Degrader Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional molecules such as targeted protein degraders induce proximity to promote gain&#8208;of&#8208;function pharmacology. These powerful approaches have gained broad traction across academia and the pharmaceutical industry, leading to an intensive focus on strategies that can accelerate their identification and optimization. We and others have previously used chemical proteomics to map degradable target space, and these datasets have been used to develop and train multiparameter models to extend degradability predictions across the proteome. In this study, we now turn our attention to develop generalizable chemistry strategies to accelerate the development of new bifunctional degraders. We implement lysine&#8208;targeted reversible&#8208;covalent chemistry to rationally tune the binding kinetics at the protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest across a set of 25 targets. We define an unbiased workflow consisting of global proteomics analysis, IP/MS of ternary complexes and the E&#8208;STUB assay, to mechanistically characterize the effects of ligand residence time on targeted protein degradation and formulate hypotheses about the rate&#8208;limiting step of degradation for each target. Our key finding is that target residence time is a major determinant of degrader activity, and this can be rapidly and rationally tuned through the synthesis of a minimal number of analogues to accelerate early degrader discovery and optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsymmetric Protonation Driven Highly Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis in Supramolecular Photocatalysts via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. However, its performance is often hindered by low selectivity and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report an anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+, featuring an unsymmetric protonation structure for H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air.&#160;The introduction of unsymmetric protonation disrupts the initial mirror symmetry of SADF, significantly enhancing the molecular dipole and facilitating efficient charge separation and electron transfer. Additionally, this modification increases the hydrophilicity of SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+, enabling the interaction of water and dissolved oxygen with the catalytic sites. The altered electron density distribution creates numerous dual active sites for Yeager&#8208;type O2 adsorption, facilitating an efficient ORR towards H2O2 via a direct one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ achieves an outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production at a rate of 4667 &#956;mol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, with a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) of 1.35%, surpassing most organic photocatalytic systems. Furthermore, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic antibacterial activity, achieving 100% antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus within 60 min.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Electric Fields on Oxidization Processes at the Air&#8208;Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the air&#8208;water interface, many reactions are accelerated, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. This phenomenon has proved to be particularly important in water microdroplets, where the spontaneous oxidation of many species stable in bulk has been experimentally demonstrated. Different theories have been proposed to explain this finding, but it is currently believed that the role of interfacial electric fields is key. In this work, we have carried out a quantum chemistry study aimed at shedding some light on this question. We have studied two prototypical processes in which a hydroxide anion transfers its excess electron to either the water environment or a dioxygen molecule. To model the interface, we use a cluster of 21 water molecules immersed in an electric field, and we examine the energetics of the studied reactions as a function of field magnitude. Our results reveal that electric fields close to those estimated for the neat air&#8208;water interface (~0.15 V&#215;&#197;&#8208;1) have a moderate effect on the reaction energetics and that much stronger fields (&gt;1 V&#215;&#197;&#8208;1) are required to get spontaneous electron transfer. Therefore, the study suggests that additional factors such as an excess charge in microdroplets need to be considered for explaining the experimental observations.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Carboxylation of Benzylic Tertiary C&#8208;H Bonds with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct catalytic carboxylation of benzylic tertiary C&#8208;H bonds with CO2 for the synthesis of all&#8208;carbon quaternary carboxylic acids represents a significant challenge. Here, we present a redox&#8208;neutral approach to address this difficulty by leveraging the synergistic interplay between photocatalysis and cascade hydrogen abstraction cycles. Remarkably, this strategy eliminates the need for sacrificial electron donors, electron acceptors, or stoichiometric additives, offering enhanced atom economy and environmental sustainability. It is particular that the combination of &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals with sulfur radicals generated in situ from the decomposition of DMSO was employed to realize the abstraction of benzylic tertiary C&#8208;H bonds. Our method enables the direct synthesis of a diverse array of benzylic quaternary carboxylic acids with excellent functional group tolerance as well as the derivatization of bioactive molecules and the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of pharmaceuticals under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated [4+2] Annulation of Silylimines with Olefins to 1&#8208;Aminotetralins Enabled by Diradical Hydrogen Atom Transfer of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile photochemical, one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly functionalized 1&#8208;aminotetralins derivatives (&gt; 70 examples) from readily accessible o&#8208;alkyl and o&#8208;formyl aryl silylimines with olefins is described. A diradical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) of primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkyl arylsilylimines and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;formyl arylsilylimines enabled a [4+2] annulation with olefins in excellent diastereoselectivity. This was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955; = 420 nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10 mol%) as the sensitizer via energy transfer. Moreover, sulfur&#8208;substituted o&#8208;alkyl silylimines can undergo such photochemical process in the absence of an external photosensitizer. This effective protocol is compatible with a variety of functional groups and can be applied to the modification of bioactive molecules. Based on mechanistic evidences and computational studies, it is suggested that the silyl substituent enables an efficient energy transfer leading to the formation of a key C,N&#8208;diradical and subsequent [4+2]&#8208;cyclization was supported by a better molecular orbital matching between the HSOMO of the 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediate and the LUMO of the olefins. Thus, upon irradiation, the excited silylimine unlocks a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen DHAT and subsequent [4+2] cyclization that allows the divergent functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kalmanol (1) is the first isolated kalmane&#8208;type grayanoid featuring a highly oxidized 5/8/5/5 tetracyclic carbon skeleton and 9 contiguous stereocenters. We have accomplished the efficient and asymmetric total synthesis of 1 in 16 steps from known compounds (20 steps from commercially available starting materials) by a modular synthetic strategy. A tetracyclic intermediate was prepared in a convergent manner through a Grignard reaction and a subsequent ring&#8208;closing metathesis reaction of two enantiomerically enriched fragments. The polyhydroxyl groups were introduced by late&#8208;stage stereo&#8208; and regioselective oxidations.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Aggregate Electrochemistry for High&#8208;Performance Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecule in solutions is the energy storage unit in the organic redox flow batteries (ORFBs), of which the aggregation is acknowledged pivotal but has been rarely investigated. By establishing a pyridinium library, the manipulation over the aggregation in solutions is investigated at the molecular level. Both theoretical calculations and physiochemical methods are used to characterize the aggregate&#8217;s structure, and salient findings are as follows. First, the singly&#8208;reduced monoradicals simultaneously aggregate in a concentrated solution, which is driven by the solvation effect, orbital overlap and dispersion interaction. Second, the aggregation can be manipulated by the molecular engineering strategy and counteracted by introducing either electrostatic repulsive force or twisted geometry. Third, the monoradical&#8217;s aggregation yields a decrease in the molecular singly occupied molecular orbital energy level and a linear scaling relationship with its thermodynamic potential. As a result, the increase in the concentration lowers the battery&#8217;s voltage, which counteracts its effort to increase the battery&#8217;s energy density. The anti&#8208;aggregation is proven effective in breaking the scaling relationship and accordingly, a molecular strategy to manipulate aggregate electrochemistry is developed. This work provides physical insights into the electrolytic solution and chemical strategy for optimizing the flow battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxotungstate Featuring Zinc&#8208;Ion&#8208;Triggered Structural Transformation as An Efficient Electrolyte Additive for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is promising but still challenging for the widespread application of aqueous zinc batteries due to the poor reversibility of the Zn anode caused by prevalent dendrite growth and pronounced interfacial s  ide reactions. Herein, we report  a rare soluble and water&#8208;stable high&#8208;nuclearity {Nd9Si4W39} polyoxotungstate. Interestingly, upon encountering Zn2+ ions, the discrete {Nd9Si4W39} nanocluster undergoes a structural transformation to form an infinitely extended cluster&#8208;based {[Zn(H2O)4]3[Nd9Si4W39]2} two&#8208;dimensional honeycomb layer, with which atomic&#8208;level Zn2+ ion effects in reconstructing the layer are determined. More interestingly, we demonstrate that the structural transformation property renders the {Nd9Si4W39} cluster an efficient electrolyte additive for aqueous zinc batteries, enabling the formation of the 2D layer as a protective layer on the zinc anode, significantly enhancing the reversibility of the zinc anode. Compared to the pristine Zn//Zn symmetric battery, the Zn//Zn symmetric battery with the {Nd9Si4W39} additive exhibits an extended lifespan of over 2000 hours at a current density of 1 mA cm&#8208;2. In&#8208;situ optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the formation of the protective layer effectively promotes uniform zinc deposition, and inhibits zinc agglomeration, dendrite growth, and side reactions, thereby enabling the zinc anode to exhibit high reversibility and long&#8208;term service life.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiosulfate&#8208;Mediated Polysulfide Redox for Energetic Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;based aqueous batteries (SABs) are regarded as promising candidates for safe, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;energy storage. However, the sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfides pose a significant challenge to the practical performance of SABs. Herein, we report a unique redox regulation strategy that leverages thiosulfate&#8208;mediated ligand&#8208;chain interaction to accelerate the polysulfide redox process (S0/S2&#8722;). The S2O32&#8722; species in the electrolyte can induce the rapid reduction of polysulfide through a spontaneous chemical reaction with sulfur species, while facilitating the reversible oxidation of short&#8208;chain sulfides. Moreover, the thiosulfate redox pair (S2O32&#8722;/S4O62&#8722;) within the K2S2O3&#160;electrolyte contributes additional capacity at higher potential (E0 &gt; 0 V vs SHE). Consequently, the elaborate SAB delivers an unprecedented K+ storage capacity of 2470 mAh gs&#8722;1, coupled with a long cycling life exceeding 1000 cycles. Remarkably, thiosulfate&#8208;mediated SAB achieves an energy density of 616 Wh kgS+Zn&#8722;1, surpassing both organic K&#8722;S batteries and conventional aqueous battery systems. This work elucidates the mechanism underlying the thiosulfate&#8208;mediated polysulfide redox process, thereby opening a pathway for the development of high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

Deoxyconidiogenol with a 6/5/5/5&#8208;fused tetracyclic cyclopiane skeleton was first produced by an engineered E. coli host harboring the corresponding terpene cyclase PchDS. Ten cyclopiane diterpenes were synthesized by late&#8208;stage functionalization of rings A, B and D of the cyclopiane skeleton through direct redox operations, directed C&#8208;H activation, and enzymatic hydroxylation, respectively. Skeletal diversification was achieved by taking advantage of the selective 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration of a cyclopiane cation generated chemically or enzymatically. Three cyclopiane&#8208;related skeletons, including the spiro 5/5/5/5&#8208;tetracyclic skeleton of spiroviolene, the angular 5/6/5/5&#8208;fused ring system of phomopsene, and the new linear 5/6/5/5&#8208;fused tetracyclic ring system of amycolatene, were produced either by chemical skeletal transformation from the cyclopiane skeleton, or by terpene cyclases discovered by genome mining.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for&#160;Boosting&#160;H2O2 Photosynthesis via the Synergy of Multiple Charge Transfer Channels and Polarized Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) serve as one of the most promising candidates for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, while attaining high&#8208;performance COFs remains a formidable challenge due to the insufficient separation of photogenerated charges. Here, through the rational design of bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs (Cz&#8208;COFs), we showcase the first achievement in piezo&#8208;photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 using COFs. Noteworthily, the ethenyl group&#8208;modified Cz&#8208;COFs (COF&#8208;DH&#8208;Eth) demonstrates&#160;a record&#8208;high yield of H2O2 (9212 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) from air and pure water through piezo&#8208;photocatalysis, which is ca. 2.5 times higher than that of pristine Cz&#8208;COFs without ethenyl groups (COF&#8208;DH&#8208;H) under identical condition and COF&#8208;DH&#8208;Eth without ultrasonic treatment. The H2O2 production rate originates from the synergistic effect between an ultrasonication&#8208;induced polarized electric field and the spatially separated multiple charge transfer channels, which significantly promote the utilization of photogenerated electrons by directional transfer from bicarbazole groups to the ethenyl group&#8208;modified benzene rings. Several Cz&#8208;COFs and bifluorenylidene&#8208;based COFs (COF&#8208;BFTB&#8208;H) with similar twisted monomers exhibit obvious piezoelectric performance for promoting H2O2 generation, signifying that organic ligands with a twistable structure play a crucial role in creating broken symmetry structures, thereby establishing piezoelectric properties in COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Autocatalytic Reactions Networks: A Pathway to Spatial Temporal Mastery in Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autocatalytic reactions present a significant opportunity for the precise spatial and temporal control of dynamic materials, mimicking the characteristics of living matter within autonomous chemical systems. Herein, we have crafted an autocatalytic chemical reaction network (CRN) designed to be incorporated into a dynamic system, allowing for efficient control of both sol(I)&#8208;gel and gel&#8208;sol(II) transitions through autocatalytic fronts. The CRN incorporates two autocatalytic reactions. The first reaction promotes the formation of disulfide crosslinks while increasing the local pH through base product generation, catalyzing further disulfide bond formation and initiating a polymerization front that transforms the liquid phase into a gel. A subsequent, slower reaction triggered at the gel/air interface, resulted in the reduction of disulfide crosslinks, transforming the gel back into a liquid state through accelerating fronts. The dynamics of these autocatalytic fronts are accurately predicted by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, providing a theoretical framework for system preprogramming. Moreover, our results show that the reversible sol&#8208;gel transition can be reliably repeated multiple times. This approach not only enhances our understanding of autocatalytic CRNs but also pioneers a new approach for developing dynamic materials with life&#8208;like properties, significantly impacting material science and bioengineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Batrachopolyenes: Volatile Norsteroids from Femoral Scent Glands of Frogs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Steroid hormones are C18&#8208;C21&#8208;sterane derivatives, featuring the typical 6&#8208;6&#8208;6&#8208;5 ring system. Here we report on a novel C18&#8208;steroid ring system named batrachane with a contracted A&#8208;ring resulting in a 5&#8208;6&#8208;6&#8208;5 ring arrangement. The isolation, structural elucidation, and total synthesis of three members of the novel batrachopolyene family occurring in the tropical frog genus Odontobatrachus is reported. The batrachopolyenes represent an entirely new collection of volatile steroidal natural products produced by anuran amphibians. Alongside the contracted A&#8208;ring, each member contains a &#916;16&#8208;17 double bond but differs in the central belt of the steroidal structure. To create these atypical structural features, syntheses featuring a combination of Breslow radical chain relay chlorination, Favorskii ring contraction, and Clemmensen reduction proved successful. The occurrence of such compounds in another distal anuran group, the Mantellinae, suggests a more widespread distribution of the batrachane&#8208;type compounds among frogs. The new structural steroid type raises questions concerning steroid biosynthesis and reception, as well as distribution in frogs in general and the structures of their hormones.</dc:description>

         <title>Precision Activity&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Amylase Probes for Dissection and Annotation of Linear and Branched&#8208;Chain Starch&#8208;Degrading Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Amylases are the workhorse enzymes of starch degradation. They are central to human health, including as targets for anti&#8208;diabetic compounds, but are also the key enzymes in the industrial processing of starch for biofuels, corn syrups, brewing and detergents. Dissection of the activity, specificity and stability of &#945;&#8208;amylases is crucial to understanding their biology and allowing their exploitation. Yet, functional characterization lags behind DNA sequencing and genomics; and new tools are required for rapid analysis of &#945;&#8208;amylase function. Here, we design, synthesize and apply new branched &#945;&#8208;amylase activity&#8208;based probes. Using both &#945;&#8208;1,6 branched and unbranched &#945;&#8208;1,4 maltobiose activity&#8208;based probes we were able to explore the stability and substrate specificity of both a panel of human gut microbial &#945;&#8208;amylases and a panel of industrially relevant &#945;&#8208;amylases. We also demonstrate how we can detect and annotate the substrate specificity of &#945;&#8208;amylases in the complex cell lysate of both a prominent gut microbe and a diverse compost sample by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and mass spectrometry. A toolbox of starch&#8208;active activity&#8208;based probes will enable rapid functional dissection of &#945;&#8208;amylases. We envisage activity&#8208;based probes contributing to better selection and engineering of enzymes for industrial application as well as fundamental analysis of enzymes in human health.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Trapdoor in HEU Zeolite Enables Inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adsorptive separation of molecules with very similar physical properties is always a challenging task. Reported herein is the design and tailoring of zeolite adsorbent for the precise discrimination and separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 mixture through the pronounced trapdoor effect. Typically, Sr exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite, namely Sr/K&#8208;HEU, is developed as a robust zeolite adsorbent for inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, showing the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dynamic CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 48.0 and sustainable CO2 dynamic uptake of 0.96 mmol/g at the same time. The perfect recyclability and the intrinsic low&#8208;cost nature of S/Kr&#8208;HEU make it a promising candidate for practical applications. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction determines the precise structure of Sr/K&#8208;HEU and density functional theory calculations reveal the intricate interplay between guest molecules and the gate&#8208;keeping extraframework cations. Briefly, extraframework Sr2+ cations from the ten&#8208;membered rings of HEU zeolites act as the molecular trapdoor, allowing the entry of CO2 molecules while excluding C2H2. This work presents a new example of molecular trapdoor in zeolite and its successful application in the challenging inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, which not only expands the scope of molecular trapdoor concept but also improves current understanding on the nature of molecular trapdoor.</dc:description>

Typically, Sr exchanged K-type clinoptilolite, namely Sr/K-HEU, is developed as a robust zeolite adsorbent for inverse CO2-C2H2 separation, showing the-state-of-the-art dynamic CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 48.0 and sustainable CO2 dynamic uptake of 0.96 mmol/g at the same time. The perfect recyclability and the intrinsic low-cost nature of S/Kr-HEU make it a promising candidate for practical applications. Three-dimensional electron diffraction determines the precise structure of Sr/K-HEU and density functional theory calculations reveal the intricate interplay between guest molecules and the gate-keeping extraframework cations. Briefly, extraframework Sr2+ cations from the ten-membered rings of HEU zeolites act as the molecular trapdoor, allowing the entry of CO2 molecules while excluding C2H2. This work presents a new example of molecular trapdoor in zeolite and its successful application in the challenging inverse CO2-C2H2 separation, which not only expands the scope of molecular trapdoor concept but also improves current understanding on the nature of molecular trapdoor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>General and Fast Gas&#8211;Solid Synthesis of Functional MXenes and Derivatives on the Scale of Tens of Grams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rising of MXenes not only enriches the two&#8208;dimensional material family but also brings more opportunities for diverse functional applications. However, the controllable synthesis of MXenes is still unsatisfied via the common liquid&#8208;solid etching route, considering the unsolved problems like safety risk, time cost and easy oxidation. Herein, a facile yet efficient gas&#8208;solid (G&#8208;S) reaction methodology is devised by using hydrogen fluoride gas derived from fluorinated organics as the MAX etchant toward high&#8208;efficiency fabrication of multiple MXenes and their derivatives. The innovative G&#8208;S reaction strategy exhibits superb versatility to achieve different gram&#8208;level MXenes (V2C, Ti3C2, Nb2C, Ti2N, Ti3CN, (Mo2/3Y1/3)2C) in a very short time, and even realizes in&#8208;situ heteroatom doping or synchronous phase conversion of MXenes directly from MAX phases. The obtained MXenes and their derivatives exhibit excellent structure stability and high electron/ion conductivity, making them promising materials for electrochemical applications. In particular, the N&#8208;doped V2C MXene shows superior adsorption and catalytic activity toward lithium polysulfides for advanced lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;sensing Analogue Nanopore for Rapid Detection of Protein&#8208;Related Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanopores offer significant advantages in biosensing. Conventional nanopore sensors require probe modification within the pore, and there are two major obstacles: inhomogeneity of probe modification within the pore, and distortion of the detection signal due to the uncontrollable dynamics of the target within the pore. Here, we constructed a cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore), by coating the outer surface of the nanopore with cell membrane. The inhomogeneity of probe modification and the uncontrollable kinetics of target&#8208;probe binding were also addressed. Specific cells are selected to prepare CeSa&#8208;nanopore, for example, cells with high expression of angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are used to achieve the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. When SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 binds to CeSa&#8208;nanopore the surface potential changes, causing a change in the ionic current, thus enabling its detection with a detection rate of 100%. In addition, the detection of different proteins, such as follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone (FSH), can be achieved by changing the cell membrane coating. The identification of cancer cells in ascites can also be achieved by utilizing homologous targeting between cancer cells. Importantly, the use of CeSa&#8208;nanopores for the detection of these targets eliminates the need for pre&#8208;processing and significantly reduces detection time.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Deep Learning Search for Exceptional Chiroptical Properties? The Halogenated [6]Helicene Case</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have focused on one of the most important chiral motifs, [6]helicene, and we have predicted the effect of halogenation on its chiroptical properties using Deep Learning. We have developed three machine learning models, which allow us to evaluate millions of compounds and learn the reasons that favor some substitutions. With the knowledge gained, we synthesized the most favored candidates, exhibiting the predicted properties.







Abstract
The relationship between chemical structure and chiroptical properties is not always clearly understood. Nowadays, efforts to develop new systems with enhanced optical properties follow the trial&#8208;error method. A large number of data would allow us to obtain more robust conclusions and guide research toward molecules with practical applications. In this sense, in this work we predict the chiroptical properties of millions of halogenated [6]helicenes in terms of the rotatory strength (R). We have used DFT calculations to randomly create derivatives including from 1 to 16 halogen atoms, that were then used as a data set to train different deep neural network models. These models allow us to i) predict the Rmax for any halogenated [6]helicene with a very low computational cost, and ii) to understand the physical reasons that favour some substitutions over others. Finally, we synthesized derivatives with higher predicted Rmax obtaining excellent correlation among the values obtained experimentally and the predicted ones.

         <title>Surface Reaction Induced Compressive Strain for Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reaction strategy is applied to regulate compressive strain at CsPbI3 surface. The synergistic effect of chemical bonding and strain regulation suppresses interface recombination and phase transition, leading to enhanced PCE of 21.0&#8201;% and promising operational stability with T99 over 2000&#8197;h at MPP tracking which represents one of the most stable wide band gap PSCs.







Abstract
Cesium&#8208;based inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising light&#8208;harvesting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their promising thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. However, obstacles to commercialization remain regarding their phase instability. In this work, we report a facile and effective strategy to regulate the surface compressive strain via in situ surface reaction to stabilize CsPbI3 perovskite. The use of a chelating ligand with a molecular configuration closely matching the integer multiples of the unit cell lattice parameters of CsPbI3 induces compressive strain at the surface of CsPbI3. The chemical bonding and strain modulation synergistically not only passivate film defects, but also inhibit perovskite phase degradation, thus significantly improving the intrinsic stability of inorganic perovskite. Consequently, enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.0&#8201;% and 18.6&#8201;% were respectively achieved in 0.16&#8208;cm2 lab&#8208;scale devices and 25.3&#8208;cm2 solar modules. Further, surface reaction enables PSCs with enhanced thermal and operational stability; these devices retain over 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after damp&#8208;heat tests (i.e., in 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% R.&#8197;H. air) for 2000&#8197;h, and remain 99&#8201;% of their initial PCE after operating for 2000&#8197;h, representing one of the most stable inorganic PSCs reported so far.

         <title>Indole N&#8208;Linked Hydroperoxyl Adduct of Protein&#8208;Derived Cofactor Modulating Catalase&#8208;Peroxidase Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) neutralizes hydrogen peroxide during infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG from cells grown at ambient temperature contains an indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct, MYW&#8208;OOH (golden color). MYW&#8208;OOH transiently inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique off switch. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature converts MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW (blue color) and restores KatG's detoxifying ability.







Abstract
Bifunctional catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) features a posttranslational methionine&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (MYW) crosslinked cofactor crucial for its catalase function, enabling pathogens to neutralize hydrogen peroxide during infection. We discovered the presence of indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct (MYW&#8208;OOH) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG in the solution state under ambient conditions, suggesting its natural occurrence. By isolating predominantly MYW&#8208;OOH&#8208;containing KatG protein, we investigated the chemical stability and functional impact of MYW&#8208;OOH. We discovered that MYW&#8208;OOH inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique temporary lock. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature removes the hydroperoxyl adduct from the protein cofactor, converting MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW and restoring the detoxifying ability of the enzyme against hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl group is releasable. KatG with MYW&#8208;OOH represents a catalase dormant, but primed, state of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into chemical strategies targeting the bifunctional enzyme KatG in pathogens, highlighting the role of N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl modifications in enzymatic function.

Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature converts MYW-OOH to MYW (blue color) and restores KatG's detoxifying ability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bifunctional catalase-peroxidase (KatG) features a posttranslational methionine-tyrosine-tryptophan (MYW) crosslinked cofactor crucial for its catalase function, enabling pathogens to neutralize hydrogen peroxide during infection. We discovered the presence of indole nitrogen-linked hydroperoxyl adduct (MYW-OOH) in &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; KatG in the solution state under ambient conditions, suggesting its natural occurrence. By isolating predominantly MYW-OOH-containing KatG protein, we investigated the chemical stability and functional impact of MYW-OOH. We discovered that MYW-OOH inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique temporary lock. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature removes the hydroperoxyl adduct from the protein cofactor, converting MYW-OOH to MYW and restoring the detoxifying ability of the enzyme against hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked hydroperoxyl group is releasable. KatG with MYW-OOH represents a catalase dormant, but primed, state of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into chemical strategies targeting the bifunctional enzyme KatG in pathogens, highlighting the role of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked hydroperoxyl modifications in enzymatic function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Loading Dyes into Chiral Cd/Zn&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sizes of chiral MOFs can be controlled from sub&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;m to over 7&#8197;mm by tuning the types and additional amounts of organic dyes. The full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence MOFs are synthesized by different dyes encapsulation, which are further assembled into a white CPL light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest chemistry of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has endowed them with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), it is still limited for MOFs to systematically tune full&#8208;color CPL emissions and sizes. This work directionally assembles the chiral ligands, metal sites and organic dyes to prepare a series of crystalline enantiomeric D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n MOFs (n=1~5, representing the adding amount of dyes), where D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn with the formula of Cd2(D/L&#8211;Cam)2(TPyPE) and Zn2(D/L&#8211;Cam)2(TPyPE) (D/L&#8208;Cam=D/L&#8208;camphoric acid, TPyPE=4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;(1,2&#8208;henediidenetetra&#8208;4,1&#8208;phenylene)tetrakis[pyridine]) were used as the chiral platforms. The framework&#8208;dye&#8208;enabled emission and through&#8208;space chirality transfer facilitate D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n bright full&#8208;color CPL activity. The ideal yellow CPL of D&#8208;Cd&#8208;5 and D&#8208;Zn&#8208;4, with |glum| as 4.9&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 and 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and relatively high photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.79&#8201;% and 45.40&#8201;%, are further assembled into a white CPL light&#8208;emitting diode. The crystal sizes of D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n were found to be strongly correlated to the types and additional amounts of organic dyes, that the positive organic dyes allow for the preparation of &gt;&#8201;7&#8197;mm bulks and negative dyes account for sub&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;m particles. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate full&#8208;color emissive CPL composites and provides a potentially universal method for controlling the size of optical platforms.

         <title>DNA Origami Vesicle Sensors with Triggered Single&#8208;Molecule Cargo Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DNA origami&#8208;based biosensor for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery using single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET). The hydrophobic ATTO647N&#8208;modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash on the sensor detects vesicle binding via FRET changes and delivers molecular cargo through triggered strand displacement reaction. This platform offers innovative applications in biosensing and controllable stoichiometric loading of vesicles.







Abstract
Interacting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Utilizing DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor with single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a DNA origami nanostructure. In a vesicle&#8208;free environment, the ssDNA coils, ensuring high FRET efficiency. Upon vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, reducing FRET efficiency. As the next step, the sensing strand serves as molecular cargo that can be transferred to the vesicle through a triggered strand displacement reaction. Depending on the number of cholesterols on the displacer strands, we either induce a diffusive release of the fluorescent load towards neighboring vesicles or a stoichiometric release of a single cargo&#8208;unit to the vesicle on the nanosensor. Ultimately, our multi&#8208;functional liposome interaction and detection platform opens up pathways for innovative biosensing applications and stoichiometric loading of vesicles with single&#8208;molecule control.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Cross&#8208;Nucleophile Coupling: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Deborylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general deborylative cyanation protocol representative of an enantioconvergent cross&#8208;nucleophile coupling platform. Mechanistic study suggests the formation of prochiral alkyl radicals via aniline&#8208;assisted single&#8208;electron activation of organoboron species. Electronic structure analysis of the reactive CuII(CN)2 complex indicates a significant amount of ligand&#8208;based radical density.







Abstract
Organoboron compounds are widely utilized in organic synthesis for their diverse reactivity, modular preparation, and stability compared to other classes of organometallic reagents. While organoboron species are commonly employed as nucleophiles in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, their potential as racemic building blocks in enantioconvergent transformations remains largely untapped. Herein, we demonstrate the direct utilization of alkylboronic pinacol esters in intermolecular enantioconvergent transformations. Specifically, this work describes the development and mechanistic study of an enantioconvergent deborylative cyanation enabled by Cu catalysis. This method imparts a high degree of enantioselectivity and tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction is proposed to proceed through a radical&#8208;relay mechanism. Aniline&#8208;assisted homolysis of the carbon&#8211;boron bond results in prochiral alkyl radicals that are functionalized by in situ generated Cu(II)(CN)2 species in an enantioselective fashion. The Cu(II)(CN)2 intermediate was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and its electronic structure was probed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Computational studies were carried out to corroborate the proposed radical&#8208;relay mechanism.

         <title>Chemical Recording of Pump&#8208;Specific Drug Efflux in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, the drug of interest competes with the efflux of BEP through specific pumps, resulting in the accumulation of BEP within the cells. The elevated intracellular levels of BEP induced by the drug contribute to a heightened extent of protein labeling. We developed two BEPs based on per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharide labeling and photocatalytic proximity labeling to record drug efflux by multidrug resistance proteins and p&#8208;glycoprotein, respectively.







Abstract
Drug efflux&#8212;a process primarily facilitated by efflux pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs)&#8212;plays a pivotal role in cellular resistance to chemotherapies. Conventional approaches to assess drug efflux are predominantly conducted in vitro and often lack pump specificity. Here we report the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, which enables the recording of pump&#8208;specific drug efflux in living cells. In BRIEF, a specific substrate is engineered as a bioorthogonal efflux probe (BEP) for specific pumps. The cellular concentration and protein labeling level of the probe can be augmented when the test drug is transported by the same pumps. Serendipitously, we discovered that per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharides, initially designed for metabolic glycan labeling, are exported by some MRPs. Using Ac4GlcNAl as a BEP, we studied the structure&#8208;efflux relationship of flavonoids and identified small molecules, including tannic acid, cholesterol and gallic acid, as novel MRP substrates in high&#8208;throughput screening. Tannic acid, known for anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 properties, showed increased efficacy upon MRP inhibition. Additionally, BRIEF was adapted to assess p&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated efflux using Rhodamine&#8197;123 as a BEP, leveraging its light&#8208;activatable proximity labeling ability. BRIEF provides a versatile approach to investigate drug efflux and enhance chemotherapy strategies.

We developed two BEPs based on per-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetylated unnatural monosaccharide labeling and photocatalytic proximity labeling to record drug efflux by multidrug resistance proteins and p-glycoprotein, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug efflux&#8212;a process primarily facilitated by efflux pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs)&#8212;plays a pivotal role in cellular resistance to chemotherapies. Conventional approaches to assess drug efflux are predominantly conducted in vitro and often lack pump specificity. Here we report the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, which enables the recording of pump-specific drug efflux in living cells. In BRIEF, a specific substrate is engineered as a bioorthogonal efflux probe (BEP) for specific pumps. The cellular concentration and protein labeling level of the probe can be augmented when the test drug is transported by the same pumps. Serendipitously, we discovered that per-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetylated unnatural monosaccharides, initially designed for metabolic glycan labeling, are exported by some MRPs. Using Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;GlcNAl as a BEP, we studied the structure-efflux relationship of flavonoids and identified small molecules, including tannic acid, cholesterol and gallic acid, as novel MRP substrates in high-throughput screening. Tannic acid, known for anti-tumor and anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties, showed increased efficacy upon MRP inhibition. Additionally, BRIEF was adapted to assess p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux using Rhodamine&#8197;123 as a BEP, leveraging its light-activatable proximity labeling ability. BRIEF provides a versatile approach to investigate drug efflux and enhance chemotherapy strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrow Alkane Product Distribution in Polyethylene Waste Hydrocracking by Zeolite Micro&#8208;Mesopore Diffusion Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing zeolite micro&#8208;mesopore diffusion optimization, this study engineers a bifunctional catalytic system that achieves 94.0&#8201;% conversion of plastic waste into liquid alkanes, with 84.8&#8201;% in the C5&#8722;C7 range, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity for upcycling of polymers into high&#8208;value fuels.







Abstract
Plastic pollution poses a pressing environmental challenge in modern society. Chemical catalytic conversion has emerged as a promising solution for upgrading waste plastics into valuable liquid alkanes and other high value products. However, the current methods yield mixed products with a wide carbon distribution. To address this challenge, we present a bifunctional catalytic system consisting of &#946; zeolite mixed hierarchical Pt@Hie&#8208;TS&#8208;1, designed for the conversion of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) into liquid alkanes. This system achieves a 94.0&#8201;% yield of liquid alkane, with 84.8&#8201;% of C5&#8722;C7 light alkanes. Combined with in situ FTIR and molecular dynamics simulation, the shape&#8208;selective mechanisms is elucidated, which ensures that only olefins of the appropriate size can diffuse to the encapsulated Pt sites within the zeolite for hydrogenation, resulting in an ultra&#8208;narrow product distribution. Furthermore, by optimizing the micro&#8208;mesopores of Pt@Hie&#8208;TS&#8208;1, the scaling relationship between the pore structure and the conversion/selectivity is identified. The rapid diffusion of olefins within these micro&#8208;mesopores significantly enhances the catalytic efficiency. Our findings contribute to the design of efficient catalysts for plastic waste valorization.

         <title>Diaminonaphthalene Boronic Acid (DANBA): New Approach for Peroxynitrite Sensing Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA) proved to be a universal and highly selective recognition group for ONOO&#8722; over H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species, overcoming the long&#8208;standing issues of aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based probes. DANBA can be combined with diverse hydroxyl&#8208;containing fluorophores to obtain ONOO&#8722; sensing probes with different spectral emissions. A DANBA and malononitrile fluorophore&#8208;based probe detected subtle changes in the ONOO&#8722; levels of mouse brains with Parkinson's disease.







Abstract
Selective detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is vital for studying their role in brain diseases. Fluorescence probes can distinguish ONOO&#8722; species from other ROS; however, their selectivity toward ONOO&#8722; species depends on the ONOO&#8722; recognition group. Aryl&#8208;boronic acids and esters, which are common ONOO&#8722; recognition groups, are not selective for ONOO&#8722; over H2O2. In this study, we developed a diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid as a new ONOO&#8722; recognition group that selectively reacts with ONOO&#8722; over H2O2 and other ROS. Three DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA)&#8208;based fluorophores that emit fluorescence over visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions, Cou&#8208;BN, BVP&#8208;BN, and HDM&#8208;BN, and their aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based counterparts (Cou&#8208;BO, BVP&#8208;BO, and HDM&#8208;BO), were developed. The DANBA&#8208;based probes exhibited enhanced selectivity toward ONOO&#8722; over that of their control group, as well as universality in solution assays and in vitro experiments with PC12 cells. The NIR&#8208;emissive HDM&#8208;BN was optimized to delineate in vivo ONOO&#8722; levels in mouse brains with Parkinson's disease. This DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid belongs to a new generation of recognition groups for developing ONOO&#8722; probes, and this strategy could be extended to other common hydroxyl&#8208;containing dyes to detect ONOO&#8722; levels in complex biological systems and processes.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Polymer Membranes with Intrinsic Microporosity for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) containing hydrophilic Tr&#246;ger's base groups were coated as ultrathin selective membranes on zinc metal anodes to regulate the ion transport and electrochemical reactions at interfaces. The PIM membranes regulate the zinc ion transport and effectively mitigate zinc dendrite growth, as well as reduce corrosive side reactions, leading to safe and stable zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
Metallic zinc has emerged as a promising anode material for high&#8208;energy battery systems due to its high theoretical capacity (820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), low redox potential for two&#8208;electron reactions, cost&#8208;effectiveness and inherent safety. However, current zinc metal batteries face challenges in low coulombic efficiency and limited longevity due to uncontrollable dendrite growth, the corrosive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and decomposition of the aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. Here, we report an interfacial&#8208;engineering approach to mitigate dendrite growth and reduce corrosive reactions through the design of ultrathin selective membranes coated on the zinc anodes. The submicron&#8208;thick membranes derived from polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), featuring pores with tunable interconnectivity, facilitate regulated transport of Zn2+&#8208;ions, thereby promoting a uniform plating/stripping process. Benefiting from the protection by PIM membranes, zinc symmetric cells deliver a stable cycling performance over 1500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA/cm2 with a capacity of 0.5&#8197;mAh while full cells with NaMnO2 cathode operate stably at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 300&#8197;cycles without capacity decay. Our work represents a new strategy of preparing multi&#8208;functional membranes that can advance the development of safe and stable zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Organized Patterns in Non&#8208;Reciprocal Active Droplet Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary mixtures of droplets exhibiting non&#8208;reciprocal active interactions self&#8208;organize into dynamic patterns upon tuning the number ratio and size ratio of the two populations and the surfactant composition. A minimal mathematical model recapitulates the experimentally observed patterns. The chemical organizing principles governing the binary droplet system are extendable to multicomponent active droplet mixtures.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium patterns are widespread in nature and often arise from the self&#8208;organization of constituents through nonreciprocal chemotactic interactions. In this study, we demonstrate how active oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet mixtures with predator&#8208;prey interactions can result in a variety of self&#8208;organized patterns. By manipulating physical parameters, the droplet diameter ratio and number ratio, we identify distinct classes of patterns within a binary droplet system, rationalize the pattern formation, and quantify motilities. Experimental results are recapitulated in numerical simulations using a minimal computational model that solely incorporates chemotactic interactions and steric repulsion among the constituents. The time evolution of the patterns is investigated and chemically explained. We also investigate how patterns vary with differing interaction strength by altering surfactant composition. Leveraging insights from the binary droplet system, the framework is extended to a ternary droplet mixture composed of multiple chasing droplet pairs to create chemically directed hierarchical organization. Our findings demonstrate how rationalizable, self&#8208;organized patterns can be programmed in a chemically minimal system and provide the basis for exploration of emergent organization and higher order complexity in active colloids.

     alt="Self-Organized Patterns in Non-Reciprocal Active Droplet Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary mixtures of droplets exhibiting non-reciprocal active interactions self-organize into dynamic patterns upon tuning the number ratio and size ratio of the two populations and the surfactant composition. A minimal mathematical model recapitulates the experimentally observed patterns. The chemical organizing principles governing the binary droplet system are extendable to multicomponent active droplet mixtures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-equilibrium patterns are widespread in nature and often arise from the self-organization of constituents through nonreciprocal chemotactic interactions. In this study, we demonstrate how active oil-in-water droplet mixtures with predator-prey interactions can result in a variety of self-organized patterns. By manipulating physical parameters, the droplet diameter ratio and number ratio, we identify distinct classes of patterns within a binary droplet system, rationalize the pattern formation, and quantify motilities. Experimental results are recapitulated in numerical simulations using a minimal computational model that solely incorporates chemotactic interactions and steric repulsion among the constituents. The time evolution of the patterns is investigated and chemically explained. We also investigate how patterns vary with differing interaction strength by altering surfactant composition. Leveraging insights from the binary droplet system, the framework is extended to a ternary droplet mixture composed of multiple chasing droplet pairs to create chemically directed hierarchical organization. Our findings demonstrate how rationalizable, self-organized patterns can be programmed in a chemically minimal system and provide the basis for exploration of emergent organization and higher order complexity in active colloids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 TxtE Model System with Mechanistic and Theoretical Evidence for a Heme Peroxynitrite Active Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient modelling of the economically impactful enzyme, TxtE, has been probed, in which indole (tryptophan mimic) nitration was observed by a putative heme&#8208;peroxynitrite intermediate, resembling one of the prime enzymatic mechanistic proposals. Experimental and theoretical exploration of the mechanism reveal a unique reaction landscape dictated by NO2 radical species.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 homolog, TxtE, efficiently catalyzes the direct and regioselective aromatic nitration of the indolyl moiety of L&#8208;tryptophan to 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan, using nitric oxide (NO) and dioxygen (O2) as co&#8208;substrates. Pathways for such direct and selective nitration of heteroaromatic motifs present platforms for engineering new nitration biocatalysts for pharmacologically beneficial targets, among a medley of other pivotal industrial applications. Precise mechanistic details concerning this pathway are only weakly understood, albeit a heme iron(III)&#8208;peroxynitrite active species has been postulated. To shed light on this unique reaction landscape, we investigated the indole nitration pathway of a series of biomimetic ferric heme superoxide mimics, [(Por)FeIII(O2&#8722;&#8901;)], in the presence of NO. Therein, our model systems gave rise to three distinct nitroindole products, including 4&#8208;nitroindole, the product analogous to that obtained with TxtE. Moreover, 15N and 18O isotope labeling studies, along with meticulously designed control experiments lend credence to a heme peroxynitrite active nitrating agent, drawing close similarities to the tryptophan nitration mechanism of TxtE. All organic and inorganic reaction components have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods. Theoretical investigation into several mechanistic possibilities deem a unique indolyl radical based reaction pathway as the most energetically favorable, products of which, are in excellent agreement with experimental findings.

         <title>Accessing Therapeutically&#8208;Relevant Multifunctional Antisense Oligonucleotide Conjugates Using Native Chemical Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide and carbohydrate&#8208;antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) conjugates containing clinically&#8208;relevant phosphorothioate (PS) and locked&#8208;nucleic acid (LNA) backbone modifications are efficiently prepared using native chemical ligation. Chemoselective post&#8208;ligation modification of ASO conjugates is accomplished using radical desulfurization and cysteine modification chemistry to deliver valuable multifunctional constructs.







Abstract
Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies hold significant promise in the realm of molecular medicine. By precisely targeting RNA molecules, ASOs offer an approach to modulate gene expression and protein production, making them valuable tools for treating a wide range of genetic and acquired diseases. As the precise intracellular targeting and delivery of ASOs is challenging, strategies for preparing ASO&#8208;ligand conjugates are in exceedingly high demand. This work leverages the utility of native chemical ligation to conjugate ASOs with therapeutically relevant chemical modifications including locked nucleic acids and phosphorothioate backbone modifications to peptides and sugars via a stable amide linkage. A suite of post&#8208;ligation functionalizations through modification of the cysteine ligation handle are highlighted, including chemoselective radical desulfurization, lipidation, and alkylation with a range of valuable handles (e.g. alkyne, biotin, and radionuclide chelating ligands), affording multifunctional constructs for further applications in biology and medicine. Application of the methodology to a clinically&#8208;relevant triantennary&#8208;GalNAc ASO conjugate and validation of its binding and functional activity underpins the applicability of the technique to oligonucleotide&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization with Conductive Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive polymers such as polyaniline are promising polarizing agents for dynamic nuclear polarization. They are tunable, can be functionalized, and their unpaired electrons can be hyperpolarized by chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity. We show solid&#8208;state dynamic nuclear polarization of polyaniline at liquid helium temperatures with an intriguing mechanism crossover as radical concentration is increased.







Abstract
The low sensitivity of liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be overcome by hyperpolarizing nuclear spins by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP). It consists of transferring the near&#8208;unity polarization of unpaired electron spins of stable radicals to the nuclear spins of interest at liquid helium temperatures, below 2&#8197;K, before melting the sample in view of hyperpolarized liquid&#8208;state magnetic resonance experiments. Reaching such a temperature is challenging and requires complex instrumentation, which impedes the deployment of dDNP. Here, we propose organic conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI) as a new class of polarizing matrices and report 1H polarizations of up to 5&#8201;%. We also show that 13C spins of a host solution impregnated in porous conductive polymers can be hyperpolarized by relayed DNP. Such conductive polymers can be synthesized as chiral and display current induced spin selectivity leading to electron spin hyperpolarization close to unity without the need for low temperatures nor high magnetic fields. Our results show the feasibility of solid&#8208;state DNP in conductive polymers that are known to exhibit chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Gallium Intermetallic Compounds with Tailored Active Site Configurations for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The obtained CoGa intermetallic compounds with body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure and isolated electron&#8208;rich Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO3 intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, which effectively reduces the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step in the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) process, thus significantly improving the NO3RR activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Gallium (Ga) with a low melting point can serve as a unique metallic solvent in the synthesis of intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The negative formation enthalpy of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs endows them with high catalytic stability. Meanwhile, their tunable crystal structures offer the possibility to tailor the configurations of active sites to meet the requirements for specific catalytic applications. Herein, we present a general method for preparing a range of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs, including Co&#8722;Ga, Ni&#8722;Ga, Pt&#8722;Ga, Pd&#8722;Ga, and Rh&#8722;Ga IMCs. The structurally ordered CoGa IMCs with body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure are uniformly dispersed on the nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide substrate (O&#8208;CoGa/NG) and deliver outstanding nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) performance, making them excellent catalysts to construct highly efficient rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Operando studies and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;rich environments around the Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO3 intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, thus improving the NO3RR activity and selectivity.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Absorbance&#8208;Activated Droplet Sorting for Engineering Aldehyde Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An absorbance&#8208;activated droplet sorting platform was developed for library screening. Absorbance in picoliter droplets is measured using a lithographic mask, with sorted droplets identified by impedance detection. This method allows sensitive detection and sorting at kHz rates. The efficiency of the platform is demonstrated by screening a 105&#8208;member aldehyde dehydrogenase library, yielding a variant with a 51&#8201;% improvement in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in the commercial use of biocatalysts, transitioning from energy&#8208;intensive traditional chemistries to more sustainable methods. Current enzyme engineering techniques, such as directed evolution, require the generation and testing of large mutant libraries to identify optimized variants. Unfortunately, conventional screening methods are unable to screen such large libraries in a robust and timely manner. Droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems have emerged as a powerful high&#8208;throughput tool for library screening at kilohertz rates. Unfortunately, almost all reported systems are based on fluorescence detection, restricting their use to a limited number of enzyme types that naturally convert fluorogenic substrates or require the use of surrogate substrates. To expand the range of enzymes amenable to evolution using droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems, we present an absorbance&#8208;activated droplet sorter that allows droplet sorting at kilohertz rates without the need for optical monitoring of the microfluidic system. To demonstrate the utility of the sorter, we rapidly screen a 105&#8208;member aldehyde dehydrogenase library towards D&#8208;glyceraldehyde using a NADH mediated coupled assay that generates WST&#8208;1 formazan as the colorimetric product. We successfully identify a variant with a 51&#8201;% improvement in catalytic efficiency and a significant increase in overall activity across a broad substrate spectrum.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Restocking Strategy for the Direct Reuse of Degraded LiFePO4 Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for the direct reuse of spent LiFePO4 electrodes is developed by simply soaking the spent electrodes in a lithiation reagent solution at room temperature for 6&#8197;min. Being reused directly, the regenerated LiFePO4 electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 162.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being exposed in air for 3&#8197;months.







Abstract
The sustainable development of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries calls for efficient recycling technologies for spent LFP (SLFP). Even for the advanced direct material regeneration (DMR) method, multiple steps including separation, regeneration, and electrode refabrication processes are still needed. To circumvent these intricacies, new regeneration methods that allow direct electrode reuse (DER) by rejuvenating SLFP electrodes without damaging its structure are desired. Here, a 0.1&#8197;M lithium triethyl borohydride/tetrahydrofuran solution, which has the proper reductive capability to reduce Fe3+ in SLFP to Fe2+ without alloying with the aluminum current collector, is selected as the lithiation/regeneration reagent to restock the Li loss and regenerate SLFP electrodes. By soaking the SLFP electrodes in the lithiation solution, we successfully rejuvenated the crystal structure and electrochemical activity of SLFP electrodes with structural integrity within only 6&#8197;minutes at room temperature. When being directly reused, the regenerated LFP electrodes deliver a high specific capacity of 162.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being exposed to air for 3&#8197;months. The DER strategy presents significant economic and environmental benefits compared with the DMR method. This research provides a timely and innovative solution for recycling spent blade batteries using large&#8208;sized LFP electrodes, boosting the closed&#8208;loop development of LFP batteries.

         <title>Potent and Protease Resistant Azapeptide Agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 and GIP Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azapeptides are highly structured and protease resistant peptidomimetics that are bioisosteric replacements for &#945;&#8208;amino acids. A single atom change in 3.5&#8197;kDa peptides from C&#945; to N&#945; was used to generate equipotent GLP&#8208;1R and GIPR mono agonists, and a unimolecular dual agonist. All azapeptide analogues were fully refractory to the front&#8208;line protease, DPP4, that degrades GLP&#8208;1 and GIP within minutes.







Abstract
The gut&#8208;derived peptide hormones glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 (GLP&#8208;1) and glucose&#8208;dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) play important physiological roles including glucose homeostasis and appetite suppression. Stabilized agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R) and dual agonists of GLP&#8208;1R and GIP receptor (GIPR) for the management of type&#8197;2 diabetes and obesity have generated widespread enthusiasm and have become blockbuster drugs. These therapeutics are refractory to the action of dipeptidyl peptidase&#8208;4 (DPP4), that catalyzes rapid removal of the two N&#8208;terminal residues of the native peptides, in turn severely diminishing their activity profiles. Here we report that a single atom change from carbon to nitrogen in the backbone of the entire peptide makes them refractory to DPP4 action while still retaining full potency and efficacy at their respective receptors. This was accomplished by use of aza&#8208;amino acids, that are bioisosteric replacements for &#945;&#8208;amino acids that perturb the structural backbone and local side chain conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that aza&#8208;amino acid can populate the same conformational space that GLP&#8208;1 adopts when bound to the GLP&#8208;1R. The insertion of an aza&#8208;amino acid at the second position from the N&#8208;terminus in semaglutide and in a dual agonist of GLP&#8208;1R and GIPR further demonstrates its capability as a viable alternative to current DPP4 resistance strategies while offering additional structural variation that may influence downstream signaling.

         <title>Triphasic Hydroxysilylation of Alkenes by Mechanically Piezoelectric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical strategy for the 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of both activated and unactivated alkenes using silylboronate and oxygen gas, facilitated by piezoelectric materials (Li2TiO3) serving as a redox catalyst in a triphasic catalytic system is introduced. This approach offers multiple advantages, including a brief reaction time of 30 minutes, solvent&#8208;free conditions, catalyst recyclability, and the avoidance of the need for strong base activation of silylboronate or external reductants.







Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of alkenes is crucial for synthesizing organosilicon compounds which are key intermediates in material science, pharmaceuticals, and organic synthesis. The development of strategies employing hydrogen atom transfer pathways is currently hindered by the existence of various competing reactions. Herein, we reported a novel mechanochemical strategy for the triphasic 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of alkenes through a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer pathway. Our approach not only circumvents competitive reactions to enable the first&#8208;ever 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of unactivated alkenes but also pioneers the research in mechanic force&#8208;induced triphasic reactions under ambient conditions. This gentle method offers excellent compatibility with various functional groups, operates under simple and solvent&#8208;free conditions, ensures rapid reaction time. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that silylboronate can be transformed to a silicon radical by highly polarized Li2TiO3 particles and oxygen under ball&#8208;milling condition.

It is found that AT can effectively regulate crystallization process and passivate defects of perovskite by binding with undercoordinated Pb2+ through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.80&#8197;eV. The AT&#8208;treated device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% and excellent stability.







Abstract
Various isomers have been developed to regulate the morphology and reduce defects in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To insight the structure&#8208;function&#8208;effect correlations for the isomerization of thiourea derivatives on the performance of the PSCs, we developed two thiourea derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB). Supported by experimental and calculated results, it was found that AT can bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ defect through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.818&#8197;eV, which is much higher than that from the synergistic interaction between two &#8722;NH&#8722; groups in HB and perovskite (1.015&#8197;eV). Moreover, the stronger interaction between AT and Pb2+ regulates the crystallization process of perovskite film to obtain a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with high crystallinity, large grain size, and low defect density. Consequently, the AT&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% (certified as 24.66&#8201;%), which is greatly higher than control (23.74&#8201;%) and HB&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 devices (25.05&#8201;%). The resultant device exhibits a remarkable stability for maintaining 91.0&#8201;% and 95.2&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after aging 2000&#8197;h in air condition or tracking at maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h, respectively.

         <title>Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Triggered Artificial DNAzyme Switches for Precise Manipulation of Cellular Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas signaling molecule&#8208;responsive artificial DNAzyme&#8208;based switches (GRAS) have been developed as H2S&#8208;driven nanodevices for manipulating cellular functions. GRAS is highly programmable and versatile, enabling the customization of user&#8208;defined H2S signaling inputs to down&#8208;regulate mRNA expression and activate RTK signaling pathways at various subcellular levels, thereby allowing for precise regulation of cell behavior.







Abstract
The development of synthetic molecular tools responsive to biological cues is crucial for advancing targeted cellular regulation. A significant challenge is the regulation of cellular processes in response to gaseous signaling molecules such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S). To address this, we present the design of Gas signaling molecule&#8208;Responsive Artificial DNAzyme&#8208;based Switches (GRAS) to manipulate cellular functions via H2S&#8208;sensitive synthetic DNAzymes. By incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties to the phosphorothioate backbone, DNAzymes are strategically designed with H2S&#8208;responsive azide groups at cofactor binding locations within the catalytic core region. These modifications enable their activation through H2S&#8208;reducing decaging, thereby initiating substrate cleavage activity. Our approach allows for the flexible customization of various DNAzymes to regulate distinct cellular processes in diverse scenarios. Intracellularly, the enzymatic activity of GRAS promotes H2S&#8208;induced cleavage of specific mRNA sequences, enabling targeted gene silencing and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, integrating GRAS with dynamic DNA assembly allows for grafting these functional switches onto cell surface receptors, facilitating H2S&#8208;triggered receptor dimerization. This extracellular activation transmits signals intracellularly to regulate cellular behaviors such as migration and proliferation. Collectively, synthetic switches are capable of rewiring cellular functions in response to gaseous cues, offering a promising avenue for advanced targeted cellular engineering.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Catalytic Cascade for the Depolymerization of the Lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Motif to Non&#8208;phenolic Dealkylated Aromatics</title>

An atom&#8208;efficient domino strategy maximizing the yield of non&#8208;phenolic dealkylated aromatics from the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif by one&#8208;pot catalytic cascade, consisting of selective dehydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;carbinol group, retro&#8208;aldol to cleave C&#8722;C bonds, and decarbonylation of the generated aldehydes.







Abstract
Aromatic monomers obtained by selective depolymerization of the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif are typically phenolic and contain (oxygenated) alkyl substitutions. This work reveals the potential of a one&#8208;pot catalytic lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 depolymerization cascade strategy that yields a uniform set of methoxylated aromatics without alkyl side&#8208;chains. This cascade consists of the selective acceptorless dehydrogenation of the &#947;&#8208;hydroxy group, a subsequent retro&#8208;aldol reaction that cleaves the C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bond, followed by in situ acceptorless decarbonylation of the formed aldehydes. This three&#8208;step cascade reaction, catalyzed by an iridium(I)&#8208;BINAP complex, resulted in 75&#8201;% selectivity for 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene from G&#8208;type lignin dimers, alongside syngas (CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2&#8776;1.4&#8201;:&#8201;1). Applying this method to a synthetic G&#8208;type polymer, 11&#8197;wt&#8201;% 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene was obtained. This versatile compound can be easily transformed into 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenol, a valuable precursor for pharmaceutical synthesis, through an enzymatic catalytic approach. Moreover, the hydrodeoxygenation potential of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene offers a pathway to produce valuable cyclohexane or benzene derivatives, presenting enticing opportunities for sustainable chemical transformations without the necessity for phenolic mixture upgrading via dealkylation.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF System Constructed via Template&#8208;Assisted Growth for Ultratrace H2S Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
The stable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 systems, synthesized via an innovative template&#8208;assisted approach, display high conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Gas sensors utilizing these systems demonstrate significant sensitivity to ultratrace H2S at room temperature and outstanding selectivity. Additionally, wearable sensors integrating these systems can capture human motion signals, opening up new possibilities for such devices.







Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) hold promise for highly sensitive sensing systems due to their conductivity and porosity. However, the fabrication of c&#8208;MOF thin films with controllable morphology, thickness, and preferential orientation remains a formidable yet ubiquitous challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative template&#8208;assisted strategy for constructing MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF (Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 (HITP: 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexamino&#8208;tri (p&#8208;phenylene))) systems with good electrical conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Leveraging the 2D nature and solution processability of NUS&#8208;8, we achieve the controllable self&#8208;assembly of Ni3(HITP)2 on NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets, producing solution&#8208;processable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with a film conductivity of 1.55&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Notably, the excellent solution processability facilitates the fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films and printing of intricate patterns with good uniformity, and the Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8&#8208;based system can monitor finger bending. Gas sensors based on Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 exhibit high sensitivity (LOD~6&#8197;ppb) and selectivity towards ultratrace H2S at room temperature, attributed to the coupling between Ni3(HITP)2 and NUS&#8208;8 and the redox reaction with H2S. This approach not only unlocks the potential of stacking different MOF layers in a sequence to generate functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single MOF, but also provides novel avenues for the scalable integration of MOFs in miniaturized devices with salient sensing performance.

         <title>An Integrated Module Performs Selective &#8216;Online&#8217; Epoxidation in the Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Mupirocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important and biosynthetically challenging polyketide antibiotic that requires key assembly steps including epoxidation, tetrahydropyran ring formation and fatty acid esterification. A linear polyketide fragment of mupirocin with six asymmetric centres was synthesized, and it was demonstrated that the mini&#8208;module MmpE is docked to MmpA and performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation using a previously unannotated ACP.







Abstract
The delineation of the complex biosynthesis of the potent antibiotic mupirocin, which consists of a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PAs) isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586, presents significant challenges, and the timing and mechanisms of several key transformations remain elusive. Particularly intriguing are the steps that process the linear backbone from the initial polyketide assembly phase to generate the first cyclic intermediate PA&#8208;B. These include epoxidation as well as incorporation of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring and fatty acid side chain required for biological activity. Herein, we show that the mini&#8208;module MmpE performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation and is integrated (&#8216;in&#8208;cis&#8217;) into the polyketide synthase via a docking domain. A linear polyketide fragment with six asymmetric centres was synthesised using a convergent approach and used to demonstrate substrate flux via an atypical KS0 and a previously unannotated ACP (MmpE_ACP). MmpE_ACP&#8208;bound synthetic substrates were critical in demonstrating successful epoxidation in vitro by the purified MmpE oxidoreductase domain. Alongside feeding studies, these results confirm the timing as well as chain length dependence of this selective epoxidation. These mechanistic studies pinpoint the location and nature of the polyketide substrate prior to the key formation of the THP ring and esterification that generate PA&#8208;B.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Supra&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Dots with Long Lifetime Photogenerated Radicals Boosting Tumor Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8208;acceptor type supra&#8208;CDs has been fabricated by using red emissive CDs as donor and electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule as acceptor. This peculiar donor&#8208;acceptor configuration facilitates the efficient charge separation in supra&#8208;CDs, thereby generating more superoxide radicals and additional holes&#8208;related radicals, which collectively boosts type&#8208;I tumor photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have gained significant interest because of their potential in biomedical applications. Nevertheless, developing CDs with efficient photoinduced charge separation for tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains a challenge. This study presents a novel class of supra&#8208;carbon&#8208;dots (supra&#8208;CDs) developed by fusing red emissive CDs with 2,3&#8208;dicyanohydroquinone (DCHQ) via post&#8208;solvothermal treatment. In supra&#8208;CDs, the core, acting as electron donors, is formed by assembled CDs with substantial sp2 domains, the fused interface originating from DCHQ with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups functions as the electron acceptor. This configuration creates the unique donor&#8208;acceptor nanostructure. Upon white light irradiation, the excited electrons from the assembled CDs were transferred to the electron&#8208;withdrawing interface, whereas the photogenerated holes were retained within the assembled CDs as radicals, leading to effective photoinduced charge separation. The separated photogenerated electrons then react with oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Simultaneously, the photogenerated holes undergo oxidation of crucial cellular substrates. This dual action underscores the exceptional cell&#8208;killing efficacy of supra&#8208;CDs. Moreover, the increased particle sizes (~20&#8197;nm) ensure supra&#8208;CDs to exhibit a notable capacity for tumor accumulation via the improved permeability and retention effect, thereby achieving satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor PDT efficacy in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Switchable Lattice Oxygen Sites for Selective C&#8722;H and C(O)&#8722;C Bond Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;switching strategy for in situ formulating stationary or removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in ESE&#8208;NiOOH is developed with ultrahigh selectivity for electrocatalytic upgrading of aromatic secondary alcohols via direct dehydrogenation to acetophenones or C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage to benzoic acids. Precisely modulating lattice&#8208;oxygen removability is reported for the first time to activate C&#8722;H and vector downstream reactions.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen is highly oxidizable, ideal for electrocatalytic C&#8722;H oxidation but insufficient alone for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage due to the non&#8208;removable nature of lattice sites. Here, we present a visible light&#8208;assisted electrochemical method of in situ formulating removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in a nickel&#8208;oxyhydroxide (ESE&#8208;NiOOH) electrocatalyst. This catalyst efficiently converts aromatic alcohols and carbonyls with C(O)&#8722;C fragments from lignin and plastics into benzoic acids (BAs) with high yields (83&#8211;99&#8201;%). Without light irradiation, ESE&#8208;NiOOH's intrinsic lattice&#8208;oxygen is non&#8208;removable and inert for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage. In situ characterizations show light&#8208;induced lattice&#8208;oxygen removal and regeneration via OH&#8722; refilling. Theoretical calculations identify the nucleophilic oxygen attack on ketone&#8208;derived carbanion as a rate&#8208;determining step, which can be remarkably facilitated by removable lattice&#8208;oxygen to activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an &#8220;electrochemical funnel&#8221; strategy is developed for high&#8208;efficiency upgrading aromatic mixtures with C(O)&#8722;C moieties into BA with up to 94&#8201;% yield. This in situ removal&#8208;regeneration approach for lattice sites opens an avenue for the tailored design of interfacial electrocatalysts to selectively upcycle waste carbon sources into valuable products.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Metformin Conjugates Acting as Promising PD&#8208;L1 Inhibitors through the AMP&#8208;Activated Protein Kinase Mediated Lysosomal Degradation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate was developed to modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment through PD&#8722;L1 down&#8208;regulation and hypoxia reversion, leading to highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small&#8208;molecular Pt(II) complex. The study led to the proposal of an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time.







Abstract
With the development of metalloimmunology, the potential of platinum drugs in cancer immunotherapy has attracted extensive attention. Although immunochemotherapy combining PD&#8208;1/PD&#8722;L1 antibodies with platinum drugs has achieved great success in the clinic, combination therapy commonly brings new problems. Herein, we have developed a platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate as a promising alternative to antibody&#8208;based PD&#8722;L1 inhibitors, not only disrupting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8722;L1 axis on cell surface but also down&#8208;regulating the total PD&#8722;L1 levels in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells comprehensively, thus achieving highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small molecule. Mechanism studies demonstrate that Pt&#8208;metformin conjugate can selectively accumulate in lysosomes, promote lysosomal&#8208;dependent PD&#8722;L1 degradation via the AMPK&#8208;TFEB pathway, and modulate the upstream regulatory proteins related to PD&#8722;L1 expression (e.g. HIF&#8208;1&#945; and NF&#8208;&#954;B), eventually decreasing the total abundance of PD&#8722;L1 in NSCLC, overcoming tumor hypoxia, and activating anti&#8208;tumor immunity in vivo. This work suggests an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time and provides a unique design perspective for the development of novel platinum drugs for immunochemotherapy.

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Alcohols via Amine Modified Copper Nanoparticles at Acidic Conditions</title>

The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products was significantly enhanced over Cu by the modification of n&#8208;butylamine at acidic media. The FE of C2+ products could reach up to 81.8&#8201;% with a total current density of 410&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the FE of C2+ alcohols was 52.6&#8201;%. The amine molecule on the surface of Cu could not only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which resulted in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products (e.g. C2+ alcohols) offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. Use of strong alkaline electrolytes is favorable to producing C2+ products. However, CO2 can react with hydroxide to form carbonate/bicarbonate, which results in low carbon utilization efficiency and poor stability. Using acidic electrolyte is an efficient way to solve the problems, but it is a challenge to achieve high selectivity of C2+ products. Here we report that the amine modified copper nanoparticles exhibit high selectivity of C2+ products and carbon utilization at acidic condition. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products reach up to 81.8&#8201;% at acidic media (pH=2) with a total current density of 410&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over n&#8208;butylamine modified Cu. Especially the FE of C2+ alcohols is 52.6&#8201;%, which is higher than those reported for CO2 electroreduction at acidic condition. In addition, the single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency towards C2+ production reach up to 60&#8201;%. Detailed studies demonstrate that the amine molecule on the surface of Cu cannot only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which result in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.

         <title>Precise Preparation of Supramolecular Spherical Nucleic Acids for Nucleolin&#8208;Targeted Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise supramolecular nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) were designed by incorporating a pair of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modified with multiple nucleic acids and adamantane with functional targeting nucleic acid. These Supra&#8208;SNAs with multivalent structure exhibit enhanced nuclease resistance, cellular uptake, and gene regulation capabilities in comparison to single&#8208;stranded DNA molecule. Moreover, the inhibition of gene expression in tumor cells leads to down&#8208;regulate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and thus effective cell proliferation and death against tumor cells.







Abstract
Molecular spherical nucleic acids (m&#8208;SNAs) are a second generation of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which are of significance in potential application of targeted delivery of nucleic acids or gene regulation due to their defined molecular structures. Nevertheless, m&#8208;SNAs typically involve a single DNA sequence which greatly limits its functions as either targeting purpose or gene regulation. In response, we proposed here a third generation, supramolecular spherical nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) with two different sequences to achieve both above&#8208;mentioned functions. Specifically, we constructed a series of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures by coupling a cell membrane receptor (i.e., nucleolin)&#8208;recognizing aptamer (AS1411)&#8208;modified adamantine as targeting probe and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antisense&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to specifically inhibit the overexpression of HER2 proteins for gene regulations. In comparison to the m&#8208;SNA precursors, such Supra&#8208;SNA structures exhibited enhanced levels of resistance to nuclease degradation, cellular uptake, gene regulation capabilities and tumor retention capacity. We demonstrated that Supra&#8208;SNAs exhibited optimal cell suppression rates and cell apoptosis via a phosphatidylinositol 3&#8208;kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. The well&#8208;defined molecular structures provide an attractive platform for investigating interrelationship between structure and property at the molecular level.

         <title>Pentagon&#8208;Rich Caged Carbon Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized caged carbon catalysts enriched with pentagonal structures and investigated their catalytic activity for the high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction. The origin of the ORR activity of the pentagon&#8208;containing carbon catalyst lies in the spin that localizes in the pentagon ring. The SOMO of pentagon&#8208;containing molecules is characterized by &#960; orbitals and is energetically low, which promotes effective oxygen adsorption.







Abstract
The interaction between electron spin and oxygen molecules in non&#8208;platinum catalysts, particularly carbon catalysts, significantly influences the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A promising approach to developing high&#8208;performance catalysts involves introducing five&#8208;membered ring structures with spin into graphitic carbons. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of cage&#8208;like cubic carbon catalysts enriched with pentagon structures using pentagon ring&#8208;containing C60 and a NaCl template. The number of pentagons contained in the structure was increased by doping with nitrogen and annealing, and the number of electron spins also increased, thereby improving catalytic activity. The prepared catalyst exhibits remarkable activity in ORR under acidic electrolytes. Furthermore, we elucidate the correlation between the pentagon structure, the number of spin, and catalytic activity, demonstrating that enhanced activity is contingent upon the presence of spin. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the role of spin in improving activity. The concept of spin and the introduction of pentagon structures provide new design principles for carbon catalysts.

         <title>Silylene&#8208;Copper&#8208;Amide Emitters: From Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Dual Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of emissive N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene Cu(I) amide complexes herald a significant advancement in the domain of linear two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) emitters, characterized by their thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and dual emissive properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report the inaugural instance of N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene (NHSi)&#8208;coordinated copper amide emitters (2&#8211;5). These complexes exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and singlet&#8208;triplet dual emission in anaerobic conditions. The NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;diphenylamide (2) complex demonstrates TADF with a very small &#916;EST gap (0.01&#8197;eV), an absolute quantum yield of 11&#8201;%, a radiative rate of 2.55&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a short &#964;TADF of 0.45&#8197;&#956;s in the solid state. The dual emissive complexes (3&#8211;5) achieve an absolute quantum yield of up to 20&#8201;% in the solid state with a kISC rate of 1.82&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with lifetimes up to 9&#8197;ms. The gradual decrease in the intensity of the triplet state of complex 3 under controlled oxygen exposure demonstrates its potential for future oxygen&#8208;sensing applications. Complexes 2 and 3 have been further utilized to fabricate converted LEDs, paving the way for future OLED production using newly synthesized NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;amides.

         <title>Isofunctional but Structurally Different Methyltransferases for Dithiolopyrrolone Diversification</title>

Two for one job: DtpM and XrdM are two bacterial enzymes that have different structures but still catalyze the same reaction: the amide N&#8208;methylation of dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs). Ligand binding to both enzymes was studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography, modeling, mutagenesis and activity assays. The results suggest that different organisms developed distinct methyltransferases for the same task by convergent evolution.







Abstract
Dithiolopyrrolone (DTP) natural products are produced by several different bacteria and have potent antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. While the amide of their DTP core can be methylated to fine&#8208;tune bioactivity, the enzyme responsible for the amide N&#8208;methylation has remained elusive in most taxa. Here, we identified the amide methyltransferase XrdM that is responsible for xenorhabdin (XRD) methylation in Xenorhabdus doucetiae but encoded outside of the XRD gene cluster. XrdM turned out to be isofunctional with the recently reported methyltransferase DtpM, that is involved in the biosynthesis of the DTP thiolutin, although its X&#8208;ray structure is unrelated to that of DtpM. To investigate the structural basis for ligand binding in both enzymes, we used X&#8208;ray crystallography, modeling, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and kinetic activity assays. Our study expands the limited knowledge of post&#8208;non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) amide methylation in DTP biosynthesis and reveals an example of convergent evolution of two structurally completely different enzymes for the same reaction in different organisms.

         <title>Iridium(III) Photosensitizers Induce Simultaneous Pyroptosis and Ferroptosis for Multi&#8208;Network Synergistic Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis is reported here. The iridium(III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, can induce DNA damage&#8208;related gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, along with regulating iron stress&#8208;related gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion synergistically promoted ferroptosis, and further trigger a strong immune response.







Abstract
The integration of pyroptosis and ferroptosis hybrid cell death induction to augment immune activation represents a promising avenue for anti&#8208;tumor treatment, but there is a lack of research. Herein, we developed two iridium (III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, with the capacity to disrupt redox balance and induce photo&#8208;driven cascade damage to DNA and Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein&#8197;1 (KEAP1). The activation of the absent in melanoma&#8197;2 (AIM2)&#8208;related cytoplasmic nucleic acid&#8208;sensing pathway, triggered by damaged DNA, leads to the induction of gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Simultaneously, iron homeostasis, regulated by the KEAP1/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor&#8197;2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase&#8197;1 (HO&#8208;1) pathway, serves as a pivotal bridge, facilitating not only the induction of gasdermin&#8197;E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated non&#8208;canonical pyroptosis, but also ferroptosis in synergy with glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion. The collaborative action of pyroptosis and ferroptosis generates a synergistic effect that elicits immunogenic cell death, stimulates a robust immune response and effectively inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Our work introduces the first metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy, and highlights the significance of iron homeostasis as a vital hub connecting synergistic effects of pyroptosis and ferroptosis.

Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). An interface chemistry modulation strategy is proposed to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. The strong interactions significantly promote internal electron exchanges, and the improved electron delocalization led to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2. This enhancement promotes a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*.







Abstract
Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in clean energy conversion and storage systems. Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are regarded as highly promising electrocatalysts for the UOR. However, their effectiveness is significantly hindered by the unavoidable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of nickel species during UOR. To address this challenge, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. This heterostructure incorporates Ag at the CoOOH@NiOOH heterojunction interface, where strong interactions significantly promote the electron exchanges at the heterojunction interface between &#8208;OH and &#8208;O groups. Consequently, the improved electron delocalization leads to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2, promoting a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*. The resulting catalyst, Ag&#8722;CoOOH@NiOOH, demonstrates ultrahigh UOR activity with a low potential of 1.33&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The fabricated catalyst exhibits a mass activity over 11.9 times greater than the initial cobalt oxyhydroxide. The rechargeable urea&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) achieve a record&#8208;breaking energy efficiency of 74.56&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, remarkable durability (1000&#8197;hours at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and quick charge performances.

         <title>Diatomic Catalysts for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Mechanistic Insights and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin exchange effect between diatomic sites activates the diatomic catalysts, effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of triiodide and facilitating the iodine conversion reaction. Utilizing MnZn&#8722;NC diatomic catalysts, the zinc&#8208;iodine battery demonstrates both a high specific capacity and exceptional cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
There has been a growing interest in developing catalysts to enable the reversible iodine conversion reaction for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs). While diatomic catalysts (DACs) have demonstrated superior performance in various catalytic reactions due to their ability to facilitate synergistic charge interactions, their application in AZIBs remains unexplored. Herein, we present, for the first time, a DAC comprising Mn&#8722;Zn dual atoms anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (MnZn&#8722;NC) for iodine loading, resulting in a high&#8208;performance AZIB with a capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and remarkable cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles. The electron hopping along the Mn&#8722;N&#8722;Zn bridge is stimulated via a spin exchange mechanism. This process broadens the Mn 3dxy band width and enhances the metallic character of the catalyst, thus facilitating charge transfer between the catalysts and reaction intermediates. Additionally, the increased electron occupancy within the d&#8208;orbital of Zn elevates Zn's d&#8208;band center, thereby enhancing chemical interactions between MnZn&#8722;NC and I&#8208;based species. Furthermore, our mechanism demonstrates potential applicability to other Metal&#8208;Zn&#8722;NC DACs with spin&#8208;polarized atoms. Our work elucidates a clear mechanistic understanding of diatomic catalysts and provides new insights into catalyst design for AZIBs.

         <title>Rewritable Surface&#8208;Grafted Polymer Brushes with Dynamic Covalent Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the fabrication of rewritable surface&#8208;initiated polymer brushes with a relatively high grafting density grafted from both nanoparticles and macroscopic surfaces has been developed. The incorporation of a dynamic covalent chemical linkage at the &#8220;root&#8221; of the polymer brushes would, in principle, enable unlimited rounds of degrafting and regrafting of polymer brushes.







Abstract
Surface grafting of polymer brushes drastically modifies surface properties, including wettability, compatibility, responsiveness, etc. A broad variety of functionalities can be introduced to the surface via different types of polymers. Bringing together properties of two or more types of polymer brushes to one surface opens up even more possibilities in brush&#8208;modified materials. However, while it is generally feasible to introduce several chemical compositions along the brushes via copolymerization, it is challenging to vary the types of polymer brushes along a surface. Although previous studies have demonstrated binary brushes via orthogonal polymerization techniques or partial deactivation/regrafting, they commonly limit the number of polymer types to two. Here, we propose a strategy to introduce dynamic covalent diketoenamine linkages at the root of polymer brushes. The grafting density could be precisely tuned during surface functionalization. The surface&#8208;anchored polymer brushes were cleaved by the addition of small molecule amines. New polymer brushes can be regrafted from the surface following refunctionalization of exposed sites. The maneuverability allows tuning of the types and densities of the polymer brushes, pointing the way to the preparation of a new generation of well&#8208;defined brush&#8208;modified materials with mixed grafts, with potential applications in the design of smart materials and surfaces.

         <title>Dynamically Stabilizing Oxygen Atoms in Silver Catalyst for Highly Selective and Durable CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pulsed&#8208;bias technique was developed to dynamically stabilize oxygen atoms in silver (Ag) electrodes under operando conditions, allowing to achieve highly selective and durable electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysis.







Abstract
Oxide derived catalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), in which, it is found that residue oxygen atoms play a pivotal role in regulating the catalyst's electronic structure and thus the CO2RR process. Unfortunately, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst under cathodic CO2RR potentials makes it unstable during continuous electrolysis, greatly hindering its practical industrial applications. In this work, we develop a pulsed&#8208;bias technique that is able to dynamically stabilize the residue oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst during electrochemical CO2RR. As a result, the oxide derived catalyst under pulsed bias exhibits super catalytic stability in catalyzing electrochemical CO2RR, while keeping excellent catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Induced Flexible and Twisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functionalized Carbon Dots with Customized&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the exciting discovery of the surface modification of carbon dots drives the construction of an assembly asymmetric environment to realize a full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the aggregated state. Moreover, we explore panchromatic as well as white&#8208;light CPL applications of light emitting diodes and large flexible optical films, which provide new material strategies for virtual reality, medical imaging, and scientific visualization, among others.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has numerous applications in optical data storage, quantum computing, bioresponsive imaging, liquid crystal displays, and backlights in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) displays. In addition to their competitive optical properties, carbon dots (CDs) benefit from simple and low&#8208;cost preparation, facile post&#8208;modification, and excellent resistance to photo&#8208; and chemical bleaching after carbonization. Combining the superior optical performance with polarization peculiarities through hierarchical structure engineering is imperative for the development of CDs. In this study, hydrophobic interactions of aromatic ligands, which participate in the surface&#8208;ligand post&#8208;modification process on the ground&#8208;state chiral carbon core, are employed to drive the oriented assembly. Furthermore, the residual chiral amides on CDs form multiple hydrogen bonds during gradual aggregation, causing the assembled materials to form an asymmetric bending structure. Superficial ligands interfere with the optical dynamics of the exciton radiation transition and stabilize the excited state of the assembled materials to achieve a circularly polarized signal. The linkage ligands overcome the frequent aggregation&#8208;induced quenching phenomenon that present difficulties in conventional CDs, facilitate the assembly of self&#8208;supporting films, and improve chiral optical expression. The full&#8208;color and white CPL are manipulated by simply adjusting the functional groups of the ligands, which also illustrates the versatility of the post&#8208;modification strategy. Finally, large chiral flexible films and multicolor chiral light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the stable chiral powder phosphors were constructed, thereby providing feasible materials and technical support for flexible 3D displays.

         <title>Rare Earth Er&#8208;Nd Dual Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts for Efficient Visible&#8208;light Induced CO2 Reduction to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual single atoms (SAs) catalyst Er3Nd1/CN is designed and synthesized by atomic confinement and coordination strategies, and exhibits record&#8208;level rates of 1761.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 987.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH in CO2 photoreduction. Synchrotron radiation, in&#8208;situ test, and density functional theory (DFT)calculations indicate that weaker *CO adsorption on the Nd tends to desorb and migrate to Er site for C&#8722;C coupling, which is the key to ethanol synthesis.







Abstract
Efficient synthesis of CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via photochemical CO2 reduction holds promise for achieving carbon neutrality but remains challenging. Here, we present rare earth dual single atoms (SAs) catalysts containing ErN6 and NdN6 moieties, fabricated via an atom&#8208;confinement and coordination method. The dual Er&#8722;Nd SAs catalysts exhibit unprecedented generation rates of 1761.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 987.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH, respectively. Through a combination of theoretical calculation, XAFS analysis, aberration&#8208;corrected HAADF&#8208;STEM, and in&#8208;situ FTIR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the Er SAs facilitate charge transfer, serving as active centers for C&#8722;C bond formation, while Nd SAs provide the necessary *CO for C&#8722;C coupling in C2H5OH synthesis under visible light. Furthermore, the experiment and DFT calculation elucidate that the variety of electronic states induced by 4&#8201;f orbitals of the Er SAs and the p&#8722;f orbital hybridization of Er&#8722;N moieties enable the formation of charge&#8208;transfer channel. Therefore, this study sheds light on the pivotal role of *CO adsorption in achieving efficient conversion from CO2 to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via a novel rare earth&#8208;based dual SAs photocatalysis approach.

         <title>Non&#8208;Natural MUC1 Glycopeptide Homogeneous Cancer Vaccine with Enhanced Immunogenicity and Therapeutic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically defined vaccine is prepared by combining the structural design of a non&#8208;natural glycopeptide antigen with a site&#8208;specific protein modification. The resulting vaccine, which contains a single copy of the antigen, is both prophylactically and therapeutically effective. Importantly, this approach refutes a prevailing dogma that glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent presentation of antigens.







Abstract
Glycopeptides derived from the glycoprotein mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) have shown potential as tumor&#8208;associated antigens for cancer vaccine development. However, their low immunogenicity and non&#8208;selective conjugation to carriers present significant challenges for the clinical efficacy of MUC1&#8208;based vaccines. Here, we introduce a novel vaccine candidate based on a structure&#8208;guided design of an artificial antigen derived from MUC1 glycopeptide. This engineered antigen contains two non&#8208;natural amino acids and has an &#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosidic bond, where sulfur replaces the conventional oxygen atom linking the peptide backbone to the sugar N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. The glycopeptide is then specifically conjugated to the immunogenic protein carrier CRM197 (Cross&#8208;Reactive Material 197), a protein approved for human use. Conjugation involves selective reduction and re&#8208;bridging of a disulfide in CRM197, allowing the attachment of a single copy of MUC1. This strategy results in a chemically defined vaccine while maintaining both the structural integrity and immunogenicity of the protein carrier. The vaccine elicits a robust Th1&#8208;like immune response in mice and generates antibodies capable of recognizing human cancer cells expressing tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. When tested in mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer, the vaccine is effective both as a prophylactic and therapeutic use, significantly delaying tumor growth. In therapeutic applications, improved outcomes were observed when the vaccine was combined with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) checkpoint inhibitor. Our strategy reduces batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability and enhances both immunogenicity and therapeutic potential. This site&#8208;specific approach disputes a prevailing dogma where glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent display of antigens.

&lt;p&gt;A chemically defined vaccine is prepared by combining the structural design of a non-natural glycopeptide antigen with a site-specific protein modification. The resulting vaccine, which contains a single copy of the antigen, is both prophylactically and therapeutically effective. Importantly, this approach refutes a prevailing dogma that glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent presentation of antigens.

&lt;p&gt;Glycopeptides derived from the glycoprotein mucin-1 (MUC1) have shown potential as tumor-associated antigens for cancer vaccine development.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting with a Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion Efficiency Exceeding 2&#8201;% through Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic overall water splitting system is successfully developed using I3&#8722;/I&#8722; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of PMA2PbI4/MoS2 as the H2 evolution photocatalyst and theWO3/RuOx as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductors is a promising approach for converting solar energy to clean energy. However, challenges such as sluggish water oxidation kinetics and limited light absorption of photocatalyst cause low solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH). Herein, we develop a photocatalytic overall water splitting system using I3&#8722;/I&#8722; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of benzylammonium lead iodide (PMA2PbI4, PMA=C6H5CH2NH2) loaded with MoS2 (PMA2PbI4/MoS2) as the H2 evolution photocatalyst, and the RuOx&#8208;loaded WO3 (WO3/RuOx) as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07&#8201;%. This work provides a detour route for photocatalytic water splitting with the help of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; shuttle redox couple in the halide perovskite HI splitting system and enlightens one to integrate and utilize multi catalytic strategies for solar&#8208;driven water splitting.

         <title>Pulsed EPR Methods in the Angstrom to Nanometre Scale Shed Light on the Conformational Flexibility of a Fluoride Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoride sensing riboswitch was investigated by EPR&#8208;based distance measurements. Electron&#8208;electron double resonance revealed preorganisation of the stem structures and conformational flexibility while electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance demonstrates low structural heterogeneity around the fluoride site and distinct differences between the crystal and solution structures.







Abstract
Riboswitches control gene regulation upon external stimuli such as environmental factors or ligand binding. The fluoride sensing riboswitch from Thermotoga petrophila is a complex regulatory RNA proposed to be involved in resistance to F&#8722; cytotoxicity. The details of structure and dynamics underpinning the regulatory mechanism are currently debated. Here we demonstrate that a combination of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR/EPR) spectroscopies, detecting distances in the angstrom to nanometre range, can probe distinct regions of conformational flexibility in this riboswitch. PELDOR (pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance) revealed a similar preorganisation of the sensing domain in three forms, i.e. the free aptamer, the Mg2+&#8208;bound apo, and the F&#8722;&#8208;bound holo form. 19F&#8197;ENDOR (electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance) was used to investigate the active site structure of the F&#8722;&#8208;bound holo form. Distance distributions without a priori structural information were compared with in silico modelling of spin label conformations based on the crystal structure. While PELDOR, probing the periphery of the RNA fold, revealed conformational flexibility of the RNA backbone, ENDOR indicated low structural heterogeneity at the ligand binding site. Overall, the combination of PELDOR and ENDOR with sub&#8208;angstrom precision gave insight into structural organisation and flexibility of a riboswitch, not easily attainable by other biophysical techniques.

         <title>Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation via Aniline&#8208;Decorated ZIF&#8208;8 Membrane: Lattice Rigidity Adjustment and Adsorption Site Introduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aperture flexibility of the metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) and the inherent weak adsorption ability of propylene can be tailored through the introduction of a guest molecule of aniline, encapsulated in the cavities of ZIF&#8208;8. The rigid Cm polymorph phase instead of the usual I_43&#8197;m phase of ZIF&#8208;8, along with the introduction of aniline as an adsorption site, enables the membrane good and stable C3H6/C3H8 separation.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes excel in molecular separation, attracting significant research interest. The crystallographic microstructure and selective adsorption capacity of MOFs closely correlate with their gas separation performance. Here, aniline was added to the ZIF&#8208;8 synthesis in varying concentrations. Aniline, encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 cavities, interacts strongly with the 2&#8208;methylimidazole linker, resulting in both a shift in crystallographic phase from I_43&#8197;m to Cm in Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the selective adsorption behavior between propylene and propane. Consequently, an aniline decorative ZIF&#8208;8 (Anix&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) membrane was prepared using a fast current&#8208;driven synthesis method, which exhibits good propylene/propane separation selectivity of up to 85. Calculation of the interaction energy between aniline and the various crystallographic phases of ZIF&#8208;8 using density functional theory (DFT) further verifies that aniline not only promotes the formation of crystallographic Cm phase, but also enhances the adsorption selectivity of propylene over propane. Aniline modification effectively tunes the crystallographic microstructure of ZIF&#8208;8, thereby, improving molecular sieving capabilities.

         <title>Metallic Impurities in Electrolysis: Catalytic Effect of Pb Traces in Reductive Amination and Acetone Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the reductive amination of acetone with methylamine as nitrogen source using electrochemistry revealed the catalytic activity of 1&#8197;ppm Pb. In addition, the effects of the applied potential and the cathode materials on the reaction were investigated. Finally, the results were transferred to the electrochemical hydrogenation of acetone.







Abstract
The electrochemical hydrogenation (e&#8208;hydrogenation) of unsaturated compounds like imines or carbonyls presents a benign reduction method. It enables direct use of electrons as reducing agent, water as proton source, while bypassing the need for elevated temperatures or pressures. In this contribution, we discuss the active species in electrocatalytic reductive amination with the transformation of acetone and methylamine as model reaction. Surprisingly, lead impurities in the ppm&#8208;range proved to possess a significant effect in e&#8208;hydrogenation. Accordingly, the influence of applied potential and cathode material in presence of 1&#8197;ppm Pb was investigated. Finally, we transferred the insights to the reduction of acetone manifesting comparable observations as for imine reduction. The results suggest that previous studies on electrochemical reduction in the presence of lead electrodes should be re&#8208;evaluated.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Ball Milling Enables an Ultra&#8208;Fast Wittig Olefination Under Ambient and Solvent&#8208;free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a protocol for a solvent&#8208;free mechanically induced Wittig olefination under ambient conditions often without the need of ylide pre&#8208;formation with a 30&#8197;seconds reaction time under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions.







Abstract
30&#8197;Seconds to success!&#8212;The Wittig reaction, a fundamental and extensively utilized reaction in organic chemistry, enables the efficient conversion of carbonyl compounds to olefins using phosphonium salts. Traditionally, meticulous reaction setup, including the pre&#8208;formation of a reactive ylide species via deprotonation of a phosphonium salt, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;yielding reactions under classical solution&#8208;based conditions. In this report, we present an unprecedented protocol for an ultra&#8208;fast mechanically induced Wittig reaction under solvent&#8208;free and ambient conditions, often eliminating the need for tedious ylide pre&#8208;formation under strict air and moisture exclusion. A range of aldehydes and ketones were reacted with diverse phosphonium salts under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions, frequently giving access to the respective olefins in only 30&#8197;seconds.

         <title>Exploring Aqueous Solution&#8208;Processed Pseudohalide Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Ferroelectrics toward X&#8208;Ray Detection with High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;temperature hybrid pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskite (HPREDP) ferroelectric was obtained by rationally designed. Further, we explored application of HPREDP ferroelectric in X&#8208;ray detection, and achieved the highest sensitivity of 1307&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (among all hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors).







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskites (PREDPs) have garnered significant attention for their versatile physical properties, including ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, large piezoelectric responses, and circularly polarized luminescence. However, their potential for X&#8208;ray detection remains unexplored, and the low Curie temperature (TC) limits the performance window for PREDP ferroelectrics. Here, by applying the chemical regulation strategies involving halogen substitution on the organic cation and Rb/Cs substitution to the PREDP [(R)&#8208;M3HQ]2RbEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;M3HQ=(R)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] with a low TC of 285&#8197;K, a novel 3D PREDP ferroelectric [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ=(R)&#8208;N&#8208;chloromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] are successfully synthesized, for which the TC reaches 344&#8197;K. More importantly, such a strategy endowed [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 with notable X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Centimeter&#8208;sized [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 single crystals fabricated from aqueous solutions demonstrated a sensitivity of 1307&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detectable dose rate of 152&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, the highest sensitivity reported for hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors. This work positions PREDPs as promising candidates for the next generation of eco&#8208;friendly optoelectronic materials and also offers substantial insights into the interaction between structure, composition, and functionality in ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Brush&#8208;Like Polymeric Gels Enabled Photonic Crystals toward Ultrasensitive Cosolvent Chromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) was constructed by using the assembled ZnS@SiO2 nanoparticles as a photonic crystal template and in situ polymerizing oligo ethylene glycol acrylate. Owing to the cosolvency&#8208;induced incremental stretching of acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol side&#8208;chains in ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, the prepared BPPG exhibited sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) exhibit dynamic chromism upon trigger by various solvents, showing potential applications in qualitative identification and quantitative analysis of multicomponent solvents. However, distinguishing similar solvents, especially traces of cosolvents, remains challenging due to the limited sensitivity of RPCs. To address this, we herein introduce brush&#8208;like polymeric gels inside photonic crystals, forming a brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) that can trace tiny component changes. In this BPPG system, the acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol (PEG) side&#8208;chains stretch incrementally due to the cosolvency of ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, resulting in highly sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations. With water content varying slightly from 0 to 1&#8197;vol&#8201;%, the reflection wavelength of BPPG can sharply redshift over 30&#8197;nm, leading to very noticeable changes in structural color. This enhanced sensitivity makes BPPG suitable for real&#8208;time, in situ purity monitoring of absolute ethanol during storage, transportation, and other applications.

         <title>Atomic Printing Strategy Achieves Precise Anchoring of Dual&#8208;Copper Atoms on C2N Structure for Efficient CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully develop a universal atomic imprinting synthesis strategy for the preparation of dual&#8208;atom catalysts, with a particular focus on the synthesis of a dual&#8208;atom Cu catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene. The dual&#8208;atom copper catalyst developed in this research exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance, achieving a remarkable 71.7&#8201;% ethylene Faradaic efficiency at an applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs RHE.







Abstract
Isolated metal sites catalysts (IMSCs) play crucial role in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with potential industrial applications. However, tunable synthesis strategies for IMSCs are limited. Herein, we present an atomic printing strategy that draws inspiration from the ancient Chinese &#8220;movable&#8208;type printing technology&#8221;. Selecting customizable combinations of metal atoms as metal precursors from an extensive binuclear metal library.

&lt;p&gt;We successfully develop a universal atomic imprinting synthesis strategy for the preparation of dual-atom catalysts, with a particular focus on the synthesis of a dual-atom Cu catalyst for the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to ethylene. The dual-atom copper catalyst developed in this research exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance, achieving a remarkable 71.7&#8201;% ethylene Faradaic efficiency at an applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; RHE.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolated metal sites catalysts (IMSCs) play crucial role in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, with potential industrial applications. However, tunable synthesis strategies for IMSCs are limited. Herein, we present an atomic printing strategy that draws inspiration from the ancient Chinese &#8220;movable-type printing technology&#8221;. Selecting customizable combinations of metal atoms as metal precursors from an extensive binuclear metal library. A series of dual-atom catalysts were prepared by utilizing the edge nitrogen atoms in the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N cavity as anchoring &#8220;pincers&#8221; to capture metal atoms. To prove utility, the dual atom catalyst Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N is investigated as electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR catalyst. The synergistic interaction of dual Cu atoms promotes C&#8722;C coupling and guarantees FE&lt;sub&gt;C2+&lt;/sub&gt; (90.8&#8201;%) and FE&lt;sub&gt;C2H4&lt;/sub&gt;. (71.7&#8201;%) at &#8722;1.10&#8197;V vs RHE. DFT calculations revealed the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; site would be subtly flipped during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR for enhancing *CO adsorption and dimerization.

         <title>Quantifying the Hydration&#8208;Dependent Dynamics of Cu Migration and Activity in Zeolite Omega for the Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega's (Cu&#8208;omega) activity in partial methane oxidation via oxygen looping significantly varies with the conditions applied. Using primarily in situ anomalous x&#8208;ray powder diffraction (AXRPD) the source of this divergent behavior is revealed to be due to a migration of Cu throughout the framework, which in turn is predominantly controlled by the system's degree of hydration.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega) is a potent material for the selective conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) via the oxygen looping approach. However, its performance exhibits substantial variation depending on the operational conditions. Under an isothermal temperature regime, Cu&#8208;omega demonstrates subdued activity below 230&#8201;&#176;C, but experiences a remarkable increase in activity at 290&#8201;&#176;C. Applying a high&#8208;temperature activation protocol at 450&#8201;&#176;C causes a rapid deactivation of the material. This behavioral divergence is investigated by combining reactivity studies, neutron diffraction and in situ high&#8208;resolution anomalous X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (HR&#8208;AXRPD), as well as electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, to reveal that the migration of Cu throughout the framework is the primary cause of these behaviors, which in turn is predominantly governed by the degree of hydration of the system. This work suggests that control over the Cu migration throughout the zeolite framework may be harnessed to significantly increase the activity of Cu&#8208;omega by generating more active sites for the MtM conversion. These results underscore the power of in situ HR&#8208;AXRPD for unraveling the behavior of materials under reaction conditions and suggest that a re&#8208;evaluation of Cu&#8208;zeolites priorly deemed inactive for the MtM conversion across a broader range of conditions and looping protocols may be warranted.

We report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold.







Abstract
The synthesis of diradical organic compounds has garnered significant attention due to their thermally accessible spin inversion and optoelectronic properties. Yet, preparing such stable structures with high open&#8208;shell behavior remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold. Incorporation of dithiafulvene units at each end of the molecule (at the five&#8208;membered rings) furnishes extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) undergoing reversible oxidations to the radical cation and diradical dication. The various pro&#8208;aromatic structures presented herein show highly localized spin density and a limited conjugation due to the confined &#960;&#8208;electrons in the aromatic cycles, as supported by 1H NMR, UV/Visible, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Measuring Kinetics under Vibrational Strong Coupling: Testing for a Change in the Nucleophilicity of Water and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) is reported to modify chemical reactivity, but its mode of action is not understood. Here, we provide a methodology using fixed&#8208;width optical cavities for measuring kinetics under VSC in a reproducible way. The large kinetic dataset showed that VSC does not substantially alter the nucleophilicity of alcohols.







Abstract
Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) has been reported to change the rate of organic reactions. However, a lack of convenient and reliable methods to measure reaction kinetics under VSC makes it challenging to obtain mechanistic insight into its influence, hindering progress in the field. Here, we use recently developed fixed&#8208;width optical cavities to obtain large kinetic datasets under VSC with small errors (&#177;1&#8211;5&#8201;%) in an operationally simple manner using UV/Vis spectroscopy. The setup is used to test whether VSC changes a fundamental kinetic property of polar reactions, nucleophilicity, for water and alcohols, species commonly used in VSC&#8208;modified chemistry. We determined the rate constants for nucleophilic capture with a library of benzhydrilium ions as reference electrophiles with and without strong coupling of the nucleophile's key vibrations. For all investigated combinations of electrophiles and nucleophiles, only minor changes in the observed rate constants of the reactions were observed independently of the coupled bands. These results indicate that VSC does not substantially alter the nucleophilicity of water and alcohols, suggesting that polar reactions are modified through other, presently unknown mechanisms. Fixed&#8208;width cavities allow for convenient and reproducible UV/Vis kinetics, facilitating mechanistic studies of VSC&#8208;modified chemistry.

         <title>Individually Tunable Energy Levels of Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers based on electron&#8208;accepting double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit with individually tunable energy levels were developed. This unique energy level tuning is attributed to the separation of LUMO and HOMO at the atomic scale of the BNBP unit and the different contributions of charge transfer transitions in the excited states.







Abstract
Opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance of organic semiconductors are mainly determined by energy levels of their frontier molecular orbitals, e.g. lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) in the ground state, first singlet state (ES1) and first triplet state (ET1) in the excited state. These energy levels are always intricately intertwined. Herein, we report a series of monodisperse oligomers based on double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) units. With the increasing number of repeating units, the oligomers exhibit gradually downshifted ELUMO and nearly unchanged EHOMO due to the different distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the oligomers. Moreover, the oligomers exhibit gradually decreasing ES1 and nearly unchanged ET1 because of the different contributions of the charge transfer component in the excited state. This work provides new insight into energy level tuning of organic semiconductors, which is important for high&#8208;performance organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.

&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt;) in the excited state. These energy levels are always intricately intertwined. Herein, we report a series of monodisperse oligomers based on double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) units. With the increasing number of repeating units, the oligomers exhibit gradually downshifted &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;LUMO&lt;/sub&gt; and nearly unchanged &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;HOMO&lt;/sub&gt; due to the different distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the oligomers. Moreover, the oligomers exhibit gradually decreasing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; and nearly unchanged &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt; because of the different contributions of the charge transfer component in the excited state. This work provides new insight into energy level tuning of organic semiconductors, which is important for high-performance organic opto-electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing d/p&#8208;2&#960;* Orbitals Hybridization via Strain Engineering for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>

Lattice strain regulates the orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics.







Abstract
The photoconversion of CO2 into valuable chemical products using solar energy is a promising strategy to address both energy and environmental challenges. However, the strongly adsorbed CO2 frequently impedes the seamless advancement of the subsequent reaction by significantly increasing the reaction activation energy. Here, we present a BiFeO3 material with lattice strain that collaboratively regulates the d/p&#8208;2&#960;* orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics. Quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculation reveals that the optimized Fe sites enhance the adsorption and activation effect of CO2, and continuous internal electrons are rapidly transferred to the reaction sites and injected into the surface *CO2 and *COOH under the condition of illumination, which promotes the rapid formation and stability of *COOH. Certainly, the performance of CO2 photoreduction to CO is improved by 12.81&#8208;fold compared with the base material. This work offers a new perspective for the rapid photoreduction process of strongly adsorbed CO2.

Tryptophan nitration chemistry of an economically impactful heme enzyme, TxtE, has been modeled utilizing synthetic heme mimics by Sam&#8197;P. de&#8197;Visser, Gayan&#8197;B. Wijeratne et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409430). Therein, spectroscopic and theoretical characterizations strongly suggest the occurrence of a heme peroxynitrite active species, closely paralleling mechanistic propositions put forward for TxtE enzyme. Precise mechanistic details and key structure&#8211;activity relationships present important findings to be implemented in next generation therapeutic and synthetic applications.

Wijeratne et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202409430"&gt;e202409430&lt;/a&gt;). Therein, spectroscopic and theoretical characterizations strongly suggest the occurrence of a heme peroxynitrite active species, closely paralleling mechanistic propositions put forward for TxtE enzyme. Precise mechanistic details and key structure&#8211;activity relationships present important findings to be implemented in next generation therapeutic and synthetic applications.

         <title>Reactivity Inside Molecular Flasks: Acceleration Modes and Types of Selectivity Obtainable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular flasks are hollow supramolecular structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions, often exhibiting complex catalytic mechanisms and selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. This Review discusses the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, and showcases the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through their use, focusing on examples relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe this summary will facilitate the design and development of novel catalysis examples inside molecular flasks







Abstract
There is increasing interest in the discovery and application of molecular flasks&#8211;supramolecular host structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions. Reminiscent of enzymes due to possessing a host cavity akin to an active site, molecular flasks can exhibit complex catalytic mechanisms and in many cases provide selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. In this Review, we aim to organize the increasingly diverse examples through a two&#8208;part structure. In part one, we provide an overview of the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, while in part two we showcase, through selected examples, the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through the use of molecular flasks. Particular attention is given to examples that are relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe that this structure makes the field more approachable and thus will stimulate the development of novel applications of molecular flasks.

         <title>Celebrating Ten Years of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Solar Energy Conversion: Past, Present and Future</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the first report of covalent organic frameworks as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 2014, a new type of &#8220;soft photocatalyst&#8221; was released. Here, a historical overview as well as the current state of the art and future perspectives on various photocatalytic reactions including CO2 reduction (CO2RR), overall water splitting, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction (ORR), and alcohol oxidation, are given.







Abstract
Accelerated anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases due to increasing energy demands has created a negative impact on our planet. Therefore, the replacement of fossil by renewable energy resources has become of paramount interest, both societally and scientifically. It is within this setting that organic photocatalysts have emerged as a new generation of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the conversion of solar radiation into chemical energy. In 2014, the first example of a covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction was reported by our group, which has not only marked the beginning of COF photocatalysis for solar fuel production but also helped to accelerate research into &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221; based on porous polymers in general. In the last decade, significant progress has been made toward developing COFs as robust, molecularly precise platforms emulating artificial photosynthesis. This mini&#8208;review commemorates the 10th anniversary of COF photocatalysis and gives a brief historical overview of the milestones in the field since its inception in 2014. We review milestones in the development of COFs for solar fuel production and related photocatalytic transformations, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, overall water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction, and alcohol oxidation. We discuss lessons learned for the design of structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in COF photocatalysts, and future perspectives and challenges for the field of &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221; are given.

         <title>Disorder Over Pore Size: Boosting Supercapacitor Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a recent study, Forse and co&#8208;workers show that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. This discovery provides a new direction for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors, guiding the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials.







Abstract
The urgent need for efficient energy storage systems has spotlighted supercapacitors and nanostructured porous carbon materials. These materials require structural optimization to enhance their performance and lifespan, necessitating advanced design and synthesis techniques. In a recent publication, Forse and co&#8208;workers reveal that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances their capacitance performance, suggesting that optimizing structural disorder is key to developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors. This study innovatively shows that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. The investigation of multiple nanoporous carbons from a range of different suppliers showcases the generalizability of the findings. Annealing treatment further confirms that the capacitance enhancement is due to structural disorder. This discovery guides the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials, providing a new direction for the future development of supercapacitors.

         <title>dGAE(297&#8211;391) Tau Fragment Promotes Formation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy&#8208;Like Tau Filaments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro methods for obtaining disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates of the microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau are needed for diagnostics and drug development against tauopathies. We show that the chronic traumatic encephalopathy type II fold can be propagated onto full&#8208;length tau by seeding the aggregation with the tau fragment dGAE. The work brings us closer to in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific tau filament types.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau forms disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates in several different neurodegenerative diseases. In order to understand how tau undergoes misfolding into a specific filament type and to control this process for drug development purposes, it is crucial to study in vitro tau aggregation methods and investigate the structures of the obtained filaments at the atomic level. Here, we used the tau fragment dGAE, which aggregates spontaneously, to seed the formation of full&#8208;length tau filaments. The structures of dGAE and full&#8208;length tau filaments were investigated by magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR, showing that dGAE allows propagation of a chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)&#8208;like fold to the full&#8208;length tau. The obtained filaments efficiently seeded tau aggregation in HEK293T cells. This work demonstrates that in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific types of full&#8208;length tau filaments is feasible.

         <title>Fused Aromatic and Antiaromatic Smaragdyrin Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singly linked and fused dimers were synthesized for aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex and antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base. The fused dimers show larger electronic interactions but the respective antiaromatic and aromatic characters are well preserved.







Abstract
Singly&#8208;linked aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the reductive coupling of 16&#8208;brominated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, which was oxidized to a stable diradical with PbO2. As the first example of fused smaragdyrin dimer, a fused [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the oxidation of a CuCl&#8208;BF2 complex dimer with FeCl3 and subsequent reduction with NaBH4. After removal of the BF2 group, the singly&#8208;linked and fused aromatic dimers were oxidized to the corresponding antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base dimers. The first oxidation and reduction potentials of these dimers are split depending upon the intramolecular electronic interactions, which are larger for the fused dimers. Despite the large electronic interactions, the aromatic and antiaromatic characters are well preserved in the fused dimers.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Doping in Robust Open&#8208;Shell Ladder&#8208;Type Oligoaniline Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;doping mechanism is introduced in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. This mechanism, facilitated by resonance&#8208;assisted proton transfer, enables efficient self&#8208;doping of the organic electronic compound, resulting in a durable conductive material without the need for an external dopant. The findings open new possibilities for creating organic conductors that are both high&#8208;performing and long&#8208;lasting.







Abstract
A novel resonance&#8208;assisted self&#8208;doping mechanism has been demonstrated in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. The new class of compounds has a unique structure incorporating acidic phenolic hydroxyl groups into the ladder&#8208;type cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diimine core, enabling efficient resonance&#8208;assisted proton transfer and electronic doping without the need for external dopants. Mechanistic and computational studies confirm the open&#8208;shell, zwitterionic nature of the self&#8208;doped state and the significant role played by the dielectric environment. This new self&#8208;doping mechanism allows for higher stability and durability in the material&#8216;s electronic performance. The self&#8208;doped form retains durability under harsh conditions and maintains its properties over extended periods of time.

         <title>Mechanistically Different Mechanochromophores Enable Calibration and Validation of Molecular Forces in Glassy Polymers and Elastomeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers with covalently incorporated donor&#8208;acceptor torsional springs allow for real&#8208;time monitoring of forces, that are calibrated using known spiropyran mechanophores. This concept is demonstrated using glassy, entangled polymers and elastomeric networks.







Abstract
Sterically distorted donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;systems, termed DA springs, can be progressively planarized under mechanical load causing a bathochromic shift of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. By combining theory and experiment, we here use a simple linear force calibration for two different conformational mechanochromophores to determine molecular forces in polymers from the mechanochromic shift in PL wavelength during multiple uniaxial tensile tests. Two systems are used, i) a highly entangled linear glassy polyphenylene and ii) a covalent elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane network. The mean forces estimated by this method are validated using known threshold forces for the mechanochemical ring&#8208;opening reactions of two different spiropyran force probes. The agreement between both approaches underlines that these DA springs provide the unique opportunity for the online monitoring of local molecular forces present in diverse polymer matrices.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Characterization of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Hyponitrite Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Hyponitrite Reactivity: The Fe&#8208;hyponitrite complex 3 was generated from preformed hyponitrite and characterized by spectroscopic methods and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Upon protonation or oxidation, quantitative N2O formation occurs. Lewis acidity of iron plays a key role in reactivity, as a more Lewis acidic iron center leads to the cleavage of the N=N bond of hyponitrite.







Abstract
Flavodiiron NO reductases (FNORs) are important enzymes in microbial pathogenesis, as they equip microbes with resistance to the human immune defense agent nitric oxide (NO). Despite many efforts, intermediates that would provide insight into how the non&#8208;heme diiron active sites of FNORs reduce NO to N2O could not be identified. Computations predict that iron&#8208;hyponitrite complexes are the key species, leading from NO to N2O. However, the coordination chemistry of non&#8208;heme iron centers with hyponitrite is largely unknown. In this study, we report the reactivity of two non&#8208;heme iron complexes with preformed hyponitrite. In the case of [Fe(TPA)(CH3CN)2](OTf)2, cleavage of hyponitrite and formation of an Fe2(NO)2 diamond core is observed. With less Lewis&#8208;acidic [Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2(OTf)2] (2), reaction with Na2N2O2 in polar aprotic solvent leads to the formation of a red complex, 3. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that 3 is a tetranuclear iron&#8208;hyponitrite complex, [{Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2}2(&#956;&#8208;N2O2)](OTf)2, with a unique hyponitrite binding mode. This species provided the unique opportunity to us to study the interaction of hyponitrite with non&#8208;heme iron centers and the reactivity of the bound hyponitrite ligand. Here, either protonation or oxidation of 3 is found to induce N2O formation, supporting the hypothesis that hyponitrite is a viable intermediate in NO reduction.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Lithium Pyrocarbonate (Li2[C2O5]) and Lithium Hydrogen Pyrocarbonate (Li[HC2O5])</title>

Li[HC2O5] is the first hydrogen&#8208;containing pyrocarbonate. It was synthesized by a reaction of CO2 and H2O with Li2[CO3] at moderate pressures and temperatures together with an anhydrous lithium pyrocarbonate (Li2[C2O5]) in a DAC. The crystal structure was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and confirmed by DFT&#8208;based calculations. The structure refinement and DFT calculations show that in Li[HC2O5] a symmetric hydrogen bond is present in the hydrogenated pyrocarbonate anion [HC2O5]&#8722;.

         <title>An Aza&#8208;Prilezhaev&#8208;Based Method for Inversion of Regioselectivity in Stereospecific Alkene 1,2&#8208;Aminohydroxylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under acidic conditions (TFA) and in the presence of water, BocNHOTs promotes stereospecific 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylations of alkenes. The processes involve intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by water. This reagent combination provides regiochemical outcomes that are opposite to those observed using epoxidation initiation 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylation protocols. The reaction platform enables other classes of alkene 1,2&#8208;aminofunctionalization, and intramolecular processes are also feasible, including unusual variants that evoke azabicyclobutane reactivity.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymers for Highly Specific Bioorthogonal Catalysis Inside Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a copper center and specific substrate binding domain, could perform highly&#8208;specific abiotic transformation inside cells, particularly in a gain&#8208;of&#8208;functions. Importantly, Cu&#8208;MIEs exclusively catalyze target substrates and retain its superb performance even in the presence of copper&#8208;poisoning molecules like glutathione (GSH).







Abstract
Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal catalysis expand the chemical possibilities within cells. Developing synthetic TMCs tools that emulate the efficiency and specificity of natural metalloenzymes is a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. Here, we highlight the potential of molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a Cu center and specific substrate binding domain, for conducing dimethylpropargyloxycarbonyl (DmProc) cleavage reactions within cells. Our studies reveal that the Cu&#8208;MIEs act as highly specific guides, precisely catalyzing target substrates, even in glutathione (GSH)&#8208;rich cellular environments. By adapting templates similar to the target substrates, we evolved Cu&#8208;MIEs activity to a high level and provided a method to broaden its scope to other unique substrates. This system was applied to a thyroid hormone (T3)&#8208;responsive gene switch model, inducing firefly luciferase expression by T3 in cells. This approach verifies that MIEs effectively rescue DmProc&#8208;bearing T3 prodrugs and seamlessly integrating themself into cellular biocatalytic networks.

Azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable inverse agonists of the retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptor &#947; (ROR&#947;) enable optical control of gene expression mediated by this important nuclear hormone receptor, with excellent potency and selectivity.







Abstract
Retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptor &#947; (ROR&#947;) is a nuclear hormone receptor with multiple biological functions in circadian clock regulation, inflammation, and immunity. Its cyclic temporal role in circadian rhythms, and cell&#8208;specific activity in the immune system, make it an intriguing target for spatially and temporally localised pharmacology. To create tools that can study ROR&#947; biology with appropriate spatiotemporal resolution, we designed light&#8208;dependent inverse ROR&#947; agonists by building azobenzene photoswitches into ligand consensus structures. Optimizations gave photoswitchable ROR&#947; inhibitors combining a large degree of potency photocontrol, with remarkable on&#8208;target potency, and excellent selectivity over related off&#8208;target receptors. This still rare combination of performance features distinguishes them as high quality photopharmaceutical probes, which can now serve as high precision tools to study the spatial and dynamic intricacies of ROR&#947; action in signaling and in inflammatory disorders.

         <title>Hydroaminoalkylation for Amine Functionalization of Vinyl&#8208;Terminated Polyethylene Enables Direct Access to Responsive Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a novel method for producing functionalized polyethylenes (PEs) via a 100&#8201;% atom economic tantalum&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyethylene (VTPE). Our approach addresses current synthetic challenges by enabling the efficient incorporation of amine functionalities into crystalline PEs in the melt phase. These functional materials have diverse potential applications and here we show that aminated PEs exhibit enhanced material properties, and pH responsive properties results in antibacterial PE films.







Abstract
While functionalized polyethylenes (PEs) exhibit valuable characteristics, the constraints of existing synthetic approaches limit the variety of readily incorporated functionality. New methods to generate functionalized PEs are required to afford new applications of this common material. We report 100&#8201;% atom economic tantalum&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyethylene (VTPE) as a method to produce amine&#8208;terminated PE. VTPEs with molecular weights between 2200&#8211;16800&#8197;g/mol are successfully aminated using solvent&#8208;free conditions. Our catalytic system is efficient for the installation of both aromatic and aliphatic amines, and can be carried out on multigram scale. The associating amine functional groups afford modified material properties, as measured by water contact angle, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polymer rheology. The basic amine functionality offers the opportunity to convert inert PE into stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, such that the protonation of aminated PE affords the generation of functional antibacterial PE films.

         <title>Dynamic Asymmetric Diamination of Allylic Alcohols through Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis: Diastereo&#8208;Divergent Synthesis of Tetrahydrobenzodiazepines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein an unprecedented, catalytic enantioconvergent diamination of racemic allylic alcohols with the construction of two C&#8722;N bonds and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. This iridium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalytic system operates through an atom&#8208;economical borrowing hydrogen amination/aza&#8208;Michael cascade, and converts readily available phenylenediamines and racemic allylic alcohols to 1,5&#8208;tetrahydrobenzodiazepines in high enantioselectivity. An intriguing solvent&#8208;dependent switch of diastereoselectivity was also observed.

         <title>Rapid Thermal Drying Synthesis of Nonthiolated Spherical Nucleic Acids with Stability Rivaling Thiolated DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By thermal drying, highly stable spherical nucleic acids with a high DNA density were synthesized using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on gold nanoparticles. Applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensors.







Abstract
Attaching DNA oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to prepare spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) has offered tremendous insights into surface chemistry with resulting bioconjugates serving as critical reagents in biosensors and nanotechnology. While thiolated DNA is generally required to achieve stable conjugates, we herein communicate that using a thermal drying method, a high DNA density and excellent SNA stability was achieved using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA such as surviving 1&#8197;M NaCl, 2 month stability in 0.3&#8197;M NaCl and working in 50&#8201;% serum. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on AuNPs. By side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison with the salt&#8208;aging method, the conjugation mechanism was attributed to competitive adenine adsorption at high temperature along with an extremely high DNA concentration upon drying. Bioanalytical applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensor platforms, facilitating cost&#8208;effective applications for SNAs.

         <title>Syntheses of Tungsten Imido Cyclohexylidene Complexes Using Perfluoro&#8208;t&#8208;Butanol or Hexafluoro&#8208;t&#8208;Butanol as Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metathesis&#8208;active W(NR)(C6H10)(ORF9)2 (C6H10=cyclohexylidene) complexes are available in three steps (tungsten oxides&#8594;W(NR)2Cl2&#8594;W(NR)2Cy2&#8594;W(NR)(C6H10)(ORF9)2) without making alkylidene intermediates and without using strong acids. The bisnonafluoro&#8208;t&#8208;butoxide alkylidene complexes can be converted readily into bisalkoxide, bispyrrolide, and MAP complexes through nucleophilic substitutions. Cyclohexylidene complexes appear to be more readily prepared than neophylidene complexes, perhaps in part because any cyclohexene complex formed through &#946; hydrogen abstraction is isomerized to a cyclohexylidene complex by RF9OH. This mild acid&#8208;catalyzed approach is an attractive alternative to established syntheses of tungsten neopentylidene or neophylidene imido complexes.







Abstract
The fluorinated alcohols, (CF3)3COH (RF9OH) and (CF3)2MeCOH (RF6OH), react with W(NR)2Cy2 (Cy=Cyclohexyl; R=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl or 1&#8208;adamantyl) in C6D6 at 55&#8201;&#176;C to give cyclohexylidene complexes. Traditional routes to terminal alkylidene complexes (neopentylidene or neophylidene) have used either triflic acid or HCl (rarely), but relatively weak fluorinated acids are sufficient and active bisalkoxide catalysts are therefore prepared directly. An &#945; hydrogen abstraction reaction to give a cyclohexylidene complex from a biscyclohexyl complex appears to be as facile as &#945; hydrogen abstraction to give a neopentylidene or neophylidene ligand, but isomerization of a cyclohexene formed through &#946; hydrogen abstraction is also a possibility. The ORF9 ligands can be replaced readily with dimethylpyrrolide (Me2Pyr) or other more basic alkoxides. Single crystal X&#8208;ray studies were carried out on W(NAr)2Cy2, W(NAr)(ORF9)2(C6H10)(ArNH2), W(NAr)(ORF6)2(C6H10)(ArNH2), W(NAd)(ORF9)2(C6H10)(AdNH2), W(NAr)(O&#8208;i&#8208;PrF6)3Cy, and W(NAd)(&#951;1&#8208;Me2Pyr)2(C6H10) (C6H10=cyclohexylidene).

&lt;p&gt;The fluorinated alcohols, (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COH (R&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt;OH) and (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MeCOH (R&lt;sub&gt;F6&lt;/sub&gt;OH), react with W(NR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Cy=Cyclohexyl; R=2,6-diisopropylphenyl or 1-adamantyl) in C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; at 55&#8201;&#176;C to give cyclohexylidene complexes. Traditional routes to terminal alkylidene complexes (neopentylidene or neophylidene) have used either triflic acid or HCl (rarely), but relatively weak fluorinated acids are sufficient and active bisalkoxide catalysts are therefore prepared directly. An &#945; hydrogen abstraction reaction to give a cyclohexylidene complex from a biscyclohexyl complex appears to be as facile as &#945; hydrogen abstraction to give a neopentylidene or neophylidene ligand, but isomerization of a cyclohexene formed through &#946; hydrogen abstraction is also a possibility. The OR&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt; ligands can be replaced readily with dimethylpyrrolide (Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pyr) or other more basic alkoxides. Single crystal X-ray studies were carried out on W(NAr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, W(NAr)(OR&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)(ArNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), W(NAr)(OR&lt;sub&gt;F6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)(ArNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), W(NAd)(OR&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)(AdNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), W(NAr)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr&lt;sub&gt;F6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cy, and W(NAd)(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pyr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;=cyclohexylidene).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically Stable Diazo Peptides as Selective Probes of Cysteine Proteases in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diazo group is an interesting tool in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology due to its selective and versatile reactivity. We show that chemically stable diazo peptides, which even tolerate 95&#8201;% trifluoroacetic acid, can be generated and used as high&#8208;precision chemical tools.







Abstract
Diazo peptides have been described earlier, however, due to their high reactivity have not been broadly used until today. Here, we report the preparation, properties, and applications of chemically stable internal diazo peptides. Peptidyl phosphoranylidene&#8208;esters and amides were found to react with triflyl azide primarily to novel 3,4&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl&#8208;peptides. Nonaflyl azide instead furnished diazo peptides, which are chemically stable from pH&#8197;1&#8211;14 as amides and from pH&#8197;1&#8211;8 as esters. Thus, diazo peptides prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis were stable to final deprotection with 95&#8201;% trifluoroacetic acid. Diazo peptides with the recognition sequence of caspase&#8208;3 were identified as specific, covalent, and irreversible inhibitors of this enzyme at low nanomolar concentrations. A fluorescent diazo peptide entered living cells enabling microscopic imaging and quantification of apoptotic cells via flow cytometry. Thus, internal diazo peptides constitute a novel class of activity&#8208;based probes and enzyme inhibitors useful in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Optical Control of AMPA Glutamate Receptors with a Photoswitchable Tethered Antagonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
AMPA receptors are central to excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain but difficult to control with sufficient precision. We developed MP&#8208;GluAblock, a cell specific light&#8208;controllable AMPAR blocker that consists of a photo&#8208;switchable compound (P) that is targeted to specific cells via an expressed membrane&#8208;anchor protein (M). Our approach could be used to dissect AMPAR signaling with unprecedented cellular and spatiotemporal specificity.







Abstract
AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are the main drivers of excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the brain, central to synaptic plasticity, and are key drug targets. However, AMPARs are expressed in virtually every neuron in the central nervous system and are activated with complex temporal dynamics, making it difficult to determine their functional roles with sufficient precision. Here we describe a cell specific, light&#8208;controllable competitive antagonist for the AMPA receptor called MP&#8208;GluAblock that combines the temporal precision of a photo&#8208;switchable ligand with the spatial and cellular specificity of a genetically&#8208;encoded membrane&#8208;anchor protein. This tool could pave the way for controlling endogenous AMPARs in neural circuits with cellular, spatial, and temporal specificity.

         <title>Electron Deficiency is More Important than Conductivity in C&#8722;N Coupling for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for direct urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites with electrochemical reduction tolerance by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. The vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species was disclosed.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for waste upgrading and urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. In situ Raman spectroscopy identified the existence of electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites and was able to withstand electrochemical reduction conditions. Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations disclosed the vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species. The electron&#8208;deficient Cu displayed a high urea yield rate of 255.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent electrochemical durability, superior than that of non&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient counterpart with conductive carbon material as the support. It can be concluded that the regulation of site electronic structure is more important than the optimization of catalyst conductive properties in the C&#8722;N coupling reactions.

         <dc:description>
Remarkable properties have been predicted for cubic graphite, a hypothetical 3D carbon allotrope composed of carbon cages (C48). A sixty carbons fragment of cubic graphite, benzofused (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208;tris(tribenzo[8]annulene) (TTBA), was now assembled by K+&#8208;mediated cyclotrimerization of tribenzoCOTyne, that contains 36&#8197;carbon atoms properly arranged in a well&#8208;defined cubic graphite cage (C48).







Abstract
A remarkable stereodivergent cyclotrimerization of 9,10&#8208;didehydrotribenzo[8]annulene (tribenzoCOTyne) to the corresponding (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208; and (&#945;,&#945;,&#946;)&#8208;benzofused derivatives has been developed by controlling the reaction conditions. While the K+&#8208;mediated cyclotrimerization afforded the (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer, using Pd as a catalyst resulted in the (&#945;,&#945;,&#946;)&#8208;derivative. Both stereoisomers were evidenced by spectroscopic data and crystal X&#8208;Ray analysis. The (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer is a fragment of cubic graphite (CG), an elusive 3D carbon allotrope that contains carbon cages, since all of its sixty carbons are part of the structure of CG, and 36&#8197;constitute a part of the C48 molecular cage of CG. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies revealed that the potassium ion would play a key role as a template to favor the formation of the (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer.
