         <title>Engineering Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer to Break Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;off of Oxygen Electroreduction Catalysts for Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are regarded as effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, integrating high active and long&#8208;term durability on SACs is still challenging due to the severe limitations of activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Herein, we report an integrative electrocatalyst combining isolated Fe sites and MoC nanoparticles (MoC/Fe&#8208;NC). MoC nanoparticles accelerate ORR kinetics via the proton&#8208;feeding effect and optimize Fe site microstructure. Thus, MoC/Fe&#8208;NC exhibits a high alkaline ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.916 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, and exceptional durability of 50k cycles with 5 mV E1/2 loss. The observed ORR performance is further verified in a zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) with a high peak power density of 316 mW cm&#8722;2 and operational stability over 1000 h. Moreover, the fabricated temperature&#8208;adaptive quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB can cycle stably for 150 h under alternating temperatures. Theory calculations and experiment characterizations, involving scanning electrochemical microscopy techniques and distribution of relaxation times analysis, reveal that the excellent capabilities of MoC/Fe&#8208;NC arise from accelerated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, weakened *OH adsorption, and strengthened Fe&#8722;N bonds fueled by MoC nanoparticles. This work sheds light on breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off barrier of SACs for energy&#8208;conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Single Atom Copper Catalyst as a Redox Mediator in the Cathodic Reduction of Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of clean electric energy to activate inert compounds has garnered significant attention. Homogeneous redox mediators (RMs) in organic electrosynthesis are effective platforms for this purpose. However, understanding the RM's electronic structure under operational conditions, electron transport processes at the electrode surface, and substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption dynamics remains challenging. Here, we synthesized a Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC, named Cu&#8208;N&#8208;P@NC) with a CuN3P1 micro&#8208;coordination structure, employing it as a unique cathode redox mediator. Introducing phosphine atoms into the coordination system allowed modulation of the SAC's electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, optimizing catalyst&#8208;substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption dynamics and accelerating electrochemical reactions. Utilizing the heterogeneous SAC strategy, we achieved a novel electro&#8208;reduction coupling ring&#8208;opening reaction of inert quinazolinone frameworks. The Cu&#8208;SAC exhibited exceptionally high catalytic activity and substrate compatibility, operating smoothly at gram&#8208;scale production. Additionally, we applied the SAC to modify 11 natural product molecules. Integrating micro&#8208;coordination environment regulation and theoretical adsorption models elucidated the significant influence of electrode&#8208;RMs&#8208;substrate interactions on reaction kinetics and catalytic efficiency&#8208;a feat challenging for homogeneous RMs. This approach offers a novel pathway for advancing efficient organic electrosynthesis reactions and provides critical insights for mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Gromomycins: An Unprecedented Class of Triterpene Antibiotics Produced by a Novel Biosynthetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current situation with drug&#8208;resistant microbial pathogens is critical dictating an acute need for novel efficient antibiotics. Herein, we report a new class of antibiotics entitled gromomycins with significant activity especially against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens including methicillin&#8208; and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Gromomycins are pentacyclic triterpenes with a cyclic guanidino group forming the fifth six&#8208;membered ring. We have used transposon mutagenesis to identify the gromomycin biosynthetic gene cluster since it could not be assigned by any available bioinformatics tools, highlighting its unique biosynthetic route. Using gene cluster engineering, feeding experiments, LC&#8208;MS and NMR analyses we have proposed the biosynthetic pathway for gromomycins, which are the first bacterial triterpenes synthesized independently of the squalene pathway. They also exhibit a so far unprecedented cyclization route that utilizes a hexaprenylguanidine linear precursor. Leveraging our understanding of their biosynthesis, we have identified additional gromomycin producers, resulting in the isolation of novel bioactive derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>From sequence definition to structure&#8208;property relationships in discrete synthetic macromolecules: insights from molecular modeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the exquisite properties emerging from the sequence order in nucleic acids and proteins, researchers are increasingly considering synthetic sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules (SDMs) to reach precise functions, e.g. for catalysis, data storage, energy, and health. While researchers develop iterative techniques permitting the synthesis of perfectly defined sequences, there is still an important gap to achieve the desired properties leading to their utilization as materials. This arises from the fact that the effect of the sequence order on the 3D structure is unknown for most&#160;synthetic SDMs. While the Protein Data Bank gathers hundreds of thousands of elucidated 3D structures, and many more computed (using e.g. AlphaFold), extended information on sequence&#8208;structure relationships do not exist yet for synthetic SDMs. To tackle this problem for relatively flexible macromolecules, one can nowadays utilize the existing tools of molecular modeling. In this Review, we report advanced practices to reveal the 3D structures and the interactions, through the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis&#160;applied to different&#160;SDMs. By combining the computational results to the experimental ones, we show the potential of this approach for&#160;understanding sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships in discrete macromolecular systems, towards guiding their rational design for specific functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Effects in Membrane&#8208;Electrode&#8208;Assembly CO Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA)&#8208;based CO electrolysis (COE) has demonstrated the capability to produce C2+ products with high faradaic efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current densities. However, most studies on COE have achieved performance benchmarks under strongly alkaline conditions (e.g., &#8805;1 M KOH, pH &#8805; 14), raising the question of whether such high pH levels are essential for optimal performance. In this study, we investigated the effects of different electrolytes (KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH) on MEA&#8208;based CO electrolysis, focusing on the influence of pH and the impact of anodic oxidation on the selectivity of various liquid products. By adjusting electrolyte concentration and pH, we achieved significant partial current densities for ethanol (189 &#177; 5 mA cm&#8208;2) and propanol (89 &#177; 4 mA cm&#8208;2) using 0.5 M K2CO3. This high performance is attributed to the creation of a moderate local alkaline environment and the relatively high resistance to anodic oxidation. Additionally, durability measurements emphasized the critical importance of eliminating anodic oxidation to optimize MEA&#8208;based COE for ethanol and propanol production.</dc:description>

         <title>High Voltage Design for Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) are recognized as a promising candidate for next generation of safe battery systems, owing to their inherent advantages. However, the performance of traditional ZABs is constrained by a lower theoretical voltage of 1.65 V, presenting a significant challenge in enhancing their practical application. This paper demonstrates a prototype of acid&#8208;alkaline hybrid quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air battery (HSZAB), featuring a unique design in both a new acidic gel electrolyte and battery structure. Our approach involves regulating the electrolyte pH and ionic conductivity to achieve an enhanced theoretical voltage, resulting in an open circuit voltage of up to 2.0 V. Additionally, the HSZAB demonstrates substantially improved peak power density (417 mW cm&#8208;&#178;, five times higher than the conventional alkaline ZABs) and increased energy efficiency (from 60% to 82%). This finding underscores the promising prospects of high voltage zinc&#8208;air batteries, offering a substantial step forward in the field of energy storage systems.</dc:description>

Our approach involves regulating the electrolyte pH and ionic conductivity to achieve an enhanced theoretical voltage, resulting in an open circuit voltage of up to 2.0 V. Additionally, the HSZAB demonstrates substantially improved peak power density (417 mW cm-&#178;, five times higher than the conventional alkaline ZABs) and increased energy efficiency (from 60% to 82%). This finding underscores the promising prospects of high voltage zinc-air batteries, offering a substantial step forward in the field of energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Interfacial Chemistry and Ion&#8208;Solvent Interactions to Enable Reversible Magnesium Metal Anode in Chloride&#8208;Free Mg(TFSI)2 Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivation of magnesium (Mg) anode in the chloride&#8208;free magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2) electrolyte is a key challenge for Mg metal batteries. Tailoring solvation structure and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been considered an effective strategy. Herein, a series of imidazole co&#8208;solvents with different branched&#8208;chain structures (methyl, ethyl and propyl) are introduced into the Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;ether electrolyte to address the passivation issue. The ion&#8208;solvent interaction, interfacial adsorption effect and SEI formation are comprehensively studied by theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations. Through molecular structure analysis, the long&#8208;chain 1&#8208;propylimidazole (PrIm) exhibits a strong coordination ability to Mg2+ and a favorable parallel adsorption configuration on the Mg surface. As a result, PrIm co&#8208;solvent can not only restructure the solvation sheath of Mg2+, but also act as a dynamic protective shield to repel a part of TFSI&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) away from the Mg surface. Benefited from the synergistic regulation effect of interfacial chemistry and ion&#8208;solvent interactions, the chloride&#8208;free Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;DME+PrIm electrolyte ensures a minimal interface passivation and achieves highly reversible Mg plating/stripping. This work provides a guiding strategy for solvation structure regulation and interface engineering for rechargeable Mg metal battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Upcycling of Polyolefin Waste to Light Aromatics via Coupling C&#8208;C Scission and Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The upcycling of waste polyolefins into light aromatics has great potential to generate hundreds of millions of tons of valuable aromatic carbon feedstock. However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature radical cracking method for aromatizing polyolefins on zeolites faces challenges in aromaticity control and rapid deactivation due to coke. Here, we present a unique strategy that integrates traditional cracking&#8208;aromatization process&#160;of PE&#160;with CO insertion, a key step of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis, achieving a rise of yield of light aromatics by 4 times, with an&#160;absolute value up to 67% by weight at only 280 &#176;C. The insertion of CO into the Ru&#8208;alkyl intermediates formed during polyolefin cracking facilitates the generation of active oxygenate species, guarantees an ideal C&#8208;C chain length range, and smoothing the way for subsequent efficient aromatization on Hol&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5@S1 with a short b&#8208;axis. According to the technical economic analysis, this low&#8208;carbon&#8208;footprint and economic approach can reduce approximately 1/3 of carbon emissions compared to traditional naphtha cracking technologies, and holds promise for reshaping the global aromatic hydrocarbon cycle of petrochemical industry through polyolefin degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Mn&#8208;Br Hybrid Perovskite Assembled by Achiral Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in various advanced technological fields. CPL activity typically requires compounds that crystallize in noncentrosymmetric chiral space groups. Achieving noncentrosymmetric crystal structures using achiral molecular architectures is highly appealing but remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance CPL materials via crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly using achiral architectures. We successfully obtained Mn2+&#8208;based halide enantiomeric hybrids (P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1), self&#8208;assembled from [MnBr4]2&#8208; anions and rotational symmetric [Pr&#8208;dabco]2+ cations (Pr&#8208;dabco2+ = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), crystallizing in the chiral space group P212121. The single crystals of 1 exhibit exceptionally high CPL performance, with a luminescence dissymmetry factor |glum| and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 4.8&#215;10&#8208;2 and 86.8%, respectively, thus a record&#8208;high figure of merit (FM) of 4.2&#215;10&#8208;2 among reported Mn2+&#8208;based CPL materials. Furthermore, P/M&#8208;1 based UV&#8208;LED devices demonstrated outstanding light&#8208;emitting performance, including high color&#8208;purity, excellent stability, remarkable luminous brightness (74,591.94 cd m&#8208;2), and a high electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) value of 3.6&#215;10&#8208;2. This study offers a robust strategy for the design and development of high&#8208;performance CPL materials utilizing achiral molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helix assemblies of chiral molecules can transfer microscopic unimolecular chirality to macroscopic supramolecular chirality, enhancing various chiral properties. In addition to the commonly observed spiral&#8208;column&#8208;like helix assembly, a small number of spiral&#8208;stair&#8208;like helix assemblies have also been reported in aromatic nanocarbons with multiple chirality&#8208;related irregularities. However, they require separation of diastereomers and/or enantiomers or do not have stable chirality. Here, we report the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylenes with stable helical chirality by the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed four consecutive intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloadditions of dodecaynes with two flexible biphenyl units. The chiral figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylene with ethyl and methyl side chains exhibits the spiral&#8208;stair&#8208;like single helix assembly in the crystal due to CH&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;O interactions and good CPL properties in solution. Experimental verification of the enantio&#8208; and diastereodetermining steps of four consecutive [2+2+2] cycloadditions is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical&#8208;Enzymatic Conversion of PET to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction over Ru&#8208;Doped Co3O4 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reforming presents a sustainable route for the conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8208;) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into value&#8208;added chemicals, such as ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (HCOOH). However, its widespread application has been constrained by low selectivity due to the complexity of reduction processes and thus energy scaling limitations. In this study, the atomically dispersed Ru sites in Co3O4 synergistically interact with Co centers, facilitating the adsorption and activation of hydroxyl radicals (OH*) and ethylene glycol (EG), resulting in a remarkable HCOOH selectivity of 99 % and a yield rate of 11.2 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 surpassing that of pristine Co3O4 (55 % and 3.8 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2). Furthermore, when applied as a bifunctional cathode catalyst, Ru&#8208;Co3O4 achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5 % for NH3 production (3.54 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) at &#8208;0.3 V vs. RHE. Additionally, we developed a prototype device powered by a commercial silicon photovoltaic cell, enabling on&#8208;site solar&#8208;driven production of formate and NH3 through enzyme&#8208;catalyzed PET and NO3&#8208; conversion. This study offers a viable approach for waste valorization and green chemical production, paving the way for sustainable energy applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The ortho&#8208;carboranyl carbophosphinocarbene (CPC) has been synthesized through a click&#8208;type reaction between the super strained carborane&#8208;fused borirane 1,2&#8208;BN(SiMe3)2&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10 and Bestmann ylide Ph3PCCO.

         <title>Avoiding the Kauzmann Paradox via Interface&#8208;Driven Divergence in States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kauzmann paradox suggests that deeply supercooled liquids can have a lower entropy than the corresponding crystalline solids. While this entropy catastrophe has been thoroughly studied via equilibrium thermodynamics, the solidification process occurs far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium. By analyzing this process experimentally and theoretically, we show that surface speciation in core&#8208;shell particles can perturb the entropy production to an extent that a continuum equilibrium phase transition is not possible. Speciation of the surface causes divergence of associated stress vectors that generate nonequilibrium fluxes and frustrates homogeneous nucleation hence deep undercooling. The asymmetry of the speciation&#8208;derived surface tensor skews the minimum entropy production criterion. We analyze a set of nonequilibrium models, one showing and one averting the entropy catastrophe. Applying thermodynamic speed limits to these models, we show that the Kauzmann paradox takes another form. Deviations from the speed limit diverges the configurational entropy of the glass, but adding an interfacial state avoids the entropy catastrophe with significantly large supercooling.</dc:description>

         <title>Gallium&#8208;Based Eutectic Alloys as Liquid Electron Donors to Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of Vanillin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the catalytic pathways of atomically dispersed single&#8208;atom catalysts  (SAC) has emerged as an effective strategy to optimize their overall catalytic activity. Herein, we present Ru1@m&#8208;tube, a hollow carbon nitride&#8208;supported Ru SAC, coated with eutectic galinstan (GaInSn), as a model catalyst, we demonstrate a performance inversion in  vanillin  conversion. Vanillin, as a biomass&#8208;derived compound with industrial relevance, presents challenges in catalytic hydrogenation, making it an ideal model reaction to test and compare the catalyst's selectivity and efficiency. The as&#8208;obtained Ru1@m&#8208;tube(GaInSn) achieved nearly 100% vanillin conversion within 5 hours  and exhibited an impressive 93.8% selectivity for vanillyl alcohol . Electron spillover from gallium&#8208;based eutectic alloys to highly diluted ruthenium sites enhances the desorption of vanillyl alcohol, resulting in an exceptional performance shift between hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Our findings not only offer a novel approach  for modulating SAC performance via liquid&#8208;metal interfaces but also expand the understanding of promoter screening for various challenging reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Triangular Cu3&#160;Motif Steers CO2&#160;Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreduction of CO2 using copper&#8208;based multi&#8208;atom catalysts (MACs) offers a potential approach to achieve value&#8208;added C2+ products. However, achieving MACs with high metal contents and suppressing the thermodynamically favored competing ethylene production pathway remain challenging, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance in ethanol production. Herein, we developed a &#8216;pre&#8208;locking and nanoconfined polymerization&#8217; strategy for synthesis of an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density Cu MAC with low&#8208;coordination triangular Cu3 motifs (Cu3 MAC) on polymeric carbon nitride mesoporous nanofibers. The Cu3 MAC with Cu contents of 36&#8201;wt% achieves a high reactivity of 117 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 for ethanol production from CO2 and H2O, with a remarkable selectivity of 98% under simulated sunlight irradiation, representing one of the highest performances in ambient conditions without sacrificial reagents. The superior catalytic efficiency is attributed to the triangular Cu3 configuration, in which both Cu(I) and Cu(II) coexist, predominantly as Cu(I). Such Cu3 motifs act as strong alkaline sites that effectively chemisorb and activate CO2, extend visible&#8208;light absorption range, while accumulating high&#8208;density electrons and favoring 12&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer products. An accelerated asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling with adsorption configuration of the bridge&#8208;adsorbed *CO at paired Cu sites and atop&#8208;adsorbed *CO at adjacent single Cu atom was observed, enabling preferential formation of *CHCHOH intermediates to produce ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Optical Waveguides Based on Serpentine&#8208;like Organic Pseudo&#8208;Plastic&#160;Crystals that Mimic Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical components and circuits for signal generation and processing are essential for artificial neural networks (ANNs). We present a four&#8208;layered organic optical waveguide architecture that mimics an ANN. This structure is constructed from flexible organic crystals of (E)&#8208;1&#8208;(((5&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MPyIN) using an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip&#8208;based micromanipulation technique. By strategically selecting four MPyIN crystal waveguides of varying lengths, bending them into serpentine&#8208;like forms, and integrating them hierarchically, we create interconnected, neuron&#8208;like optical waveguides with six optical synapses. These synapses enable parallel transmission of passive optical signals through evanescent coupling across multiple paths within the waveguides. The feedforward mechanism allows the synapses to split the input optical signal into four diverging signals with different magnitudes. Certain outputs combine passive and active signals due to diverging and converging optical paths. This hierarchical, ANN&#8208;like architecture offers a foundation for developing smart optical neural networks using multiple emissive and phase&#8208;changing organic crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Intervalence Charge Transfer and Exothermic and Isoenergetic Symmetry Breaking Charge Separation in Far&#8208;Red Capturing Zinc Phthalocyanine Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orientation and distance&#8208;dependent intervalence charge transfer phenomenon is demonstrated in far&#8208;red capturing zinc phthalocyanine dimers connected by a bis&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenyl &#960;&#8208;spacer (ortho, meta, or para positions) upon oxidizing one of the phthalocyanine rings, resulting in split oxidation waves and a new optical transition in the near&#8208;infrared region. Optical studies initially probed the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation events in these dimers wherein solvent polarity&#8208;dependent quenching was witnessed. Interestingly, efficient quenching in nonpolar toluene was also seen for the ortho&#8208;dimer. Free&#8208;energy calculations supported symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation in polar solvents and the ortho&#8208;dimer even in nonpolar solvents under isoenergetic (endothermic by ~40 mV) conditions. Molecular electrostatic potential maps generated on DFT&#8208;optimized structures revealed quadrupolar charge transfer states, more so in polar media. The time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations revealed the conversion of the quadrupolar charge transfer states to bipolar charge&#8208;separated states from different singlet&#8208;singlet excitations. Femtosecond transient absorption studies covering broad temporal and spatial scales provided evidence for the charge separation process, including that for the ortho&#8208;dimer in toluene, where an isoenergetic process was predicted. The charge&#8208;separated states lasted for 200&#8208;500 ps depending upon dimer linkage. These unprecedented findings reveal the potential applications of the investigated phthalocyanine dimers in energy harvesting, photocatalytic, and pertinent optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts Enabling Efficient Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Blue&#8208;Emitting Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of pure hydrocarbon materials as hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs is reported. Blue MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs using either DtBuCzB or v&#8208;DABNA as emitter and either FIrpic, fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 or CN&#8722;Ir as sensitizer, achieved very high maximum external quantum efficiencies ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%, due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts.







Abstract
Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials are a class of highly efficient and stable host materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Despite recent great advancements in PHC research, their applications are still mainly limited to phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs). High&#8208;performance blue OLEDs still pose a considerable challenge. Thus, expanding PHC materials into other types of OLEDs is critical for advancing organic electronic technologies.

&lt;p&gt;The first application of pure hydrocarbon materials as hosts in phosphorescence-sensitized multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) OLEDs is reported. Blue MR-TADF OLEDs using either DtBuCzB or &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;-DABNA as emitter and either FIrpic, &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-Ir(tpz)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or CN&#8722;Ir as sensitizer, achieved very high maximum external quantum efficiencies ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%, due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials are a class of highly efficient and stable host materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Despite recent great advancements in PHC research, their applications are still mainly limited to phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs). High-performance blue OLEDs still pose a considerable challenge. Thus, expanding PHC materials into other types of OLEDs is critical for advancing organic electronic technologies. In this study, we designed a series of original high-triplet PHC materials based on a multi-substitution approach of the 9,9&#8242;-spirobifluorene (SBF) backbone and used them, for the first time, as a host in phosphorescence-sensitized multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) OLEDs. Devices based on the 2,6-bis(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)boron (DtBuCzB) emitter, using FIrpic or fac-Ir(tpz)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the sensitizer, achieved high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) values ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%. Additionally, blue MR-TADF OLED devices based on &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;-DABNA with a phosphorescent sensitizer (CN&#8722;Ir), demonstrated outstanding electroluminescent performance, with an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of approximately 31&#8201;% due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts. All devices exhibited narrow full-width at half-maximum spectra and minimal efficiency roll-off. This study marks the first application of PHC materials as hosts in phosphorescence-sensitized MR-TADF OLEDs, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for next-generation blue OLEDs and offering a viable pathway to achieve high-performance devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Theophylline to Adenine or preQ1: Repurposing a DNA Aptamer Revealed by Crystal Structure Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers, which are short, single&#8208;stranded DNA or RNA, are capable of binding to a wide array of targets with exceptional selectivity. Those with high affinity for theophylline have the potential to serve as biosensors, crucial for tracking theophylline levels in the treatment of respiratory conditions. Despite the extensive structural characterization of the RNA theophylline aptamer, the DNA counterpart&#8217;s ligand&#8208;recognition mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we elucidate the DNA theophylline aptamer&#8217;s ligand&#8208;binding mechanism through high&#8208;resolution crystal structures of its complexes with theophylline, 3&#8208;methylxanthine, and hypoxanthine. Guided by these structural insights, we computationally redesigned the theophylline&#8208;binding pocket via rational mutagenesis of key nucleotides, generating novel aptamers selective for adenine and prequeuosine (preQ1) ligands. These engineered aptamers were validated through biochemical and crystallographic analyses. By integrating structural biology with computational design, our work provides a relatively simple and effective method for developing new aptamers. While this strategy does not supplant SELEX, it serves as a beneficial complement to it.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Temperature Depolymerization of Polymethacrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The depolymerization of polymers synthesized by reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) has recently garnered significant attention due to its potential for recovering monomer at low temperatures. However, current reports focus solely on polymethacrylates, significantly limiting applications, scope, and fundamental understanding. Although polymethacrylamides are highly valued for their excellent biocompatibility, anti&#8208;bacterial properties, and water solubility, their chemical recycling remains experimentally unattainable, irrespective of their synthesis method (i.e. free radical, RDRP, anionic, etc.). Herein, we present the first example of thermal reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer&#160;(RAFT) depolymerization of various polymethacrylamides, regenerating monomers at high yields. Central to our work was the identification of two key weaknesses associated with polymethacrylamides, namely (i) insufficient end&#8208;group activation, and (ii) premature end&#8208;group loss at higher temperatures, leading to compromised monomer yields and low depolymerization rates. These challenges were bypassed via the addition of commercially available radical initiators, resulting in faster reactions and higher percentages of recovered monomer at as low as 90 &#176;C. The broad applicability of this method was further demonstrated by its compatibility with various RAFT&#8208;agents, and the possibility to depolymerize a crosslinked hydrogel. Our work expands the depolymerization scope of high&#8208;value materials beyond polymethacrylates and shines a light on intriguing thermodynamic and kinetic insights.</dc:description>

Here, we demonstrate the highly selective, active and long&#8208;term durable electrocatalytic production of ethylene from CO2 by constructing a Cu2O nano&#8208;homojunction, which is composed of Cu2O nanocubes in size of ~100 nm and the surface&#8208;adhered Cu2O nanodots in size of ~12 nm, as electrocatalyst.&#160;&#160;The maximum Faradaic efficiency of ethylene can reach 73.7% at &#8722;1.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in H&#8208;type cell, with partial current density to ethylene of 38.2 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it can work stably for more than 200 h at 0.31 A cm&#8722;2 in membrane electrode assembly. The mechanism for the high selectivity, activity and stability for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion was investigated by in&#8208;situ experiments and theoretical calculations.

         <title>A DNP&#8208;Supported Solid&#8208;State NMR Approach to Study Nucleic Acids In Situ Reveals Berberine&#8208;Stabilized Hoogsteen Structures in Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria are vital for energy production and rely on intricate nucleic acid structures to regulate gene expression. Using DNP&#8208;ssNMR (dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR), we observed G&#8208;quadruplex formation in intact mitochondria treated with berberine. This method enables detailed studies of mitochondrial nucleic acids in their native environment, advancing research into mitochondrial diseases and therapies.








Abstract
Mitochondria are central to cellular bioenergetics, with the unique ability to translate and transcribe a subset of their own proteome. Given the critical importance of energy production, mitochondria seem to utilize higher&#8208;order nucleic acid structures to regulate gene expression, much like nuclei. Herein, we introduce a tailored approach to probe the formation of such structures, specifically G&#8208;quadruplexes, within intact mitochondria by using sensitivity&#8208;enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization&#8208;supported solid&#8208;state NMR (DNP&#8208;ssNMR). We acquired NMR spectra on isolated intact isotopically labeled mitochondria treated with berberine, a known high&#8208;affinity G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer. The DNP&#8208;ssNMR data revealed spectral changes in nucleic acid sugar correlations, increased signal intensity for guanosine carbons, and enhanced Hoogsteen hydrogen bond formation, providing evidence of in vivo G&#8208;quadruplex formation in mitochondria. Together, our workflow enables the study of mitochondrial nucleic acid&#8208;ligand interactions at endogenous concentrations within biologically relevant environments by DNP&#8208;ssNMR, thus paving the way for future research into mitochondrial diseases and their potential treatments.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Conduction Band and Defect Engineering for the Prominent Visible&#8208;Light Responsive Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance H&#8322; evolution via water splitting, preventing deep electron traps&#8212;&#8208;often formed by anion vacancies&#8212;&#8208;is essential. Transient IR absorption spectroscopy reveals that 2D layered materials like Bi&#8324;NbOCl rarely form such traps. This is due to the formation of a defect&#8208;tolerant, bonding&#8208;based conduction band minimum, which effectively suppresses deep traps while maintaining high electron reactivity. Addressing this issue has been a major focus in photocatalysis research, as reported by Akira Yamakata, Takafumi Ogawa, and Hiroshi Kageyama et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202419624).

This is due to the formation of a defect-tolerant, bonding-based conduction band minimum, which effectively suppresses deep traps while maintaining high electron reactivity. Addressing this issue has been a major focus in photocatalysis research, as reported by Akira Yamakata, Takafumi Ogawa, and Hiroshi Kageyama et&#160;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a target="_blank"

         <title>AIE Bottlebrush Polymers: Verification of Internal Crowdedness in Bottlebrush Polymers Using the AIE Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottlebrush polymers are a unique class of macromolecules with densely grafted side chains along a central long backbone. A comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single bottlebrush polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging. Here, we synthesized AIEgen&#8208;based bottlebrush polymers using ROMP. The expected AIE phenomenon clearly visualized the steric crowding effect among the densely grafted side chains in bottlebrush polymers.








Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers, characterized by densely grafted side chains along a central backbone, have gained significant interest due to their unique properties in bulk and solution states. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging, and direct evidence to visualize and manifest this effect is scarce. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) offers a novel method to address this challenge. To achieve this, a vinyl&#8208;derivatized AIE monomer was polymerized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in a controlled way. Afterward, the end group of the synthesized polymer chain was transformed to azide, which was coupled with an alkyne&#8208;derivatized norbornene unit using click chemistry to produce the macromonomer. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of the norbornenyl macromonomer using Grubbs catalyst, (H2IMes)(pyr)2(Cl)2Ru&#160;=&#160;CHPh (G3), resulted in well&#8208;defined bottlebrush polymers in a highly efficient way. We studied the polymerization behavior and characterized the single chain conformation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution together with coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CG&#8208;MD) simulation. Photoluminescence investigation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution revealed the expected AIE phenomenon, thus verifying the steric crowding effects within bottlebrush polymers. This work bridges AIE technology with polymer science and especially bottlebrush polymers. By doing this, our research not only broadens the bottlebrush polymer library but also provides insights into bottlebrush polymer chain study for potential applications.

         <title>Gem&#8208;Diboronic Acids: A Motif for Anion Recognition in Competitive Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gem&#8208;diboronic acids are an anion recognition motif that provides strong and directional binding to oxoanions in aqueous media. This motif provides a selectivity profile that is distinct from other anion recognition groups, and binding affinities that are superior to those of simple amides and (thio)ureas. A simple receptor featuring two gem&#8208;diboronic acid motifs was found to be one of the most selective malonate receptors disclosed to date.








Abstract
Gem&#8208;diboronic acid derivatives have previously been demonstrated to facilitate substrate binding within a metal's secondary coordination sphere, but their use as an anion recognition motif has not been explored. Here, we introduce the gem&#8208;diboronic acid motif as a highly effective group for recognition of oxoanions in aqueous solution. Anion receptors based on this motif demonstrate higher binding affinities than other common neutral motifs such as amides and (thio)ureas, and display a unique selectivity profile. Studies with a receptor bearing two gem&#8208;diboronic acid groups, receptor 2, indicate that the interaction with anions is highly directional. Despite its simplicity, receptor 2 represents one of the most selective receptors for malonate reported to date.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Exploration of Chemical Space of MOF&#8208;5 Analogs for Enhanced C2H6/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study outlines a data&#8208;driven approach for identifying potential candidates for effectively separating C2H6/C2H4 mixtures. By integrating machine learning and molecular simulations, the chemical space of MOF&#8208;5 analogs was explored for large C2H6 adsorption capacity and high C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. The most promising MOF was synthesized, and its exceptional C2H6/C2H4 separation capability was validated through experimentation. 








Abstract
Adsorptive separation using C2H6&#8208;selective adsorbents can produce high&#8208;purity C2H4 directly, making it an energy&#8208;efficient separation method with the potential to replace cryogenic distillation. Although many C2H6&#8208;selective MOFs have been reported, developing MOFs with both large C2H6 adsorption capacity and high C2H6/C2H4 selectivity remains challenging. Herein, we present a machine learning&#8211;assisted molecular simulation strategy to explore the C2H6/C2H4 separation capability of pcu&#8208;MOFs isoreticular to MOF&#8208;5. The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm showed high accuracy in predicting the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity and C2H6 uptake, where Henry coefficient ratio (S0) and Henry coefficient of C2H6 (K(C2H6)) were identified as key factors. We further synthesized the top&#8208;performing MOF termed A&#8208;66 and experimentally verified its large C2H6 adsorption capacity and excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation performance. This work provides a valuable strategy for exploring the chemical space of MOF&#8208;5 analogs and identifying promising candidates for the efficient purification of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical C&#9472;H Chlorination of Terminal Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free electrochemical method for the chlorination of terminal C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds of alkanes is described. The specific cavity size of organic molecular catalysts ensures high regioselectivity, while the use of inexpensive and readily reusable graphite felt electrodes, a simple electrochemical device, and mild conditions enables the reaction to maintain good efficiency even when applied in flow electrochemistry and used for kilogram&#8208;scale production.








Abstract
Although research on the activation of C&#9472;H bonds in alkanes has been ongoing for decades, there are still few strategies that are both highly selective and suitable for industrial production. Herein, we report a highly selective method for the chlorination of terminal C&#9472;H bonds in alkanes by combining electrochemistry and organocatalysis. The specific cavity size of organic molecular catalysts ensures high regioselectivity, while the use of inexpensive and readily reusable graphite felt electrodes, a simple electrochemical device, and mild conditions enables the reaction to maintain good efficiency even when applied to kilogram&#8208;scale production.

Herein, we report a highly selective method for the chlorination of terminal C&#9472;H bonds in alkanes by combining electrochemistry and organocatalysis. The specific cavity size of organic molecular catalysts ensures high regioselectivity, while the use of inexpensive and readily reusable graphite felt electrodes, a simple electrochemical device, and mild conditions enables the reaction to maintain good efficiency even when applied to kilogram-scale production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Miniaturized Separation&#8208;Sensing Tandem Enabled by Fluorescent Monoliths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bifunctional porous fluorescent monoliths were synthesized for the first time inside a capillary column, enabling a miniaturized separation&#8208;sensing platform for mixture sensing. This platform not only realizes quantitative analysis for trace water in methanol, a sarin simulant, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and metal ions but also shows baseline separation for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene at nanogram levels.








Abstract
Discriminative sensing for mixture by either fluorescent sensor or other sensors remains a challenge. This issue is attributed to the absence of a separation unit prior to the sensor. Here, we report a new sensing medium, named porous fluorescent monolith, which can separate mixture and meanwhile be integrated into a sensor for discriminative detection. The fluorescent monoliths are prepared via polymerization of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8244;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzaldehyde with diamines. Their photophysical property and hierarchical porosity are systematically studied. On this basis, we set up a separation&#8208;sensing platform and realize quantitative analysis for trace water in methanol, a sarin simulant, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and metal ions. The separation&#8208;sensing platform furthermore demonstrates baseline separation for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, with limit of detections of 86, 54, 19, and 58&#160;ng, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a fluorescent monolith is used to realize a separation&#8208;sensing tandem. We anticipate our findings will provide a promising strategy for producing portable devices with the on&#8208;site discriminative sensing ability for real samples.

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanostructure Monolayers as SERS Substrates for Ultrasensitive Detection of Enantiomer Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral gold nanostructures induced by D&#8208;/L&#8208;cysteine&#8211;leucine (D&#9472;/L&#9472;CL) dipeptide were used as SERS substrates for the detection of chiral molecules, specifically D&#8208;kynurenine (Kyn), which would be a new biomarker of Alzheimer's disease for clinical diagnosis.








Abstract
The early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), requires the identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers. Detecting chiral molecules at concentrations relevant to disease states remains challenging. Herein, a new type of chiral gold nanostructure induced by D&#8208;/L&#8208;cysteine&#8211;leucine dipeptides with a g&#8208;factor of 0.1 was successfully synthesized for enantiomer biomarker detection.&#160;To enhance the discrimination performance, the chiral gold nanostructures were assembled into D&#8208;/L&#8208;Au monolayers. As surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, the D&#8208;/L&#8208;Au monolayers simultaneously deliver molecular structural specificity and enantioselectivity within a single spectrum, which can be a versatile, label&#8208;free chiral discrimination strategy for the detection of D&#8208;/L&#8208;kynurenine (Kyn). The mechanism was unveiled to involve high enantioselective adsorption energies between L&#8208; and D&#8208;Kyn on the lattice plane (221), resulting in enantioselective sensing.&#160;The results showed that the L&#8208;Au monolayer reached a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.7&#160;nm for L&#8208;Kyn, while the D&#8208;Au monolayer reached an LOD of 3.6&#160;nM for D&#8208;Kyn.&#160;Notably, there was a significant difference in D&#8208;Kyn levels between AD patients and healthy individuals in serum samples, a distinction not observed for L&#8208;Kyn, which positioned D&#8208;Kyn as a potential novel biomarker for clinical prediagnosis of AD patients, marking the first report of its kind worldwide.&#160;This study provides a robust tool for advancing biomedical science and clinical diagnostics.

         <title>Ligand Modulation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Derived Regenerable Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#945;&#8208;FeOOH coated Ni&#8208;catecholate metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;CAT MOF) catalyst converts into ligand&#8208;coordinated &#947;&#8208;NiFeOOH species during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which can revert to more stable &#945;&#8208;phase counterparts, showing &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;regenerate&#8221; characteristics. The ligand enhances the adsorption energies of oxygenic intermediates, strengthens bonding states, and electron delocalization interactions, leading to superior catalytic OER performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as promising pre&#8208;catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. However, the coordination chemistry of MOF ligands in reconstructed species remains poorly understood, particularly regarding how ligand modulation influences the electronic configurations of catalytic sites. In this study, we present the synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;FeOOH coated Ni&#8208;catecholate MOF composite (FeOOH@Ni&#8208;CAT), which transforms into a ligand&#8208;coordinated &#947;&#8208;NiFeOOH active species during OER. Notably, this active species can revert to its stable &#945;&#8208;phase counterpart, exhibiting an &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;regenerate&#8221; characteristic. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the ligand significantly enhances the adsorption energies of oxygenic intermediates involved in the OER, while also modulating electronic structures by strengthening bonding states and promoting electron delocalization between active sites and intermediates. As a result, the FeOOH@Ni&#8208;CAT pre&#8208;catalyst exhibits exceptional OER performance, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 180&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and impressive durability over 384&#160;h (16 days), leveraging the regenerable property. This work advances the understanding of high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based pre&#8208;catalysts by elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of structural reconstruction during OER and highlighting the role of ligand modulation in improving OER activity.

         <title>Fluorescence of Helical Molecular Springs Under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of &#960;&#8208;extended [n]helicenes (n&#160;=&#160;7 and 9) were selected as model systems for molecular springs to study the relationship between optical properties and molecular structures at high pressure in a diamond anvil cell. Based on experimental and simulation results, the fluorescence properties of these molecular springs were found to be influenced not only by the intermolecular interaction but also by the unique intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between their overlapping helices.








Abstract
Although the unique structure of helicenes resembles molecular springs, the effects of their extension&#8211;contraction cycles on their properties have rarely been explored. Here, we investigated the fluorescence of two &#960;&#8208;extended [n]helicenes with different helical lengths n, named [7] and [9], under high pressures in a diamond anvil cell. The experimental results showed that compound [9], with a longer helical length, exhibited a more sensitive fluorescence response than [7] in both crystalline and solvated states upon compression. Theoretical calculations reveal that &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlapping at their helices in these molecular springs provides an additional contribution to their fluorescence properties under compression when the overlap becomes sufficiently strong. Our results provide insights into structure&#8211;property relationships of helical molecules under high&#8208;pressure conditions and verify the potential of helicenes as molecular springs for future applications in molecular machines.

         <title>Programmable Mono&#8208;/di&#8208;alkylation of Amines with Aldehydes over a Pd&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Binding&#8208;Site Purification of Actives (B&#8208;SPA) Enables Efficient Large&#8208;Scale Progression of Fragment Hits by Combining Multi&#8208;Step Array Synthesis With HT Crystallography</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Ne te lave pas, j'arrive.&#8221; No work&#8208;up or purification required! Cheap robotics&#8208;based high throughput synthesis of crude reactions mixtures, married to high throughput X&#8208;Ray crystallography, leads to savings in time, energy and solvent use, and was applied to fragment elaboration vs the atypical bromodomain PHIP(2). Overall, &gt;1800 reactions were performed in a few weeks and 22 crystal structures were solved showing that binding can be detected on even weak fragments, with 3 showing an unexpected binding pose. A final compound displayed acceptable binding to the bromodomain (IC50=34&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
Fragment approaches are long&#8208;established in target&#8208;based ligand discovery, yet their full transformative potential lies dormant because progressing the initial weakly binding hits to potency remains a formidable challenge. The only credible progression paradigm involves multiple cycles of costly conventional design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyse medicinal chemistry. We propose an alternative approach to fragment elaboration, namely performing large numbers of parallel and diverse automated multiple step reactions, and evaluating the binding of the crude reaction products by high&#8208;throughput protein X&#8208;ray crystallography. We show it is effective and low&#8208;cost to perform, in parallel, large numbers of non&#8208;uniform multi&#8208;step reactions, because, even without compound purification, crystallography provides a high&#8208;quality readout of binding. This can detect low&#8208;level binding of weakly active compounds, which the target binding site extracts directly from crude reaction mixtures. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we have expanded a fragment hit, from a crystal&#8208;based screen of the second bromodomain of pleckstrin homology domain&#8208;interacting protein (PHIP(2)), using array synthesis on low&#8208;cost robotics. We were able to implement 6 independent multi&#8208;step reaction routes of up to 5 steps, attempting the synthesis of 1876 diverse expansions, designs entirely driven by synthetic tractability. The expected product was present in 1108 (59%) crude reaction mixtures, detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). 22 individual products were resolved in the crystal structures of crude reaction mixtures added to crystals, providing an initial structure activity relationship map. 19 of these showed binding pose stability, while, through binding instability in the remaining 3 products, we could resolve a stereochemical preference for mixtures containing racemic compounds. One compound showed biochemical potency (IC50=34&#8197;&#956;M) and affinity (Kd=50&#8197;&#956;M) after resynthesis. This approach therefore lends itself to routine fragment progression, if coupled with algorithmically guided compound and reaction design and new formalisms for data analysis.

         <title>Low Strain Mediated Zn (0002) Plane Epitaxial Plating for Highly Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the crystalline orientation of Zn anode to achieve stable Zn (0002) plane growth is pursued for highly reversible zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). However, the lattice strain of Zn substrate hinders stable Zn2+ plating/stripping and sustainable epitaxial growth of Zn (0002) texture. Herein, we present a low strain strategy to mediate nucleated&#8208;Zn grains for stabilizing Zn2+ electrodeposition/stripping process and guiding sustainable Zn2+ growth along (0002) surfaces. Fluorinated anthracene triptycene polymer (FATP) photopolymerized on Zn exhibits nanocrystalline structure with highly ordered nanochannels (1.5 nm), enabling oriented nucleation and sustainable epitaxial stacking of Zn (0002) plane due to low nucleation energy (0.2 vs. 1.1 e&#8722;/&#197;3 of pure Zn) and low grain strain (&#8722;0.2 to 0.4 vs. &#8722;0.9 to 0.9 MPa). Besides, the ordered porous FATP nanofilm refines electroplating Zn grains (9.4 vs. 26.7 &#956;m), alleviating strain accumulation (3.7 vs. 28.2 MPa) and lattice distortion. Consequently, FATP&#8208;Zn||Cu cell achieves a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% over 6000 cycles, while FATP&#8208;Zn||FATP&#8208;Zn cell shows stable&#160;plating/stripping after 5000 h. Notably, FATP&#8208;Zn||MnO2 pouch cell (2.77 Ah) demonstrates stable operation over 1000 cycles. This work presents a new approach to designing Zn anodes with refined nucleated&#8208;Zn grains and sustainable Zn (0002) plane stacking for advanced ZMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Prediction and Validation of Mechanical Flexibility in Molecular Crystals: Dispersion Interactions Dictate Bending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational prediction of mechanical flexibility in molecular crystals based on anisotropy in interaction topology and their experimental validation reveals certain fundamental features of the origin of bending. Analyses based on interaction anisotropy indices and interaction components show that despite stronger electrostatic motifs, the bending in these crystals is still governed by dispersion forces. 








Abstract
Mechanically flexible crystals are a rapidly growing class of functional molecular materials. Typically, such flexible crystals are discovered by serendipity. Herein, we have predicted mechanical flexibility in a series of molecular crystals based on a structure screening approach that combines interaction topology and the presence of nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile interactions&#8212;a supramolecular motif hitherto not associated with bending property. Further, we have experimentally validated plastic/elastic bending properties in a series of crystal structures thus predicted. However, four out of five of these crystals showed the bending direction along &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking despite the fact that the direction of strongest interaction anisotropy was rendered by the nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile interaction motifs. This is contrary to the commonly perceived anisotropy model and underscores the dominant role of dispersion forces over the electrostatically stabilized motifs in dictating the bending phenomena in molecular crystals. The interaction energies of these motifs have been evaluated using accurate structures from X&#8208;ray quantum crystallography. Analyses combining elastic tensors, interaction anisotropy indices, thermal expansion studies, and high&#8208;pressure simulations quantify the relative roles of the nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile motif and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking in mechanical flexibility. Our results point to the possibility of expanding the realm of flexible molecular materials to novel structural types aided by predictive computational models.

         <title>Deciphering the Impact of Polysulfide Solvation Structure on Electrical Double Layer Chemistry in Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tetrahydropyran (THP)&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) has been developed for reversible sodium&#8211;sulfur (Na&#8211;S) batteries, which regulates the sodium polysulfides (NaPS) solvation structure, enables a robust electrical double layer chemistry, and suppresses side reactions between NaPS and Na&#8211;metal anodes. As a result, the Na&#8211;S cells with THP&#8208;based LHCE display long&#8208;term cycle stability with excellent rate performance.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are garnering attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical application is hindered by challenges, such as the shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS) and dendrite growth. The high solubility of NaPS in the electrolyte is particularly problematic. It disrupts electron transfer and obstructs mass transport in the electrical double layer (EDL) region. The EDL plays a pivotal role in governing the interfacial chemistry between the electrode and electrolyte, significantly impacting the overall electrochemical performance. Through simulations and experimental screening of various solvents, including 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and tetrahydropyran (THP), along with ethyl 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl ether (ETFE) as a diluent, the relationship between NaPS solvation structure and EDL chemistry has been elucidated. Our findings reveal that THP&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) not only reduces the solubility of NaPS by altering its solvation structure but also promotes the formation of a stable inorganic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and improves compatibility with sodium metal. Consequently, Na&#8211;S batteries with LHCE&#8208;THP/ETFE exhibit long&#8208;term stability over 500 cycles at 1C rate with a capacity decay rate of only 0.07% per cycle. This study provides a methodology for designing electrolytes based on molecular structure, polysulfide solvation properties, and EDL interfacial chemistry.

         <title>Reactions of R3PNNPR3 Species with Boranes: Classical Adducts, FLPs, and Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the substituents, bis&#8208;phosphazine species R3PNNPR3 (R&#160;=&#160;Ph 1, Cy 2) react with boranes to give Lewis acid&#8211;base adducts, generate frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP), or effect single electron transfer affording a frustrated radical pair (FRP). The B(C6F5)3 and BF3 adducts of 1 and the radical salts [R3PNNPR3]&#8226;+[BF4] (R&#160;=&#160;Cy 5b Cy 6) were obtained and studied structurally and computationally.








Abstract
Although the nature of bis&#8208;phosphazine species is of much interest, there are few reports of their reactivity. Herein, we show that the bis&#8208;phosphazine species Ph3PNNPPh3 1 react with Lewis acids to give the Lewis acid adducts Ph3PNN(B(C6F5)3)PPh3 3 and Ph3PN(BF3)N(BF3)PPh3 4. Compound 1 also generates a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) in the presence of BPh3 and thermolysis of 1/BPh3, or 3 at 80&#160;&#176;C released N2 while 4 was stable at 80&#160;&#176;C. In contrast, the species Cy3PNNPCy3 2 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to effect single electron transfer affording a frustrated radical pair (FRP). Independent reactions of 1 and 2 with [Cp2Fe][BF4] gave the corresponding radical salts [R3PNNPR3]&#8226;+[BF4] (R&#160;=&#160;Cy 5b Ph 6). Structural and computational data show the N&#9472;N bond is strengthened in the bis&#8208;phosphazine radical cation.

         <title>A Phenazine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Photochemical CO2 Reduction with Increased Selectivity for Two&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic advantages of&#160;covalent organic frameworks&#160;(COFs) for sustainable CO&#8322; utilization have been demonstrated by the photocatalytic reduction of CO&#8322; by&#160;a redox&#8208;active, phenazine&#8208;based COF (Phen&#8208;COF). Phen&#8208;COF efficiently converts CO&#8322; into formate, oxalate, and carbon monoxide under light irradiation, achieving significantly higher yields than a comparable monomer.








Abstract
The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) into valuable products will contribute to sustainable carbon use. Here we report the photocatalytic reduction of CO&#8322; to carbon monoxide, formate, and oxalate ions using a redox&#8208;active phenazine&#8208;based 2D covalent organic framework (Phen&#8208;COF) and its phenazine monomer. Under similar irradiation conditions, Phen&#8208;COF produced 2.9 times more CO, 11 times more formate, and 13 times more oxalate compared to equimolar amounts of the monomeric phenazine, demonstrating that the COF architecture enhances catalytic performance (TOFCOF: 10&#8722;7 s&#8722;1 CO, 10&#8722;8 s&#8722;1 formate, and 10&#8722;11 s&#8722;1 oxalate). Structural analysis, including X&#8208;ray diffraction and N&#8322; porosimetry, confirmed the COF's long&#8208;range order and porosity. Mechanistic studies suggest a sequential formate&#8208;to&#8208;oxalate pathway, with CO and formate acting as intermediates. These results demonstrate the potential of the COF architecture to improve the performance of metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;active aromatic systems such as phenazines to facilitate efficient and selective CO&#8322; conversion under mild conditions.

         <title>Enantioselective Acylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Enabled by a Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective acylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond via cooperative photoredox and NHC catalysis was disclosed, affording the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones in high efficiency, with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 er). Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations support the radical pathway and rationalize the radical coupling via open&#8208;shell singlet transition states to be the enantiodetermining step.








Abstract
Organocatalyzed direct and asymmetric functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond is attractive yet challenging. Herein, we report the enantioselective acylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond via a cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, affording the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 er). The rational design of novel NHCs guided by the initial evaluation of available catalysts and their application promotes the asymmetric transformation. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the formation of benzyl radical and ketyl radical intermediates and rationalize the coupling of these radical species via open&#8208;shell singlet transition states to be the enantiodetermining step. This redox neutral protocol features mild conditions and is free of transition&#8208;metals (TMs) and pre&#8208;functionalized radical precursors.

         <title>Using Color to Control Conformation in a Chemical System Containing Multiple Tricyanofuran Photoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a solution of two metastable photoacids with contrasting absorption maxima, the solution pH may be control by varying the wavelength of the visible light input. This pH change governs the interaction between the Zn2+ cation and two competing anionic chiral ligands, detected by a change in circular dichroism (CD) spectra. Variation of the relative proportions of the photoacids allows the construction of an AND/OR logic gate and a wavelength detector.








Abstract
Color vision relies on selective, reversible isomerization by visible light of a mixture of retinyl chromophores in photoreceptor cells. Synthetic molecular mimics of this wavelength&#8208;dependent induction of function are rare, despite the attractiveness of controlling chemical processes solely by the wavelength of incident light. Here, we report a color&#8208;responsive chemical system that is composed of a cationic receptor complex, two competing chiral anionic ligands, and two metastable photoacids with contrasting absorption properties. Tricyanofuran photoacids are synthesized with absorption maxima of varying wavelengths across the whole visible spectrum. Protons released by the photoacids upon selective&#160;irradiation reversibly mask the more basic receptor&#8208;bound ligand, leading to ligand exchange that can be observed as a shift in the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the reporter complex. A &#8776;90&#160;nm separation between the absorbance maxima of the photoacids allowed each to be selectively photoisomerized in the presence of the other. The concentration of released protons, and hence the magnitude of the shift in CD response, are controlled by changing the wavelength of the incident visible light. Different output behaviors (OR/AND logic gates and wavelength detection) are programmed into the system by varying the relative proportions of the photoacids.

         <title>Synthesis of Linear and Cyclic Poly(allenamer)s by Powerful Cyclic&#8211;Alkyl&#8211;Amino&#8211;Carbene (CAAC) Ruthenium Catalysts and Facile Post&#8208;modification</title>

         <dc:description>
We synthesized linear/cyclic poly(allenamer)s (PAs) from cycloallenes by CAAC&#8208;Ru catalysts. Mechanism studies suggested CAAC ligands enhanced the stability of propagating Ru vinylidene, producing various PAs with TON up to 1360 and Mn up to 549&#160;kDa. Their cyclic structure has been characterized by MALS SEC with viscometer. Controlled ROMP of one &#945;&#8208;OTBS cycloallene was achieved using Grubbs G3 catalyst. Lastly, we disclosed facile post&#8208;modifications on PAs with 1&#176; and 2&#176; alcohols in excellent efficiency and selectivity. 








Abstract
Cyclic polymers are very attractive due to their unique properties; however, so far, they have simple and less reactive backbone structures due to synthetic limitations, restricting their further post&#8208;modification. Notably, allenes present a potentially useful platform in polymer chemistry due to their well&#8208;established toolbox in organic chemistry. Nevertheless, the biggest challenge remains in synthesizing poly(allenamer)s with high allene contents or polymerization efficiency, as well as synthesizing different types of cyclic poly(allenamer)s. Herein, we synthesized linear and cyclic poly(allenamer)s via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and ring&#8208;expansion metathesis polymerization (REMP), employing highly efficient cyclic&#8211;alkyl&#8211;amino&#8211;carbene (CAAC) ruthenium catalysts. Mechanistic studies suggested CAAC ligands enhanced stability of propagating Ru vinylidene, enabling various linear and cyclic poly(allenamer)s with turnover number up to 1360 and molecular weight reaching 549&#160;kDa. Their cyclic architecture was thoroughly characterized by multiangle light scattering size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (MALS SEC) with viscometer. Moreover, controlled ROMP of a highly reactive &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic allene was achieved using third&#8208;generation Grubbs' catalyst. Finally, we demonstrated highly efficient and selective post&#8208;modifications on poly(allenamer)s with primary and secondary alcohols. This broadens the scope of cyclic polymers with improved efficiency and structural control, affording a practical platform for diverse macromolecules.

         <title>LIBX&#8208;A401: A Novel Selective Inhibitor of Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) and Its Binding Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of LIBX&#8208;A401, a potent and selective ACSL4 inhibitor derived from rosiglitazone is reported. HDX&#8208;MS reveals that LIBX&#8208;A401 stabilizes the ACSL4 C&#8208;terminus and alters the fatty acid (FA) gate domain. Consistently, photoaffinity labeling, molecular dynamics, and mutagenesis identify key binding residues within the FA pocket. LIBX&#8208;A401 also exhibits ACSL4&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;ferroptotic properties in cells, supporting its therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Acyl&#8208;coenzyme A synthetase long&#8208;chain family member 4 (ACSL4), a pivotal enzyme in lipid metabolism, has emerged as a therapeutic target for ferroptosis&#8208;related conditions and cancer. However, its reference inhibitor, rosiglitazone, has off&#8208;target activity on peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#947;), a key regulator of lipid homeostasis. Here, the discovery of LIBX&#8208;A401, a potent ACSL4 inhibitor derived from rosiglitazone devoid of PPAR&#947; activity, is reported. Its binding to ACSL4 is ATP&#8208;dependent, stabilizing the C&#8208;terminal domain and altering the fatty acid gate region, as shown by Hydrogen&#8208;Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry. Photoaffinity labeling identified A329 within the fatty acid binding site, while molecular dynamics and mutagenesis highlighted Q302 as critical for LIBX&#8208;A401 binding. LIBX&#8208;A401 exhibits anti&#8208;ferroptotic properties in cells, supported by target engagement. These findings establish LIBX&#8208;A401 as a valuable tool to study ACSL4 in ferroptosis and cancer, while its elucidated binding mode paves the way for the rational design of improved inhibitors.

         <title>Realization of Tunable Ferroelectricity in Perovskite Crystals for Multidirectional Self&#8208;Driven Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper investigates the design of 2D perovskite ferroelectrics OA2Csn&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 with layer&#8208;dependent properties. Importantly, the unique multiaxial polarization combined with the enhanced transport of photon&#8208;generated carrier enables OA2Cs2Pb3Br10 to show high&#8208;performance self&#8208;driven photodetection in multiple directions. The study presents a layer&#8208;regulation strategy to efficiently regulate ferroelectric polarization for next&#8208;generation intelligent photodetection.








Abstract
Halide perovskite ferroelectrics endowed with a distinctive spontaneous polarization effect have been regarded as prospective electroactive materials and are prevalently utilized in solar cells, photoelectric detection, and other domains. Among them, multipolar&#8208;axis ferroelectrics featuring multiple equivalent polarization directions are particularly desirable for diverse areas of applications. Nevertheless, the design and regulation of multipolar axis perovskite ferroelectrics remains a significant challenge. Here, guided by the strategy of layer regulation, we successfully designed and regulated a series of 2D homologous perovskites OA2Csn&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 (OA&#160;=&#160;n&#8208;octylammonium, n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;3). Notably, OA2Csn&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 exhibits layer&#8208;dependent ferroelectricity: OA2PbBr4 exhibits non&#8208;ferroelectricity, OA2CsPb2Br7 displays uniaxial ferroelectricity, while OA2Cs2Pb3Br10 has multiaxial ferroelectricity. Moreover, the devices fabricated based on OA2Cs2Pb3Br10 achieve high&#8208;performance self&#8208;driven photodetection in multiple directions. This precise layer&#8208;regulation strategy offers an efficient approach to obtaining and regulating multipolar&#8208;axis perovskite ferroelectrics, presenting the potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Isotope Techniques in Chemical Wastewater Treatment: Opportunities and Uncertainties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we would first introduce basic knowledge about isotopic compounds and then scrutinize the physical and chemical influence induced by isotope changes. Special attention will be paid to the uncertainties in explaining the isotope results. Next, the implications in kinetic isotope effects (KIE, including solvent and nonsolvent KIE) and element tracing will be individually discussed. Notably, the combination of isotope techniques with EPR, infrared, Raman, and DFT calculation will be summarized. Finally, the limitations and outlooks will be proposed.








Abstract
A comprehensive and in&#8208;depth analysis of reaction mechanisms is essential for advancing chemical water treatment technologies. However, due to the limitations of conventional experimental and analytical methods, the types of reactive species and their generation pathways are commonly debatable in many aqueous systems. As highly sensitive diagnostic tools, isotope techniques offer deeper insights with minimal interference from reaction conditions. Nevertheless, precise interpretations of isotope results remain a significant challenge. Herein, we first scrutinized the fundamentals of isotope chemistry and highlighted key changes induced by the isotope substitution. Next, we discussed the application of isotope techniques in kinetic isotope effects, presenting a roadmap for interpreting KIE in sophisticated systems. Furthermore, we summarized the applications of isotope techniques in elemental tracing to pinpoint reaction sites and identify dominant reactive species. Lastly, we propose future research directions, highlighting critical considerations for the rational design and interpretation of isotope experiments in environmental chemistry and related fields.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the conditions of Scholl reactions has enabled the selective synthesis of polycyclic arenes with two related &#960;&#8208;skeletons. One &#960;&#8208;skeleton is a key fragment of theoretical carbon schwarzites, while the other is a triple [6]helicene, which exhibits unique supramolecular structures in the clathrate with chloroform and an absorption dissymmetry factor of 0.015. Both &#960;&#8208;skeletons were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT calculations.








Abstract
This study explores two structurally related &#960;&#8208;skeletons. The &#960;&#8208;skeleton of compounds 1a&#8211;e containing three heptagons represents a key fragment in theoretical carbon schwarzites, while that of 2a&#8211;b is a triple [6]helicene. Compounds 1a&#8211;e were synthesized via Scholl reactions, and using a weaker acid allowed the reaction to stop at an intermediate stage, yielding 2a&#8211;b. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed not only distinct stereochemistry of 1b and 2a but also unique supramolecular assemblies in the clathrate of 2a with chloroform. Compound 1b adopts a saddle&#8208;like geometry, while 2a exhibits a propeller&#8208;like structure with C3 symmetry, consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The &#960;&#8208;skeleton of 1a&#8211;e is flexible, enabling rapid enantiomerization, whereas that of 2a&#8211;b is rigid, allowing resolution of 2b into optically pure forms with an absorption dissymmetry factor as high as 0.015. Comparative analysis shows that presence of seven&#8208;membered rings in 1a&#8211;e does not significantly alter the local aromaticity of the triple [6]helicene framework.

         <title>Using Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry to Examine the Effects of Porosity and Catalyst&#8208;Support Interactions on CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous framework materials and carbon nanotubes are often used to immobilize molecular electrocatalysts. Herein, we employ metalloporphyrin nanocages (M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Co) and their host&#8208;guest complexes with C60/C70 as discrete counterparts to these hybrid catalytic materials. The cages achieve high current densities for reducing CO2 to CO at low overpotentials, and performance can be improved by fullerene guests, suggesting that porosity is not needed for good activity. 








Abstract
Bis&#8208;porphyrin nanocages (M2BiCage, M&#160;=&#160;FeCl, Co, Zn) and their host&#8208;guest complexes with C60 and C70 were used to examine how molecular porosity and interactions with carbon nanomaterials affect the CO2 reduction activity of metalloporphyrin electrocatalysts. The cages were found to adsorb on carbon black to provide electrocatalytic inks with excellent accessibilities of the metal sites (&#8776;50%) even at high metal loadings (2500&#160;nmol cm&#8722;2), enabling good activity for reducing CO2 to CO. A complex of C70 bound inside (FeCl)2BiCage achieves high current densities for CO formation at low overpotentials (|jCO| &gt;7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, &#951; = 320&#160;mV; &gt;13.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, &#951; = 520&#160;mV) with &#8805;95% Faradaic efficiency (FECO), and Co2BiCage achieves high turnover frequencies (&#8776;1300&#160;h&#8722;1, &#951; = 520&#160;mV) with 90% FECO. In general, blocking the pore with C60 or C70 improves the catalytic performance of (FeCl)2BiCage and has only small effects on Co2BiCage, indicating that the good catalytic properties of the cages cannot be attributed to their internal pores. Neither enhanced electron transfer rates nor metal&#8208;fullerene interactions appear to underlie the ability of C60/C70 to improve the performance of (FeCl)2BiCage, in contrast to effects often proposed for other carbon nanosupports.

         <title>Electronegative Strategic Positions in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Unlocking High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs with an electronegative skeleton designed for selective gold recovery. The hexaazatriphenylene centers, imine linkages, and pyridine linkers generate electron&#8208;rich sites at strategic positions&#8212;vertex, linkages, and linkers&#8212;thereby enhancing the structural integrity of the framework. These features enable efficient gold capture, providing high&#8208;adsorption capacity and fast kinetics through electrostatic interactions, making the COFs highly effective for selective gold recovery.








Abstract
Gold (Au) concentrations accumulated from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) and industrial leachates far surpass those found in natural ores, a highly valuable resource if efficient recovery methods can be developed. Despite advancements in covalent organic frameworks (COFs), achieving adsorbents with high selectivity, large capacity, and rapid adsorption kinetics remain challenging because of limitations in partial pore wall sites. Here, we present hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs (HATP&#8208;COFs) with an electronegative skeleton, specifically designed for selective Au recovery. The hexaazatriphenylene centers, imine linkages, and pyridine linkers within the COFs introduce electron&#8208;rich sites that extend across strategic positions&#8212;vertex, linkages, and linkers&#8212;thereby enhancing the overall structural integrity. These features facilitate efficient Au capture through electrostatic interactions, achieving an exceptional adsorption capacity exceeding 2366&#160;mg g&#8722;1 with rapid kinetics, making HATP&#8208;COFs one of the most efficient pure COFs reported to date. Moreover, these HATP&#8208;COFs demonstrate remarkable selectivity, stability, and scalability. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electronegative skeleton introduces critical binding sites, promoting strong electrostatic interactions with Au3+ ions and improving adsorption kinetics. This work highlights the potential of charge&#8208;interface engineering in COFs as a transformative strategy for developing next&#8208;generation materials.

         <title>Energy Efficiency Limit in CO&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electroreduction and the Method to Advance Toward</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient CO&#8208;electroreduction system featuring high active&#8208;site density with nanometer intersite spacings is designed, which achieves an ultralow full&#8208;cell potential of 1.87&#160;V with CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ and CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 energy efficiencies &gt;50% and 40%, C2+ and C2H4 Faradaic efficiencies &gt;90% and 70% in a 25&#160;cm2 membrane electrode assembly at 4&#160;A.








Abstract
The electrified synthesis of high&#8208;demand feedstocks (C2H4) from CO and H2O through a CO electroreduction (COR) protocol is attractive for large&#8208;scale applications; however, a high reaction potential and modest Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) limit its practical energy efficiency (EE). In this study, a quantitative reaction&#8211;transport model was constructed to analyze the root causes of low performance in COR, which revealed low volumetric exchange current density and limited intermediate surface reaction as key factors, constraining CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ and CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion energetics and selectivities. Consequently, a robust, high active&#8208;site density electrode, featuring nanometer&#8208;scale interspacing between the active, Nafion&#8208;wrapped Cu+&#8211;Cu nanosheet catalysts, was designed. This design increases volumetric COR activity with an efficient intermediate surface reaction mechanism for C2H4 production, substantially lowering the full&#8208;cell COR potential to 1.87&#160;V at 4&#160;A in a 25&#160;cm2 membrane electrode assembly, thereby achieving a record &gt;50% C2+ EE with a 90&#160;&#177;&#160;1% FE along with a &gt;40% C2H4 EE with a 71&#160;&#177;&#160;1% FE throughout stable &gt;100&#160;h operation.

     alt="Energy Efficiency Limit in CO-to-Ethylene Electroreduction and the Method to Advance Toward"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient CO-electroreduction system featuring high active-site density with nanometer intersite spacings is designed, which achieves an ultralow full-cell potential of 1.87&#160;V with CO-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; and CO-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; energy efficiencies &amp;gt;50% and 40%, C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiencies &amp;gt;90% and 70% in a 25&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; membrane electrode assembly at 4&#160;A.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrified synthesis of high-demand feedstocks (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) from CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O through a CO electroreduction (COR) protocol is attractive for large-scale applications; however, a high reaction potential and modest Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) limit its practical energy efficiency (EE). In this study, a quantitative reaction&#8211;transport model was constructed to analyze the root causes of low performance in COR, which revealed low volumetric exchange current density and limited intermediate surface reaction as key factors, constraining CO-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; and CO-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion energetics and selectivities. Consequently, a robust, high active-site density electrode, featuring nanometer-scale interspacing between the active, Nafion-wrapped Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Cu nanosheet catalysts, was designed. This design increases volumetric COR activity with an efficient intermediate surface reaction mechanism for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production, substantially lowering the full-cell COR potential to 1.87&#160;V at 4&#160;A in a 25&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; membrane electrode assembly, thereby achieving a record &amp;gt;50% C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; EE with a 90&#160;&#177;&#160;1% FE along with a &amp;gt;40% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; EE with a 71&#160;&#177;&#160;1% FE throughout stable &amp;gt;100&#160;h operation. Similarly designed high-volumetric-activity Bi and Ag nanosheet catalysts enabled &amp;gt;60% and &amp;gt;55% EEs for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-formate and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO electroreduction, demonstrating the broader applicability of our electrochemical activity and EE enhancement concept on a three-phase interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescent Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared chemiluminescent probes with the advantages of deep&#8208;tissue permeability, free autofluorescence, and structural diversity have attracted growing attention for disease theranostics. This review discusses the molecular design strategies for these probes, with the highlight of their biomarker activity for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Molecular chemiluminescence probes with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offer promising benefits in deciphering complex pathological processes in a living system, as NIR chemiluminescence minimizes autofluorescence, enhances deep&#8208;tissue penetration, and improves signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Molecular engineering using single&#8208;luminophore design and dual&#8208;luminophore design with intramolecular energy transfer provides ways to develop conventional chemiluminophore scaffolds into NIR chemiluminescence probes with ideal chemiluminescence quantum yield and half&#8208;life. By virtue of the structural diversity, 1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;based NIR chemiluminophores with biomarker activity have been developed. This review summarizes the molecular design strategies of NIR chemiluminescence theranostic probes (NCTPs), followed by introducing activatable NCTPs with their biomedical applications for disease theranostics. Lastly, future perspectives and potential challenges of NIR chemiluminescence imaging in preclinical research and clinical translational potential are discussed.

         <title>Switching Products Selectivity in Electrocatalytic C(sp3)&#8208;H Bonds Activation and CO2 Carboxylation via Cu&#8208;S Bond Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds activation along with CO2 carboxylation to prepare high&#8208;value carboxylic acids is a sustainable route for achieving the carbon&#8208;neutral goal, but the current catalytic performance is far from satisfying the demand. Targeting this problem, it was found that crystal engineering of Cu&#8208;S bonds not only significantly enhanced the activity of C(sp3)&#8208;H activation and CO2 carboxylation in an electrocatalytic system, but also efficiently realized chemoselectivity in the CO2 carboxylation process. Specifically, hexagonal CuS(001) electrocatalyst could readily achieve C(sp3)&#8208;H bond activation of alkanes and aromatics along with CO2 carboxylation, exhibiting almost complete chemoselectivity to carbon chain increased monocarboxylation acids. Intriguingly, hexagonal Cu2S(110) electrocatalyst, which was prepared by phase transition, could realize highly selective alkanes and aromatics dicarboxylation with CO2 to produce dicarboxylation acids. Notably, biomass compound 2&#8208;methylfuran was efficiently converted into furan&#8208;2&#8208;acetic acid over CuS(001); while 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran was quantitatively converted to the degradable polymer precursor furan&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid over Cu2S(110). Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) results revealed the origin of differences in the activity and chemoselectivity over CuS(001) and Cu2S(110) catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Spectral Range in T2&#8208;Supertetrahedral Nonlinear Optical Chalcogenides via Incorporating Inorganic Polycations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;chalcogenide supertetrahedral clusters that exhibit significant hyperpolarizability are highly sought after as promising nonlinear optical (NLO) function modules. However, these &#8220;naked&#8221; anionic clusters are commonly coordinated with organic ligands to maintain electrical neutrality, which unfortunately limits their utility in the mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared (MFIR) region due to strong absorption. In this study, we successfully substituted the organic ligand with the unprecedented (X4K8Ba2)8+ supertetrahedral cations that are suitable size and high charge and integrated them with (In4Se10)8&#8722; supertetrahedral clusters to form three&#8208;dimessional (3D) salt&#8208;inclusion chalcogenides (SICs) [K4BaX2][In6Se11] (X = Cl, Br). As anticipated, the parallel arrangement of the (In4Se10)8&#8722; clusters yielded splendid second&#8208;harmonic generation intensities (2.2&#8211;2.4 &#215; benchmark AgGaS2 @1910 nm), ranking among the top within the SICs category. Most importantly, the introduction of inorganic polycations with broad cut&#8208;off IR edge is a key factor in enabling 1 to achieve an ultrawide transparency range (0.7 to 18.1 &#181;m) that covers the crucial atmospheric windows (3&#8211;5 and 8&#8211;14 &#181;m). Indeed, replacing the organic ligand with an inorganic polycation allows supertetrahedra&#8208;based chalcogenides to fulfill the broad&#8208;spectrum criteria of NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions for the Binding of CO by a Weakly Lewis Acidic Borane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Known boron carbonyl complexes either exploit very high Lewis acidity or a low oxidation state boron centre in order to capture CO. By contrast, we report a carbonyl complex featuring a simple&#160;tri&#8208;coordinate borane, characterized by a Lewis acidity which is only marginally higher than B(NMe2)3. {(Ph2P)xanth}3B&#160;features a solid&#8208;state structure in which two of the three B&#8208;bound xanth(PPh2) units are projected above the BC3plane, generating an&#160;up,up,down&#160;conformation. Quantum chemical methods, however, reveal that the alternative&#160;up,up,up&#160;alignment, characterized by a cage&#8208;like geometry and enhanced intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions, is favoured significantly&#160;in silico&#160;(by ca. 33.0 kcal mol&#8208;1). While this conformation is optimal for binding polar&#160;C3&#8208;symmetric H&#8208;bond donors such as NH3&#160;(and related guests such as H2O and MeNH2) the binding of essentially non&#8208;polar substrates such as CO would be expected to be weak at best.&#160;However, exposure of {(Ph2P)xanth}3B to CO under mild conditions (1 bar, 25&#176;C) reversibly yields {(Ph2P)xanth}3B&#183;CO, a tractable cage&#8208;like borane carbonyl adduct featuring a central BCO moiety shrouded by&#160;xanth(PPh2)&#160;moieties. Dispersion forces are critical to substrate binding: the two binding modes in which the B&#8208;bound CO guest is located inside/outside the host cage differ in energy by 59.5 kcal mol&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohol Self&#8208;Aggregation: the Preferred Configurations of the Ethanol Trimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isomers of the ethanol trimer were identified by their rotational spectra aided by extensive quantum chemical calculations. All aggregates show cyclic structures linking the &#8722;OH groups through O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds, and additional C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. Gauche ethanol conformations are prevalent but there is no homochirality synchronization. Our results underscore the critical changes involved in alcohol aggregation as size increases.







Abstract
An atomic&#8208;level knowledge of the aggregation of archetypal molecular systems is essential to accurately model supramolecular structures and the transition from gas to liquid phase. The structures and forces involved in ethanol aggregation have been investigated using microwave spectroscopy and extensive quantum chemical calculations. Four isomers of the ethanol trimer have been observed and identified based on comparisons between experimental and predicted spectroscopic parameters, and considering collisional relaxation in the supersonic expansion. All observed isomers exhibit O&#8722;H

O hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups forming a six&#8208;membered ring. Additionally, secondary C&#8722;H

H dispersion contacts participate in the stabilization of the complexes with remarkably similar energy contributions. Structures where there is a mixture of gauche and trans conformations of ethanol are favored, with gauche conformations being predominant and no evidence of homochirality synchronization. Our results underscore the critical changes involved in aggregation as the size of the system increases and shed light on the unique properties and behavior of ethanol in chemical and biological systems.

         <title>Simultaneous Fabrication of P and M Helices in One&#8208;Component Chiral System by Methanol&#8208;Water Mediated Dual Assembly Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system. The conformation of L&#8208;phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH3OH. Addition of H2O into above CH3OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self&#8208;assembly pathways, due to the synchronous process of 1)&#8197;self&#8208;assembly of folded LBpyF into M&#8208;helices and 2)&#8197;H2O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self&#8208;assembly of them into P&#8208;helices.







Abstract
The synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures stemmed from same building units is ubiquitous in nature and vital to living systems, but achieving it in artificial systems remains a challenge. Herein, we report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system. The conformation of l&#8208;phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH3OH due to the hydrogen bonds as well as C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between LBpyF and CH3OH. Addition of H2O into above CH3OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self&#8208;assembly pathways and double networks of P and M helices were therefore formed, due to the synchronous process of 1)&#8197;self&#8208;assembly of folded LBpyF into M&#8208;helices and 2)&#8197;H2O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self&#8208;assembly of them into P&#8208;helices. The bipyridine core, phenyl ring, amide unit all adapted into different stacking modes in M&#8208;helices and P&#8208;helices, and energy analysis indicated that the minority M&#8208;helices were more thermodynamically favored products. This study provides an approach to explore synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures by manipulating the multiple assembly pathway.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Characterization of Native Bacterial Biofilms via Dynamic Nuclear Polarization&#8208;Enhanced Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms cause persistent infections and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. We utilized for the first time hyperpolarized DNP solid&#8208;state NMR to structurally characterize native bacterial biofilm. We collected 1D/2D spectra within seconds/minutes and detected polysaccharide, protein and other signals. These structural information will boost structure&#8208;guided approaches for combating biofilm&#8208;forming microbes.







Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are major contributors to persistent infections and antimicrobial resistance, posing significant challenges to treatment. However, obtaining high&#8208;resolution structural information on native bacterial biofilms has remained elusive due to the methodological limitations associated with analyzing complex biological samples. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) has shown promise in this regard, but its conventional application is hindered by sensitivity constraints for unlabeled samples. In this study, we utilized high&#8208;sensitivity Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) ssNMR to characterize native Pseudomonas fluorescens colony biofilms. The ~75&#8208;fold sensitivity enhancement provided by DNP enabled structural characterization without isotope labeling or chemical/physical modification. We successfully collected 1D 13C/15N, and 2D 1H&#8722;13C, 1H&#8722;15N and 13C&#8722;13C ssNMR spectra within seconds, minutes or hours, facilitating the identification and quantification of biofilm extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Additionally, DNP ssNMR allowed quantitative detection of both flexible and rigid biofilm components by favorable freezing conditions. This study represents the first application of ultrasensitive DNP ssNMR to characterize a native bacterial biofilm, significantly expanding the capabilities of ssNMR for analyzing the composition and structure of a wide array of in&#8197;vitro and ex&#8197;vivo biofilms. The versatility of this approach will accelerate structure&#8208;guided efforts to combat infections caused by biofilm&#8208;forming microbes.

         <title>Mechanics&#8208;Photophysics Correlation in Tough, Stretchable and Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescence Ionogels Deciphered by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) spectra to establish mechanics&#8208;DMA&#8208;photophysics correlation for ionogels. This resembles parallel and sequential processing of human brain from sensation to cognition. This work provides an enabling strategy towards the early indication of performance of ionogels without laborious characterization.







Abstract
The development of tough, stretchable and long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials holds great significance for manufacturing and processing photoluminescent materials, but limited techniques are available to profile their mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation. Here we report glassy ionogels, and their mechanical properties and photophysical properties are fused by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), functioning like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking sensory perception and cognition. Depending on two special temperatures presented in DMA curves, Tloss (the peak of loss modulus (E&#8221;)) and Tg (glass transition temperature), the ionogels can vary from being either tough with persistent phosphorescence, extensible with effective phosphorescence or resilience with inefficient phosphorescence. Leveraging this method, we achieve stretchable and long&#8208;lived RTP ionogels with tensile yield strength of 53&#8197;MPa, tensile strain of 497&#8201;%, Young's modulus of 782&#8197;MPa, toughness of 111.2&#8197;MJ/m3, and lifetime of 113.05&#8197;ms. Our work provides a simple yet powerful method to reveal the mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation of RTP ionogels, to predict their performance without laborious synthesis and characterization, opening new avenues for applications of RTP materials, including applications in harsh conditions (257&#8197;K or 347&#8197;K), shape memory and shape reconstruction.

         <title>Diastereoselective Polypseudorotaxane Formation with Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Co&#8208;crystallization Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective polypseudorotaxane formation was achieved through the simple co&#8208;crystallization of a diastereomeric pillar[5]arene macrocycle and poly(ethylene glycol). During the co&#8208;crystallization process, the concentration gradually increased, allowing the pillar[5]arene and poly(ethylene glycol) to assemble closely. Consequently, the matched packing of the pillar[5]arene side chains facilitated the cooperative arrangement of pillar[5]arenes with the same chirality along the polymer chain.







Abstract
As the number of chiral ring molecules in chiral polyrotaxane increases, the number of possible stereoisomers exponentially increases. Consequently, the selective synthesis of a specific stereoisomer becomes much more challenging. To address this problem, we co&#8208;crystallized poly(ethylene glycol) and a diastereomeric ring molecule, pillar[5]arene, in the solid state. The co&#8208;crystallization formed polypseudorotaxanes with a high diastereomeric excess (ca. 88&#8201;% de), meaning that polypseudorotaxanes containing (S, pS) stereoisomer pillar[5]arene rings were synthesized selectively. By contrast, in solution and evaporation systems, the selectivity remained low (ca. 10&#8201;% de). The results suggested that the packing effect by the co&#8208;crystallization contributed to the denser assembly of ring molecules on the polymeric chain, resulting in the diastereoselective formation. High diastereoselectivity was also observed even in higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(ethylene glycol)s. These selectivities arose from the cooperative effects of the ring molecules on the polymeric chain, which were supported by calculating the stabilization energy.

         <title>Optimized Adsorption of Had and OHad over Amorphous SrRuPtOxHy Nanobelts towards Efficient Alkaline Fuel Cell Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a new class of amorphous SrRuPtOxHy nanobelts (a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs) with excellent performance towards alkaline HOR and AEMFCs. Electrochemical experiments and calculations collectively show that a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs have optimized HBE and OHBE as well as low HOR barrier, which all greatly improve the HOR efficiency.







Abstract
PtRu&#8208;based catalysts toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) suffer from low efficiency, CO poisoning and over&#8208;oxidation at high potentials. In this work, an amorphization strategy is adopted for preparation of amorphous SrRuPtOxHy nanobelts (a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs). The a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs has optimized adsorption of intermediates (H and OH), increased number of active sites, highly weakened CO poisoning and enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation ability owing to the special amorphous structure. Consequently, a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs displays superior HOR performance with a mass activity of 7.5&#8197;A/mgPt+Ru, 25 and 5&#8197;times of that of SrRuPt(OH)x NBs and commercial PtRu/C, respectively, and long&#8208;lasting stability. Besides, a peak power density of 750&#8197;mW/cm2 and a specific power of 14.8&#8197;W/mgPt+Ru have been achieved for a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs at a low loading of 0.05&#8197;mgPt+Ru/cm2, surpassing many reported HOR catalysts. Mechanism investigation indicates that Pt and Ru are present in oxide/hydroxide forms and H in a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs participates in HOR. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that there are three catalytic mechanisms participating in a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs, which all exhibit low catalytic barrier and highly improved HOR efficiency. This work provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts towards fuel cells.

         <title>Artificial Gold Enzymes Using a Genetically Encoded Thiophenol&#8208;Based Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Binding Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of artificial metalloenzymes containing genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding sites featuring a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, which serves as an excellent soft ligand for binding various noble metals, was developed. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised, confirming gold binding to the thiophenol, and successfully applied in catalytic hydroamination reactions.







Abstract
Incorporating noble metals in artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) is challenging due to the lack of suitable soft coordinating ligands among natural amino acids. We present a new class of ArMs featuring a genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding site based on a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, 4&#8208;mercaptophenylalanine (pSHF), incorporated in the transcriptional regulator LmrR through stop codon suppression. We demonstrate that pSHF is an excellent ligand for noble metals in their low oxidation states. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and successfully catalysed hydroamination reactions of 2&#8208;ethynyl anilines with turnover numbers over 50. Interestingly, two equivalents of gold(I) per protein dimer proved to be required for activity. Up to 98&#8201;% regioselectivity in the hydroamination of an ethynylphenylurea substrate was observed, yielding the corresponding phenyl&#8208;dihydroquinazolinone product, consistent with a &#960;&#8208;activation mechanism by single gold centres. The ArM was optimized by site saturation mutagenesis using an on&#8208;bead screening protocol. This resulted in a single mutant that showed higher activity for one class of substrates. This work brings the power of noble&#8208;metal catalysis into the realm of enzyme engineering and establishes thiophenols as alternative ligands for noble metals, providing new opportunities in coordination chemistry and catalysis.

         <title>Reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;Compatible Supercapacitor&#8208;Diode Empowering Computation Efficiency for Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By empowering the supercapacitor function into the diode, the reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;compatible supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) and corresponding computing blocks effectively mimic the biological system: Unidirectional ion flow is mimicked based on the significant capacitance difference; Dendritic computing is mimicked based on the tunable ion rectification; Neuromorphic computing is mimicked based on the volatile/nonvolatile charge&#8208;storage.







Abstract
Biological system utilizes unidirectional ion flow to produce and transmit signals. To realize bioinspired artificial intelligence and thus seamless human&#8208;machine interaction, ion rectification devices should be developed. Here, a reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;compatible supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) is developed by resettling the pseudo&#8208;capacitive and electrochemical&#8208;double&#8208;layer&#8208;capacitive components of a lithium&#8208;ion pseudocapacitor into the positive and negative voltage regions respectively through engineering the redox peaks. This CAPode exhibits good ion rectification and charge&#8208;storage bifunction with high rectification ratio (RR) (RRI~20, RRII~0.83), large areal capacitance (17&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long cycling stability (5000 cycles). More importantly, two main computing paradigms in the biological system are efficiently realized based on this CAPode by empowering the supercapacitor function into the diode: (I) multivalued ionic logic gates are constructed based on the tunable ion rectification characteristics induced by the bifunction of this CAPode for mimicking the dendritic computing; (II) all&#8208;CAPode based reservoir computing is implemented based on the reconfigurable volatile and nonvolatile charge&#8208;storage characteristics of this CAPode for mimicking the neuromorphic computing. This work paves a new way towards seamless and high&#8208;efficiency human&#8208;machine interaction.

         <title>Mn Doping at High&#8208;Activity Octahedral Vacancies of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 for Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysis in Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8722;Fe2O3/CNT catalyst was synthesized by doping Mn into the highly active octahedral sites, and displays efficient and stable electrocatalytic performance for ORR and Metal&#8208;air batteries. The strong electron donating capability of octahedral sites and synergistic effect between Mn and Fe optimized reaction energy barriers, and the vacancies in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 located only at octahedral sites were confirmed by the clarification doping sites of Mn.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 with the intrinsic cation vacancies is an ideal substrate for heteroatom doping into the highly active octahedral sites in spinel oxide catalysts. However, it is still a challenge to confirm the vacancy location of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 through experiments and obtain enhanced catalytic performance by preferential occupation of octahedral sites for heteroatom doping. Here, a Mn&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 incorporated with carbon nanotubes catalyst was developed to successfully achieve preferential doping into highly active octahedral sites by employing &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 as the precursor. Further, the vacancy in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 was only located on octahedral sites rather than tetrahedral ones, which was first proved by direct experimental evidence through the clarification doping sites of Mn. Notably, the catalyst shows outstanding activity towards oxygen reduction reaction with the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.82&#8197;V and 0.64&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, respectively, as well as the maximum power density of 179 mWcm&#8722;2 and 403 mWcm&#8722;2 for Mg&#8208;air batteries and Al&#8208;air batteries, respectively. It could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the doping Mn on octahedral sites and the substrate &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 along with the modification of the adsorption/desorption properties for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates as well as the optimization of the reaction energy barriers.

A fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) Scheme is introduced for precise quantification of individual interactions within complex molecular systems. Applications across diverse fields, encompassing protein&#8208;ligand binding energies and association energies in large biomolecular assemblies, showcase the versatility and broad applicability of this approach.







Abstract
We introduce the fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) scheme for precise quantification of individual interactions contributing to the binding energy of arbitrary chemical entities, such as protein&#8208;ligand binding energies, lattice energies of molecular crystals, or association energies of large biomolecular assemblies. Using fp&#8208;LED, we can assess whether the contribution to the binding energy arising from noncovalent interactions between pairs of molecular fragments in any chemical system is attractive or repulsive, and accurately quantify its magnitude at the coupled cluster level &#8208; commonly considered as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of computational chemistry. Such insights are crucial for advancing molecular and material design strategies in fields like catalysis and therapeutic development. Illustrative applications across diverse fields demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of this theoretical framework, promising profound implications for fundamental understanding and practical applications.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Approach Enables RNA Aptamers to Function as Sensors for Reactive Inorganic Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activity&#8208;based light&#8208;up aptamer system was developed to enable a single RNA aptamer to detect non&#8208;fluorogenic and reactive inorganics. This method can easily turn E. coli into whole&#8208;cell sensors of redox species. Organic chemistry principles can advance aptamers by expanding their target scope without nucleic acid engineering or in vitro selection.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamer (FLAP) systems are promising (bio)sensing platforms that are genetically encodable. However, FLAP&#8208;mediated detection of each distinct target necessitates either in vitro selection or engineering of nucleic acid sequences. Furthermore, an aptamer that binds an inorganic target or a chemical species with a short lifetime is challenging to realize. Here, we describe a small&#8208;molecule approach that makes it possible for a single FLAP system to detect chemically unique, non&#8208;fluorogenic, and reactive inorganics. We developed functionalized pre&#8208;ligands of RNA aptamers that bind benzylidene imidazolinones (Baby Spinach, Broccolli, Squash). Reactive inorganics, hydrogen sulfide (H2S/HS&#8722;) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can specifically convert these pre&#8208;ligands into native ligands that fluoresce with FLAPs. Adaptation of this platform to live cells opened an opportunity for constructing whole&#8208;cell sensors: Escherichia coli transformed with a Baby Spinach&#8208;encoding plasmid and incubated with pre&#8208;ligands generated fluorescence in response to exogenous H2S/HS&#8722; or H2O2. Leveraging the functional group reactivity of small molecules eliminates the requirement of in vitro selection of a new aptamer sequence or oligonucleotide scaffold engineering for distinct molecular targets. Our method allows for detecting inorganic, short&#8208;lived species, thereby advancing FLAP systems beyond their current capabilities.

         <title>Isomerization&#8208;Controlled Aggregation in Photoactive Layer: An Additive Strategy for Organic Solar Cells with Over 19.5&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric molecules are employed as additives in organic photovoltaics. Stepwise regulations of acceptor aggregation are realized. Liquid additive LCB retards solvent evaporation, preventing excessive aggregation. Solid additive SCB shortens aggregation period, obtaining tight molecular stacking. While volatile solid additive VCB fine&#8208;tunes intermolecular interactions, achieving optimal molecular aggregation, which lead to significant efficiency enhancement of PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices up to 19.51%







Abstract
Morphology control of the photoactive layer is crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs), yet it remains a significant challenge in this field. One effective approach is the additive strategy, which fine&#8208;tunes the morphology of the photoactive layer. However, the underlying mechanisms governing the impact of different types of additives from liquid, solid, to volatile solid, on the bulk heterojunction morphology and device performance are not fully understood. Herein, we present an aggregation regulation strategy for acceptor molecules by incorporating three novel isomeric additives: 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene (LCB), 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene (SCB), and 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene (VCB) into the blend active layer. This approach optimizes the bulk heterojunction morphology and enhances the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Our results reveal that these additives induce stepwise regulation of acceptor molecule aggregation during film formation. The liquid additive LCB primarily extends solvent evaporation time, effectively preventing excessive aggregation, while the solid additive SCB significantly shortens the aggregation period during the film evolution, resulting in the most compact molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Furthermore, the volatile solid additive VCB fine&#8208;tunes the intermolecular interactions and crystallization within the active layer, promoting optimal molecular self&#8208;assembly and aggregation for ideal molecular stacking. Consequently, the power conversion efficiencies of 19.33&#8201;% and 19.51&#8201;% were achieved for the VCB&#8208;processed D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208; and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs, respectively, outperforming the LCB&#8208;processed and SCB&#8208;processed devices.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminophore Switches Photodynamic Processes via Protein Complexation for Biomarker&#8208;Activatable Cancer Therapy</title>

Near&#8208;infrared Type&#8208;I photodynamic chemiluminescent&#8208;protein complex (HEDPN) is designed which can be specifically activated by the tumor&#8208;overexpressed nitroreductase for chemiluminescence&#8208;guided PDT.







Abstract
Despite the potential in cancer therapy, phototheranostic agents often face two challenges: limited diagnostic sensitivity due to tissue autofluorescence and suboptimal therapeutic efficacy due to the Type&#8208;II photodynamic process with the heavy oxygen reliance. In contrast, chemiluminescent theranostic agents without the requirement of real&#8208;time light excitation can address the issue of tissue autofluorescence, which however have been rarely reported for photodynamic therapy (PDT), not to mention less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type&#8208;I PDT. In this work, we synthesize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophores with the specific binding towards human serum albumin (HSA) to form chemiluminophore&#8208;protein complex for cancer detection and photodynamic therapy. Interestingly, after the complexation with HSA, the chemiluminescence (CL) intensities of chemiluminophores are enhanced by over 10&#8208;fold; meanwhile, the photodynamic process switches from Type&#8208;II (singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;generation dominated) to Type&#8208;I (superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical dominated), while the previously reported activated chemiluminophore with non&#8208;specific HSA binding can't switch photodynamic process. Based on the optimal chemiluminophore, a nitroreductase&#8208;activatable CL probe&#8208;protein complex is synthesized, which specially turns on its CL and Type&#8208;I PDT in hypoxic tumors for precision therapy. Thus, this study provides a complexation strategy to improve phototheranostic performance of chemiluminophores.

         <title>Enhanced Stability and Properties of Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Copolymers through Engineered Coupled Equilibria
</title>

         <dc:description>
Replacing an ester by an ether function in the side chain of a chiral benzene1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer (magenta and red disks, resp.) greatly favours its copolymerization with achiral BTA monomers (green disk), due to the minimization of competing species. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit greater stability which translates into better catalytic and rheological properties.







Abstract
Improving the stability of multi&#8208;component and functional assemblies such as supramolecular copolymers without impeding their dynamicity is key for their implementation as innovative materials. Up to now, this has been achieved by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach, requiring the time&#8208;consuming characterization of a series of supramolecular coassemblies. We report herein that this is possible to significantly enhance the stability of supramolecular copolymers by a minimal change in the chemical nature of one of the interacting monomers. This is achieved by replacing an ester function by an ether function in the structure of a chiral benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, used as &#8220;sergeant&#8221;, coassembled with achiral monomers, the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;. Pseudo&#8208;phase diagrams, constructed by probing the nature of the coassemblies with multifarious analytical techniques, confirm that the greater stability of the resulting copolymers is mainly due to the minimization of competing species. This leads to better rheological and catalytic properties of the corresponding supramolecular copolymers. Favouring coassembly over undesired assembly pathways must be considered as a blueprint for the development of better&#8208;performing supramolecular multi&#8208;component systems.

         <title>A Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Radical Emission System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems have been built by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. The ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer and ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer effects between metal compounds and organic radicals endow these systems&#8217; multi&#8208;band and multiple stimulus&#8208;response emissions. In addition, such materials have been used to detect radioactive metal ions.







Abstract
Developing new organic radical emission systems and regulating their luminescence properties presents a significant challenge. Herein, we build dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. After the assembling, dual&#8208;band, and excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emission was observed upon ultraviolet light irradiation, one emission band originates from carbonyl radical after light irradiation, the other band from the ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) state, which benefits from the charge transfer from the radicals to the metal salts. The dual emission centers also introduce excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties for the molecules. In addition, three&#8208;band emission covering the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions can be shown when two or three kinds of metal ions are simultaneously doped into the radical system driven by the ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT). Interestingly, visible light can quickly quench the radical emission of systems, thus realizing a dynamic luminescence. The LMMCT effect and strong supramolecular interactions significantly improve the photoluminescence quantum yield by up to 67.2&#8201;%. Moreover, such materials can be successfully used for detecting radioactive metal ions and information encryption. This study develops a platform for manufacturing various metal&#8208;organic radical emission systems with diverse properties.

         <title>Conditional Relay Activation of Theranostic Prodrug by Pretargeting Bioorthogonal Trigger and Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

We devise a click&#8208;photo&#8208;activatable theranostic prodrug platform exemplified by tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;conjugated SN&#8208;38 prodrug 1 with masked fluorescence, low cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an IEDDA reaction between the tetrazine unit on the prodrug and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) on the tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation to liberate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells.







Abstract
Bioorthogonalized light&#8208;responsive click&#8208;and&#8208;uncage platform has enabled precise cell surface engineering and timed payload release, but most of such photoactivatable prodrugs have &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; photoactivity leading to the dark toxicity. On the other hand, the conditionally activatable photocage is limited to the application of fluorogenic probe/photosensitizer liberation. Herein, we devise a conditionally activatable theranostic platform based on the tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) construct, in which tetrazine serves as a quencher motif to disable both the fluorescence and photoresponsivity of BODIPY. The uncaged BODIPY upon the bioorthogonal transformation of the tetrazine reinstates fluorescence on&#8208;target to guide the subsequent visible light irradiation thereby releasing the therapeutic payload in situ. The proof of concept for such &#8220;light where is lit up&#8221;&#8208;activated theranostics was demonstrated by the tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY conjugated SN&#8208;38 (1) with masked fluorescence, up to 70&#8197;times&#8208;reduced cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction between tetrazine unit on 1 and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) as a pretargeted trigger on tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation (500&#8211;520&#8197;nm) to activate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells, offering high spatiotemporal precision of disease diagnosis and therapy.

The Scholl reaction has been used for the selective synthesis of two different boron&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems: an unexpected spiro&#8208;formation via dearomatization as well as the desired 575&#8208;ringed &#960;&#8208;extension via cyclodehydrogenation. The two products have fully distinct chemical reactivities, electronic structures, and photophysical properties.







Abstract
Incorporation of heteroatoms and/or non&#8208;hexagonal rings into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can alter their intrinsic structures and physical properties. However, it is challenging to construct PAHs featuring boron/carbon composition and non&#8208;hexagonal combination. Herein, we disclose the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;type and pentagon/heptagon&#8208;containing boron&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems by the Scholl reaction. Two spiro&#8208;fused organoboranes 1 and 2 and one 575&#8208;ringed boron&#8208;doped nanographene 3 were synthesized. The key point is that the boron&#8208;edged &#960;&#8208;system enabled unexpected spiro&#8208;formation via dearomatization, whereas the boron&#8208;centered &#960;&#8208;system enabled desired 575&#8208;ringed &#960;&#8208;extension via cyclodehydrogenation. The thus&#8208;obtained molecules exhibit the intriguing but fully distinct reactivity, electronic structures and properties, for instance, while 2 may react with Br&#248;nsted acid to display reversible chemochromism and further convert into 1, 3 possesses very broad absorption, short excited&#8208;state lifetime and no fluorescence nature. As disclosed, the boron atom together with the spirocycle region or 575&#8208;ringed structural motif significantly contribute to their characteristic properties. Thus, this study sheds light on control over the Scholl reaction using organoborane &#960;&#8208;systems and will promote the exploration of more sophisticated polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems as organic reactive and optical scaffolds.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Control of Mammalian Gene Expression Using DNA Repair Inducible Ribozyme Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch based on site&#8208;specific DNA lesion&#8208;modified plasmids was designed for cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression. This strategy was demonstrated to allow selective control the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing in cancer cells, providing a compact system for DNA repair monitoring and precision gene therapy.







Abstract
The ability to control gene expression is vital for elucidating gene functions and developing next&#8208;generation therapeutics. Current techniques are challenged by the lack of cell&#8208;specific control designs or immunogenicity risk from foreign proteins. We develop a DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch that enables cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression in cells and in vivo. This strategy designs plasmids with a DNA lesion (8&#8208;oxoG and O6&#8208;MeG) site&#8208;specifically installed within the ribozyme encoding region, generating active hammerhead ribozyme for mRNA degradation due to transcriptional mutagenesis, whereas DNA repair yields a single&#8208;base mismatch in the ribozyme to abrogate its activity. This strategy is demonstrated to allow specific control of gene expression in cancer cells with overexpressed DNA repair enzymes such as MutY DNA glycosylase and O6&#8208;methylguanine&#8208;DNA&#8208;methyltransferases. It also shows the capability of conditionally regulating the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing, enabling DNA repair monitoring and targeted gene therapy in cancer cells. This strategy is demonstrated using the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system for in vivo editing of oncogenic Polo&#8208;like kinase 1 in a mouse model, resulting in significant tumor growth suppression. The DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch may provide a compact system for cell&#8208;specific gene expression control toward precise gene therapy.

         <title>Molecular Conjugated&#8208;Polymer Electrode Enables Rapid Proton Conduction for Electrosynthesis of Ammonia from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with copper catalyst is reported for selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonia. The polyaniline in the electrode mediates proton transfer reactions involved in the process of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility for molecular engineering of electrode supports to promote the selectivity and energy efficiency for NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3&#8722;.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of ammonia (NH3) from nitrate (NO3&#8722;) using renewable energy holds promise as a supplementary alternative to the Haber&#8722;Bosch process for NH3 production. Most research focuses on tuning the catalytic activity of metal catalysts by modification of the catalyst structures. However, the electrode supports which could influence the catalytic activity have not been well&#8208;explored. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 still exhibit limited energy efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current density. Herein, we report a polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with Cu catalyst for selective and energy&#8208;efficient NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3. In the electrode, the polyaniline promotes protonation of the key intermediate formed during NO3&#8722; reduction at Cu, which circumvents the limitation of the Cu catalyst in the efficiency&#8208;limiting proton transfer step. The molecular electrode produces NH3 at a partial current density of 2.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an energy efficiency of 62&#8201;%, demonstrating much better electrochemical performance than common Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts and indicating the great potential in molecular engineering of electrode supports for selective NO3&#8722; reduction.

         <title>Beyond Dimerization: Harnessing Tetrameric Coiled&#8208;Coils for Nanostructure Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing tetrameric coiled&#8208;coils into CCPO structures can improve their stability and expands the possible topologies that can be constructed. Assembling proteins from two units could be used as delivery systems, as their assembly could be controlled via external modulators. The first cryo&#8208;EM structure of a CCPO is presented.







Abstract
Versatile DNA and polypeptide&#8208;based structures have been designed based on complementary modules. However, polypeptides can also form higher oligomeric states. We investigated the introduction of tetrameric modules as a substitute for coiled&#8208;coil dimerization units used in previous modular nanostructures. Tetramerizing helical bundles can run in parallel or antiparallel orientation, expanding the number of topological solutions for modular nanostructures. Furthermore, this strategy facilitates the construction of nanostructures from two identical polypeptide chains. Importantly, tetrameric modules substantially stabilized protein nanostructures against air&#8211;water interface denaturation, enabling the determination of the first cryo&#8208;electron microscopy three&#8208;dimensional structure of a coiled&#8208;coil&#8208;based nanostructure, confirming the designed agreement of the modules forming a tetrahedral cage.

         <title>Constraining CO2 Coverage on Copper Promotes CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;carbon Products in Strong Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diluting CO2 feed enhances CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products on Cu in strong acid. Reduced CO2 coverage stabilizes intermediates such as *CO2 and *CO, while suppressing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation. Enriched CO surface coverage and optimized CO adsorption configuration, promote C&#8722;C coupling for C2+ production. This work addresses CO2 reactant loss and advances direct flue gas electrolysis for valuable chemicals and fuels.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products in strong acid presents a promising approach to mitigate the CO2 loss commonly encountered in alkaline and neutral systems. However, this process often suffers from low selectivity for C2+ products due to the competing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation and complex C&#8722;C coupling kinetics. In this work, we report a CO2 coverage constraining strategy by diluting CO2 reactant feed to modulate the intermediate distribution and C&#8722;C coupling pathways for an enhanced electrosynthesis of C2+ products in strong acid. Lowering the CO2 feed concentration reduces CO2 coverage on copper catalyst, enriching the surface coverage and optimizing the adsorption configuration of the key CO intermediate for C&#8722;C coupling. This approach efficiently suppresses the formation of undesired C1 products. By employing a 20&#8201;% CO2 feed, we achieved a significant improvement in C2+ Faradaic efficiency, reaching 68&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, approximately 1.7&#8197;times higher than the 41&#8201;% obtained using pure CO2. We demonstrated the direct electroreduction of a 30&#8201;% CO2 feed&#8212;representative CO2 concentration of typical industrial flue gases&#8212;in a full electrolyzer, achieving a C2+ selectivity of 78&#8201;% and an energy efficiency of 23&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

     alt="Constraining CO2 Coverage on Copper Promotes CO2 Electroreduction to Multi-carbon Products in Strong Acid"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diluting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feed enhances CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to multi-carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) products on Cu in strong acid. Reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coverage stabilizes intermediates such as *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and *CO, while suppressing C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation. Enriched CO surface coverage and optimized CO adsorption configuration, promote C&#8722;C coupling for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; production. This work addresses CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reactant loss and advances direct flue gas electrolysis for valuable chemicals and fuels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) to multi-carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) products in strong acid presents a promising approach to mitigate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loss commonly encountered in alkaline and neutral systems. However, this process often suffers from low selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products due to the competing C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation and complex C&#8722;C coupling kinetics. In this work, we report a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coverage constraining strategy by diluting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reactant feed to modulate the intermediate distribution and C&#8722;C coupling pathways for an enhanced electrosynthesis of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products in strong acid. Lowering the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feed concentration reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coverage on copper catalyst, enriching the surface coverage and optimizing the adsorption configuration of the key CO intermediate for C&#8722;C coupling. This approach efficiently suppresses the formation of undesired C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; products. By employing a 20&#8201;% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feed, we achieved a significant improvement in C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency, reaching 68&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, approximately 1.7&#8197;times higher than the 41&#8201;% obtained using pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We demonstrated the direct electroreduction of a 30&#8201;% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feed&#8212;representative CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of typical industrial flue gases&#8212;in a full electrolyzer, achieving a C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 78&#8201;% and an energy efficiency of 23&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bulk Stereoselective Cationic Polymerization of Vinyl Ethers by the Coordination of ZrCl4 with Tunable Spirocyclic Phosphoric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective polymerization of vinyl ethers was achieved using ZrCl4 coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid, featuring low catalyst loads, solvent&#8208;free, high tacticity control, and recyclable catalyst.







Abstract
Control over stereochemistry in poly(vinyl ether)s leads to a notable change in their physical properties, yet remains a grand challenge. Here, we demonstrate the bulk stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers using ZrCl4 coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid (SPA). The widely variable substituents in SPAs exert a profound impact on the stereochemical and activity outcome of the polymerization: the % m of poly(vinyl ether)s linearly increases with the Hammett substituent constant (&#963;) of SPAs; the catalytic activity increases with the &#963;; the large steric hindrance groups lead to decreased polymerization activity. Mechanism studies suggest that the coordination of ZrCl4 with three equivalents of SPAs generates the chiral complex. The complex can abstract chlorine from the initiator/chain end to form the chiral ion pair allowing the selective facial addition of incoming monomers. The catalyst system features characteristics of no solvent, low loads, high tacticity control, high monomer scope, and recyclability.

         <title>Synthesis of Arenesulfenyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfenylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;Diazocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of arenesulfenyl fluorides (ArS&#8208;F) has been achieved via a Halex reaction. Several arenesulfenyl fluorides have been characterized by NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and FTIR spectroscopy, including structural analysis of two compounds by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group engages in direct, efficient, and highly regioselective&#160;anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes.







Abstract
Sulfenyl fluorides are organic compounds of sulfur in formal oxidation state +2 with the formula R&#8722;S&#8722;F. Although the chloride, bromide, and iodide analogues have been extensively described in the literature, arenesulfenyl fluorides remain essentially unstudied. These structures have been implicated as putative intermediates in established processes to access polyfluorinated sulfur species; however, definitive and direct evidence of their existence has not been obtained, nor has a systematic understanding of their reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of several arenesulfenyl fluorides, including structural analysis of 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group undergoes direct, efficient, and highly regioselective anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes. The resulting &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;fluoro thioether adducts can be readily transformed into useful fluorinated motifs, for example by modification of the sulfur groups (to sulfonamides or sulfonyl fluorides), by sulfur elimination (to generate formal C&#8722;H fluorination products), or by Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination (to form vinyl fluorides). Thus, we establish that sulfenyl fluorides are unexpectedly accessible and stable compounds, which serve as versatile reagents for the production of fluorinated organic compounds.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Pt Nanowires with Disordered Shells for Highly Active Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt sub&#8208;nanometer nanowires, which feature a unique architecture with a monoatomic&#8208;layer surface of disordered, bonding&#8208;unsaturated Pt atoms surrounding a crystalline core as narrow as 0.58&#8197;nm in diameter, are succsessfully synthesized. It significantly boosts the electrochemical surface area and catalytic efficiency for formic acid oxidation, a key reaction in direct formic acid fuel cells, which have the potential to outperform current battery technologies for lightweight, long&#8208;lasting portable power.







Abstract
Controlled synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional materials at atomic&#8208;scale dimensions represents a milestone in nanotechnology, offering the potential to maximize atom utilization while enhancing catalytic performance. However, achieving structural stability and durability at such fine scales requires precise control over material structure and local chemical environment. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA) as a small&#8208;molecule modifier, in contrast to conventional long&#8208;chain surfactants, to interact with surface Pt atoms. This approach facilitates the removal of surface Pt atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms in DMA during solubilization in water, effectively stripping the size of Pt nanowires down to sub&#8208;nanometer. The resulting Pt subnanometer nanowires (subNWs) feature a monoatomic&#8208;layer surface composed of disordered, bonding&#8208;unsaturated Pt atoms, and an interior crystalline core as narrow as 0.58&#8197;nm in diameter. These unique structural characteristics confer the Pt subNWs with an electrochemically active surface&#8208;area of 189&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 during formic acid oxidation. Furthermore, the amorphous&#8208;like surface structure lowers the free energy of *OCOH intermediates and inhibits the formation of toxic byproducts CO, demonstrating exceptional electrocatalytic activity of 18.1&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1, surpassing most reported Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Our work introduces a novel strategy for the controlled construction of nanowire&#8208;structures at sub&#8208;nanometer scale, effectively bridging the gap between ultrafine structural design and performance stability.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Diffusion and Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of Two&#8208;Step Deposited Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film via Reducing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing formic acid (FA) as cationic solvent retards reaction rate and stabilizes I&#8722;, while further introduction of dithiothreitol (DTT) precisely modulates reaction&#8208;diffusion and crystallization kinetics through establishing a targeted interaction with SnI2, thus obtaining high&#8208;quality perovskite film and highlighting the importance of kinetic balance. Ultimately, the DTT&#8208;incorporated device delivers the highest PCE of 12.68&#8201;% in a DMSO&#8208;free solvent by the two&#8208;step sequential deposition method.







Abstract
The two&#8208;step deposition method effectively mitigates the efficiency decline observed in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPVSCs) with increasing cell area, stemming from film in&#8208;homogeneity. However, the high solubility of SnI2 in the conventionally used solvent isopropyl alcohol, coupled with the absence of effective modulation of reaction&#8208;diffusion process, results in inadequate film coverage and conversion. In this study, we introduce formic acid as the second&#8208;step solvent and introduce dithiothreitol (DTT) to regulate reaction&#8208;diffusion/crystallization kinetics meticulously. Moreover, this research underscores a fundamental principle that the suitable binding energy ranging from &#8722;1.38 to &#8722;10.10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 between ligands and Sn2+ significantly enhances the effectiveness of two&#8208;step crystallization control. Notably, a uniform perovskite film is achieved on large&#8208;scale substrate, and TPVSCs processed with DTT exhibit the highest efficiencies of 12.68&#8201;% for 0.04&#8197;cm2 device and 11.30&#8201;% for 1&#8197;cm2 device among tin&#8208;based perovskite devices in two&#8208;step sequential deposition method, even in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide.

&lt;p&gt;Developing formic acid (FA) as cationic solvent retards reaction rate and stabilizes I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, while further introduction of dithiothreitol (DTT) precisely modulates reaction-diffusion and crystallization kinetics through establishing a targeted interaction with SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus obtaining high-quality perovskite film and highlighting the importance of kinetic balance. Ultimately, the DTT-incorporated device delivers the highest PCE of 12.68&#8201;% in a DMSO-free solvent by the two-step sequential deposition method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-step deposition method effectively mitigates the efficiency decline observed in tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPVSCs) with increasing cell area, stemming from film in-homogeneity. However, the high solubility of SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the conventionally used solvent isopropyl alcohol, coupled with the absence of effective modulation of reaction-diffusion process, results in inadequate film coverage and conversion. In this study, we introduce formic acid as the second-step solvent and introduce dithiothreitol (DTT) to regulate reaction-diffusion/crystallization kinetics meticulously. Moreover, this research underscores a fundamental principle that the suitable binding energy ranging from &#8722;1.38 to &#8722;10.10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; between ligands and Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; significantly enhances the effectiveness of two-step crystallization control. Notably, a uniform perovskite film is achieved on large-scale substrate, and TPVSCs processed with DTT exhibit the highest efficiencies of 12.68&#8201;% for 0.04&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; device and 11.30&#8201;% for 1&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; device among tin-based perovskite devices in two-step sequential deposition method, even in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide. This study lays the groundwork for the potential scale-up development of lead-free perovskite solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Oxidation Reactions of E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Allylic Primary Alcohols by an Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

The unspecific peroxygenase rAaeUPO&#8208;PaDa&#8208;I&#8208;H catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and aldehyde/acid products, respectively. Both reactions were performed on a preparative scale with yields of up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) catalyze the selective oxygenation of organic substrates using only hydrogen peroxide as the external oxidant. The PaDa&#8722;I variant of the UPO from Agrocybe aegerita catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and carboxylic acid/aldehyde products respectively. Both reactions can be performed on preparative scale with isolated yields up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee). The divergent reactions can also be used to transform E/Z mixtures of allylic alcohols, enabling both product series to be isolated from a single reaction. The utility of the epoxidation method is exemplified in the total synthesis of both enantiomers of the insect pheromone disparlure, including a highly enantioselective gram&#8208;scale transformation. These reactions provide further evidence for the potential of UPOs as catalysts for the scalable preparation of important oxygenated intermediates.

         <title>Through Space &#960;&#8208;Electrons Communication in [2,2]&#8208;Paracyclophanes: Unprecendented Stabilization of Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D spatial configuration of paracyclophanes lowers the activation energy for alkoxyamine to afford stabilized radicals. This family of new compounds is able to initiate nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization and also exhibits antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines.







Abstract
Efforts to understand radical stability have led to considerable progress in radical chemistry. In this article, we investigated a novel approach to enhancing the radical stability of carbon&#8208;centered radicals through space electron delocalization within [2,2]&#8208;paracyclophanes. Alkoxyamines possessing a paracyclophane scaffold exploit face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;interactions between the aromatic rings to effectively lower bond dissociation energy (BDE) for NO&#8722;C bond homolysis. Electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments and computational modeling have confirmed a better stability compared to the analogues without the paracyclophane core. Theoretical analyses further elucidate the role of through&#8208;space electron communication in enhancing radical stability. This study highlights promising applications in fields such as organic synthesis, material science, and drug design. By achieving a low BDE for homolysis, the alkoxyamines efficiently release radicals, enabling successful application in nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP) of styrene, which provides high control over polymer architecture. Additionally, preliminary anti&#8208;proliferative assays reveal that the alkoxyamines exhibit promising anti&#8208;cancer activities against lung, breast, and prostate cells, which is correlated to their ability to release radicals upon homolysis.

         <title>Latent Solvent&#8208;Induced Inorganic&#8208;Rich Interfacial Chemistry to Achieve Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel latent solvent, 1,2&#8208;dibutoxyethane (DBE), is proposed into low&#8208;concentration electrolyte to manipulate the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath. The designed electrolyte exhibits enhanced oxidation resistance, low desolvation energy, and highly stable SEI film with superior potassium storage performances.







Abstract
Low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) have attracted great attention due to their cost effectiveness and low viscosity, but suffer undesired organic&#8208;rich interfacial chemistry and poor oxidative stability. Herein, a unique latent solvent, 1,2&#8208;dibutoxyethane (DBE), is proposed to manipulate the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath and construct a robust inorganic&#8208;rich interface in a 0.5&#8197;M electrolyte. This unique solvation structure reduces the desolvation energy, facilitating rapid interfacial kinetics and K+ intercalation in graphite. Additionally, enhanced anion&#8208;cation interactions promote the formation of a thin and robust interfacial layer with excellent cycling performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Graphite||perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride full cell exhibits a good capacity retention of 80.3&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles, and delivers a high discharge capacity of 131.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study demonstrates the feasibility of latent solvent&#8208;optimized electrolyte engineering, providing a pathway of superior electrochemical energy storage in PIBs.

         <title>Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Incorporating 4,5&#8208;Dihydroazuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene Cores</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel class of extended tetrathiafulvalenes incorporating a dihydro&#8208;azulenoazulene core is presented. Upon oxidation to the dication, a non&#8208;benzenoid, aromatic core is obtained as corroborated by DFT computations, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR/EPR spectroelectrochemistry, and X&#8208;ray as well as electron diffraction studies. The redox and optical properties are finely tuned by ring fusion (benzene, naphthalene or thiophene) at the azulenoazulene core.







Abstract
The introduction of 4,5&#8208;dihydroazuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene as a central core between two 1,4&#8208;dithiafulvene (DTF) units provides a novel class of extended tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) electron donors. Herein we present the synthesis of such compounds with the azulenoazulene further expanded by annulation to benzene, naphthalene, or thiophene rings. Moreover, unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores with one DTF and one carbonyl at the central core are presented. The effect of the odd&#8208;membered rings of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon cores on the geometrical features and the extent of bond conjugation in these systems were investigated by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, (spectro)electrochemical studies, X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction, and computational studies. Altogether these studies reveal that, upon oxidation, the non&#8208;planar core of the bis(benzo)&#8208;fused dihydro&#8208;azulenoazulene&#8208;extended TTF generates a large 22&#960;&#8208;aromatic system (together with two 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic 1,3&#8208;dithiolium appendages) characterized by significant bond length equalizations. The dication formed by oxidation is EPR silent, indicating a singlet ground state. Computations reveal that the closed&#8208;shell singlet species and its open&#8208;shell singlet counterpart are nearly degenerate and of lower energy than a triplet species. According to cyclic voltammetry, the compounds can be oxidized further and present multi&#8208;redox systems.

The effect of the odd-membered rings of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon cores on the geometrical features and the extent of bond conjugation in these systems were investigated by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, (spectro)electrochemical studies, X-ray and electron diffraction, and computational studies. Altogether these studies reveal that, upon oxidation, the non-planar core of the bis(benzo)-fused dihydro-azulenoazulene-extended TTF generates a large 22&#960;-aromatic system (together with two 6&#960;-aromatic 1,3-dithiolium appendages) characterized by significant bond length equalizations. The dication formed by oxidation is EPR silent, indicating a singlet ground state. Computations reveal that the closed-shell singlet species and its open-shell singlet counterpart are nearly degenerate and of lower energy than a triplet species. According to cyclic voltammetry, the compounds can be oxidized further and present multi-redox systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving High Solid&#8211;Liquid Ratio through Competitive Coordination towards Efficient Recovery of Metals from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the potential of DESs for practical applications, we propose a novel competition coordination strategy for designing the ternary DESs, which can reinforce the construction of H&#8208;bond interaction and facilitate the exsolution of the ligand (OxA), leading to an enhanced mass transfer kinetic and an excellent selective precipitation of metals (Ni).







Abstract
The recycling of critical metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries represents a significant step towards meeting the enhancing resource requirements in the new energy industry. Nevertheless, achieving effective leaching of metals from the stable metal&#8208;oxygen (MO6) structure of spent ternary cathodes and separation of metal products simultaneously still remained a huge challenge towards industrial applications. Herein, a competitive coordination strategy was proposed to design a novel deep eutectic solvent (DESs), which improved both leaching and selective metal recycling capacity even at high solid&#8211;liquid ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;10). The results demonstrated that the number of hydrogen bonds in designed ternary DESs was 16.5&#8201;% higher compared to those in the binary DESs, resulting in efficient reaction kinetics to break the metals&#8208;oxygen bond. More importantly, the competing&#8208;ligand (p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid) could preferentially enter into the first nanostructure sheath and reduce the proportion of solvated oxalic acid (OxA) from 28.36&#8201;% to 17.76&#8201;% within the nanostructure, which enable OxA molecules to enhance the coordination interaction with metal for precipitating NiC2O4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O product (~95.7&#8201;% purity) from spent cathodes. This work achieved impressive profitability ($16.05 per kg feedstock) and effectively reduction of GHG emissions during the recycling process, making it applicable to critical sustainability initiatives.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Swing Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Films for Fast and Precise Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation and growth kinetics of COFs are regulated using the temperature&#8208;swing synthesis strategy, which contributes to highly crystalline and porous COF films. The regular channels within the COF enable fast solvent permeation and excellent selectivity to precisely discriminate fine antibiotic mixtures. This work paves the way towards the structural orderliness of framework materials.







Abstract
Producing crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) films is intimately related to the elusive nucleation and growth processes, which is desirable for efficient molecular transport. Rational control over these processes and insights into the mechanisms are crucial to improve synthetic methodology and achieve COF films with regular channels. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of COF films via the temperature&#8208;swing strategy and explore their crystallization from monomer assemblies to film formation. A detailed time&#8208;dependent study reveals that COF crystallites preferentially coalesce at low temperature, progressing from assembled nanospheres to continuous films through lateral and vertical interactions. Moreover, appropriately elevating the synthesis temperature promotes crystal growth and eliminate the defects of weakly crystalline regions, contributing to highly crystalline and porous COF film with a surface area of 746&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. The prepared COF composite membrane exhibits a methanol permeance of 79&#8197;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which is 4.5 times higher than the weakly crystalline counterpart. In addition, the molecular sieving test recognize great membrane selectivity to discriminate the antibiotic mixture with a high separation factor of 15.4. This work offers a feasible way for the rational design of the synthesis environment, enabling access to highly crystalline framework materials for targeting molecular separations.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Process for the Regiodivergent Double Hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed divergent, one&#8208;step double hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene produced either adiponitrile or 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile with high regioselectivity. The success of this process is attributed to the highly tunable binding pockets of the bidentate phosphite ligands, which create a geometrically defined coordination space around the nickel center.







Abstract
In industry, the two important nitrile starting materials, adiponitrile and 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile, are primarily manufactured through the well&#8208;known DuPont process, which consists of a tandem sequence including first hydrocyanation, isomerization and second hydrocyanation. However, this mature process has the intrinsic defects of step efficiency and regioselectivity. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed divergent, one&#8208;step double hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to produce either adiponitrile or 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile in high regioselectivity. The key to this success lies in the highly tunable binding pockets of the bidentate phosphite ligands, which creates a geometrically defined coordination space around the nickel center. The first hydrocyanation that produces either the linear or branched alkenyl nitrile was identified as the selectivity&#8208;determining step. Organometallic studies confirm the formation of well&#8208;defined diphosphite nickel diene complexes in solution, and the role of ligands in dictating regioselectivity was further rationalized by DFT computations. This result provides the first example of a highly selective nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of adiponitrile and 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile from butadiene, and it also represents a high&#8208;level of catalyst&#8208;controlled regioselectivity via the fine&#8208;tuning of ligand pocket geometry.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolytes with High Disordered Solvation Structures for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel low&#8208;concentration HE electrolyte is developed to address dendrite formation and side reactions in aqueous ZIBs. This HE electrolyte features weakly solvated structures and multiple anions, leading to highly disordered solvation shells that enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics and electrode interface stability. As a result, Zn||Zn symmetric cells reach over 2,000&#8197;hours of cycling, and Zn||Cu cells achieve 99.9&#8201;% CE over 1,000 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are playing an increasingly important role in the field of energy storage owing to their low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their practical applications are still handicapped by severe dendrite formation and side reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion) on the zinc anodes. Herein, a low&#8208;concentration high&#8208;entropy (HE) electrolyte strategy is proposed to achieve high reversibility and ultra&#8208;durable zinc metal anode. Specifically, this HE electrolyte features multiple anions participating in coordination and highly disordered solvation shells, which would disrupt the intrinsic H&#8208;bond network between water molecules and suppress interfacial side reactions. Moreover, these diversified weakly solvated structures can lower the solvation energy of Zn2+ solvation configurations and enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics, thereby promoting uniform Zn deposition and electrode interface stability. Consequently, Zn||Zn symmetric cells exhibit over 2,000&#8197;hours of cycling stability, and Zn||Cu asymmetric cells achieve a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn||PANI full cell with the optimized HE&#8208;50&#8197;mM electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity of 110.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 70.4&#8201;% at 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 10,000 cycles. Remarkably, even at a low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn||PANI full cells equipped with HE&#8208;50&#8197;mM electrolyte still demonstrate long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.5&#8201;%. This research provides a promising strategy for the design of aqueous electrolytes, aiding in the development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

Remarkably, even at a low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn||PANI full cells equipped with HE-50&#8197;mM electrolyte still demonstrate long-term cycling stability over 600 cycles with a high-capacity retention of 93.5&#8201;%. This research provides a promising strategy for the design of aqueous electrolytes, aiding in the development of low-cost, high-safety, and high-performance aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zeolite Encapsulation to Enhance Interfacial Gas Availability for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulating the photocatalyst within S&#8208;1 zeolite efficiently enriched gaseous oxygen and accelerated the photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 by creating a gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface, which significantly increased the concentration of gaseous oxygen in the microporous structure of zeolite and facilitated its interaction with the surface of the photocatalyst at the liquid&#8208;solid interface.







Abstract
The photocatalytic oxidation of water with gaseous oxygen is environmentally benign for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but it is currently constrained by the inadequate supply of gaseous oxygen at the catalyst surface in a solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase reaction system. Herein, we address this challenge by employing the zeolite encapsulated catalysts that efficiently enrich gaseous oxygen and accelerate the H2O2 synthesis in aqueous conditions. We focus on the classical titania photocatalyst, encapsulating it within siliceous MFI zeolite crystals. This encapsulation results in a significant enhancement in H2O2 synthesis efficiency, achieving a yield that is ten times greater than that with unencapsulated TiO2. Mechanism study reveals that gaseous oxygen is notably concentrated within the microporous structure of the zeolite under aqueous conditions, thereby facilitating its interaction with the titania surface at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. In addition, the H2O2 product could swiftly transfer through the micropores, thereby reducing the side reaction of decomposition. This design provides an alternative pathway to address the poor gas solubility of gaseous reactants in water, and paves the way for advancements in various other photocatalytic processes.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships for s&#8208;Block Metal/Co(III) Heterodinuclear Catalysts in Cyclohexene Oxide Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterodinuclear catalysts featuring Co(III) in combination with s&#8208;block metals are reported for the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide with phthalic anhydride, and with carbon dioxide at 20 and 1&#8197;bar pressures. Quantifiable structure&#8211;activity trends are observed; activity increases with decreasing s&#8208;block metal Lewis acidity, as measured by the pKa of the s&#8208;block metal aqua complexes. These relationships reveal key mechanistic insights to help inform future catalyst design.







Abstract
In homogeneous catalysis, uncovering structure&#8211;activity relationships remains very rare but invaluable to understand and rationally improve performances. Here, generalizable structure&#8211;activity relationships apply to a series of heterodinuclear polymerization catalysts featuring Co(III) and s&#8208;block metals M(I/II) (M=Na(I), K(I), Ca(II), Sr(II), Ba(II)). These are shown to apply to polycarbonate production by the ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), conducted at high (20&#8197;bar) and low (1&#8197;bar) CO2 pressures, and to polyester production by copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and phthalic anhydride (PA). For the CHO/PA and high&#8208;pressure CHO/CO2 copolymerizations, activity increases exponentially with s&#8208;block metal acidity peaking at the Co(III)K(I) catalyst, whilst for the low&#8208;pressure CHO/CO2 copolymerization it increases linearly to the same metal combination. The polymerization kinetics fit second order rate laws and the correlations support dinuclear metallate mechanistic hypotheses. These relationships help understand and identify key metal complex structural features in synergic polymerization catalysis.

         <title>Arraying and Guest Inclusion of Soluble Metal&#8208;Organic Nanotubes Composed of Macrocyclic Paddle&#8208;Wheel Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangular and square metal&#8208;organic nanotubes were constructed based on paddlewheel Rh dimer complexes. The side chains introduced into the metal complexes allowed the nanotubes to dissolve in solutions. The nanotubes were cast on a substrate to form a solid film oriented over a wide area. In addition, the nanotubes encapsulated guest molecules.







Abstract
A new series of metal&#8208;organic nanotubes was constructed through one&#8208;dimensional assembly using molecular triangles or molecular squares composed of paddlewheel dirhodium complexes and bidentate axial ligands. The metal&#8208;organic nanotubes were significantly different from conventional solid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) motifs. They exhibit good solubility owing to the branched side chains at their periphery and demonstrate high orientation capabilities in thin films owing to their anisotropic structure. Furthermore, the nanotubes can accommodate guest molecules in nanochannels and orient them on a large scale on a glass substrate.

         <title>Conformer&#8208;Mediated Helical Chirality in 2D Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers of chiral organic ammonium ion are arranged alternatively in the structure of 2D hybrid perovskites. The two conformers have very different strengths of non&#8208;covalent interactions at the organic&#8211;inorganic interface. This periodic asymmetry in non&#8208;covalent interactions induces the rare helical chirality within the inorganic sublattice with interesting chiroptic properties. This conformer&#8208;mediated chirality is a novel concept.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral hybrid perovskites A2PbI4 (A: chiral organic ion) enable chirality controlled optoelectronic and spin&#8208;based properties. A+ organic sublattice induces chirality into the semiconducting [PbI4]2&#8722; inorganic sublattice through non&#8208;covalent interactions at organic&#8211;inorganic interface. Often, the A+ cations in the lattice have different orientations, leading to asymmetry in the non&#8208;covalent interactions. In a novel approach, we use different conformers of A+ cations to create asymmetry in the non&#8208;covalent interactions, thereby, achieving chiral perovskites with rare helical enantiomorphic structures. We prepared (R&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 and (S&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 (IdPA: 1&#8208;iodopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ammonium) which crystallize in the helical enantiomorphic space groups P43212 and P41212, respectively. The gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers of IdPA+ are arranged alternatively in the hybrid structure. Importantly, the anti&#8208;conformer of IdPA+ ion have significantly stronger electrostatic, N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I hydrogen bonding, and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bonding interactions with the [PbI4]2&#8722; sublattice, compared to the gauche&#8208;conformer. This periodic asymmetry in non&#8208;covalent interactions caused by the alternative arrangement of gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers induces chirality in the inorganic sublattice with four&#8208;fold screw axes (43 and 41). The enantiomers (R&#8208;/S&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 show mirror&#8208;image like circular dichroism from excitonic absorption of the inorganic sublattice. This conformer&#8208;based design of chiral hybrid perovskites in helical space groups broadens material choices for advanced optoelectronic applications.

A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet displays reversible redox transformation upon ultraviolet irradiation and subsequent dark treatment, leading to a significant change of magnetic memory effect.







Abstract
A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet [Dy(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5](PMo12O40)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3CyPh2PO&#8901;H2O (1&#8208;Dy) is synthesized via cocrystal engineering of a polyoxomolybdate (POMo) anion and an Ising&#8208;type cation with pseudo pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. Upon ultraviolet irradiation, MoVI&#8208;to&#8208;MoV single&#8208;electron photoreduction occurs in the POMo moiety, resulting in significant changes of optical and magnetic properties. The emergence of intervalence charge&#8208;transfer transitions in heteropoly blue state 1&#8208;Dy* facilitates photothermal conversion in near&#8208;infrared region. Meanwhile, the coercive field of hysteresis loop is altered from 0.72&#8197;T (1&#8208;Dy) to 0.04&#8197;T (1&#8208;Dy*) at 2&#8197;K, which might be contributed to the magnetic interaction between DyIII and MoV. After dark treatment, 1&#8208;Dy* can convert to the initial state with the recovery of magnetic memory effect. These results presented herein provide a blueprint for developing versatile opto&#8208;magnetic materials via the coupling of photochemical regulation and magnetic interaction.

         <title>Anchorable Polymers Enabling Ultra&#8208;Thin and Robust Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for High&#8208;Efficiency Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Coordinative pyridyl units are introduced as side&#8208;chains on poly&#8208;triarylamine (PTAA) backbone with varied contents by copolymerization method, resulting in chemical interactions between polymeric HTMs and substrates. The strong interaction allows them to be processed into ultra&#8208;thin, uniform, and robust hole&#8208;transporting layers, greatly decreasing charge transport losses. Based on the optimal CP4, we achieved highly efficient inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 26.21&#8201;%.







Abstract
Currently, the development of polymeric hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) lags behind that of small&#8208;molecule HTMs in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A critical challenge is that conventional polymeric HTMs are incapable of forming ultra&#8208;thin and conformal coatings like self&#8208;assembly monolayers (SAMs), especially for substrates with rough surface morphology. Herein, we address this challenge by designing anchorable polymeric HTMs (CP1 to CP5). Specifically, coordinative pyridyl groups are introduced as side&#8208;chains on poly&#8208;triarylamine (PTAA) backbone with varied contents by copolymerization method, resulting in chemical interactions between polymeric HTMs and substrates. The strong interaction allows them to be processed into ultra&#8208;thin, uniform, and robust hole&#8208;transporting layers through employing low&#8208;concentration solutions (0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1, vs. 2.0&#8211;5.0&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 for conventional PTAA), greatly decreasing charge transport losses. Moreover, upon systematically tuning the pyridyl substitution ratio, the energy levels, surface wetting, solution processability, and defect passivation capability of such anchorable HTMs are simultaneously optimized. Based on the optimal CP4, we achieved highly efficient inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 26.21&#8201;%, which is on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SAM&#8208;based inverted PSCs. Furthermore, these devices exhibit enhanced stabilities under repeated current&#8211;voltage scans and reverse bias ageing compared with SAM&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Striking Impact of Solvent Polarity on the Strength of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complexes: A Nexus Between Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conventional belief that the stability of H&#8208;bonded complexes decreases in a more polar solvent is being questioned in this study. Our analysis indicates that the stability of neutral H&#8208;bonded complexes increases in a more polar solvent, provided there is substantial charge transfer between the subsystems. Experimental NMR, IR and quantum chemical micro&#8208;solvation and periodic metadynamics methods confirm the findings.







Abstract
The binding free energy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes is generally inversely proportional to the solvent dielectric constant. This occurs because the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of the complex is always smaller than that of the individual subsystems, leading to a reduction in solvation energy. The present study explores the potential for stabilizing hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes in a solvent with higher polarity. Contrary to the established understanding, we have demonstrated that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex (CH3CH2COOH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine) can be better stabilized in a solvent with higher polarity. In this case, a significant charge transfer between the subsystems results in an increased dipole moment of the complex, leading to its stabilization in a more polar solvent. The expected inverse relationship between binding free energy and solvent dielectric constant is observed when the charge transfer between the subsystems is low. Thus, the magnitude of the charge transfer between subsystems is possibly the key factor in determining the stabilization or destabilization of H&#8208;bonded complexes in different solvents. Here, we present a comprehensive study that combines experimental and theoretical approaches, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR) spectroscopies and quantum chemical calculations to validate the findings.

Cephalopod&#8208;inspired MXene&#8208;integrated cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (MXene&#8208;CLCEs) with multispectral camouflage capability exhibit dynamic structural color changes, tunable infrared radiation, and switchable microwave shielding across wide ranges upon mechanical stretching. Advanced pneumatically driven octopus&#8208;inspired soft models demonstrate visible&#8208;infrared camouflage and microwave shielding switching between two compatible states.







Abstract
Multispectral camouflage materials that provide adaptable features across a wide spectrum, from visible light to radar frequencies, play a vital role in sophisticated multi&#8208;band electromagnetic (EM) applications. However, conventional single&#8208;band stealth is difficult to align with the growing demand for multi&#8208;band compatibility and intelligent adaptation. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of cephalopod&#8208;inspired MXene&#8208;integrated cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (MXene&#8208;CLCEs) with multispectral camouflage capability, which was fabricated through in situ thiol&#8208;acrylate Michael addition and free&#8208;radical photopolymerization of CLCE precursor and isocyanate&#8208;mediated robust covalent chemical bonding of MXene nanocoating at the interface. The resulting MXene&#8208;CLCE exhibits dynamic structural color changes, tunable infrared radiation, and switchable microwave shielding across wide ranges upon mechanical stretching, with its infrared stealth and microwave shielding properties being realized through the reconfiguration of surface morphology from planar to cracked states via mechanical actuation. A visible&#8208;to&#8208;infrared camouflage octopus&#8208;patterned MXene&#8208;CLCE is demonstrated to achieve a stealth effect across the visible&#8208;infrared spectrum upon mechanical stretching. As an illustration, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept pneumatic&#8208;driven octopus&#8208;inspired soft models are demonstrated, which enables dynamic visible&#8208;infrared camouflage and microwave shielding switching between two compatible states. The research herein can offer new perspectives on the development of bioinspired smart camouflage materials and their application in various emerging fields such as smart optical stealth, dynamic thermal management, and switchable electromagnetic devices.

         <title>Exogenously and Endogenously Sequential Regulation of DNA Nanodevices Enables Organelle&#8208;Specific Signal Amplification in Subcellular ATP Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating exogenous NIR light&#8208;triggered photoactivation and endogenous enzyme&#8208;mediated signal amplification with DNA sensor technology, spatiotemporally selective, amplified imaging of ATP in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum is achieved. The dual&#8208;regulated nanodevices enable monitoring of ATP fluctuations in the specific organelles following drug intervention.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency in cells, is dynamically regulated across different subcellular compartments. The ATP interplay between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) underscores their coordinated roles in various biochemical processes, highlighting the necessity for precise profiling of subcellular ATP dynamics. Here we present an exogenously and endogenously dual&#8208;regulated DNA nanodevice for spatiotemporally selective, subcellular&#8208;compartment specific signal amplification in ATP sensing. The system allows for exogenous NIR light&#8208;controlled spatiotemporal localization and activation of the aptamer sensor in mitochondria or ER, while a specific endogenous enzyme in the organelles further drives signal amplification via the consumption of molecular beacon fuels, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivity and spatial precision for the subcellular ATP profiling in the organelle of interest. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system for robust monitoring of ATP fluctuations in mitochondria and ER following drug interventions. This advancement provides a powerful tool for improving our understanding of cellular energetics at the subcellular level and holds potential for the development of targeted therapeutics.

         <title>Supercritical Ethane Processing of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes towards Pressure&#8208;Resistant C3H6/C3H8 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneered the preparation of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes using supercritical ethane as solvent. Owing to its high diffusivity, low viscosity, and chemical inertness, grain boundary defects could be largely eliminated, resulting in superior and pressure&#8208;resistant C3H6/C3H8 separation performances.







Abstract
ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have shown great promise in industrial&#8208;scale C3H6/C3H8 separation. Nonetheless, sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes remains a grand challenge. In this study, we pioneered the use of supercritical ethane (scC2H6) as reaction medium for preparing pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. Membrane growth in neutral organic environment was proven to have less disturbance to structure integrity compared with supercritical CO2 (scCO2). Gas permeation results indicated that obtained ZIF&#8208;8 membrane exhibited an ideal C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 172.1 with C3H6 permeance of 5.9&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pa&#8722;1. Of particular note, the membrane maintained stable C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of ~150 with C3H6 flux of ~1.6&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 at operation pressure of 6&#8197;bar, which was significantly different from ZIF&#8208;8 membranes obtained from scCO2 reaction medium. Through combining with advantages of zero pollutant discharge and full ligand recovery, our protocol holds great promise in sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes towards practical application in high&#8208;purity C3H6 production.

         <title>Catalytic Reductive Amination and Tandem Amination&#8211;Alkylation of Esters Enabled by a Cationic Iridium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation&#8208;enabled one&#8208;pot reductive amination and reductive amination&#8212;functionalization of common carboxylic esters to form N&#8208;alkylated, and tandem N&#8208;alkylated, &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines are described. The reactions relies on cationic [Ir(COD)2]BArF, which exhibited high efficiency (at 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ir&#8208;loading, and 0.001&#8197;mol&#8201;% in a 15&#8197;g scale) and good stability (alleviates the use of glovebox). {BArF=tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate; COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene}.







Abstract
Reported herein is a convenient and efficient method for one&#8208;pot, catalytic reductive amination, as well as the first multi&#8208;component tandem reductive amination&#8212;functionalization of bench&#8208;stable and readily available common carboxylic esters. This method is based on the cationic [Ir(COD)2]BArF&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective hydrosilylation of esters, followed by one&#8208;pot acid&#8208;mediated amination and nucleophilic addition. The reaction was conducted under mild conditions at a very low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Ir), which could be further reduced to 0.001&#8197;mol&#8201;%, as demonstrated by a reaction at a 15&#8197;g scale. The method is highly versatile, allowing the use of esters with or without &#945;&#8208;protons for the N&#8208;mono&#8208;alkylation of primary and secondary amines to produce diverse secondary and tertiary amines, as well as &#945;&#8208;branched/functionalized amines. The method is highly chemoselective and tolerates a variety of functional groups such as bromo, trifluoromethyl, ester, and cyano groups. The value of the method was demonstrated by the one&#8208;step catalytic synthesis of two bio&#8208;relevant N&#8208;mono&#8208;methyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters and the antiparkinsonian agent piribedil, as well as by the use of two shorter chain triglycerides as alkylating feedstock.

         <title>Promoting Hydrogen Transfer in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction via a Hydrogen on Demand Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism was proposed for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, realizing the hydrogen supply matches CO2 protonation. This new mechanism addresses the contradiction between activity and selectivity faced with the traditional &#8220;hydrogen supply&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
The proceeding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires the formation of active hydrogen species for CO2 protonation, while traditional catalysts fail to balance the rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. Herein, we propose a &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism, in which the polarity of the adsorbed CO2 is enhanced to allow the capture of hydrogen from water without forming free hydrogen species, realizing the matching rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. As a proof of concept, we construct Zn&#8722;N sites modified by Se atoms, allowing the proceeding of CO2RR under the &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism with superior efficiency. The catalyst achieves an industrial CO current of &#8722;539.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faradaic efficiencies of CO &gt;90&#8201;% over a broad window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and a high turnover frequency of 7.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 in flow cell. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Se sites enhance the electron localization around the Zn sites, thus increasing the polarity of adsorbed CO2&#8722; with improved ability to acquire hydrogen species from water to facilitate the protonation process.

The catalyst achieves an industrial CO current of &#8722;539.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, faradaic efficiencies of CO &amp;gt;90&#8201;% over a broad window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and a high turnover frequency of 7.6&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in flow cell. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Se sites enhance the electron localization around the Zn sites, thus increasing the polarity of adsorbed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with improved ability to acquire hydrogen species from water to facilitate the protonation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversing Surface Charge for Highly&#8208;Active Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface charge reversal strategy is introduced to regulate the charge character of organic photovoltaic catalyst (OPC). Nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by cationic surfactant exhibit a raised Fermi level, larger surface band bending and Schottky barrier relative to OPC NPs stabilized by anionic surfactant, enhancing charge separation and transfer efficiency while suppressing charge carrier recombination and therefore demonstrating better photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaic materials typically exhibit low charge separation and transfer efficiency and severe exciton/carrier recombination due to high exciton binding energy and short exciton diffusion lengths, limiting the enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Here, we introduce a surface charge reversal strategy to regulate the charge character of organic photovoltaic catalyst (OPC). Compared to OPC nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by an anionic surfactant ((&#8722;)&#8201;NPs), NPs stabilized by a cationic surfactant ((+)&#8201;NPs) exhibit a raised Fermi level, larger surface band bending and Schottky barrier, thereby enhancing charge separation and transfer efficiency while suppressing charge carrier recombination. As a result, (+)&#8201;NPs demonstrate better photocatalytic performance than (&#8722;)&#8201;NPs, independent of the chemical structure of OPCs and surfactant molecules. Under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the PM6: 2FBP&#8208;4F NPs stabilized by cationic surfactant (dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, DTAB) exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution (up to 946.1&#177;15.76&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) than that of PM6: 2FBP&#8208;4F NPs stabilized by anionic surfactant, among the best results reported so far for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulated sunlight.

         <title>Unveiling the Photoluminescence Mechanism of Carbonized Polymer Dots: Evolution and Synergistic Photoluminescence of Multiple Molecular Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular fluorophore named 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,8,13,14&#8208;tetrahaydroimidazo[2,3&#8208;k][4,7,11]&#8208;triazaacephenanthrylene&#8208;1,5,10(12H)&#8208;trione (IATO) was separated from the carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) prepared with citric acid and ethylenediamine. IATO had been proven to evolve from 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;7&#8208;carboxylic acid (IPCA). Further research revealed the whole photoluminescence mechanism of CPDs to be the evolution and synergistic photoluminescence of multiple molecular fluorophores linked on CPDs nanoparticle.







Abstract
Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) are a class of exceptional fluorescent materials with diverse applications. However, their photoluminescence (PL) mechanism remained enigmatic and controversial, hindering further development and application. While molecular fluorophores explain primary fluorescence in some CPDs, the overall PL of CPDs still cannot be fully explained, such as their excitation&#8208;dependent behaviors, let alone the modulation of PL. Besides, the extracted molecular fluorophores are dissociative, raising questions including the purity of CPDs and whether the PL of CPDs nanoparticles come from these molecular fluorophores. Here, the emission around 510&#8197;nm of citric acid&#8208;ethylenediamine CPDs (CA&#8208;EDA CPDs) was proved to be contributed by a molecular fluorophore, which evolved from another molecular fluorophore following the quantum confinement effect. Further research revealed the whole PL mechanism of CA&#8208;EDA CPDs to be the evolution and synergistic PL of multiple molecular fluorophores linked on CPDs nanoparticle. The evolution of molecular fluorophores had also been observed in another two systems, indicating the universality of this mechanism, and a new approach for regulating the optical properties of CPDs was put forward inspired by this mechanism. This study not only refined the PL mechanism but also paved the way for future advancements of CPDs.

         <title>Rapidly Generated, Ultra&#8208;Stable, and Switchable Photoinduced Radicals: A Solid&#8208;State Photochromic Paradigm for Reusable Paper Light&#8208;Writing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapidly responsive and ultra&#8208;stable photoinduced radical platform was constructed by the anti&#8208;parallelly aligned para&#8208;hydroxyphenyl groups of persulfurated arenes. The ultra&#8208;fast high&#8208;contrast photochromism upon UV irradiation is stable for 3&#8197;months in dark. The superior photochromic behavior also remains in the ground sample, for which it can be further processed into reusable papers for light&#8208;writing.







Abstract
Although photochromic molecules have attracted widespread interest in various fields, solid&#8208;state photochromism remains a formidable challenge, owing to the substantial conformational constraints that hinder traditional molecular photoisomerization processes. Benefiting from the significant color change upon radical generation, chemical systems enabling a photoinduced radical (PIR) behavior through photoinduced electron transfer (PET) could be ideal candidates for solid&#8208;state photochromism within minimized need of conformational freedom. However, the transient nature of radicals causes a dilemma in this Scheme. Herein, we present a general crystal engineering strategy for rapidly generated (7&#8208;s irradiation to saturation) and ultra&#8208;stable (lasting 12&#8197;weeks) PIRs in the solid state, based on the anti&#8208;parallel alignment of para&#8208;hydroxyphenyl groups of persulfurated arenes to form a strong non&#8208;covalent network for efficient PET and radical stabilization. Using this strategy, a PIR platform was constructed, with a superior photochromic behavior remaining in different solid forms (even in the fully&#8208;ground sample) due to their transcendent crystallization ability. On this basis, our compounds can be further processed into reusable papers for light&#8208;writing, accompanied by water fumigation for modulating the reversible process. This work provides new insights into addressing solid&#8208;state photochromism and can inspire a wide range of optical material design from the switchable radical perspective.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction and Application of Axially Chiral Spiro&#8208;bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization, a class of configurationally stable axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole skeletons were accessed for the first time with excellent enantiocontrol. Further stereospecific elaborations of the resulting highly enantioenriched products afforded axially chiral fluorescent molecules with good asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.







Abstract
Spiro skeletons have emerged as a privileged class of chiral carriers across various research fields, including asymmetric catalysis and functional materials, due to their remarkable configurational rigidity. However, limited structural diversity of spiro frameworks significantly restricts the expansion of their applications. Here we present a new class of axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole frameworks and report their first enantioselective construction via a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization reaction. Unlike the classical SPINOL backbone, incorporation of indole moieties in place of phenol enhances the nucleophilicity of ketone substrates, thereby eliminating the need for a tedious pre&#8208;activation process. By leveraging the retained active sites of indole, the resulting highly enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles can be rapidly transformed into other valuable structures. More importantly, axially chiral fluorescent molecules with good asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency are readily accessed, opening a new avenue for developing chiral fluorescent materials. Control experiments demonstrate the pivotal role of both unmasked N&#8722;H bonds in achieving good efficiency and enantiocontrol.

         <title>BN&#8208;Acene Ladder with Enhanced Charge Transport for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel ladder&#8208;type BN&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) featuring a highly ordered BC3N2 acene unit were prepared via a nitrogen&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. In micro&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), these compounds demonstrate enhanced charge transport, achieving a hole mobility of up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which ranks among the highest values for BN&#8208;PAH&#8208;based OFETs.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth research on the charge transport properties of BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) still lags far behind studies of their emitting properties. Herein, we report the successfully synthesis of novel ladder&#8208;type BN&#8208;PAHs (BCNL1 and BCNL2) featuring a highly ordered BC3N2 acene unit, achieved via a nitrogen&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed their unique and compact herringbone packing structures. Micro&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) demonstrated that an enhanced charge transport capability, with BCNL2 achieving a hole mobility of up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8211;three orders of magnitude higher than that of BCNL1 (&#956;hmax=6 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), ranking among the highest values for BN&#8208;PAHs&#8208;based OFETs. Detailed calculations attribute this significant enhancement in the hole mobility to the marked reduction in reorganization energy (&#955;) of BCNL2, resulting from the five&#8208;membered pyrrole ring annulation and molecular skeleton elongation. This work provides insight into molecular design principles for potential BN&#8208;PAHs in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Growth of Metallocluster Inside Heterometal&#8208;Organic Cage to Switch Electron Transfer for Targeted CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetranuclear Cu cluster was coordinated endogamously inside a cluster&#8208;based heterometallic&#8208;organic cage which takes a crucial role in modulating the orbital alignment for a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state towards targeted CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.







Abstract
Construction of metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with internal modifications is a promising avenue to build enzyme&#8208;like cavities and unlocking the mystery of highly catalytic activity and selectivity of enzymes. However, current interests are mainly focused on single&#8208;metal&#8208;node cages, little achievement has been expended to metallocluster&#8208;based architectures, and the in situ endogenous generation of metal clusters. Herein, based on the hard&#8208;soft&#8208;acids&#8208;bases (HSAB), the metallocluster&#8208;based heterometallic MOC (Cu3VMOP) constructed of [Cu3OPz3]+ and [V6O6(OCH3)9(SO4)(CO2)3]2&#8722; clusters was obtained by one&#8208;pot method. In addition, Cu4I4 was generated in situ in the cage to form Cu4I4@Cu3VMOP by the coordination&#8208;driven hierarchical self&#8208;assembly strategy. As catalysts for CO2 reduction, Cu3VMOP produces HCOOH and CH3COOH as the main reduction product with yield of CH3COOH up to 0.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest value of reported materials, whereas Cu4I4@Cu3VMOP exhibited targeted CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion with 100&#8201;% formic acid selectivity and the yield outperforms that of Cu3VMOP by 5 fold. Theoretical calculations and femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption reveal that endogenous Cu4I4 not only regulates orbital arrangements and enhances localized electron states to generate a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state, but also raises *CO coupling energy barrier, resulting in the targeted conversion of CO2 to formic acid.

         <title>Tunable Mechanically Interlocked Semi&#8208;Crystalline Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked semi&#8208;crystalline polymer networks were constructed to achieve the synchronous enhancement of seemingly conflicting material properties including mechanical robustness, toughness, elasticity and reprocessability. The improvement was ascribed to the synergic mechanism of mechanical interlocked crosslinks, physical crystalline domains, and dynamic disulfide bonding.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance polymers based on dynamic chemistry have been widely explored for multi&#8208;field advanced applications. However, noncovalent sacrificial bond&#8208;mediated energy dissipation mechanism causes a trade&#8208;off between mechanical toughness and resilience. Herein, we achieved the synchronous boost of seemingly conflicting material properties including mechanical robustness, toughness and elasticity via the incorporation of mechanical chemistry into traditional semi&#8208;crystalline networks. Detailed rheological tests and all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulation reveal that the excellent mechanical robustness and toughness are attributed to the dissociation of crystalline domains threading through the sieve&#8208;shape macrocycles. Reversible nano&#8208;crystalline domains and ring&#8208;sliding&#8208;effect accelerated segment motion efficiently reduce energy dissipation to achieve instantaneous resilience. Moreover, the model polymers demonstrate that the multiple dynamic components endow the resulting polymer with excellent reprocessability under mild conditions. This mechanically interlocked semi&#8208;crystalline polymer exhibits potential applications as a thermal/photo actuator. This work reveals the synergic effects of mechanically interlocked sites and tunable crystalline domains, thus providing a reliable guide for the comprehensive improvement of material performance.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Induced Spin&#8208;State Switching Based on Fe(II)&#8722;Hg(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature and light&#8208;dependent synergistic switching effects in magnetic, structural, and spectral properties have been discovered for a three&#8208;dimensional spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) material [FeII(4&#8208;acetylpyridine)2][HgII(&#956;&#8208;SCN)4]. Tunable terahertz absorption through temperature and light stimuli is associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers through SCO behavior supported by ab initio calculation.







Abstract
The development of molecular switches with tunable properties has garnered considerable interest over several decades. A novel spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) material based on iron(II) complexes incorporating 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;acpy) and [Hg(SCN)4]2&#8722; anions was synthesized and formulated as [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2][Hg(&#956;&#8208;SCN)4] (1). Compound 1 is crystallized in a three&#8208;dimensional network in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group Pna21 with two octahedral [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2(NCS)4] entities featuring two distinct Fe centers (Fe1 and Fe2). Crystallographic, magnetic, and M&#246;ssbauer measurements reveal an incomplete SCO exclusively at Fe2, with transition temperature T1/2&#8776;102&#8197;K. Photomagnetic studies conducted at 10&#8197;K with lasers ranging from 405 to 1310&#8197;nm evidence light&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (LIESST) and reverse&#8208;LIESST effects, with a unique near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LIESST phenomenon at 1064 and 1310&#8197;nm. Advanced photocrystallographic studies at 40&#8197;K provide precise structural evidence for these metastable states. The optical and vibrational properties consistently corroborate with magnetic and photomagnetic studies. Additionally, temperature&#8208; and light&#8208;dependent terahertz (THz) absorptions are associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers, through SCO behavior, as supported by ab initio calculation. The Fe(II)&#8722;Hg(II) systems can be promising benchmarks for exploring synergistic switching effects in structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic properties.

A novel spin-crossover (&lt;i&gt;SCO&lt;/i&gt;) material based on iron(II) complexes incorporating 4-acetylpyridine (4-acpy) and [Hg(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions was synthesized and formulated as [Fe(4-acpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][Hg(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-SCN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;). Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is crystallized in a three-dimensional network in the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group &lt;i&gt;Pna&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with two octahedral [Fe(4-acpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NCS)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] entities featuring two distinct Fe centers (Fe1 and Fe2). Crystallographic, magnetic, and M&#246;ssbauer measurements reveal an incomplete &lt;i&gt;SCO&lt;/i&gt; exclusively at Fe2, with transition temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;102&#8197;K. Photomagnetic studies conducted at 10&#8197;K with lasers ranging from 405 to 1310&#8197;nm evidence light-induced excited spin-state trapping (&lt;i&gt;LIESST&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;reverse-LIESST&lt;/i&gt; effects, with a unique near-infrared-responsive &lt;i&gt;LIESST&lt;/i&gt; phenomenon at 1064 and 1310&#8197;nm. Advanced photocrystallographic studies at 40&#8197;K provide precise structural evidence for these metastable states. The optical and vibrational properties consistently corroborate with magnetic and photomagnetic studies. Additionally, temperature- and light-dependent terahertz (THz) absorptions are associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers, through &lt;i&gt;SCO&lt;/i&gt; behavior, as supported by ab initio calculation. The Fe(II)&#8722;Hg(II) systems can be promising benchmarks for exploring synergistic switching effects in structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3,6&#8208;Bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A methylthiocarbazole&#8208;based phosphonic acid, MeS&#8208;4PACz, capable of forming a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide has been developed. The molecule induces an interfacial dipole and passivates iodide vacancies in FAPbI3 perovskite. Inverted perovskite solar cells using MeS&#8208;4PACz SAM as a hole&#8208;selective layer achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.134&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) relies on effectively managing the interface between the hole extraction layer and the light&#8208;absorbing perovskite layer. In this study, we have synthesised (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (MeS&#8208;4PACz), which forms a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode. The molecule&#8216;s methylthio substituents generate a favourable interfacial dipole moment and interact with the perovskite layer. This interaction results in well&#8208;aligned energy levels among the FTO/SAM/perovskite layers, promoting efficient hole extraction and significantly reducing carrier recombination losses. Additionally, the methylthio groups passivate iodide vacancies and interact with Pb2+ ions of the perovskite, reducing defect&#8208;induced trap states and enhancing the crystalline growth of the perovskite layer. Consequently, inverted PSCs incorporating MeS&#8208;4PACz achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.13&#8201;%, along with outstanding photostability.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Induced Ordered Carbonaceous Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated method is proposed to induce phase separation of the assembled units and the evolution of micellar templates, enabling the successful construction of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;induced hierarchical superstructures in a single preparation step. These superstructures exhibit a unique surface architecture composed of discontinuous nanodots and demonstrate enhanced catalytic activity, showcasing excellent electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries.







Abstract
Constructing hierarchical superstructures through one&#8208;step bottom&#8208;up synthesis poses significant challenges due to strong interactions between additives and micelles, which hinders the formation of heterogeneous configurations. Here, we propose a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated method to weaken these interactions and manipulate the thermal instability of micellar templates. This approach successfully synthesizes hierarchical superstructures that combine a carbonaceous nanosheet substrate with polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;induced, highly ordered discontinuous nanodots in a single preparation step. The surface nanodots have a diameter of approximately 19&#8197;nm and are spaced about 32&#8197;nm apart. Besides, the nanodots with various arrangements can be generated by simply adjusting the amount of POM. Importantly, the superstructure features more exposed POM catalytic sites than conventional carbonaceous hybrids lacking surface architectures, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. This high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated approach offers new insights for designing hierarchical superstructures and functional materials with enhanced activities.

Spherical Na4Fe2.96Mg0.02Cu0.02(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP) cathode materials have been successfully synthesized via the combination of spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method. The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP. While, the small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry exhibit an enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables a low high&#8208;stress concentration and alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress during the extensive (de)sodiation cycling.







Abstract
Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has been regarded as the promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the practical applications of NFPP are hindered by its high&#8208;volume changes, poor intrinsic electron conductivity and sluggish Na+ ions diffusion kinetics. Herein, a spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method have been utilized to fabricate the spherical trace amount Mg/Cu co&#8208;doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP). The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP by reducing band gap between the conduction and valence bands. While, the unique spherical structured NFMCPP with a carbon film even coated on its surface ensures rapid electron transport. Moreover, small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry demonstrate an alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress and enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables fluent Na+ extraction/insertion, leads to a low high&#8208;stress concentration and uniform stress/strain distribution during extensive (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the optimized spherical NFMCPP cathode materials exhibit an excellent rate capability and cyclic stability.

         <title>Isomerism Effect of 3D Dimeric Acceptors for Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with 20&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular isomerization strategy was employed to develop 3D dimeric acceptors (CH8&#8208;4/4A/4B), which demonstrate varying molecular pre&#8208;aggregation in o&#8208;xylene. These distinctive properties significantly affect the film&#8208;forming process and the resulting morphological characteristics. Due to the moderate pre&#8208;aggregation of CH8&#8208;4, an impressive efficiency of 20.0&#8201;% was received for CH8&#8208;4&#8208;based device, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in non&#8208;halogen solvent&#8208;processed organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaic materials that can be processed via non&#8208;halogenated solvents are crucial for the large&#8208;area manufacturing of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited available of electron acceptors with adequate solubility and favorable molecular packing presents a challenge in achieving efficient non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs. Herein, inspired by the three&#8208;dimensional dimeric acceptor CH8&#8208;4, we employed a molecular isomerization strategy to synthesize its isomers, CH8&#8208;4A and CH8&#8208;4B, by tuning the position of fluorine (F) atom in the central unit. The differing intramolecular fluorine&#8208;sulfur non&#8208;covalent interactions among these isomers led to differences in molecular pre&#8208;aggregation abilities (CH8&#8208;4B&lt;CH8&#8208;4&lt;CH8&#8208;4A) in o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) solution, which significantly influence the film&#8208;forming process and the resultant morphological characteristics. Among these, the blend film of CH8&#8208;4, characterized by moderate molecular pre&#8208;aggregation, achieved optimal bi&#8208;continuous donor/acceptor phase separation. Consequently, the o&#8208;xylene processed PM6&#8201;:&#8201;CH8&#8208;4 device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.1&#8201;%, outperforming that of two other devices. By incorporating L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D as a guest acceptor, we attained an impressive PCE of 20.0&#8201;% for the CH8&#8208;4&#8208;based ternary device, alongside a high PCE nearing 16&#8201;% for the mini&#8208;module (13.5&#8197;cm2). Our findings underscore the potential of isomerism in 3D dimer acceptors to enhance the performance of eco&#8208;friendly OSCs.

     alt="Isomerism Effect of 3D Dimeric Acceptors for Non-Halogenated Solvent-Processed Organic Solar Cells with 20&#8201;% Efficiency"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular isomerization strategy was employed to develop 3D dimeric acceptors (CH8-4/4A/4B), which demonstrate varying molecular pre-aggregation in &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene. These distinctive properties significantly affect the film-forming process and the resulting morphological characteristics. Due to the moderate pre-aggregation of CH8-4, an impressive efficiency of 20.0&#8201;% was received for CH8-4-based device, representing the state-of-the-art in non-halogen solvent-processed organic solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic photovoltaic materials that can be processed via non-halogenated solvents are crucial for the large-area manufacturing of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited available of electron acceptors with adequate solubility and favorable molecular packing presents a challenge in achieving efficient non-halogenated solvent-processed OSCs. Herein, inspired by the three-dimensional dimeric acceptor CH8-4, we employed a molecular isomerization strategy to synthesize its isomers, CH8-4A and CH8-4B, by tuning the position of fluorine (F) atom in the central unit. The differing intramolecular fluorine-sulfur non-covalent interactions among these isomers led to differences in molecular pre-aggregation abilities (CH8-4B&amp;lt;CH8-4&amp;lt;CH8-4A) in &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-XY) solution, which significantly influence the film-forming process and the resultant morphological characteristics. Among these, the blend film of CH8-4, characterized by moderate molecular pre-aggregation, achieved optimal bi-continuous donor/acceptor phase separation. Consequently, the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene processed PM6&#8201;:&#8201;CH8-4 device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.1&#8201;%, outperforming that of two other devices. By incorporating L8-BO-D as a guest acceptor, we attained an impressive PCE of 20.0&#8201;% for the CH8-4-based ternary device, alongside a high PCE nearing 16&#8201;% for the mini-module (13.5&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Our findings underscore the potential of isomerism in 3D dimer acceptors to enhance the performance of eco-friendly OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inverting Methanol Dehydrogenation Selectivity by Crowding Atomic Ni Species over &#945;&#8208;MoC Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal carbides are promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts but face challenges in controlling reaction pathways due to strong adsorption of reactants. This study shows that bare &#945;&#8208;MoC favors bimolecular methanol dehydrogenation to methyl formate and H2, while Ni&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;MoC shifts selectivity to monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H2. Mechanistic insights reveal Ni sites enhance C&#8722;H bond cleavage, enabling complete alcohol dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Metal carbides with earth&#8208;abundant elements are widely regarded as promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts. Although comparable catalytic performances have been observed for metal carbides in several types of reactions, precise control of reaction pathways on them remains a formidable challenge, partially due to strong adsorption of reactants or intermediates. In this study, we show that bimolecular dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate and H2 is kinetically favored on bare &#945;&#8208;MoC catalysts, while monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H2 becomes the dominant pathway when &#945;&#8208;MoC is decorated with crowding atomic Ni species. Under optimal conditions, excellent selectivities of the target products (&gt;90&#8201;%) were achieved in both cases, with unprecedented production rates of methyl formate and H2 for the former and latter mechanisms, respectively. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational assessments were integrated to clarify the mechanism driving this remarkable selectivity inversion. Isolated Ni sites bound to &#945;&#8208;MoC exhibit superior dehydrogenation activity, which promotes complete cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in methanol&#8208;derived intermediates rather than the C&#8722;O coupling between them. Our study offers an effective approach to modulating the selectivity of carbide&#8208;based catalysts in alcohol dehydrogenation towards different target products.

         <title>Surface Coverage Tuning for Suppressing Over&#8208;Oxidation: A Case of Photoelectrochemical Alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;Aldehyde/Ketone Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has been found that oxidative species derived from H2O exhibit a stronger competitive adsorption ability compared to alcohol substrates during photoelectrochemical (PEC) alcohol oxidation, leading to poor formation of pre&#8208;oxidized intermediates and excessive alcohol oxidation. However, after PEC polarization, the adsorption of alcohol substrates is significantly enhanced, enabling competition with oxidative species. This boosts the formation of pre&#8208;oxidized intermediates, effectively suppressing alcohol over&#8208;oxidation and enhancing the oxidation kinetics of alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;aldehyde conversion.







Abstract
Suppressing over&#8208;oxidation is a crucial challenge for various chemical intermediate synthesis in heterogeneous catalysis. The distribution of oxidative species and the substrate coverage, governed by the direction of electron transfer, are believed to influence the oxidation extent. In this study, we presented an experimental realization of surface coverage modulation on a photoelectrode using a photo&#8208;induced charge activation method. Through the surface coverage modulation, both pre&#8208;oxidized alcohol substrates and surface coverage were increased, which not only improved the reaction kinetics but also suppressed the over&#8208;oxidation of the generated aldehydes/ketones. As a demonstration, the Faradaic efficiency for the conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone increased from 31.8&#8201;% to 46.8&#8201;% (with selectivity rising from 47.6&#8201;% to 71.3&#8201;%), from 73.4&#8201;% to 87.8&#8201;% for benzyl alcohol to benzyl aldehyde (selectivity increasing from 76.7&#8201;% to 92.4&#8201;%) and from 4.2&#8201;% to 53.6&#8201;% for ethylene glycol to glycolaldehyde (selectivity increasing from 6.2&#8201;% to 62.7&#8201;%). Our findings offer a promising strategy for the production of high&#8208;value carbon products in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis Enables Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclopropene and Ring Expansion of Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding interaction enables catalyzing the ring expansion of aryl ketones appending a cyclopropene moiety as carbene precursor. In contrast, transition metal and thermal approaches prefer the formation of furan side product. This research reveals that chalcogen bonding catalysts can play a role in producing and regulating carbene species, thus providing an alternative platform for solving reactivity problem in carbene transformations.







Abstract
Catalytic transformation of carbene species constitutes a fundamental part in organic synthesis, and the research in this direction has been dominated by transition metals while organic catalysts are difficult to mimic such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity. It would significantly advance carbene chemistry if organic catalysts enable achieving classical metal&#8208;carbene approaches otherwise unrealizable reactions. Herein, we report that chalcogen bonding catalysis can solve reactivity problem to achieve an elusive Buchner ring expansion of aryl ketones appending a cyclopropene moiety as carbene precursor. In this work, the ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropene and the ring&#8208;expansion of aryl systems were added in the field of noncovalent catalysis. This work demonstrates that chalcogen bonding can mediate carbene transformations beyond the known ionic approach. In contrast, transition metals such as rhodium, palladium, and copper complexes, could not solve the reactivity problem to achieve ring expansion of aryl ketones but instead these metal&#8208;carbene approaches prefer the formation of furan side product. In addition, a thermal approach even being conducted at 200&#8201;&#176;C could not achieve this ring expansion reaction. Mechanistic investigation suggests Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction with cyclopropene facilitates the ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropene and chalcogen bonding with carbene intermediate changes the reaction pathway, thus overriding the furan reaction pathway.

         <title>Partially Interstitial Silicon&#8208;Implanted Ruthenium as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partially interstitial silicon implanted ruthenium not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. In addition, the spontaneously generated built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption property of the Ru sites, further significantly lowering the thermodynamic energy barrier for the alkaline HER.







Abstract
To enhance the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it is crucial, yet challenging, to fundamentally understand and rationally modulate potential catalytic sites. In this study, we confirm that despite calculating a low water dissociation energy barrier and an appropriate H adsorption free energy (&#916;G*H) at Ru&#8208;top sites, metallic Ru exhibits a relatively inferior activity for the alkaline HER. This is primarily because the Ru&#8208;top sites, which are potential H adsorption sites, are recessive catalytic sites, compared with the adjacent Ru&#8208;hollow sites that have a strong &#916;G*H. To promote the transformation of Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites, interstitial Si atoms are implanted into the hollow sites. However, complete interstitial implantation leads to a high water dissociation energy barrier at the RuSi intermetallic surface. Thus, we present a partial interstitial incorporation strategy to form a Ru&#8722;RuSi heterostructure that not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. Moreover, the spontaneously formed built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption ability of the Ru sites, thereby greatly reducing the thermodynamic energy barrier and enhancing the alkaline HER.

&lt;p&gt;The partially interstitial silicon implanted ruthenium not only converts the Ru-top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. In addition, the spontaneously generated built-in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption property of the Ru sites, further significantly lowering the thermodynamic energy barrier for the alkaline HER.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it is crucial, yet challenging, to fundamentally understand and rationally modulate potential catalytic sites. In this study, we confirm that despite calculating a low water dissociation energy barrier and an appropriate H adsorption free energy (&#916;G&lt;sub&gt;*H&lt;/sub&gt;) at Ru-top sites, metallic Ru exhibits a relatively inferior activity for the alkaline HER. This is primarily because the Ru-top sites, which are potential H adsorption sites, are recessive catalytic sites, compared with the adjacent Ru-hollow sites that have a strong &#916;G&lt;sub&gt;*H&lt;/sub&gt;. To promote the transformation of Ru-top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites, interstitial Si atoms are implanted into the hollow sites. However, complete interstitial implantation leads to a high water dissociation energy barrier at the RuSi intermetallic surface. Thus, we present a partial interstitial incorporation strategy to form a Ru&#8722;RuSi heterostructure that not only converts the Ru-top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. Moreover, the spontaneously formed built-in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption ability of the Ru sites, thereby greatly reducing the thermodynamic energy barrier and enhancing the alkaline HER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Micellar Aggregate Electrolytes Enable Durable Electrochemical Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular micellar aggregate is designed as non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes for stable and high&#8208;voltage electrochemical proton storage. Such aggregates impart rapid and stable electrochemical proton storage with a widened operating voltage (1.8&#8197;V vs. 1.5&#8197;V in aqueous electrolyte). A symmetric full proton battery using the optimal CTAB electrolyte achieves a maximum energy density of 102.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 10.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Proton electrochemistry holds eminent potential for developing high capacity and rate energy storage devices in the post&#8208;lithium era. However, the decomposition of water in acidic aqueous electrolytes causes electrode corrosion, leading to capacity fading. Herein, we report a judicious design of molecular micellar aggregates as non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes for stable and high&#8208;voltage electrochemical proton storage. The key to our strategy lies in introducing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), forming micelles to improve the miscibility of acetonitrile (ACN) and H3PO4, afford channel for proton transport, and electrostatically interact with phosphate ions of H3PO4 to further promote proton transport. Such aggregates impart rapid and stable electrochemical proton storage with a widened operating voltage (1.8&#8197;V vs. 1.5&#8197;V in aqueous electrolyte). By optimizing CTAB content, proton transport can be enhanced. Asymmetric full proton battery using the optimal CTAB electrolyte achieves a maximum energy density of 102.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 10.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Our simple yet robust route to micellar aggregate electrolytes enables stable proton storage, underscoring its potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, emergency power supplies, and portable electronics.

         <title>Multifaceted Hidden Catalysis Revealed by Mechanistic Analysis of FeBr3&#8208;Catalysed Arene Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic analysis revealed the iron&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H borylation of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine derivatives with 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ([H&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN]2) operates through hidden catalysis with the iron salt mediating the formation of Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN, the active catalyst. The reaction was shown to proceed through an electrophilic borylation mechanism.







Abstract
Arene borylation reactions provide direct access to aryl organoboranes, including aryl boronic esters. Precious metals, namely Ir, Rh, Pt, remain the go&#8208;to for metal&#8208;catalysed borylation reactions, however, significant efforts have been expended in developing Earth&#8208;abundant metal alternatives. The iron&#8208;catalysed borylation of 2&#8208;aryl pyridine derivatives with 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (H&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN) offers unique reactivity by using only FeBr3 as the catalyst, without added ligand(s). Mechanistic analysis of this borylation reaction revealed an alternative, hidden catalysis pathway whereby the iron salt acts not as a borylation catalyst, but as an initiator for the generation of a catalytically active haloborane, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN. The roles of iron salt, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN, and HBr in catalyst formation, the mode of catalytic turnover, and catalyst regeneration were all determined using single&#8208;turnover and catalytic studies. The borylation reaction was found to proceed by a catalytic electrophilic borylation using, in situ generated, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN. These studies highlight a new, orthogonal method of generating haloboranes and their previously unobserved role as hidden catalysts within arene borylation reactions.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Plasma&#8208;Driven Ammonia Synthesis Using a AuCu3/Cu Composite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient radio&#8208;frequency (RF) plasma&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis has been achieved using an integrated AuCu3/Cu composite catalyst. The Cu antenna facilitates the generation of reactive species, while surface AuCu3 nanoparticles (NPs) serve as catalytic sites for efficient ammonia synthesis, owing to the unique Cu&#8722;Au interface and a downshifted d&#8208;band center. The synergistic effect of Cu antenna and surface AuCu3 NPs comprehensively boosts ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
Green ammonia synthesis using fluctuating renewable energy supply in decentralized process is a goal that has been long sought after. Ammonia synthesis with non&#8208;thermal plasma under mild conditions is a promising technology, but it faces the critical challenge of low energy efficiency. Herein, we develop an easily&#8208;scalable AuCu3/Cu catalyst, which consists of a decimeter&#8208;scale metallic Cu antenna and nano&#8208;scale AuCu3 catalytic sites on metallic Cu surface, significantly enhancing the energy efficiency and ammonia yield in a radio&#8208;frequency (RF) plasma system. Compared to plasma alone, the single&#8208;pass ammonia yield over AuCu3/Cu increases by a factor of 20, approaching 10&#8201;%. Mechanistic studies indicate that Cu antenna can amplify the millimeter&#8208;scale local electric field, thereby facilitating the generation of active nitrogen species, including nitrogen radicals and vibration&#8208;excited nitrogen molecules. Due to the downshifted d&#8208;band center and unique Cu&#8722;Au interface structure, the AuCu3 nanoalloy modified on Cu antenna surface significantly reduces hydrogenation barriers of active NHX (x=0,1,2) species (the rate&#8208;determining step) and facilitates ammonia desorption at lower temperature. The synergistic effect of Cu antenna and surface AuCu3 nanoalloy comprehensively enhances ammonia synthesis through both the nitrogen radical&#8208;mediated Eley&#8208;Rideal pathway and the vibration&#8208;excited nitrogen molecule&#8208;mediated Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathway.

         <title>Molecular Customization of Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfaces for Enhanced Stability and Reversibility in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Carbon Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

The pyridine group enables interfacial aggregation and anchoring of vitamin molecules, while the hydroxyl group coordinates with Zn2+, optimizing the solvation structure near the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This dual modulation regulates Zn2+ deposition, reducing corrosion and hydrogen evolution, enhancing zinc electrochemistry reversibility and enhancing zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors&#8217; cycling stability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors display application potential in green power and high&#8208;end equipment owing to their high security, large power and sustainability. The water&#8208;rich zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface (AEI) and disordered zinc&#8208;ion diffusion are the culprits triggering corrosion reactions and dendrite growth, threatening the sustainability of aqueous zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors. Herein, a polyfunctional biomolecular, vitamin B6, is introduced into the traditional aqueous electrolyte for customizing the functional AEI and fine&#8208;regulating the interfacial coordination environment of zinc ions. Specifically, the preferential anchoring of pyridine nitrogen enables trace vitamin (2.0&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) to construct a robust AEI and suppress corrosion reactions. The hydroxyl function zone provides high&#8208;octane guidance for zinc&#8208;ion diffusion at the AEI, resulting in flat zinc (002) oriented growth. Consequently, the Zn//Zn symmetrical cell features an ultrahigh cumulative capacity of 4.0&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under 34&#8201;% depth of discharge. The vitamin&#8208;optimized zinc&#8208;carbon capacitor features extended operational lifetimes exceeding 8&#8197;months (200 thousand cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and demonstrates a high areal capacity of averaging 0.68&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exceptional durability over 2000&#8197;hours at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 under a high discharge depth of zinc anode (averaging 11.6&#8201;%). This work offers valuable insights into sustainable and cost&#8208;effective zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors.

&lt;p&gt;The pyridine group enables interfacial aggregation and anchoring of vitamin molecules, while the hydroxyl group coordinates with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, optimizing the solvation structure near the anode-electrolyte interface. This dual modulation regulates Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition, reducing corrosion and hydrogen evolution, enhancing zinc electrochemistry reversibility and enhancing zinc-carbon capacitors&#8217; cycling stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-carbon capacitors display application potential in green power and high-end equipment owing to their high security, large power and sustainability. The water-rich zinc anode-electrolyte interface (AEI) and disordered zinc-ion diffusion are the culprits triggering corrosion reactions and dendrite growth, threatening the sustainability of aqueous zinc-carbon capacitors. Herein, a polyfunctional biomolecular, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is introduced into the traditional aqueous electrolyte for customizing the functional AEI and fine-regulating the interfacial coordination environment of zinc ions. Specifically, the preferential anchoring of pyridine nitrogen enables trace vitamin (2.0&#8197;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to construct a robust AEI and suppress corrosion reactions. The hydroxyl function zone provides high-octane guidance for zinc-ion diffusion at the AEI, resulting in flat zinc (002) oriented growth. Consequently, the Zn//Zn symmetrical cell features an ultrahigh cumulative capacity of 4.0&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under 34&#8201;% depth of discharge. The vitamin-optimized zinc-carbon capacitor features extended operational lifetimes exceeding 8&#8197;months (200 thousand cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and demonstrates a high areal capacity of averaging 0.68&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and exceptional durability over 2000&#8197;hours at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under a high discharge depth of zinc anode (averaging 11.6&#8201;%). This work offers valuable insights into sustainable and cost-effective zinc-carbon capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Poly(2&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;Oxazoline) as Super&#8208;Hydrophilic Antifouling Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protected alcohol functional 2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline (AcOMeOx) is synthesized with the aim of making a super hydrophilic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) for biomedical applications. The monomer showed unanticipated and intriguing reactivity during CROP as it very slowly polymerizes at low temperature while the polymerization rate constant at high temperature is amongst the highest known values. Additionally, first order kinetic plots for the copolymerisation of AcOMeOx with EtOx at high temperature revealed that EtOx is incorporated at a faster rate than the AcOMeOx, confirming both the low nucleophilicity of AcOMeOx and the chain end&#8208;activation by the ester side chains. Hydrolysis of the PAcOMeOx generates poly(2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PHOMeOx) which is found to be the most hydrophilic non&#8208;ionic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) reported to date. Strong anti&#8208;fouling properties of intensely hydrophilic and cytocompatible PHOMeOx against serum protein was confirmed from the cell association study.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ionic &#8220;super&#8208;hydrophilic&#8221; polymers generally possess strong non&#8208;fouling characteristics and, therefore, can suppress non&#8208;specific and unwanted interactions with blood proteins when attached to in vivo nanomedicine ranging from drug or gene delivery to diagnostics. In this contribution, we revitalize a protected alcohol functionalized 2&#8208;oxazoline monomer, 2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline, that was first reported almost fifty&#8208;five years ago and explore the possibility of making &#8220;super&#8208;hydrophilic&#8221; poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s for biomedical applications. The synthesis of the 2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline monomer and its cationic ring&#8208;opening homopolymerization and copolymerization kinetics are reported. The monomer showed unanticipated and intriguing reactivity during homopolymerization as it very slowly polymerizes at low temperature while the polymerization rate constant at high temperature is amongst the highest known values. Additionally, first order kinetic plots for the copolymerisation of AcOMeOx with EtOx at high temperature revealed that AcOMeOx is incorporated at a slower rate than EtOx confirming its lower nucleophilicity, while EtOx was accelerated in the copolymerization indicating chain&#8208;end activation by the ester side&#8208;chains. Subsequently, controlled hydrolysis of the resulting poly(2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PAcOMeOx) generates the alcohol (&#8722;OH) side chain functional poly(2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PHOMeOx). The relative hydrophilicity of PHOMeOx was analyzed and compared with the previously reported most hydrophilic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s, such as poly(2&#8208;methoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) and poly(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline), revealing that PHOMeOx is the most hydrophilic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) reported to date. Finally, the cytocompatibility of these different hydrophilic polymers with MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cells was explored where all polymers revealed high cytocompatibility. Most importantly, strong anti&#8208;fouling properties of the most hydrophilic PHOMeOx against serum protein were observed during the cell association studies. Hence, the &#8220;super&#8208;hydrophilic&#8221; and anti&#8208;fouling PHOMeOx might be an interesting candidate to be explored in the area of polymeric drug and gene delivery as well as anti&#8208;fouling surfaces.

         <title>Printing Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy for Microvasculature using Degradable DNA Biolubricant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general PRINting Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy (PRINCESS) and successfully fabricated microvasculatures using degradable DNA biolubricant. This is the first demonstration of direct cell printing to fabricate microvasculature. Utilizing the DNA hydrogel as biolubricant, we can print a 70&#8197;&#956;m endothelialized microvasculature and cell&#8208;laden tissue constructs with branched microvasculatures.







Abstract
Microvasculature is essential for the continued function of cells in tissue and is fundamental in the fields of tissue engineering, organ repair and drug screening. However, the fabrication of microvasculature is still challenging using existing strategies. Here, we developed a general PRINting Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy (PRINCESS) and successfully fabricated microvasculatures using degradable DNA biolubricant. This is the first demonstration of direct cell printing to fabricate microvasculature, which eliminates the need for a subsequent cell seeding process and the associated deficiencies. Utilizing the shear&#8208;thinning property of DNA hydrogels as a novel sacrificial, cell&#8208;laden biolubricant, we can print a 70&#8197;&#956;m endothelialized microvasculature, breaking the limit of 100&#8197;&#956;m. To our best knowledge, this is the smallest endothelialized microvasculature that has ever been bioprinted so far. In addition, the self&#8208;healing property of DNA hydrogels allows the creation of continuous branched structures. This strategy provides a new platform for constructing complex hierarchical vascular networks and offers new opportunity towards engineering thick tissues. The extremely low volume of sacrificial biolubricant paves the way for DNA hydrogels to be used in practical tissue engineering applications. The high&#8208;resolution bioprinting technique also exhibits great potential for printing lymphatics, retinas and neural networks in the future.

         <title>Unveiling the Structure&#8208;Fluorogenic Property Relationship of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Derived Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized fluorogenic Seoul&#8208;Fluor (SF)&#8208;based tetrazine (Tz) probes with differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Through electronic modifications and quantum calculations, we elucidated the relationship between dienophile&#8208;Tz adduct structures and their fluorogenic properties. These probes enabled simultaneous multicolor bioorthogonal imaging of diverse cellular targets using a single probe.







Abstract
Tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;embedded fluorescent probes, known for their fluorogenicity following bioorthogonal inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iEDDA) reactions, are extensively used in bioimaging. Despite extensive research on fluorogenic Tz probes, there has been limited systematic exploration of their fluorogenic responses with various dienophiles. In this study, we elucidate the structure&#8208;fluorogenic property relationship of bioorthogonal Tz probes. We synthesized a series of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Tz (SFTz) probes designed to exhibit differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon iEDDA reactions with three dienophiles: trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Our findings revealed that the fluorogenic properties of the SFTz probes are highly dependent on the structures of Tz&#8208;dienophile adducts. By systematically modifying the electronic properties and employing quantum chemical calculations, we developed a series of SFTz probes with optimal dienophile&#8208;dependent fluorescence. These probes enabled simultaneous dual&#8208;color imaging of different cellular targets using a single probe, providing a robust approach for advanced bioimaging applications that require precise and efficient multicolor labeling strategies.

         <title>Engineering Electrolyte Network Structure for Improved Kinetics and Dendrite Suppression in Zn&#8208;S Batteries</title>

By incorporating co&#8208;solvents (PM) and additives (ZnI2), the electrolyte network structure was optimized, enhancing the interfacial stability between the cathode and anode while promoting the reversibility of sulfur cathodic transitions. Experimental results demonstrated that PM reshaped the ligand structure, improving Zn2+ transport kinetics. Additionally, PM interacted synergistically with ZnI2 to reduce cell polarization, catalyze sulfur cathode reactions, and mitigate I3&#8722;&#8208;induced zinc anode corrosion, significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance of the aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur battery.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries (Zn&#8722;S) are promising alternatives to conventional lithium&#8208;ion technology due to their high energy density, low cost, and enhanced safety. However, challenges such as slow redox kinetics of sulfur cathode conversion and inadequate anode stability persist. This study demonstrates that by tuning the electrolyte structure with the introduction of propylene glycol methyl ether (PM) as a co&#8208;solvent and ZnI2 as an electrolyte additive, and significant improvements at both electrodes could be achieved. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the larger polar &#8722;OH and C&#8722;O&#8722;C electron&#8208;donating groups in the PM molecule can donate electrons for the redox reaction of I&#8722;/I3&#8722;. Its role as a redox mediator improves the reversibility of the sulfur cathodic transformation. Additionally, the dipole moment induced by the hydroxyl groups in PM enhances electron transfer from the zinc anode to the electrolyte and promote the decomposition of anions (OTF&#8722;), improving the interfacial stability of the zinc anode. The synergistic effect of PM and the I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox mediator pair enables the zinc&#8208;sulfur battery to deliver an impressive capacity of 1456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 471.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Optimizing s&#8211;p Orbital Overlap Between Sodium Polysulfides and Single&#8208;Atom Indium Catalyst for Efficient Sulfur Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

The s&#8208;p orbital overlap degree between the s orbitals of Na in sodium polysulfides and the p orbitals of the carbon&#8208;supported p&#8208;block single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which serves as a descriptor to efficiently design promising nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;supported InN5 SACs with excellent sulfur reduction and oxidation reaction activities.







Abstract
P&#8208;block metal carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (C&#8208;SACs) have emerged as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries, due to their high atom utilization and unique electronic structure. However, the ambiguous electronic&#8208;level understanding of Na&#8208;dominant s&#8208;p hybridization between sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and p&#8208;block C&#8208;SACs limits the precise control of coordination environment tuning and electro&#8208;catalytic activity manipulation. Here, s&#8208;p orbital overlap degree (OOD) between the s orbitals of Na in NaPSs and the p orbitals of p&#8208;block C&#8208;SACs is proposed as a descriptor for sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and sulfur oxidation reaction (SOR). Compared to NG and NG&#8208;supported InN4 (NG&#8208;InN4) SACs, the nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;supported InN5 (NG&#8208;InN5) SACs show the largest s&#8208;p OOD, demonstrating the weakest shuttle effect and the lowest reaction energy barriers in both SRR and SOR. Accordingly, the designed catalysts allow the Na&#8722;S pouch batteries to retain a high capacity of 490.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 4.5&#8197;&#956;l&#8201;mg&#8722;1. This work offers an s&#8208;p orbital overlap descriptor describing the interaction between NaPSs and p&#8208;orbital&#8208;dominated catalysts for high&#8208;performance RT Na&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Cascade Reaction Enables Heterointerfaces&#8208;Enriched Nanoarrays for Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

This study introduces an innovative cascade reaction in a molten salt environment to synthesize heterostructure nanoarrays, enhancing hydrogen production. Using nickel foam, transition metal salts and potassium thiocyanate, it develops catalysts with superior interfaces that significantly improve electrochemical activity and stability under high current densities.







Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts with superior catalytic activity and stability is essential for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Heterostructure nanoarrays are promising candidates, though achieving both high activity and stability simultaneously, especially under high current densities, remains challenging. To this end, we have developed a cascade reaction process that constructs a series of heterostructure nanoarrays with rich heterointerfaces. This process involves treating nickel foam (NF) with molten KSCN and transition metal salts. Initially, NF reacts with KSCN to form Ni9S8 nanoarrays and S2&#8722; ions, which are subsequently captured by transition metal ions to form sulfides that are directly integrated onto the nanoarrays, resulting in abundant heterointerfaces. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that these rich heterointerfaces significantly enhance the interfacial interaction between Ni9S8 and RuS2 within the nanoarrays (termed RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2), markedly improving both the intrinsic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Impressively, the RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2 demonstrates exceptional HER performance, achieving a low overpotential of just 180&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for up to 500&#8197;h under such high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions. This innovative approach paves the way for the interfacial design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance catalysts for ampere&#8208;level hydrogen production.

         <title>Breaking Performance Barriers in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) Analogs by Functional Group Self&#8208;Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel KBBF&#8208;analog arsenates, CsAs2O3Br and CsAs4O6Br, have been successfully synthesized via functional group self&#8208;polymerization. These compounds set a new benchmark among KBBF&#8208;like materials, exhibiting extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (20.5&#215; KDP for CsAs2O3Br) and large uniaxial birefringence (0.26@546&#8197;nm for CsAs4O6Br), breaking performance barriers for KBBF analogs.







Abstract
Enhancing the conversion efficiency of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lasers through the rational design of crystal materials with superior linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a novel approach to optimizing these properties in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF)&#8208;analog crystals via functional group self&#8208;polymerization. This strategy led to the synthesis of two new optical crystals: noncentrosymmetric CsAs2O3Br and centrosymmetric CsAs4O6Br. By incorporating highly optically active [AsO3]3&#8722; units into the classical 2D [Be2BO3F]&#8734;&#8722; framework, we facilitated the self&#8208;assembly of [As2O3]&#8734; layers, forming a densely packed and highly ordered structure that enhances macroscopic optical activity. CsAs2O3Br exhibited an extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, 20.5 times stronger than KH2PO4 (KDP), while CsAs4O6Br demonstrated exceptional birefringence (0.26 at 546&#8197;nm), setting new performance benchmarks among KBBF analogs. Theoretical analyses reveal that these superior properties arise from the efficient alignment and high density of self&#8208;polymerized functional units. This work represents a significant advancement in the design of high&#8208;performance UV NLO materials, particularly for fourth&#8208;harmonic generation, and paves the way for future innovations in photonic technologies, including solar&#8208;blind UV laser systems and advanced photonic devices.

By incorporating highly optically active [AsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units into the classical 2D [Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; framework, we facilitated the self-assembly of [As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; layers, forming a densely packed and highly ordered structure that enhances macroscopic optical activity. CsAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br exhibited an extraordinary second-harmonic generation (SHG) response, 20.5 times stronger than KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (KDP), while CsAs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Br demonstrated exceptional birefringence (0.26 at 546&#8197;nm), setting new performance benchmarks among KBBF analogs. Theoretical analyses reveal that these superior properties arise from the efficient alignment and high density of self-polymerized functional units. This work represents a significant advancement in the design of high-performance UV NLO materials, particularly for fourth-harmonic generation, and paves the way for future innovations in photonic technologies, including solar-blind UV laser systems and advanced photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks on Carbon Nanotubes for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TpPa&#8208;COF enriched with &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine has been in situ grown on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNT) via a simple solvothermal method, which can activate numerous K+ storage sites. Enol&#8208;keto tautomerism reinforces the structural stability and improves K+ adsorption capability. The obtained TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables exhibit outstanding potassium storage performance, with high reversible capacity, excellent rate property, and ultralong cycling stability.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been demonstrated as promising organic electrodes in many electrochemical devices. However, their inherently low conductivity significantly hinders the full utilization of their internal redox&#8208;active sites. To address this issue, a simple solvothermal method is used to in situ polymerize 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PA) on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), generating a nanocable&#8208;like COF&#8208;based nanocomposite, TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables, which contain abundant &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine groups. By combining the high specific surface area and dense active sites of COFs with the superior conductivity of CNTs, the TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables as the anode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries displayed excellent performance. The reason is that the isomerization between the enolic and keto forms reinforces the stability of molecular architecture, while the transformation of active sites from C=N to C=O improves the K+ adsorption capability. Notably, the TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocable anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 446.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains 282.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after 2000&#8197;cycles at a higher current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, a full battery assembled with 3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride heat&#8208;treated at 450&#8201;&#176;C as the cathode retains a reversible capacity of 273.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Hybrid Enzyme&#8208;Electrocatalyst Cascade Modified Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrodes for Methanol Formation from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards the development of technologies for the conversion of excess atmospheric CO2, a hybrid electrocatalytic/bioelectrocatalytic system combining an inorganic catalyst with a bienzymatic cascade for CO2 electroreduction to methanol is presented. The Ag&#8208;Bi2O3 electrocatalyst enables the selective conversion of CO2 to formate. The generated formate is subsequently converted in a two&#8208;step process catalyzed by the two NADH&#8208;dependent enzymes, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, via formaldehyde to methanol. NADH regeneration is ensured by diaphorase wired to the electrode by a redox polymer.







Abstract
We propose a hybrid electrocatalytic&#8208;bioelectrocatalytic reaction cascade integrated on a gas diffusion electrode for CO2 reduction under selective formation of methanol. Ag&#8208;Bi2O3 selectively reduces gaseous CO2 to formate at neutral pH conditions. A subsequent enzymatic cascade comprising formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, which are both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#8208;dependent, further reduce formate sequentially to formaldehyde and methanol. The enzymatically oxidized redox cofactor NAD+ is regenerated through the enzyme diaphorase which is electrochemically coupled to the electrode by embedding it into a cobaltocene&#8208;based low&#8208;potential redox polymer. Methanol formation is confirmed using a highly selective biosensor based on alcohol oxidase in combination with horseradish peroxidase integrated into a specifically adapted redox polymer. The proposed hybrid electrocatalytic&#8208;bioelectrocatalytic cascade is an example for a general strategy for enhancing the selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions and/or to replace bioelectrochemically challenging steps such as the synthesis of formate from CO2 using highly oxygen&#8208;sensitive formate dehydrogenases by more robust inorganic electrocatalysts.

We successfully synthesized and isolated a stable triplet&#8208;ground&#8208;state Kekul&#233; diradical polycyclic hydrocarbon &#8211; a kinetically blocked derivative of dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene. Its triplet ground state was unequivocally confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and superconducting quantum interference device measurements, and its structure and electronic properties were revealed. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion were also studied.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) hold significant potential in organic spintronics and organic magnets. However, their synthesis is very challenging due to their extremely high reactivity. Herein, we report the successful synthesis and isolation of a kinetically blocked derivative (1) of dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene, which represents a rare persistent triplet diradical of a Kekul&#233; PH. Its triplet ground state was unambiguously confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and superconducting quantum interference device measurements. Its structure was also unequivocally confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and its electronic properties were systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. The key design principle is to extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation for achieving the decrease of the bonding interaction and the increase of the exchange interaction between unpaired electrons, which are essential for accessing the stable triplet ground state. Due to kinetic blocking, 1 shows a reasonable stability with a half&#8208;life time of 64&#8197;h under ambient conditions. It has a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and displays amphoteric redox behavior. Notably, its dication and dianion exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state and near&#8208;infrared absorption, and the structures were identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. This study will shed new light on the design and synthesis of novel stable PHs with high&#8208;spin multiplicity.

The PTH&#8208;SO2&#8208;COF showed a 7755&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 synthesis rate, a 720&#8201;% improvement over PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF, reaching 13565&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 upon adjusting the sacrificial agent ratio. In situ characterizations and simulations confirmed three H2O2 evolution pathways, advancing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts through artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking.







Abstract
Mimicking natural enzymes through artificial enzyme engineering represents a powerful strategy to fine&#8208;tune the performance of photocatalysts, while the manipulation of electron transfer systems through atomic precision control is challenging. Herein, we reported a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on progressively oxidized phenothiazine (PTH) core as the platform for emulating Coenzyme Q, achieved through meticulous stepwise adjustments of their redox states. Compared to the original PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF, the COFs with incrementally oxidized sulfur sites exhibited enhanced charge transfer efficiencies, facilitating efficient electron donation to O2 and thereby providing a favorable pathway for H2O2 synthesis. Notably, the PTH&#8208;SO2&#8208;COF achieved a remarkable synthesis rate of 7755&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, marking a 720&#8201;% improvement over the PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF baseline. Furthermore, upon adjusting the sacrificial agent ratio, this rate soared to an impressive 13565&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing the most reported photo&#8208;active COFs. In situ characterizations and simulations verified that three H2O2 evolution pathways (2e&#8722; ORR, 4e&#8722; OER, and 4e&#8722; ORR) all involved in the H2O2 production process. As a result, our findings introduce a novel pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts through the innovative application of artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking techniques.

         <title>Precise Supramolecular Nanoarchitectonics for Simultaneous Enhanced Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis in a Co&#8208;Assembly by a Biomimetic Isolation&#8208;Conduction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of photoluminescence and photocatalysis have been achieved simultaneously in a co&#8208;assembly by a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy based on arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (A&#8722;P) interactions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly has been exploited to build a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system for real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids (PFOA) and photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
Limited by the two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of separation and recombination of photogenerated carriers, achieving photoluminescence and photocatalysis simultaneously is extremely challenging but essential for ever&#8208;growing complex issues and specialized scenarios. Here we proposed a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy induced by an arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (A&#8722;P) interaction for enabling photoluminescence and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in the co&#8208;assembly of aromatic monomers and octafluoronapthalene (OFN). Inspired by the isolation&#8208;conduction effect of periodic isolation of myelin sheaths on the axons of vertebrate nerve fibers by node of Ranvier, we use OFN as a molecular isolator embedded in the aromatic monomers array to block the singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet pathway, while the enlarged intermolecular dipoles resulting from the A&#8722;P interactions facilitate the conduction of photogenerated carriers in the isolated regions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly exhibits an enhanced monomeric green emission compared to the corresponding monocomponent self&#8208;assembly with weak red emission. Meanwhile, it also has an enhanced photocatalytic HER performance with a rate of 2.45&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 15.2&#8197;times more than the self&#8208;assembled one. On this basis, a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system that includes real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids and photocatalytic HER device is constructed.

         <title>Simultaneous High Current Density and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 through Intermediate Balancing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

The cooperative CuBIM catalyst has a remarkable CH4 formation rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a high CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 51.7&#8201;% at 1,300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH. The distant Cu&#8722;Cu sites (~5.7&#8197;&#197;) in the Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer favor multistep *CO hydrogenation, and the proper ratio of CuO component ensures adequate *H supply, enabling high current density and highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 is promising for carbon neutrality and renewable energy storage but confronts low CH4 selectivity, especially at high current densities. The key challenge lies in promoting *CO intermediate and *H coupling while minimizing side reactions including C&#8722;C coupling and H&#8722;H coupling, which is particularly difficult at high current density due to abundant intermediates. Here we report a cooperative strategy to address this challenge using Cu&#8208;based catalysts comprising Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer and CuO component that can simultaneously manage the key intermediates *CO and *H. A fast CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 is achieved at 1,300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.7&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations show that the increased Cu&#8722;Cu distance in the Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer component favors multistep *CO hydrogenation over the dimerization, and the CuO component ensures an adequate supply of *H, together contributing to the selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion at high current densities. This work develops a cooperative strategy for the electrosynthesis of CH4 with simultaneous high current density and high selectivity by rational catalyst design, paving the way for its applications.

South Africa's rich natural resources fuelled its industrialisation but are marred by its colonial past. Despite 30&#8197;years of democracy, deep inequalities remain, with infectious diseases disproportionately affecting disadvantaged communities. Chemistry and biomedical research can help to address these challenges. This Viewpoint advocates for chemistry&#8208;driven advancements tailored to South Africa's socioeconomic needs to improve healthcare and economic outcomes.







Abstract
South Africa's rich natural resources remain a key driver of its chemical industrialisation but are tainted and constrained by its complex colonial history. Thirty years since the advent of democracy in South Africa, deep sociopolitical inequalities are amplified by an intolerable infectious disease burden amongst disadvantaged communities. In that respect, South Africa shares challenges with many other nations in the Global South; there are limited opportunities for the economic development and growth needed to uplift all strata of society. This Viewpoint examines the role of the chemical sciences in South Africa's unique history and the current state of its academic and industrial sectors, with a focus on the intersection of chemistry, healthcare and biomedical research. We argue that the opportunities offered through chemistry research and development, including local manufacturing, should be exploited and that scientific advancements should be tailored to and integrated with the socioeconomic realities of South Africa for an effective and multidisciplinary approach to improving healthcare outcomes. This Viewpoint aims to inspire a renewed focus on the pivotal role of chemical scientists and their broader societal contributions to combating the country's infectious disease burden and shaping a healthier future for South Africa.

Mechanics&#8211;photophysics correlation in tough, stretchable and long&#8208;lived roomtemperature phosphorescence ionogels is deciphered by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). In their Research Article (e202419114), Y. Tang et al. utilize DMA to explore the relationship between the mechanical and photophysical properties and explain it using two special temperatures (Tloss and Tg). Such a method shows the merits of immediate indication of performance toward ionogels, like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking visual senses with the tactile senses.

Diverse chirality evolution originating from the same building blocks can be simultaneously triggered, as demonstrated by Chuanliang Feng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202417876). The study highlights the construction of supramolecular networks composed of M&#8208; and P&#8208;type nanofibers through the self&#8208;assembly of homochiral phenylalanine derivatives. The cover illustration symbolizes this phenomenon, depicting flowers with opposite chirality, all blossoming simultaneously from the same seeds.

         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective polypseudorotaxane formation via co&#8208;crystallization of stereodynamic planar chiral pillar[5]arene and polyethylene glycol is reported by Tomoki Ogoshi et al. in their Research Article (e202420115). In the image, the bracelet represents the polypseudorotaxane, with blue and red stones depicting the pS and pR forms of the pillar[5]arene ring, respectively. The crystals between the stones imply the crystallization method. As the number of stones increases, the possible combinations multiply, making selection more difficult, but ultimately, you will find the bracelet that suits you best.

         <dc:description>
The structural motifs and interaction patterns of four different isomers of ethanol trimer were identified by their rotational spectra aided by extensive quantum chemical calculations, as reported by M. Eugenia Sanz et al. in their Research Article (e202415229). Higher&#8208;energy ethanol conformers are predominant in the observed clusters but there is no homochirality synchronization. This study provides insight into the aggregation of an archetypal alcohol.

Ultrasensitive characterization of native bacterial biofilm: A high&#8208;sensitivity dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR method illuminates the composition of intact native bacterial biofilm. The DNP sensitivity boost (~75&#8208;fold) allows observing NMR signals of biofilms composed of bacteria and extracellular matrix at natural abundance, shown here for Pseudomonas. Chemical identification quantifies the biofilm components, as reported by &#220;mit Akbey et^^al. in their Research Article (e202418146).

         <title>Frontispiece: Improving Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin with Triethanolamine as a CO2 Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to improve carbon dioxide delivery in solutions for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is reported by Xue&#8208;Peng Zhang, Rui Cao et al. in their Communication (e202500154). By shuttling CO2 with triethanolamine, which can capture CO2 to form zwitterionic alkylcarbonate and release the bound CO2 at catalytic Fe tetraphenylporphyrin sites, the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity can be significantly increased.

This Review provides a comprehensive summary of the synthesis, properties, and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes (FMAs) composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons that have emerged in the past decade. The FMAs are categorized on the basis of the different building blocks incorporated.







Abstract
Fluorescent macrocyclic arenes have attracted increasing interest in macrocyclic and supramolecular chemistry due to their exceptional photophysical properties and versatile applications. Classical macrocyclic arenes modified with fluorescent groups at the upper or bottom rims have long provided valuable platforms across various fields. Recently, a large number of novel fluorescent macrocyclic arenes directly composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic building blocks including naphthalene, anthracene, tetraphenylethene, pyrene, fluorene, carbazole, acridan, phenothiazine, coumarin, triphenylamine, benzothiadiazole and so on, have been reported, and they have shown specific fluorescent property, and also exhibited broad applications in molecular recognition, sensing, bioimaging and functional materials. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the synthesis and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes containing polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons emerged in the past decade. By categorizing these fluorescent macrocyclic arenes based on the different building blocks, this review provides a comprehensive summary of their synthesis, properties and applications.

Creating functional polyolefins using customized units has attracted increasing attention. This review summarizes the application of functional units such as comonomers, chain transfer agents, post&#8208;polymerization modification reagents, and functional fillers for preparing functional polyolefins and composites.







Abstract
Polyolefins are simple hydrocarbons that require additional chemical modifications or functional additives to give them custom functions. Recent research in the development of functional polyolefins has surpassed the traditional approach of simply improving surface properties by incorporating polar moieties. Creating custom functionalized polyolefins by using specific functional units has attracted increasing attention. This review summarizes advances in preparing custom functionalized polyolefin materials using functional units such as comonomers, chain&#8208;transfer agents, post&#8208;polymerization modification reagents, and functional fillers. Exploring new functional units and innovative synthetic strategies will further enhance the performance and expand the applications of functional polyolefins.

         <title>Metal Nanoclusters as Highly Efficient, Versatile Type&#8208;II Photoinitiators via Generating Radicals from Non&#8208;Conventional Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that metal nanoclusters can function as highly efficient, versatile type&#8208;II photoinitiators via generating various types of non&#8208;conventional thiyl and nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals. Discovery of this underlying photochemcial process could open the door of applying metal nanoclusters in photolithography and other emerging applications using inexpensive light sources with low intensities.







Abstract
Development of highly efficient photocatalysis or photoinitiation systems that are applicable to various types of illumination source is critical to virtually all the light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we report a generalizable strategy to achieve highly sensitive, versatile photoinitiation systems based on the combination of metal nanoclusters with non&#8208;conventional hydrogen donors (co&#8208;initiators). Discovery of this type&#8208;II photoinitiation pathway in metal nanoclusters not only improves their two&#8208;photon initiation sensitivity by up to three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude, it further opens the door for metal nanoclusters to trigger the photopolymerization using the low&#8208;power UV light&#8208;emitting diodes. Different from molecular type&#8208;II photoinitiators, we found that the selection rules of hydrogen donors for metal nanoclusters are largely dependent on their ligand structures. More importantly, using electron paramagnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy, we for the first time demonstrate that the photoexcited metal nanoclusters can function as versatile hydrogen atom abstractors which generate various types of previously unreported thiyl and nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals. This finding indicates the broad opportunity of the future application of metal nanoclusters in light&#8208;driven organic synthesis and radical chemistry.

         <title>Thermally Induced Reversible Martensitic Phase Transition and Self&#8208;Healing in Nickel Glycinamide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A martensitic&#8208;type polymorphic transition accompanied by self&#8208;healing was observed in a nickel coordination compound. A single crystal is transformed into a two&#8208;component twinned crystal in a reversible twinning/detwinning thermally induced polymorphic transition. The coexistence of both polymorphs was observed within the same crystal, and the cracks heal upon the reversible transition.







Abstract
Martensitic phase transitions and self&#8208;healing in molecular compounds are extremely rare, and while they carry potential for rapid energy transduction, they are currently found only by serendipity. Here, we report the observation of both phenomena in a coordination compound of glycinamide (Glyam), [Ni(H2O)2(Glyam)2]I2 (1). Upon cooling to 205&#8211;213&#8197;K, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph of this material (1RT) transforms into twinned crystals of the low&#8208;temperature polymorph (1LT(twinned)), while upon heating, it is converted back to 1RT in the temperature range 217&#8211;223&#8197;K. When this transformation occurs in single crystals, evolution of cracks is observed upon cooling that disappear upon heating. The forward transition 1RT&#8594;1LT(twinned) is completed in a few seconds, while the reverse one, 1LT(twinned)&#8594;1RT, proceeds up to several hours, contrary to the fast transition in polycrystalline samples. We determined the concomitant presence of 1RT and 1LT(twinned) in the same single crystal. The crystal structure analysis revealed complex inter&#8208; and intramolecular displacements of atoms during the transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report where a thermally induced reversible martensitic phase transition and self&#8208;healing are observed in crystals of a coordination compound, and indicates the potential generality of these extraordinary phenomena.

         <title>Barrierless Electron Transfer in a Photosynthetic Reaction Center Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast IR absorption spectroscopy was utilized to interrogate excited&#8208;state electron transfer in a strongly&#8208;coupled, cyanide&#8208;bridged photoinduced mixed&#8208;valent system. Despite structural asymmetry, a flat excited&#8208;state potential energy surface with a single minimum was found, showing a Class&#8197;III behavior. These findings were supported by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
Vibrational spectroscopy is the ultimate tool to reveal whether any donor&#8208;acceptor system is truly delocalized and therefore characterized by a single&#8208;welled potential energy surface, or if it is marginally localized with a barrier that defines two minima. Our femtosecond IR absorption investigations on cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed valence systems show a broad, intense and downshifted CN vibration signature, revealing, for the first time, an asymmetric, fully delocalized Class III photoinduced mixed valence system.

         <title>Surface&#8208;like NOx Reduction at an Atomically&#8208;Precise Tricopper Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report catalytic total denitrification of nitric oxide (NO) at a surface&#8208;like tricopper cluster complex. This process is shown to proceed via an oxygen atom transfer pathway that leverages the metal&#8208;metal cooperativity of the polynuclear core. Stoichiometric deoxygenation of nitrite and nitrate are also demonstrated, mapping out the complete denitrification cycle.







Abstract
The combustion of nitrogen&#8208;containing fuels and increasing use of nitrogen&#8208;rich fertilizers is accumulating NOx pollutants in the environment. Copper is an attractive catalyst material for reductive NOx remediation, yet ambiguity persists regarding the elementary bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps occurring at the catalyst interface. Starting from a molecular tricuprous &#956;3&#8208;oxo complex (1), an unusually reduced and highly reactive surface&#8208;like cluster (2) has been prepared. Characterization data and electronic structure calculations are consistent with 2 featuring &#963;&#8208;aromaticity that primes the tricopper core for two&#8208;electron chemistry. Cluster 2 mediates catalytic reductive coupling of NO to N2, proceeding through N2O, via sequential oxygen atom transfer steps. Stoichiometric reduction of NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; is also disclosed, mapping the complete denitrification cycle at an atomically&#8208;precise molecular cluster.

         <dc:description>
Halogenated donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (HDACs) are presented as viable surrogates for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) cyclopropenes. Upon cycloaddition with a variety of 2&#960;&#8208;components, spontaneous elimination of HX occurs, giving rise to the products of a formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition to a (D&#8722;A) cyclopropene. Six types of cycloaddition reactions are presented using HDACs and a kinetic study was undertaken to gain further understanding of this reactivity.







Abstract
Herein we report (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of halogenated donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (HDACs) as surrogates for donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropenes. Upon reaction with a variety of 2&#960;&#8208;components, cycloaddition followed by elimination generates the unsaturated five&#8208;membered ring products. A series of HDACs were shown to be effective in reactions with thioketones. Five further cycloaddition reactions were used to showcase the broad applicability of these donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropene surrogates. Kinetic studies allowed the proposal of a plausible mechanism for this reaction.

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin with Triethanolamine as a CO2 Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of Fe porphyrins can be significantly enhanced with triethanolamine, which can function as a CO2 shuttle to capture CO2 and bring it to the Fe porphyrin site for binding and activation. The unique tripodal structure of triethanolamine is essential for capturing CO2 to form a zwitterionic alkylcarbonate. This work is significant to present a new strategy to promote the activation of CO2 in solutions.







Abstract
Delivering CO2 molecules to catalyst sites is a vital step in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Achievements have been made to develop efficient catalysts, but few efforts have been dedicated to improving CO2 delivering in solutions. Herein, we report on electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion using Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) as a catalyst and triethanolamine as a CO2 shuttle. Compared to ethanol, the electrocatalytic CO2RR current with triethanolamine increases by more than three times. We show that triethanolamine can effectively capture a CO2 molecule to form a zwitterionic alkylcarbonate through the collaboration between its tripodal alcohol and amine units. This alkylcarbonate can release the bound CO2 molecule for activation at the Fe site upon its interaction with FeTPP. In addition to shuttling CO2, alkylcarbonates can also provide protons to assist the C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Therefore, this work is significant to demonstrate a new strategy to improve electrocatalytic CO2RR by shuttling CO2.

         <title>Selective and Potent Molecular Glue Degraders for NIMA&#8208;Related Kinase 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first well&#8208;characterized and selective NIMA&#8208;related kinase 7 (NEK7) molecular glue degrader LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 was developed. By degrading NEK7 protein, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 deactivated the NLRP3 inflammasome and showed potent inhibitory effects on the release of the downstream cytokines.







Abstract
Molecular glue degraders (MGDs) represent a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation within cells. While chemoproteomics has unveiled hundreds of potential MGD targets, very few proteins are degraded by highly selective and potent MGDs. Here, we developed a novel glutarimide analog with a tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine scaffold that exhibited strong NIMA&#8208;related kinase 7 (NEK7) degradation potential. Further optimization led to the identification of LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 as a leading NEK7 MGD candidate, demonstrating potent activity with a half&#8208;maximal degradation (DC50) of 7&#8197;nM and a maximum degradation (Dmax) of 90&#8201;% in MOLT&#8208;4 cells. Notably, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 displayed high selectivity for NEK7 across the proteome. Mechanistic studies indicated that the degradation was mediated by the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) and relied on the glycine 57 (G57)&#8208;containing degron motif in NEK7. Additionally, two amino acids adjacent to the degron motif were found to be crucial for modulating the compound's selectivity and potency, underscoring the significance of neighbouring residues in MGD design. Moreover, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 effectively inhibited secretion of the downstream cytokines, including IL&#8208;1&#946; and IL&#8208;18, highlighting the potential therapeutic applications of NEK7 MGDs in treating inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Metal&#8722;Organic Framework with Constrained Flexibility for Benchmark Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D ligand metal&#8722;organic framework ZUL&#8722;C6 with an alkyl&#8208;rich, confined pore system, obtains high&#8208;capacity molecular sieving separation for hexane isomer mixtures in a wide pressure range, benefiting from its constrained flexibility which is driven by the non&#8208;centrosymmetric rotation and distortion of the coordination units with a high deformation energy barrier, achieving benchmark hexane isomer separation performance.Twitter/X handle: vigaryang76749.







Abstract
Flexible metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for adsorptive separations, but achieving a balance among flexibility, adsorption capacity, and selectivity remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel flexible MOF, Ni(bhdc)(ted)0.5 (ZUL&#8722;C6), incorporating hybrid three&#8208;dimensional alkane&#8208;bridged ligands, which realizes high&#8208;capacity molecular sieving for hexane isomer separation &#8208; a critical process in the petroleum industry. The alkyl&#8208;rich, confined pore system within the ZUL&#8722;C6 framework facilitated a strong affinity for n&#8208;hexane and 3&#8208;methylpentane. However, the narrow pore size and the constrained flexibility limited the uptake of 2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane (&lt;4.0&#8197;mg/g), accompanied by a high gate&#8208;opening pressure. The gating behavior was elucidated by guest&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal (SC) X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which revealed a unique SC to SC transformation driven by the non&#8208;centrosymmetric rotation of the 3D bhdc linker and distortion of the metal cluster and pillar units, along with a high deformation energy barrier. As a result, ZUL&#8722;C6 exhibited not only significantly higher uptake and selectivity than the industrially used 5&#8197;A molecular sieve, but also the record&#8208;high nHEX/3MP breakthrough uptake (92.8/73.9&#8197;mg/g) and unprecedented 22DMB producing time (309.2&#8197;min/g, corresponding to the productivity of 770&#8197;mmol/kg and yield of 92.8&#8201;%) among reported MOFs.

         <title>Validation and Mechanistic Studies of the Headspace Effect in MOF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a fixed vessel volume, the rate of metal&#8211;organic framework formation is shown to depend on the amount of solution employed. This headspace effect is demonstrated to arise only in the presence of oxygen. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that oxygen reacts with the formamide solvent and contributes to nitrosamine side products.







Abstract
The influence of headspace volume and composition on metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) synthesis has been largely overlooked with no mechanisms currently invoking these factors. Herein, we reveal that an increased volume of oxygen in the headspace during the synthesis of zinc carboxylate&#8208;based MOFs (MOF&#8208;5, MOF&#8208;177, and IRMOF&#8208;8) as well as UiO&#8208;66 and ZJU&#8208;28 accelerates crystal formation. Investigation into the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon elucidates the critical roles played by all reagents, and some of their byproducts, in MOF synthesis. These insights are the key to developing more efficient and sustainable synthetic strategies for MOF production.

         <title>Divergent Total Syntheses of Six Crinipellin&#8208;Type Diterpenoids through Tandem 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization/Dicycloexpansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A more straightforward approach to synthesize densely congested crinipellins has been accomplished in just 9&#8211;11 steps through strategic tandem 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/dicycloexpansion cascade and a series of highly regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and diastereoselective late&#8208;stage transformations without using protecting groups.







Abstract
Crinipellins are a significant class of naturally occurring highly congested tetraquinane diterpenoids, with many members exhibiting bio&#8208;important antibacterial and anticancer activities. However, their complex structures, particularly their dense 5/5/5/5 tetracyclic frameworks, have made efficient synthesis challenging, leading chemists to attempt to create highly efficient and divergent routes. This study presents a concise, divergent synthesis of six crinipellins, completed in just 9&#8211;11 steps using commercially available materials. Particular highlights include: (1) a vital one&#8208;step 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/dicycloexpansion cascade that rapidly constructs the angular/fused tetraquinane scaffold with two contiguous quaternary carbons, and (2) strategic functionalizations through iso&#8208;propylation, methylation, and Wacker oxidation/dehydrogenation, enabling the divergent syntheses of the six crinipellin members without using protecting groups. This approach provides a versatile platform for accessing additional crinipellin derivatives, which we believe will benefit medicinal and biological research.

         <title>Auxiliary Ligand&#8208;Coordinated Nanoconfined Hydrophobic Microenvironments in a Nickel(II)&#8208;Acetylide Framework for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;acetylide frameworks (MAFs), featuring metal&#8208;bis(acetylide) linkages (&#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211;M&#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211;), are emerging as a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with promise in catalysis. Here, we report a new 2D NiII&#8208;acetylide framework, TPA&#8208;Ni(PR3)2&#8208;GYs, that incorporates the NiII(PR3)2 moiety [R = CH3 (Me), CH2CH3 (Et), and CH2CH2CH2CH3 (Bu)] into a tris(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)amine&#8208;based graphdiyne framework (TPA&#8208;GDY). As a result, TPA&#8208;Ni(PBu3)2&#8208;GY exhibits an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of 3807 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a high selectivity of 99.4% for CO production upon visible light irradiation. Mechanistic investigations reveal a strong orbital matching effect between the d orbitals of NiII and the p orbitals of the alkynyl C atoms in organic ligands, which not only accelerates the transfer and separation of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers but also reduces the reaction potential barrier for the formation of *COOH intermediates. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the auxiliary coordinated ligands (trialkylphosphines) to Ni center, particularly tributylphosphine, creates a nanoconfined space that enhances both the accessibility of CO2 and the utilization of NiII catalytic active sites while inhibiting hydrogen evolution. This study highlights the benefit of modulating the microenvironment around the coordinated metal center to enhance the performance of catalysts with direct metal&#8208;acetylide bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Nickel Precatalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Chlorides and Arylboronic Acids under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and catalytic properties of Ni(II) complexes with the general formula Ni(NHC)[P(OR)3](Ar)Cl is described. These complexes are air&#8208;stable and extremely effective precatalysts in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The reaction protocols described allow for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl chlorides and arylboronic acids, employing low catalytic loading, to deliver a large variety of functionalized biaryl compounds. For the coupling of aryl chlorides with N&#8208;heterocyclic boronic acids, TBAF was used as an additive to afford nitrogen&#8208;containing biaryl products. Overall, these reaction protocols operate at room or mild temperatures and can be applied to a variety of electronically and sterically differentiated coupling partners. Fundamental insights into the mechanism of this reaction, including the proposed formation of the catalytically active Ni(NHC)[P(Oi&#8208;Pr)3] and resting state species, are also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Anions and Water Molecules by Lewis Acid&#8208;Base for Highly Stable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), Zn anodes often suffer from Zn dendrite and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in traditional electrolytes. Herein, fumed silica with both Lewis acid&#8208;base functional groups were introduced into traditional electrolytes. Owing to the strong Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions between Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si functional groups and SO42&#8208; ions, the Zn2+ ion transference number is significantly increased in electrolyte and thus more Zn2+ ions reach to the Zn anode surface. As a result, the distribution of Zn2+ ions will be more homogeneous and dendrites growth will be suppressed on the Zn anode surface. In addition, Si&#8208;OH functional groups on fumed silica can also constrain the free and solvated H2O molecules in electrolyte simultaneously through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions between electronegative O atoms in Si&#8208;OH functional groups and electropositive H atoms in H2O molecules, ensuring that the HER is inhibited on Zn anodes. Therefore, in fumed silica&#8208;contained electrolyte, the Zn anodes exhibit a high reversibility and Zn||MnO2 full batteries demonstrate a superior cycling performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing Unstable Carbanionic Intermediates via Halogen Transfer: Base&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Coupling Reactions of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluoromethylarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe how the merger of deprotonation, halogenation and substitution into compatible processes enables the productive functionalization of traditionally unstable carbanionic intermediates. This strategy enables the first oxidative coupling protocol of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic C&#8211;H bonds with heteronucleophiles. Here, transiently generated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic carbanionic intermediates undergo halogen transfer from 2&#8208;bromothiophenes to form electrophilic ArCF2Br compounds for in situ nucleophilic substitution, thereby avoiding &#945;&#8208;fluoride elimination pathways that typically plague &#945;&#8208;fluorocarbanions. This method streamlines the modular synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzyl(thio)ethers and led to the broader realization that halogen transfer to unstable carbanions is an enabling principle across diverse C(sp2)&#8211;H and C(sp3)&#8211;H systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Ti2O3(H2PO4)2&#183;2H2O as a Novel Intercalated Anode for Ultralong Lifespan "Rocking&#8208;chair"&#160;Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) with Zn metal anode is hindered by severe dendritic growth, corrosion, and inefficient Zn utilization. "Rocking&#8208;chair" type AZIBs are considered a viable approach toward practical applications due to the success of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries employing intercalated graphite anodes. Herein, a new type of layered titanium phosphate Ti2O3(H2PO4)2&#183;2H2O is proposed for the first time as the intercalated anodes for AZIBs, exhibiting a capacity of 108 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 mA g&#8208;1, with a low discharge potential of 0.17 V (vs. Zn2+/Zn). The ion insertion process was thoroughly investigated, and a micro&#8208;dendrite growth&#8208;corrosion mode was proposed to explain the capacity degradation mechanism. Corresponding countermeasures were designed, resulting in a significant improvement in cycle life. When coupled with zinc hexacyanoferrate (KZnHCF) cathode, the "rocking&#8208;chair"&#160;full battery exhibits an ultralong lifespan of 50000 cycles (111 days) at 2.0 A g&#8208;1 with 94% capacity retention. This work presents a novel perspective for the development of practical AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Interfacial Water in Improving the Activity and Stability of Lattice&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Acidic Oxygen Evolution on RuO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although RuO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely studied for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), triggering the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism to suppress kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway at the expense of activity is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy. To date, approaches to simultaneously achieve remarkable activity and stability of RuO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts through the kinetically favorable LOM pathway toward acidic OER are still elusive. Herein, we report that RuS0.45Ox catalyst with the synergetic regulation of asymmetric S&#8208;Ru&#8208;O microstructure and Ru&#8208;SO4 local environments can simultaneously boost the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated OER activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. Experimental results including operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, operando X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and theoretical studies indicate the dynamic evolution of interfacial water structure from hydrogen&#8208;bond water to free&#8208;H2O on the surface of RuS0.45Ox. The generated continuous free&#8208;H2O enriched local environment is in favor of accelerating the sluggish kinetics of interfacial water dissociation, and facilitating the replenishment of lattice oxygen vacancies generated during the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated OER process, thereby significantly enhances the stability. Consequently, the obtained RuS0.45Ox displays remarkable acidic OER performance with 160 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2, and robust stability with negligible activity decay over 500 hours at 100 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;efficiency, pure deep&#8208;blue emitters are critically needed to meet the rising demands of ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays. Although high&#8208;order B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) leveraging multi&#8208;resonance (MR) effects show promise, their complex syntheses and large molecular weights hinder practical application. Here, we report a compact MR framework featuring three nitrogen&#8208;linked boron centers, synthesized at the gram scale via a single&#8208;step, amine&#8208;directed borylation. This emitter displays deep&#8208;blue emission with an ultranarrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 13 nm and achieves an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC) compared to previous BN&#8208;bond&#8208;based blue MR emitters. Theoretical studies reveal that its &#960;&#8208;extended framework and partially distorted geometry synergistically minimize structural relaxation to reduce FWHM and enhance spin&#8211;orbit coupling to facilitate efficient spin&#8208;flip processes. As a result, the corresponding deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibits a FWHM of 15 nm, and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (&#951;EQE,max) approaching 30% at color coordinates of (0.155, 0.060), rivaling the leading performance of deep&#8208;blue OLEDs based on conventional B/N&#8208;doped frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition from Tunneling to Schottky Barriers in Molecular Junctions Based on Polyoxometalate Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Schottky barriers are typically observed in mesoscale materials but are challenging to form at the molecular scale due to the discrete energy levels of molecules and the limited length of the transport channel, which hinder the development of an effective depletion region. In this study, we present the development of a molecular&#8208;scale Schottky diode within a monolayer junction by utilizing self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters. The high electron affinity and multiple redox states of POMs facilitate near band bending at the molecule/EGaIn (Ga and In alloy) electrode interface, promoting the formation of a Schottky&#8208;like band structure. This monolayer junction demonstrates a rectification ratio exceeding 3000, and the temperature&#8208;dependent measurements reveal a transition in the charge transport mechanism from direct tunneling at low bias to thermionic emission at high bias. POM&#8208;based molecular junctions offer promising potential for molecular&#8208;scale Schottky devices, introducing novel mechanisms for high&#8208;performance molecular diodes. With their low power consumption, molecular diversity, and potential for integration into nanoscale circuits, molecular Schottky diodes are well&#8208;positioned to become key components in functional molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Approach Towards BN&#8208;Embedded Terrylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work presents the first example of heteroatoms embedded terrylene diimides (TDIs), which were synthesized from the BN&#8208;embedded imide building block in a modular manner. Through the control of the amount and orientations of the BN unit(s), the manipulation of dipole moments of the obtained BN&#8208;embedded terrylene diimides (BN&#8208;TDIs) was achieved, which in turns extended the fluorescence of BN&#8208;TDIs to near infrared region. The structures of BN&#8208;TDIs were established via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions. Stronger carbonyl&#8208;&#960; interactions were observed for BN&#8208;TDIs in their crystal structures compared with that of TDI, which could be utilized in the construction of supramolecular architectures. The organic thin film transistors based on BN&#8208;TDIs were also fabricated. BN&#8208;TDI&#8208;S showcased higher electron mobilities than that of TDI, indicating the potential of BN&#8208;TDIs as promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering an Excellent &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4&#8208; Inspired UV Nonlinear Optical Material through Secondary Building Unit Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with tailored properties has been a long&#8208;standing pursuit, yet remains challenging to achieve. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a novel high&#8208;performance UV NLO material, Li3[Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]&#183;7H2O (LBOC), by substituting the [B3O6] functional building units (FBUs) in the classic &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 (&#946;&#8208;BBO) with meticulously designed [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8208; secondary building units (SBUs). The [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8208; SBUs within LBOC preserve the ordered arrangement of the [B3O6] FBUs found in &#946;&#8208;BBO, enabling LBOC to inherit the strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response from &#946;&#8208;BBO. Additionally, the increased dimensionality of the [Be3(OH)3(C3H2O4)3]3&#8208; SBUs, compared to the planar [B3O6] FBUs, leads to a reduction in optical anisotropy. Consequently, LBOC demonstrates a moderate birefringence of 0.067@589.3 nm, lower than that of &#946;&#8208;BBO (0.118@589.3 nm). Notably, bulk crystals of LBOC can be easily grown using a straightforward solution evaporation method, making it a promising candidate for UV NLO applications. This strategic design of the SBU opens new avenues for the rational development of NLO crystals with tailored properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Light&#8208;Promoted Bioorthogonal Reaction via Molecular Recombination for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyrrole and its Application in Vitro and in Vivo Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal chemistry has revolutionized organic, medicinal, and biochemical research by designing and developing selective and rapid reactions that do not interfere with biological processes. Despite significant advancements, the existing bioorthogonal reactions can normally introduce only one functional group to a biomolecule, limiting their versatility in biological systems. In this study, we report a novel light&#8208;promoting reaction, namely light&#8208;promoted bioorthogonal multifunctionalized molecular recombination (LBMR) reaction, that can facilitate the synthesis of polysubstituted pyrroles via molecular editing and recombination of isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate and isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives. The proposed LBMR reaction exhibited rapid kinetics, high efficiency, wide substrate scope, and the potential for in situ fluorescence imaging under normal physiological conditions without the need for a catalyst. The LBMR reaction allowed incorporating multiple functional groups and using well&#8208;soluble carboxylic salts as bioorthogonal substrates. The in vitro experiments performed in different types of cells and in vivo studies performed on zebrafish demonstrated the potential applicability of the proposed LBMR for biological imaging. This work not only introduces a new photo&#8208;bioorthogonal reaction paradigm but also expands the scope of bioorthogonal chemistry, paving the way for future applications in biomedical research.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Non&#8208;adjacent chiral scaffolds are privileged motifs in bioactive molecules and medicines, which has stimulated chemist's ingenuity in achieving the asymmetric construction of non&#8208;contiguous chiral elements directly. Current strategies include bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis and others, enabling the production of a wide range of enantiomerically enriched compounds fearturing different combinations of non&#8208;adjacent chirality, including mutiple central chirality, central and allenyl axial chirality, and central and biaryl axial chirality. Compared to the patterns of mutiple non&#8208;adjacent central chirality, the latter two are less frequently reported. This minireview aims to summarize the key developments in reaction design, mechanistic studies, and synthetic applications, with the goal of stimulating further exploration in this important area of asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Access to Functional 2&#8208;Azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via Hydrodearomative [2&#960; + 2&#963;] Cycloaddition of Aza&#8208;arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting planar six&#8208;membered aza&#8208;arenes into C(sp3)&#8208;rich three&#8208;dimensional (3D) scaffolds is a promising way to obtain isosteric mimetics of numerous functional products, but it remains to date a formidable challenge due to the high thermodynamic stability and dynamic inertness as well as the selectivity control. Here, by applying a novel non&#8208;noble bimetallic Mn/Fe catalyst system, we report, for the first time, an approach for direct construction of functional 3D 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via a hydrodearomatization (HDA) of the aza&#8208;arenes and [2&#960; + 2&#963;] cycloaddition cascade. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the triplet state of Fe(II) facilitates the activation of both aza&#8208;arenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs). The mild reduction nature of manganese catalysis and the steric effects of Fe(II) coordination result in an 1,4&#8208;hydrodearomatization, and the imine species derived from the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;hydrogenated aza&#8208;arenes are then effectively trapped by the polarized BCBs, thus suppressing the thermodynamically favorable over&#8208;hydrogenation of aza&#8208;arenes into cyclic amine by&#8208;products. Given the features of good substrate and functionality compatibility, high step and atom efficiency, and diversified product post&#8208;transformations, the developed chemistry offers a practical platform to access various functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Guiding Design of Mn&#8208;Rich Phosphate Cathodes with Less Intrinsic Anti&#8208;Site Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serious voltage hysteresis phenomenon in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 has received extensive research interests, which is determined by the intrinsic&#8208;anti&#8208;site&#8208;defects (IASDs) of Mn2+ resided in Na vacancies (Mn/Na&#9633;) in structure. However, a general guideline to decrease IASDs is still lacking for design of higher&#8208;performance Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system. Herein, we find that generation of Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system is mainly related to Na vacancies and weaker Mn&#8208;O bonds in structure. The more of Na vacancies, the more probability for Mn2+ occupation on Na sites. Meanwhile the weaker Mn&#8208;O bond, the more probaility for Mn2+ delocalization/migration to other sites, finally leading to the Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs. To decrease Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs, we propose to introduce dopants with lower valence (vs. Ti4+), lower electronegativity (vs. Ti4+) and good solid solubility in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 system. Based on the guiding rule, we have selected several doping cations (including Cr3+, Ti3+, Fe3+, V3+) to construct a Na&#8208;rich environment and enhance Mn&#8208;O strength. Among various dopants, the substitution of V3+ for Ti4+ leads to the strongest Mn&#8208;O interaction, thus demonstrating the most effective suppression of Mn/Na&#9633; IASDs. With these discoveries, we further developed a series of V doped Mn&#8208;richer phosphate cathodes, Na3.3+yMn1.15VyTi0.85&#8208;y(PO4)3 (0.1&#8804;y&#8804;0.25) as the promising candidates for Na&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>The Cooperative Effects of the Rh&#8208;M Dual&#8208;Metal Atomic Pairs in Formic Acid Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuously increasing mass activity&#160;in formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is the key to achieving the practical application of direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). Herein, Rh&#8208;based dual&#8208;metal atomic pairs supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts [DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN] with adjacent interatomic Rh&#8208;M (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) have been synthesized by a &#8220;host&#8208;guest&#8221; strategy. We discovered that DAP&#8208;(Cr, Rh)/CN shows the highest mass activity of 64.1 A&#183;mg&#8208;1, which is 3.8 times higher than that of the single atom Rh catalyst (17.0 A&#183;mg&#8208;1) and two orders of magnitude higher than Pd/C (0.58 A&#183;mg&#8208;1). Interestingly, the mass activity of DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN firstly increases from 11.7 A&#183;mg&#8208;1 (Rh&#8208;V) to 64.1 A&#183;mg&#8208;1 (Rh&#8208;Cr) and then decreases to 21.8 A&#183;mg&#8208;1 (Rh&#8208;Cu), forming a volcano curve of the reaction activity. Density functional theory calculations combined with in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) spectra reveal that formic acid oxidized on a series of DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN catalysts through the formate route with the subsidiary M metal atoms binding the HCOO species and the Rh atom accepting the H atoms. The most suitable adsorption strength of HCOO on the Cr sites luckily contributes to two spontaneous elementary steps and thus accelerate the FAOR rates.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy for Acidic Water Oxidation at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing active and cost&#8208;effective catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critically important for optimizing proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers used in hydrogen production. In this study, we introduce a straightforward and rapid method to synthesize a quinary high&#8208;entropy ruthenium&#8208;based alloy (RuMnFeMoCo) for acidic OER. This iridium&#8208;free catalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 170 mV and exceptional stability, enduring a 1000&#8208;hour durability test at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Microstructural analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the incorporation of corrosion&#8208;resistant elements such as Ru, Mo, and Co enhances the overall stability of the catalyst under acidic conditions. Concurrently, the presence of Mn, Fe, and Co significantly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the OER process, thus accelerating the OER kinetics and lowering the overpotential. The PEMWE employing the RuMnFeMoCo catalyst operates stably at high current densities of 500 mA cm&#8208;2 and 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 for over 300 hours with negligible performance degradation. This work illustrates a strategy for designing high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by synergistically integrating the benefits of multiple elements, potentially overcoming the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off typically encountered in the catalyst development.</dc:description>

         <title>Immunoengineering of a Photocaged 5&#180;&#8208;triphosphate Oligoribonucleotide Ligand for Spatiotemporal Control of RIG&#8208;I Activation in Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical control of oligonucleotides bears great potential for the spatio&#8208;temporal control of therapeutic targets, such as immune sensing receptors. Retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I (RIG&#8208;I) is a cytoplasmic receptor of the innate immune system that triggers antiviral responses upon detection of viral RNA.RIG&#8208;I can be specifically activated by short double&#8208;stranded (ds) RNA with a blunt 5&#8242; end bearing a triphosphate, mimicking nascent viral transcripts. Tumor cells are specifically sensitive to RIG&#8208;I&#8208;induced cell death. Here we developed a potent oligonucleotide ligand for spatiotemporally controlled activation of RIG&#8208;I by light exposure. Through structural considerations and functional studies we identified a combination of two nucleoside positions in a RIG&#8208;I oligonucleotide ligand for which the substitution of both respective 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy groups of the ribose by photolabile protecting groups (2&#8242;&#8208;photocages) resulted in a complete loss of RIG&#8208;I ligand activity, whereas photocaging the individual positions was not sufficient to turn off RIG&#8208;I. Light exposure fully restored RIG&#8208;I activation by the photocaged RIG&#8208;I ligand, enabling light&#8208;controlled RIG&#8208;I&#8208;mediated cell death of human cancer cells which had internalized the photocaged RIG&#8208;I ligand prior to light exposure. This novel photoactivatable RIG&#8208;I oligonucleotide ligand may be applicable for precise light&#8208;controlled induction of tumor cell death in superficial cancer such as melanoma.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Catalysts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Ni Single Atom and MoC Nanoclusters Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel dual&#8208;site catalyst Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC demonstrates distinct catalytic functions, where the MoC sites exhibit high efficacy in catalyzing the reduction of long&#8208;chain LiPSs from Li2S8 to Li2S4. Concurrently, the Ni&#8208;N4 sites facilitate the reduction of short&#8208;chain LiPSs from Li2S4 to Li2S. This dual functionality synergistically enhances the overall Li&#8208;S redox process while mitigating the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites.








Abstract
The practical application of sulfur (S) cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is hindered by the shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Addressing these challenges requires advanced catalytic host materials capable of trapping LiPSs and accelerating Li&#8208;S redox reactions. However, single&#8208;site catalysts struggle to effectively mediate the complex multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;phase sulfur conversion processes. In this study, we present a novel dual&#8208;site catalyst, Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC, featuring nickel single atoms anchored to nitrogen sites (Ni&#8208;N4) within a carbon nitride (NC) matrix and molybdenum carbide (MoC) nanoclusters. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that MoC sites efficiently catalyze the reduction of long&#8208;chain LiPSs (Li&#8322;S&#8328; to Li&#8322;S&#8324;), while Ni&#8208;N4 sites drive the reduction of short&#8208;chain LiPSs (Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S), resulting in a synergistic enhancement of the complete Li&#8208;S redox process. When incorporated as a coating on the cathode side of a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, the Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC catalyst enhances sulfur utilization, suppresses LiPSs shuttling, and facilitates a uniform Li+&#8208;ion distribution, effectively mitigating the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites. Thereby, Li&#8208;S batteries employing an S/Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC cathode and a Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC@PP separator demonstrate outstanding performance, including an initial capacity of 1624&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 0.2C and 1142&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 1C, retaining 590&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; after 800 cycles. At a sulfur loading of 8.3&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8315;2 and an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8315;&#185;, the system achieves an initial areal capacity of 9.57&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8315;2 at 0.1C, showcasing significant promise for practical applications.

At a sulfur loading of 8.3&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8315;&#185;, the system achieves an initial areal capacity of 9.57&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1C, showcasing significant promise for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrarobust, Stretchable, and Highly Elastic Supramolecular Elastomer with Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Interactions via sp2 Hybridized Boron&#8208;Urethane Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear polyurethane elastomers prepared with phenylboronic acid as a chain extender exhibit excellent mechanical properties, such as high mechanical strength (63.9&#160;MPa), high toughness (442.2 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3), and rapid recovery (stretching up to 16 times the original length), due to the enhanced hydrogen bonding between segments caused by the sp2 plane structure of boron atoms.








Abstract
Elastomers are omnipresent in everyday life and industry, yet the development of an elastomer with both superb stress and toughness presents a prodigious challenge. In this report, a high&#8208;strength, tough, and high&#8208;elastic elastomer derived from sp2 hybrid orbitals of phenylboronic acid was designed. The spatial conformation of network becomes significantly more compact due to the sp2 hybridization of boron. This enhances supramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, resulting in a marked improvement in the material's mechanical properties. Notably, the hydrogen bonding energy in the polyurethane chain segments enhanced by 37%. The robust hydrogen bonding imparts the elastomer with super high true stress (1.30&#160;GPa), superior toughness (442.2 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3), and super puncture resistance strength of 167.8&#183;N&#183;mm&#8722;1. The material exhibited excellent fatigue resistance during continuous tensile cycles, while the irreversible deformation disappeared after standing at room temperature. Moreover, the elastomer bespeaks extraordinary elastic restorability, swiftly reverting to its primitive length after being extended to 16 times. This work provides a strategy that the mechanical properties of materials can be enhanced and toughened by utilizing spatial conformational changes in intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Industrial Preparation of SWCNTs&#8208;Confined High&#8208;Entropy Oxides as Self&#8208;Supported Electrodes for Continuous Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially confined oxidation enables large&#8208;scale synthesis of 1D HEO@SWCNTs with high aspect ratios and mechanical properties, featuring self&#8208;supported electrodes for continuous electrosynthesis with excellent stability and electrochemical activity.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are emerging as highly promising materials for electrochemical applications due to their exceptional electronic properties and active sites. However, the synthesis of 1D HEO with high aspect ratios and mechanical properties has been challenging, particularly on an industrial scale. Herein, we report a spatially confined oxidation (SCO) method to synthesize 1D HEO@SWCNTs with high specific surface area and stability. This method enables the large&#8208;scale production of HEO@SWCNTs, achieving quasi&#8208;industrially quantities in a single batch, and can be extended to seven&#8208;element 1D HEO. The resulting exhibit a homogeneous distribution of elements and a single&#8208;phase solid solution structure, as confirmed by STEM&#8208;EDS and XRD analysis. The Fermi level of SWCNTs is downshifted into the valence band upon HEO doping, enhancing conductivity and electrochemical activity. The HEO@SWCNTs electrode demonstrates superior flexibility and self&#8208;supported properties, making it suitable for large&#8208;scale electrochemical applications. Chronoamperometric measurements reveal excellent stability, maintaining 94% current retention after 20&#160;h. Notably, in the electrochemical epoxidation reaction cycloolefin, the HEO@SWCNTs self&#8208;supported electrode achieves an average FE of 70.7% for epoxy&#8208;cyclohexane over 24&#160;h. This work provides a scalable and versatile approach to the synthesis of self&#8208;supported electrodes for advanced electrochemical systems.

         <title>Bulk&#8208; and Surface&#8208;Engineered Carbon Nitride with Promoted Electron Transfer for NADH Regeneration and Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nitride (CN), a well&#8208;known photocatalyst, has been extensively utilized in light&#8208;driven redox reactions, including NADH regeneration.  However, its catalytic efficiency is hindered by rapid charge recombination due to  obstructed  electron transfer.  Herein, we developed a highly porous CN coated with a thin layer of rhodium complex (Rh*&#8208;PCN) through a combination of bulk and surface engineering for enhanced NADH regeneration. The bulk&#8208;engineered porous network of PCN facilitates oriented electron transfer in Rh*&#8208;PCN, while the surface&#8208;engineered Rh layer minimizes the electron transfer distance between PCN and the rhodium complex. Rh*&#8208;PCN achieves an initial NADH regeneration rate of 16.80 mmol g &#8315; &#185; h &#8315; &#185;. Moreover, Rh*&#8208;PCN suppresses enzyme deactivation by compartmentalizing the enzyme from the photogenerated holes on PCN and the rhodium complex. When integrated with glutamate dehydrogenase, the Rh*&#8208;PCN/enzyme coupled system produces L&#8208;glutamic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Three Birds with One Stone: Triple Defect Passivation of Tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) Phosphate Enables 25.69% Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional molecule, tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TTFP), is utilized to concurrently address multiple defects on both the top and bottom surfaces of perovskite films, as well as within the perovskite bulk. Consequently, the TTFP&#8208;incorporated p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells exhibit a high efficiency of 25.69%, along with exceptional long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Defect passivation is widely acknowledged as a crucial strategy for enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it remains a formidable challenge to effectively address multiple defects simultaneously on both the top and bottom surfaces of perovskite films, as well as within the bulk, through a facile method. To tackle this dilemma, we have devised a triple passivation strategy, aiming to achieve a holistic passivation of defects at the aforementioned locations using a singular passivator. Specifically, a multifunctional molecule, tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TTFP), is meticulously engineered as an additive in the antisolvent. This approach capitalizes a top&#8208;down gradient distribution of TTFP along the perovskite film, thereby enabling to mitigate the interfacial and bulk defects. Meanwhile, the unique molecular structure of TTFP facilitates simultaneous interactions with both cationic and anionic defects. Additionally, TTFP exerts a pronounced influence on the crystallization kinetics, thereby promoting the formation of highly crystalline perovskite films with substantially enlarged grain sizes. Consequently, the TTFP&#8208;based devices exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.69%, accompanied by a notable improvement in stability. This work represents the successful implementation of comprehensive defect passivation, marking a significant instance in the advancement of efficient and stable PSCs technology.

         <title>Double Sb&#8208;N Coordination Enables Record&#8208;High Birefringence in UV&#8208;Transparent Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV&#8208;transparent hybrid birefringence crystal, (C12H8N2)SbF3 (PNSF), with a record&#8208;breaking birefringence of 0.79 at 546&#160;nm, surpassing all previously reported UV&#8208;transparent birefringent materials, was successfully designed and synthesized through a transformative organic&#8211;inorganic coordination approach.








Abstract
Achieving high birefringence in ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;transparent crystals has remained a significant challenge due to the absence of systematic design methodologies. Herein, we present a novel organic&#8211;inorganic coordination strategy that combines &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic ligands ([C12H8N2]) with inorganic Sb&#8208;based polyhedra featuring stereochemically active lone pairs. This approach facilitates the formation of the first coplanar double Sb&#8208;N coordination framework, enabling the synthesis of two new birefringent hybrid crystals: (C12H8N2)SbF2(H2PO3) (PNSP) and (C12H8N2)SbF3 (PNSF). Notably, PNSF demonstrates an unprecedented birefringence of 0.79 at 546&#160;nm, exceeding all known UV&#8208;transparent birefringent materials to date. These results not only expand the performance limits of birefringent hybrid crystals but also emphasize the pivotal role of stereochemically induced anisotropy in manipulating optical properties. Our study establishes a solid foundation for the rational design of next&#8208;generation optical materials, offering significant advancements for applications in cutting&#8208;edge photonic technologies, including UV polarizers and optical modulators.

&lt;p&gt;A UV-transparent hybrid birefringence crystal, (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)SbF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PNSF), with a record-breaking birefringence of 0.79 at 546&#160;nm, surpassing all previously reported UV-transparent birefringent materials, was successfully designed and synthesized through a transformative organic&#8211;inorganic coordination approach.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving high birefringence in ultraviolet (UV)-transparent crystals has remained a significant challenge due to the absence of systematic design methodologies. Herein, we present a novel organic&#8211;inorganic coordination strategy that combines &#960;-conjugated organic ligands ([C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]) with inorganic Sb-based polyhedra featuring stereochemically active lone pairs. This approach facilitates the formation of the first coplanar double Sb-N coordination framework, enabling the synthesis of two new birefringent hybrid crystals: (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)SbF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (PNSP) and (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)SbF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PNSF). Notably, PNSF demonstrates an unprecedented birefringence of 0.79 at 546&#160;nm, exceeding all known UV-transparent birefringent materials to date. These results not only expand the performance limits of birefringent hybrid crystals but also emphasize the pivotal role of stereochemically induced anisotropy in manipulating optical properties. Our study establishes a solid foundation for the rational design of next-generation optical materials, offering significant advancements for applications in cutting-edge photonic technologies, including UV polarizers and optical modulators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conditional Activation of Protein Therapeutics by Templated Removal of Peptide Nucleic Acid Masking Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the conditional activation of therapeutic proteins utilizing removable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) masking groups is presented. Site&#8208;specific installation of &#8220;Lock&#8221;&#8208;PNAs containing a cleavage thioester linkage enabled steric blockage of receptor binding sites. On&#8208;demand unmasking induced by a complementary &#8220;Key&#8221;&#8208;PNA containing a cysteine residue allowed the controlled release of active proteins.








Abstract
Interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2)&#8208;based therapeutics are emerging as treatments for immunotherapy; however, systemic activation of immune cells hampers their success. Chemically controlling the activity of potent cytokines could mitigate unwanted T cell stimulation and widen their therapeutic window. In this study, we developed a strategy for the conditional activation of proteins utilizing removable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) masking groups. Site&#8208;specific installation of &#8220;Lock&#8221;&#8208;PNAs containing a cleavage thioester linkage enabled steric blockage of receptor binding sites. Rapid unmasking and activation were performed by the addition of a complementary &#8220;Key&#8221;&#8208;PNA containing a cysteine (Cys) residue, which forms a PNA&#8211;PNA duplex leading to a proximity&#8208;accelerated cleavage step and release of the active protein. We exemplified the versatility of this methodology on de novo cytokine neoleukin&#8208;2/15 (Neo&#8208;2/15) through the preparation of PNA conjugates including homodimers, PNA&#8208;stapled conjugates, and dual PNA&#8208;bridged dimers. All constructs were effectively unmasked at low micromolar concentrations. Further, we demonstrated the conditional activation of a masked conjugate of Neo&#8208;2/15 in binding studies to the IL&#8208;2 receptors and in an ex vivo T cell signaling assay displaying a 480&#8208;fold potency increase upon activation. Finally, we extended the strategy to a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) activating the human CD40 receptor demonstrating successful masking and unmasking.

         <title>Synthesis of Abiotic Supramolecular Polymers Inside Living Cells via Organocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully abiotic supramolecular polymers (SPs) have been in situ&#8208;synthesized in living cells by virtue of organocatalyst (CAT)&#8208;accelerated intracellular formation and self&#8208;assembly of hydrazone&#8208;based monomers (HA3) from non&#8208;assembling hydrazide (H) and aldehyde (A). The generated SPs are found to restrict intracellular diffusion and interfere with the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby hindering the migration of cells.








Abstract
Cells execute mesmerizing functions using supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed through the self&#8208;assembly of biological precursors. Integration of the vast array of synthetic SPs with living cells would offer a powerful way to remold cellular functions and bridge the gap between synthetic materials and the biological realm, yet remains a challenge because of the lack of robust abiotic SP systems that can be triggered to self&#8208;assemble inside cells. Here, we report how fully abiotic SPs can be synthesized inside living cells via an organocatalysis&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly strategy, and how the in situ&#8208;generated SPs are capable of interfering and can interfere with cellular functions. The incorporation of a nucleophilic organocatalyst (CAT) into living cells accelerates the intracellular conversion of hydrazide (H) and aldehyde&#8208;derived precursors (A) to hydrazone&#8208;based monomers (HA3) that locally self&#8208;assemble into SPs. Interestingly, the in situ&#8208;generated SPs possess ignorable effects on cell viability and proliferation but remarkably hinder cell migration. Furthermore, the presence of SPs is found to retard intracellular diffusion and alter the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, both of which are suggested to be responsible for the hindered cellular migration. In considering the vastly wide range of synthetic SPs, tremendous non&#8208;natural cellular functionalities can be obtained by in situ&#8208;synthesizing SPs.

         <title>Establishing an Efficient Electron Transfer System for P450 Enzyme OleP to Improve the Biosynthesis of Murideoxycholic Acid by Redox Partner Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic redox partner engineering strategy is proposed for three&#8208;component P450s, including selection, reconstitution, engineering, and analysis of the most suitable redox partner. The applied engineering strategies, high&#8208;throughput screening methods, and analytical approaches provide a feasible way to construct an ideal redox partner for other P450 enzymes.








Abstract
The electron transfer from NAD(P)H to heme is a rate&#8208;limiting step in the redox partner&#8208;mediated catalysis of P450 enzyme. However, due to the lack of efficient engineering strategies, it is difficult to improve the properties of redox partner. Herein, we construct an effective approach to modify the redox partner for a typical P450 enzyme (OleP) that can catalyze the stereoselective conversion of lithocholic acid to murideoxycholic acid. First, the combination of computational modeling and experimental validation was performed to rapidly identify the most suitable redox partner (PetH/PetF). Next, the interactions between PetF and OleP were investigated and the engineering on PetF was conducted to enhance the efficiency of electron transfer. Using a novel microplate screening method, a superior mutant (PetFF64D) was efficiently selected, which exhibited a significant enhancement in MDCA conversion yield from 32.5% to 80.9% and total turnover number (TTN) from 406.2 to 1617.9. Finally, through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, the analysis of electron transfer pathway, and the calculations of electron transfer rate, the mechanism of electron transfer was investigated. The applied engineering strategies, high&#8208;throughput screening methods, and analytical approaches provide a feasible way to construct an ideal redox partner for other P450 enzymes.

Abstract
The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with N&#8594;B Lewis pairs, so&#8208;called borylative fusion, has recently emerged as a simple and powerful means to modulate their electronic and photophysical properties thanks to the extension of the &#960; system. Herein, we considered a new class of PAHs appended with phosphine&#8594;borane Lewis pairs and investigated pyrene as well as anthracene derivatives. In these compounds, strong P&#8594;B interactions are enforced geometrically, but the &#960;&#8208;system is not extended. Nevertheless, such P&#8594;B functionalization was found to significantly impact the optical and electrochemical properties. The P,B&#8208;functionalized PAHs display noticeably reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and enhanced fluorescence. Both the number and position of P&#8594;B units turned out to play a significant role.

         <title>A Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework With Rich Redox Active Sites as Cathode Material for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline truxenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with rich redox active sites has been designed and prepared. Experiments and calculations reveal that C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N groups are active sites during discharge/charge processes. The TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can store 27 Li+ ions in one ring and deliver a high discharge capacity of 435 mAh g&#8722;1. This work provides a facile method to achieve high&#8208;capacity COF cathodes for lithium batteries.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for lithium batteries. However, they generally show low practical capacity. Here, the design, preparation, and battery application of a highly crystalline 2D truxenone&#8208;based COF (TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with rich redox active sites, realizing a high practical capacity is reported. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the lithiation reaction proceeds successively on C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N groups of TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF. One ring of TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can theoretically store 27 Li+ ions through two stages. Consequently, the highly crystalline TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF displays a high discharge capacity of 435 mAh g&#8722;1 when used as a cathode material for lithium batteries. This work provides a facile approach to achieve COF electrode materials with high practical capacity for lithium batteries.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Organic Electroluminescence with External Quantum Efficiency of 40% from Indolocarbazole&#8208;Embedded Multiple Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition display technology has spurred the prosperity of multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) and high efficiency, making them highly promising candidates for high&#8208;color&#8208;purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) displays. Indolocarbazole, a highly rigid aza&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon framework, has shown significant potential as a building block for constructing MR&#8208;TADF emitters with ultra&#8208;narrowband emission (&lt; 20 nm). However, it remains a great challenge to construct ultra&#8208;narrowband indolocarbazole&#8208;embedded MR&#8208;TADF emitters with emission maxima less than 500 nm. Here, two MR&#8208;TADF emitters, DBN&#8208;amICz and DBN&#8208;bmICz, are constructed by adopting meta&#8208;N&#8211;&#960;&#8211;N&#8208;type indolocarbazole as core framework and achieve ultra&#8208;narrowband blue&#8208;green emission in toluene solution with peaks of both 490 nm and FWHMs of 18 and 19 nm, respectively. OLEDs incorporating emitters DBN&#8208;amICz and DBN&#8208;bmICz demonstrate excellent electroluminescence performances, with maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 40.1% and 35.5%, and FWHMs of 21 and 24 nm, respectively. This study represents the first report of dual&#8208;boron&#8208;containing MR emitters derived from indolocarbazole with emission below 500 nm, filling a gap in the development of indolocarbazole&#8208;embedded dual&#8208;boron&#8208;containing blue&#8208;green MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Probiotics Enables Targeted Gut Delivery of Dual Gasotransmitters for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains an incurable condition, often accompanied by high rates of anxiety and depression, further diminishing the quality of life of patients. Endogenous gasotransmitters, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), exhibit potent anti&#8208;inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. However, their therapeutic application is limited by challenges in targeted delivery to affected tissues. Here, we propose a novel strategy for targeted gut delivery of CO/H2S through engineering Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) with CO/H2S&#8208;releasing copolymer (POSR) loading. This engineered probiotic (POSR@EcN) enhances EcN colonization in the intestine and enables controlled, localized release of CO/H2S at inflamed sites. The release of CO/H2S modulates inflammation, restores intestinal barrier integrity, and reshapes gut microbiota by promoting beneficial bacteria and increasing short&#8208;chain fatty acids production, effectively alleviating IBD symptoms. Notably, targeted CO/H2S delivery also elevates neuroprotective metabolites like indoleacetic acid and &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid, reducing neuroinflammation via the gut&#8208;brain axis and mitigating anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors in IBD mice. This approach highlights the potential of EcN as a probiotic carrier for the targeted delivery of gasotransmitters, offering a promising strategy for IBD treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of a Self&#8208;Sustaining Modular Afterglow Scaffold for In Vivo Activatable Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecules (SAMs) offer high simplicity, reproducibility, and design flexibility compared to common multi&#8208;component systems. To date, only a few SAMs have been reported. However, these studies mainly focus on probe selection and screening, without providing an guidance for constructing SAMs from the bottom up.&#160;Herein,&#160;we report the molecular design and tuning of boron dipyrromethene derivatives (BDs), with structural engineering to enhance the singlet oxygen (1O2) reactivity and photosensitivity, aiming to construct SAMs for activatable afterglow imaging. The optimized BDI&#8208;NPs achieve afterglow luminescence at 780 nm following the precise structural creation of BDI, which serves as the role of afterglow initiator, substrate, and relay unit meantime. The BDI can be further customized into an activatable afterglow probe (BDIS&#8208;NPs), capable of simultaneously activated fluorescence and afterglow signals for sensing hydrogen disulfide (H2S). Owing to the elimination of autofluorescence and high activation contrast of the afterglow signal, BDIS&#8208;NPs enables early monitoring of&#160;lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced acute lung injury within 15 min and sensitive visualization of H2S accumulation in the brain of schizophrenia mice with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), which is not achievable by fluorescence imaging. This study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding and design guidelines for SAMs and activatable afterglow imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights Into H2O Dissociation in Overall Photo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The slow dissociation of H&#8322;O, which serves as the rate&#8208;determining step, governs the overall performance of CO&#8322; reduction. Three key regulatory mechanisms are identified as: 1) The proton&#8208;feeding effect; 2) the positive charge depletion effect; and 3) the significant reverse reaction effect. These principles universally influence catalytic systems that involve H&#8322;O activation, providing a framework for atomic&#8208;scale design strategies for energy conversion interfaces in photo/electrocatalytic systems.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction with H2O to produce fuels and chemicals offers a dual solution to address both environmental and energy challenges. For a long time, catalyst design in this reaction system has primarily focused on optimizing reduction sites to improve the efficiency or guide the reaction pathway of the CO2 reduction half&#8208;reaction. However, less attention has been paid to designing activation sites for H2O to modulate the H2O dissociation half&#8208;reaction. Impressively, the rate&#8208;determining step in overall CO2 reduction is the latter, and it influences the evolution direction and formation energy of carbon&#8208;containing intermediates through the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Herein, we summarize the mechanism of the H2O dissociation half&#8208;reaction in modulating CO2 reduction performance based on cutting&#8208;edge research. These analyses aim to uncover the potential regulatory mechanisms by which H2O activation influences CO2 reduction pathways and conversion efficiency, and to establish a mechanism&#8208;structure&#8208;performance relationship that can guide the design and development of high&#8208;efficiency catalytic materials. A summary of advanced characterization techniques for investigating the dissociation mechanism of H2O is presented. We also discuss the challenges and offer perspectives on the future design of activation sites to improve the performance of photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction.

A summary of advanced characterization techniques for investigating the dissociation mechanism of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is presented. We also discuss the challenges and offer perspectives on the future design of activation sites to improve the performance of photo-/electro-catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Photoexcitation of carboxylic acids is challenging due to high energy requirements and low quantum efficiency. Recently, Scheidt and co&#8208;workers reported a single&#8208;flask transformation of carboxylic acids into acyl phosphonates, which facilitates the generation of diradicals under visible light irradiation. Building on this work, an efficient strategy for the structural reconstruction of carboxylic acids has been developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Quantification of Neuroprotective Effect of Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst on Neurochemical Transmission by Multi&#8208;Spatiotemporal Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maintaining redox homeostasis through biocatalytic reactions has emerged as a widely studied neuroprotective strategy for various brain disorders and injuries. However, current research on neuroprotection primarily focuses on functional and behavioral assessments. The impact of neuroprotective interventions on neurotransmission, a critical function of the central nervous system, remains relatively underexplored. In this study, we report the first direct evidence for neuroprotective effect on neurochemical transmission by multi&#8208;spatiotemporal electrochemistry. We employed in vivo and single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry to quantitatively evaluate the neuroprotective effect of an antioxidative Fe single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Fe1/NC SAzyme) on neurotransmission, using a 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium (MPP+)&#8208;induced Parkinson's disease (PD) model. In the PD animal model, Fe1/NC SAzyme mitigates MPP+ neurotoxicity by decreasing damage to dopaminergic neurons, increasing evoked dopamine release, attenuating spontaneous firing, and alleviating locomotor impairment. At the single&#8208;cell level, pretreatment with Fe1/NC SAzyme inhibits MPP+ effects by scavenging reactive oxygen species, increasing cell viability and ATP concentration, and enhancing the exocytotic release. This study not only provides a research paradigm for directly quantifying therapeutic mechanisms of brain disorders and injury but also reinforces a novel neuroprotective strategy through modulating the redox homeostasis with biocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Laser&#8208;Polarization&#8208;Induced Anisotropy Enhances Protein Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarization of the optical trapping laser has a significant impact on the crystallization of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme. The anisotropy of the high&#8208;concentration domain composed of HEWL molecules/clusters plays a crucial role in the crystallization process. Linear polarization promotes crystallization by inducing strong anisotropy, whereas circular polarization leads to weak anisotropy and minimal enhancement of crystallization.








Abstract
Protein crystallization plays a critical role in structural biology and drug development, driving extensive research into its control. We present a novel approach for manipulating protein crystallization by controlling the anisotropy of the high&#8208;concentration domain (HCD) composed of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) through laser polarization in optical trapping. The anisotropy of the HCD was assessed through fluorescence anisotropy measurements and polarized Raman spectroscopy. The results revealed that linear polarization significantly enhances crystallization efficiency by inducing anisotropy of the HCD and promoting nucleation. In contrast, circular polarization resulted in weak anisotropy with minimal crystallization efficiency. This study highlights the crucial role of protein molecule anisotropy in crystallization under optical trapping conditions, providing a new strategy to optimize laser conditions for various protein molecules and pave the way for the development of innovative crystallization techniques, potentially revolutionizing structural biology and drug discovery efforts.

         <title>GOAT: A Global Optimization Algorithm for Molecules and Atomic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present GOAT, a new global optimization algorithm that hops over the potential energy surface until it finds the global minimum and conformational ensembles. The algorithm does not rely on molecular dynamics, which makes it useful to run even with hybrid DFT and deal with systems withs complicated electronic structures.







Abstract
In this work, we propose a new Global Optimization Algorithm (GOAT) for molecules and clusters of atoms and show how it can find the global energy minima for both systems without resorting to molecular dynamics (MD). This avoids the potential millions of time&#8208;consuming gradient calculations required by a long MD run. Because of that, it can be used with any regular quantum chemical method, even with the costlier hybrid DFT. We showcase its accuracy by running it on various systems, from organic molecules to water clusters, metal complexes, and metal nanoparticles, comparing it with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods such as the Conformer&#8208;Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST). We also discuss its underlying theory and mechanisms for succeeding in challenging cases. GOAT is, in general, more efficient and accurate than previous algorithms in finding global minima and succeeds in cases where others cannot due to the free choice for the Potential Energy Surface (PES).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasound (US) is a promising external excitation modality for bioapplications, offering significant advantages over X&#8208;rays or laser, due to its low cost, high biosafety, and ideal tissue penetration depth. US&#8208;activated theranostic materials, comprising organic, inorganic, and hybrid&#8208;based compounds&#8212;hold particular value in synergistic cancer therapeutic and diagnostic applications. These materials exhibit excellent imaging properties, high drug delivery and release efficiency, and enhanced ROS production, making them suitable for clinical diagnostic imaging and therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes recent research on the design, performance, and optimization of US&#8208;mediated molecules/nanosystems for a wide range of biomedical applications. Additionally, the multifunctional use of these sonosensitizers in imaging, drug delivery, and sonodynamic therapy, especially in combination with other treatment could pave the way for innovative strategies in disease therapy. Finally, an overview of this field&#8217;s challenges and potential future directions is provided, highlighting pathways to promote clinical translation and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Homologation of Alkenes Using Acetylene as a C2 Feedstock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for the homologation of alkenes that employs acetylene as a C&#8322; feedstock and proceeds via an alkyl borane intermediate has been developed. Commercially available but expensive and unavailable alkenes can be synthesized by this methodology from their C&#8322; shorter homologues, which can be much less expensive. A variety of functional groups and a series of alkene substitution patterns were tolerated, and a chain length increase of up to twelve carbon atoms was achieved by iterative homologation.








Abstract
The preparation of diverse homologs from lead compounds has been a common and important practice in medicinal, mechano, polymeric, and many other branches of chemistry. The homologation of alkenes, though important, remains challenging due to the difficulty of (CH2)n insertion into the main carbon chain of alkenes compared to chains containing other polar functional groups. Here, we report the homologation of both terminal and internal alkenes by using acetylene as a cheap and abundant C2 feedstock. The process involves an in&#8208;situ transformation of alkenes into boranes and then into elongated alkenes, during which direct (CH2)n insertion is avoided. The reaction can be carried out iteratively to achieve up to a 12&#8208;carbon elongation.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Robust Supraparticles for Spatially Orthogonal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the preparation of multicomponent, millimeter&#8208;sized, robust ionic supraparticles via electrostatic assembly within water droplets is developed. This strategy enables the synthesis of spatially orthogonal cascade catalysts in which incompatible acidic, basic, and metal sites are integrated in a single millisphere. The developed catalysts work well in industrially preferred fixed&#8208;bed reactors, exhibiting significantly enhanced cascade catalysis efficiency and outstanding operational stability. 








Abstract
Macroscopically sized supraparticles (SPs) are emerging as cutting&#8208;edge materials for industrial applications because of their unique properties unachievable for their nano&#8208;building blocks, but their effective methods are lacking. Here, a conceptually novel strategy is developed to assemble binary or ternary nanoparticles (NPs) within compartments of droplets through electrostatic interactions, making it possible to facilely fabricate millimeter&#8208;sized multicomponent ionic supraparticles (ISPs). The assembled ISPs possess unexpectedly high mechanical strength (50&#160;N per bead), being amenable to practical applications. The key factors governing the assembly behavior of nano&#8208;building blocks within water droplet compartments are identified through regulating the size and charge density of NPs or ionic strength, providing key insights into the multileveled assembly of NPs beyond the conventional assembly. The strategy is demonstrated to be versatile since a library of tailor&#8208;made ISPs containing multicomponent, diversely shaped, and differently sized NPs can be facilely fabricated. As proof of this concept, it is showcased that this method enables the preparation of spatially orthogonal cascade catalysts by co&#8208;assembling acidic, basic, and metal sites in single millimeter&#8208;scaled particles. The catalysts exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency in a one&#8208;pot cascade synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated nitriles and high operational stability (200&#160;h) in industrially preferred fixed&#8208;bed reactors.

         <title>Electronic Excitation and High&#8208;Energy Reactions Originate From Anionic Microdroplets Formed by Electrospray or Pneumatic Nebulization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet evaporation can lead to ion emission or droplet fission. In negatively charged droplets, charge can also be lost through electron emission. These ejected electrons can subsequently lead to ionization or electronic excitation in excess of 10&#160;eV.








Abstract
Formation of energetic species at the surface of aqueous microdroplets, including abundant hydroxyl radicals, oxidation products, and ionized N2 and O2 gas, has been previously attributed to the high electric field at the droplet surface. Here, evidence for a new mechanism for electronic excitation involving electron emission from negatively charged water droplets is shown. Droplet evaporation can lead to the emission of ions and droplet fission, but unlike positively charged droplets, negatively charged droplets can also shed charge by electron emission. With nanoelectrospray, no anions or negatively charged droplets are produced with a positive electrospray potential. In contrast, abundant O2+&#8226; and H3O+(H2O) are formed with negative electrospray. When toluene vapor is introduced with negative electrospray, abundant toluene radical cations and fragments are produced. Both O2+&#8226; and toluene radical cations are produced with pneumatic nebulization. The electrons produced from evaporating negatively charged droplets can be accelerated by an external electric field in electrospray, or by the field generated between droplets with opposite polarities produced by pneumatic nebulization. This electron emission/ionization mechanism leads to electronic excitation &gt;10&#160;eV, and it may explain some of the surprising chemistries that were previously attributed to the high intrinsic electric field at the surface of aqueous droplets.

         <title>Degradation of Glyphosate to Benign N&#8208;Formyl Glycine Using MOF&#8208;808 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF&#8208;808) with different crystal sizes and designed defect sites was employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the complete degradation of glyphosate at room temperature. The degradation mechanism produces N&#8208;formyl glycine and hydroxymethyl&#8208;phosphonate.








Abstract
Glyphosate (N&#8208;phosphonomethyl glycine, GPh) is an industrial herbicide used worldwide in modern agricultural practices. With the growing concerns regarding cumulative environmental and health effects, pathways for catalytic GPh degradation to benign products are becoming a pressing societal need. This report demonstrates that Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF&#8208;808) with different crystal sizes and designed defect sites can be employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the complete degradation of GPh at room temperature. Importantly, the degradation mechanism produces N&#8208;formyl glycine and hydroxymethyl&#8208;phosphonate, which are largely innocuous chemicals, especially when compared to more common GPh degradation products. Nanocrystalline MOF&#8208;808 (nMOF&#8208;808) exhibits enhanced reactivity than larger MOF&#8208;808 crystals, attributed to the higher coordination of hydroxyl and water molecules to the secondary building units (SBU) as determined using a range of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques. These studies indicate that the crystal size&#8208;dependency in GPh degradation is related to structural modifications on coordinative unsaturated Zr site that promote the fast exchange of weakly bonded ligands. Taken together, this study demonstrates that GPh degradation can be optimized through ligand field tuning in MOFs, which can help improve overall reactivity while also pushing the reaction toward desirable, nontoxic products.

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization Under Microwatt Irradiation via Unimolecular Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization significantly enhances the reactivity of acidic CTAs with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts, enabling polymerization under low light intensity (0.25&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). This approach outperforms traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently. Mechanistic studies suggest base addition shifts activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.








Abstract
Photoinduced radical addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization typically requires high light intensity (&gt;5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), limiting energy efficiency, and scalability. We demonstrate that adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT systems drastically enhances the reactivity of acidic chain transfer agents (CTAs) with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts (Zn porphyrin and Zn phthalocyanine). This approach enables complete polymerization under microwatt light intensity (0.25&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), a significant improvement over traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently with excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity. Reactivity was triggered chemically (via base addition) or electrochemically (via electrolytic reduction). Mechanistic studies reveal that base addition promotes a CTA&#8208;Zn photocatalyst complex, shifting the activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Triazenylarenes Enable Vicinal Sandmeyer&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;triazenylarenes enable vicinal disubstitution reactions. The reactions can be performed in one step or in a sequential fashion, and they allow introducing a range of different nucleophiles including fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, hydroxide, methoxide, and acetamide.








Abstract
The introduction of two nucleophiles in the vicinal position of arenes via Sandmeyer&#8208;type reactions is compromised by the problematic diazotization of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes. Herein, it is shown that vicinal substitution reactions are facilitated by the use of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;triazenylarenes. Two distinct methodologies for the synthesis of these triazenes are presented. The first approach involves the sequential conversion of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;iodoarenes into first mono&#8208; and then bis&#8208;triazenylarenes. The second procedure is based on Ru&#8208;catalyzed [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions between diynes and a 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;triazenylalkyne. The two triazene groups in the products can be substituted sequentially by a range of nucleophiles including fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, hydroxide, methoxide, and acetamide.

         <title>Advancing Propylene Epoxidation: the Role of Ethyl Acetate Autoxidation via Cobalt&#8208;Nickel Catalyzed C(acyl)&#9472;O Bond Scission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt/nickel catalytic aerobic epoxidation of propylene is described, where the autoxidation of carboxyl esters, as in ethyl acetate, ultimately provides peracetic acid as the oxidizing reagent, resulting in a remarkable epoxide selectivity. The confirmed Co(III)/Co(II) active center is stabilized through its interaction with nickel, involvement in the oxidation of the ethoxy radical (an intermediate from the ester C&#9472;O bond cleavage), as well as the single&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen.








Abstract
The selective autoxidation for the synthesis of valuable oxygenates has provoked keen interest from both academic and industrial sectors. Although the generation of reactive oxygen species via oxygen attack on C&#9472;H bonds near ester linkages is well&#8208;established, research into aliphatic ester oxidation has primarily focused on combustion, neglecting their potential utility in oxidation processes. Herein, a protocol for producing propylene oxide through the autoxidation of ethyl acetate in tandem with propylene epoxidation is demonstrated. The ethoxy radical, generated by ester C(acyl)&#9472;O bond cleavage in situ, subsequently underwent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with the Co(OAc)(&#956;&#8208;H2O)2Ni, followed by the formation of the peracetic acid optimally suited for the epoxidation reaction. The research not only eliminates the need for co&#8208;substrates in the epoxidation process but also fills the application gap in bulk&#8208;ester autoxidation, offering insights into the effective utilization of oxy&#8208;intermediates in autoxidation reactions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as a Primer in a Dual&#8208;Layer Coating for Corrosion Protection on Iron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) monolayer is electrodeposited on Fe foil and effectively functioned as a binder for a secondary layer of a cross&#8208;linked polymer network, which is photo&#8208;polymerized on the NHC monolayer. The dual coating, constructed of NHC monolayer and polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively preventes corrosion formation on Fe.








Abstract
The development of highly stable coatings on iron is essential for mitigating corrosion formation. Herein, it is demonstrated that a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) can be electrodeposited on iron foil and function as a binder for a secondary, crosslinked polymer network coating. The dual layer coating, constructed of a monolayer of NHCs and a polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively preventes corrosion formation with a protective efficiency of 99.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;%, as determined by polarization measurements in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. Spectroscopic analysis identified the formation of a chemical interaction between the NHC monolayer and the polymer film. The strong anchoring of NHC to iron along with its chemical interaction with the polymer film induced high stability and durability of the dual&#8208;layer coating to effectively protect the coated iron from corrosion formation.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Activated Platform for Controlled Hydrogen Sulfide Release with Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable H2S releasing motif was developed, enabling the encapsulation of payloads featuring diverse functional sites. The delivery of H2S was achieved through a COS mediate pathway characterized by an adjustable releasing profile. Additionally, drugs possessing function sites could be readily integrated into this platform, thereby facilitating the construction of prodrugs.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is increasingly recognized for its critical role in various physiological and pathological processes. The development of synthetic donors with controllable release profiles is essential for elucidating H2S's complex involvement in cellular signaling, which remains a challenge. Herein, we report a diverse collection of photocaged N&#8208;methylation thiocarbamates and thiocarbonates, designed to explore how electronic properties and the leaving efficiency of payloads affect H2S release behaviors. These compounds are engineered to release carbonyl sulfide (COS) following the removal of photoprotective group (PPG). The COS could be rapidly converted into H2S by carbonic anhydrase, and the entire reaction progression was monitored by changes in fluorescence signals. Furthermore, this H2S&#8208;releasing platform is suitable for conjugation with active pharmaceutical ingredients, facilitating the creation of H2S&#8208;releasing hybrid prodrugs. Collectively, this novel class of H2S donor not only provides valuable tool for H2S&#8208;related research but also holds significant potential as therapeutic agent.

         <title>Photoinduced electron transfer across phospholipid bilayers in anaerobic and aerobic atmospheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In natural photosynthesis, light&#8208;driven electron transfer across the thylakoid membrane enables efficient charge separation and the confinement of reaction spaces for generating NADPH and CO2 and oxidation of water. These reactions are complementary redox reactions and require different reaction conditions for optimal performance. However, current artificial photosynthesis studies only take place in the bulk and are sensitive towards oxygen and air, which limits their applicability under aerated and water&#8208;splitting conditions. Herein, we report light&#8208;driven electron transfer across a lipid bilayer membrane of liposome vesicles via a rigid oligoaromatic molecular wire that allows to electronically connect an oxidation and reduction reaction which are spatially separated by the membrane. The molecular wire has a simple, symmetric, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize design based on benzothiadiazole and fluorene units and absorbs in the visible spectrum which makes it suitable for solar energy conversion. The model reactions in this study are light&#8208;driven NADH oxidation on one side of the membrane and light&#8208;driven reduction of an organic water&#8208;soluble dye in the bulk phase of liposomes. Additionally, the system is active in both aerobic and anaerobic atmospheres, rendering it ideal for aerobic conditions or reactions that produce oxygen such as solar&#8208;driven water splitting and artificial photosynthesis applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry of WC Powder Electrocatalysts Probed In situ with NAP&#8208;XPS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tungsten carbide (WC) is a renowned compound catalyst material for electrochemical water splitting, and its high electrocatalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been repeatedly reported. However, its susceptibility to oxidation raises the fundamental question of the underlying reason for its high activity, especially since passivation and thus potential deactivation can occur not only in air but also during reaction. Hence, the investigation of the surface chemistry under true operating conditions is crucial for a fundamental understanding of the electrocatalytic process. In this work we use electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (EC&#8208;XPS) to revisit the surface chemistry of WC powder electrodes in alkaline electrolyte in&#8208;situ and under full potential control. Our results show that although the surface is initially covered with oxide, this passive film dissolves in the electrolyte under electrochemical reaction conditions. This clarifies the active surface termination during the HER and highlights the potential of laboratory&#8208;based EC&#8208;XPS to study applied energy conversion materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Synthetic Pathway to Lanthanide Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes: Selective Expansion of a Sandwich Complex by an Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commonly, multi&#8208;decker sandwich complexes can either be formed in a one&#8208;step reaction or in a stepwise fashion by stacking deck by deck. Herein, we showcase a new reaction pathway, in which for the first time a lanthanide half&#8208;sandwich unit inserts into an existing sandwich complex. As a result of the insertion of a cyclocene half&#8208;sandwich fragment {LnII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)} (CotTIPS&#160;=&#160;1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)2C8H62&#8208;) into a classical divalent sandwich complex [LnII(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)2] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Sm, Eu, Yb; Cnt&#160;=&#160;C9H9&#8208;), the unprecedented triple&#8208;decker sandwich complexes of the type [(&#951;9&#8209;Cnt)LnII(&#956;&#8209;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8209;CotTIPS)LnII(&#951;9&#8209;Cnt)] were obtained. A plausible reaction pathway was determined by quantum chemical calculations. Additionally, we synthesize the same lanthanide sandwich complexes in a traditional, stepwise fashion. For this, we initially present the novel inverse sandwich compounds [LnIII(thf)2(&#956;&#8209;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8209;CotTIPS)LnIII(thf)2] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Sm,&#160;Eu, thf = tetrahydrofuran) and [YbII(BH4)(thf)2(&#956;&#8209;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8209;CotTIPS)YbII(BH4)(thf)2] consisting of a cyclooctatetraene middle deck sandwiched between two divalent lanthanides as precursors. Subsequent salt metathesis reactions with [K(Cnt)] (Cnt&#160;=&#160;C9H9&#8208;) gave rise to the title compounds [(&#951;9&#8209;Cnt)LnII(&#956;&#8209;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8209;CotTIPS)LnII(&#951;9&#8209;Cnt)].

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Commonly, multi-decker sandwich complexes can either be formed in a one-step reaction or in a stepwise fashion by stacking deck by deck. Herein, we showcase a new reaction pathway, in which for the first time a lanthanide half-sandwich unit inserts into an existing sandwich complex. As a result of the insertion of a cyclocene half-sandwich fragment {LnII(&#951;8-CotTIPS)} (CotTIPS&#160;=&#160;1,4-(iPr3Si)2C8H62-) into a classical divalent sandwich complex [LnII(&#951;9-Cnt)2] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Sm, Eu, Yb; Cnt&#160;=&#160;C9H9-), the unprecedented triple-decker sandwich complexes of the type [(&#951;9&#8209;Cnt)LnII(&#956;&#8209;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8209;CotTIPS)LnII(&#951;9&#8209;Cnt)] were obtained.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Density Covalent Organic Framework Sponges with Exceptional Compression and Functional Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) macroscopic objects with hierarchical porous structures addresses the limitations of traditional COF powders, which are challenging to process, thus bringing them closer to practical applications. However, the brittleness of the parent COF powder results in poor mechanical stability of these COF macroscopic objects, presenting a significant challenge that must be overcome for their continued development. In this work, we successfully obtained a continuous, hierarchically porous, and interconnected open&#8208;cell COF structure made up of hollow sponge walls of thickness 100&#8208;250 nm through a template&#8208;assisted framework process. This unique structure endows the COF sponge with a high surface area (1655 m2 g&#8722;1), ultra&#8208;low density (2.2 mg cm&#8722;3), and exceptional mechanical stability. Even after 300,000 compressions at a 50% compression rate, its stress and height decreased by only 7.9% and 7.1%, respectively. These properties also grant the COF sponge excellent solvent absorption capacity, catalytic performance, and reusability. Therefore, this work broadens the development pathway for COF macroscopic objects and is expected to further unlock the potential of COFs in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Reactivity of Unprotected Oximes via Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Dual Copper/Organophotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct N&#9472;O bond fragmentation of free oximes is challenging due to their tendency to engage in other side reaction pathways, which severely restricts their utilization in organic synthesis. To overcome this limitation, a novel strategy is developed for the direct cyclization of unprotected oximes with enals through green&#8208;light&#8208;promoted dual copper/photoredox catalysis. This protocol activates free oximes via single&#8208;electron reduction&#8208;induced N&#9472;O bond fragmentation, enabling facile construction of highly functionalized pyridines, including bioactive and solvatochromic fluorescent molecules.








Abstract
Oximes are widely used precursors in synthetic chemistry due to their broad availability and versatile chemical properties, in which N&#9472;O bond fragmentation represents a key reactivity mode. However, these transformations typically require the use of oxygen&#8208;protected oximes, and a general strategy to directly utilize free oximes remains challenging due to their vulnerability to side reaction pathways, rendering low tendency towards N&#9472;OH bond cleavage. Here a unified platform is reported to achieve direct cyclization of unprotected oximes with enals, as well as other coupling partners through dual copper/organophotoredox catalysis under green light irradiation. This protocol enables concurrent activation of both N&#9472;OH and &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds of free oximes to form multisubstituted pyridines with exceeding structural diversity and functional group tolerance. In this process, Rose Bengal serves as a hydrogen atom transfer agent to generate radical intermediates. In the meanwhile, copper catalyst activates of free oximes via single&#8208;electron reduction&#8208;induced N&#9472;O bond fragmentation and controls the selectivity for intermediate trapping. The synthetic utility of this approach is further demonstrated by its successful applications in late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active compounds and rapid assembly of solvatochromic fluorescent materials.

         <title>First Encapsulation of Organometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet into Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An air&#8208;sensitive DyCp3 (Cp&#8722; = cyclopentadienyl) single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) complex (1) was encapsulated into single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to construct hybrid materials that are resistant to moisture and oxygen. The hybrid materials with independent slow&#8208;magnetic&#8208;relaxing centers are expected to become a key component of the next generation of information process devices based on spintronics. The resilience to moisture and oxygen further broadens its manufacturing methods and application scenarios. Furthermore, upon encapsulation into SWCNTs, DyCp3 exhibited clear ac frequency dependence in the ac magnetic susceptibility at a zero&#8208;dc field. This indicates that the guest molecule's slow magnetic relaxation properties are preserved, which is crucial and necessary to realize SMMs&#8208;based quantum information processing, by allowing a sufficient time window for quantum gate operations. Our result exemplifies that encapsulation of air&#8208;sensitive organometallic SMMs into SWCNTs enhances their chemical stability and their magnetic relaxation time at a zero&#8208;dc magnetic field, which provides a novel method for their further applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling in PtCoIn@Pt Core&#8211;Shell Catalysts for Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the p&#8208;block element indium into PtCo results in a ternary L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst. This integration promotes p&#8208;d orbital coupling, enhancing the ORR activity and durability. Impressively, even after 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, this catalyst preserved its initial mass activity, showing no degradation in an H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell.








Abstract
Pt&#8208;based catalysts are playing increasingly important roles in fuel cells owing to their high catalytic activity. However, harsh electrocatalytic conditions often trigger atomic migration and dissolution in these catalysts, causing rapid performance deterioration. Here, a novel L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst is introduced, where indium (In) is incorporated into a PtCo matrix. This integration promotes p&#8211;d orbital coupling, optimizing the electronic structure of Pt and causing additional lattice strain within PtCo. Impressively, L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt exhibits remarkable activity and durability, with only a 5.1% reduction in mass activity (MA) after 120&#8201;000 potential cycles. In H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells, this cathode achieves a peak power density of 1.99&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and maintains a high MA of 0.73 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V. After enduring 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, the catalyst maintains its initial MA and sustains the cell voltage at 0.8 A cm&#8722;2, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. Theoretical studies highlight the enhancements originating from the modulated electronic structures and shifted d&#8208;band center of Pt induced by In doping and increased vacancy formation energies in Pt and Co atoms, affirming the catalyst's superior durability.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pair Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis Enables Cr&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation of Ketones Using Hydrocarbon Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the allylation of ketones using simple alkenes promoted by a chromocene catalyst and an ion&#8208;pair hydrogen atom transfer (IP&#8208;HAT) catalyst. This catalytic system can be applied to a wide range of ketones, including aliphatic ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance.








Abstract
We report a catalytic allylation of ketones using simple hydrocarbon alkenes, enabled by a synergistic system comprising chromocene and photo&#8208;activatable ion&#8208;pair hydrogen atom transfer (IP&#8208;HAT) catalysts derived from a thiophosphoryl imide and N&#8208;heteroaromatics. This catalyst system generates highly nucleophilic, electron&#8208;rich allylchromium(III) species directly from unactivated alkenes, demonstrating broad applicability to various ketones, including aromatic, aliphatic, and multifunctional ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance. The modular design of the IP&#8208;HAT catalysts allows precise tuning of redox potential and HAT activity, with the enhanced reduction potential of the reduced N&#8208;heteroaromatics catalyst playing a pivotal role in efficiently regenerating the electron&#8208;rich chromocene(II) catalyst.

         <title>Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes Enable High&#8208;Efficiency, Long&#8208;Cycling, and Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Trivalent Antimony Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a concentrated chloride electrolyte to address the Sb3+ hydrolysis issue and achieved highly reversible three&#8208;electron Sb plating chemistry, leading to high efficiency (99.7%&#8211;99.8%), long life (10 months), and dendrite&#8208;free spherical morphology.








Abstract
Aqueous trivalent metal batteries are promising energy storage systems, which can leverage unique three&#8208;electron redox reactions to deliver high capacity and high energy. Among them, antimony (Sb) stands out with a high capacity (660 mAh g&#8722;1), abundant availability, and low cost. However, the severe Sb3+ hydrolysis reaction drastically hinders the development of aqueous antimony batteries. Herein, we address this issue by employing a concentrated lithium chloride electrolyte, which stabilizes reactive Sb3+ ions via forming robust antimony&#8208;chloride complexes. This approach effectively mitigates hydrolysis and achieves highly reversible Sb plating behavior, leading to high efficiency (99.7%&#8211;99.8%), long lifespan (7300 h, 10 months), and uniform spherical deposition morphology. When paired with a manganese dioxide (MnO2) cathode, the Sb&#8214;MnO2 battery demonstrates a high capacity of 309 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability of 50&#160;000 cycles (&#8764;70% retention). Additionally, Sb shows promise as a high&#8208;capacity cathode, which can integrate with low&#8208;potential zinc into novel dual&#8208;metal plating batteries with long cycling life (4,000 h). This work not only deepens our fundamental understanding of trivalent Sb3+ redox chemistry but also opens new opportunities to stabilize hydrolysable and high&#8208;charge&#8208;density cations for multivalent battery applications.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Accelerated Design of High&#8208;Efficient Lithium Adsorbents for Salt Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building on data from previous experiments, we developed a machine learning&#8208;guided screening protocol to rapidly discover efficient doping schemes for aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbents. The recommended doped adsorbent demonstrated a nearly 40% increase in stable adsorption capacity in various brine types, which could significantly advance the Salt Lake&#8208;based lithium extraction industry.








Abstract
The urgent demand for lithium resources has been advancing the development of highly efficient lithium extraction from brines. Aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, as the only one used in the Salt Lake industry, is limited in further improving the extraction efficiency due to the low adsorption capacity. Here, we develop a high&#8208;throughput screening framework via interpretable machine learning (ML) to rapidly determine high&#8208;performance modification strategies for the aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, avoiding the huge workload of traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error doping experiments in view of multiple doping schemes and the unique trade&#8208;off between performance and structural stability. Relying on the recommended modifications, a series of doped adsorbents are prepared and the structure stability and cyclic adsorption performance are verified, which match well with the uncovered correlation between dopant features and adsorption capacity. Experimental validations confirm the screened doped one exhibits an increased stable adsorption capacity by nearly 40% in various types of brine. These results indicate that ML&#8208;accelerated approach can significantly promote the upgrading of lithium resource adsorption industry in Salt Lakes.

         <title>Exploiting Antisite Defects in FeWN2 Nanosheets for Enol Electro&#8208;oxidation Coupled with H2 Evolution at a Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel layered 2D FeWN2 electrocatalyst with a rock&#8208;salt structure and abundant antisite defects is designed to enhance the electrocatalytic upgrading of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). The presence of antisite defects effectively modulates the electronic structure, facilitating the activation of enol groups in AA.








Abstract
Hydrogen production from biomass electro&#8208;oxidation offers a promising alternative to water electrolysis by lowering the anodic oxidation barrier and producing valuable chemicals. However, current biomass electro&#8208;oxidation systems have difficulties in achieving an industrial&#8208;scale current density due to the difficulty in cleaving high&#8208;energy C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bonds. Here, we report a ternary layer nitride FeWN2 electrocatalyst with abundant antisite defects (ASDs), which significantly improves its electrocatalytic performance for ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation. The catalyst works at a remarkable current density of 2.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.69&#160;V (vs RHE) and achieves 4 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.12&#160;V in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer at 60 &#176;C with 100% Faraday efficiency for H2 production. Theoretical calculations reveal that W atoms near antipodal Fe sites replenish the electron density of Fe, maintaining moderate Fe&#8208;DHA adsorption strength induced by ASDs that achieve superior catalytic efficiency for AA&#8208;to&#8208;DHA conversion This study provides new insight for developing high&#8208;performance organic oxidation catalysts with ASDs.

         <title>Integrating Electronic&#8208;Storage Piperazine into Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as potential electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in new environmental&#8208;friendly electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, their catalytic activity is hindered by inefficient electron transfer from electrodes to catalytic sites along extended frameworks. To overcome this bottleneck, herein, we first incorporated redox&#8208;active piperazine units into the COFs to catalyze ORR. The redox&#8208;active piperazine units enable to storage electrons, and thus accelerate the electron transferring to the catalytic sites. Furthermore, the introduction of &#8722;OH group&#8208;containing building blocks induces keto&#8208;enol tautomerism (enabling reversible &#8722;OH / &#8722;C=O interconversion), improving framework polarity with a dipole moment of 6.87 Debye (5.8 times increase compared to non&#8208;hydroxylated COFs). This polarity enhancement strengthens the intermediates binding ability, thereby improving the catalytic activity. As a result, the optimized PD&#8208;COF&#8208;OH exhibits a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76 V, turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.045 s&#8722;1, and electrochemically active surface area of 9.4 mF cm&#8211;2, surpassing most reported metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal synergistic roles of &#8722;OH and &#8722;C=O groups in stabilizing OOH* and OH* intermediates, contributing to the improved catalytic activity. This work establishes a novel design paradigm for catalytic COFs through rational integration of electron reservoir units and tautomerism&#8208;enabled polarity modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>SiO2 Nanoparticles&#8208;Induced Anti&#8208;Freezing Hydrogel Electrolyte Enables Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries with Complete and Reversible Four&#8208;Electron&#8208;Transfer Mechanisms at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries hold significant promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high specific capacities. However, achieving four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms under subzero temperatures remains challenging due to freezing point limitations of conventional aqueous electrolytes and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel electrolyte (HC&#8208;SiO2) is developed through the spontaneous gelation of a high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (1 m Zn(OAc)2 + 21 m LiCl, HC) with SiO2 nanoparticles, enabling low&#8208;temperature operation of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with complete and reversible four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes. Abundant interactions between dispersed SiO2 nanoparticles and cations enlarge ion&#8208;pair distances, reducing close ion&#8208;pair formation and lowering the freezing temperature (&#8208;60.7 &#176;C). Furthermore, the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state hydrogel electrolyte combines advantages of reduced water activity and disrupted hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, effectively suppressing I+ hydrolysis while inhibiting ice nucleation. Additionally, the utilization of low&#8208;concentration Zn(OAc)2 combined with high&#8208;concentration LiCl increases availability of free Cl&#8208; by mitigating strong ionic interaction in conventional ZnCl2&#8208;based concentrated electrolytes, thereby enhancing reaction kinetics of the I2/I+ conversion. Benefiting from synergistic manipulation of ionic interaction, water activity and Cl&#8208; activity, the HC&#8208;SiO2 hydrogel achieves a high capacity of 490.9 mAh g&#8208;1 and durable lifespan exceeding 11,000 cycles at &#8208;20 &#176;C. These findings offer valuable insights for advancing practical low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.</dc:description>

However, achieving four-electron-transfer mechanisms under subzero temperatures remains challenging due to freezing point limitations of conventional aqueous electrolytes and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an anti-freezing hydrogel electrolyte (HC-SiO2) is developed through the spontaneous gelation of a high-concentration electrolyte (1 m Zn(OAc)2 + 21 m LiCl, HC) with SiO2 nanoparticles, enabling low-temperature operation of quasi-solid-state Zn-I2 batteries with complete and reversible four-electron-transfer processes. Abundant interactions between dispersed SiO2 nanoparticles and cations enlarge ion-pair distances, reducing close ion-pair formation and lowering the freezing temperature (-60.7 &#176;C). Furthermore, the quasi-solid-state hydrogel electrolyte combines advantages of reduced water activity and disrupted hydrogen-bond networks, effectively suppressing I+ hydrolysis while inhibiting ice nucleation. Additionally, the utilization of low-concentration Zn(OAc)2 combined with high-concentration LiCl increases availability of free Cl- by mitigating strong ionic interaction in conventional ZnCl2-based concentrated electrolytes, thereby enhancing reaction kinetics of the I2/I+ conversion. Benefiting from synergistic manipulation of ionic interaction, water activity and Cl- activity, the HC-SiO2 hydrogel achieves a high capacity of 490.9 mAh g-1 and durable lifespan exceeding 11,000 cycles at -20 &#176;C.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Dipole Coupling Ion&#8208;Dipole Engineering Induced Rational Solvation&#8208;Desolvation Behavior for Constructing Stable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with high ionic conductivity, a wide voltage window, and an ultra&#8208;stability electrolyte/electrode interface are essential for practical applications of solid lithium&#8208;metal batteries but particularly challenging. The key to overcoming these long&#8208;term obstacles lies in the rational design of the Li+ solvation&#8208;desolvation behavior in SPEs. Herein, we propose an electric&#8208;dipole coupling ion&#8208;dipole strategy to modulate the  Li+ solvation structure and enhance Li+ desolvation kinetics. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the free solvents and FSI&#8722; are anchored by ion&#8208;dipole interactions, which facilitate the transfer of Li+ and obtain a wide electrochemical stability window. Coupling the electric&#8208;dipole interactions that promote lithium salt dissociation and rapid ion desolvation contributes to obtaining more mobile Li+ and realizing an inorganic&#8208;rich electrolyte/electrode interface. Benefiting from the above benefits, the assembled lithium symmetric cells and the full cells demonstrate ultra&#8208;long cycling life. More importantly, full cells with high&#8208;loading cathodes (LiFePO4 with 11.25 mg cm&#8722;2, NCM811 with 7.84 mg cm&#8722;2) and pouch cell still display stable cycling.This research gives valuable insights into regulating the solvation&#8208;desolvation behavior in SPEs and facilitates the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Structural Design in Cobaloxime&#8208;Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks to Facilitate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular hybrid composed of a cobaloxime complex and a covalent organic framework (COF) that achieves photocatalytic overall water splitting. The designed COF features ternary units and dual linkages, which induce asymmetric linkers. Upon photoexcitation, this asymmetry facilitates directed electron transfer and spatially separated redox sites, resulting in a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state. Consequently, the COF, hydrogen&#8208;bonded with cobaloxime as an H2 production cocatalyst, enables visible&#8208;light photocatalytic overall water splitting, simultaneously producing H2 and H2O2, outperforming the COFs with symmetric linker structures. This strategy of asymmetric structural design offers new insights for the design of photocatalysts with suppressed charge recombination for photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries are prospective on energy storage, yet the practical application is severely hindered by side reactions of Zn metal and the shuttle effects for polyiodide. Herein, a polymer additive PVEMA was copolymerized by 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (VEImOTf) and methacrylamide (MAAm) to alleviate the above issues. The polymer chain of PVEMA endows amphipathic properties for Zn2+ diffusion and solvation structure regulation, and the &#945;&#8208;methyl of MAAm enhances the hydrophobic properties to avoid side reactions on Zn metal. In addition, the imidazole groups adsorb onto Zn metal with electrostatic shielding effect for further side reaction alleviation, and mitigate shuttle effects by electrostatic interactions with polyiodides. Consequently, the PVEMA confers the symmetrical Zn battery with great cycling stability for over 400 h at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 and high depth of discharge (DOD) of 77.7%. The Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with PVEMA also demonstrate stable cycling performance under various current densities and temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Titanium Silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) Catalyst with Abundant Active Ti&#8208;VI Species for Efficient Conversion of Ethylene to Glycol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot synthesis of glycol from ethylene and H2O2 is simple and environmentally friendly, making it a potential alternative for glycol production. The key to the success of this is to have a bifunctional catalyst with both oxidative activity for ethylene in the presence of H2O2 and acidic centers for the subsequent hydration of ethylene oxide. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;chemical post&#8208;treatment regime to introduce acid centers in TS&#8208;1 while simultaneously improve the oxidative activity. The study shows that the combined tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) + (NH4)2CO3 post&#8208;treatment not only produces abundant Ti(OSi)2(OH)4 (Ti&#8208;VI) species from Ti(OSi)4, but also creates numerous internal cavities within crystals of the post&#8208;treated TS&#8208;1. Ti&#8208;VI possesses both high oxidative activity and acidic sites. The presence of internal cavities within TS&#8208;1 crystals enhances the diffusion on the catalyst as well as increases the accessibility of Ti&#8208;VI species. Consequently, when applied as a catalyst, the combined&#8208;treated TS&#8208;1 demonstrates an outstanding catalytic performance, achieving 98.6% conversion of H2O2 and 99.8% selectivity of EG, which is nearly 2 times of the conventional TS&#8208;1. This study also unveils the formation mechanism of Ti&#8208;VI during the post&#8208;treatment.</dc:description>
