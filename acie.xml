         <title>Amino Acid Platform for Poly(amino ester)s: Controlled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization, Complete Recyclability, and Tunable Polymerizability/Depolymerizability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A readily available and versatile platform for bio&#8208;based poly(amino ester)s were developed through ring&#8208;opening polymerization of azalactone monomers with precisely tailored ring size, substituents, and steric bulk, by a simple two&#8208;step process from amino acids and epoxides. Systematical investigation of the effect of azalactone structure on thermodynamics, kinetics and recyclability demonstrated the structure&#8208;activity relationship. 








Abstract
Poly(amino ester) (PAE) is a class of polyesters featuring backbone tertiary amines and ester bonds, combining biodegradability with tunable functionality for diverse applications. However, developing a versatile platform for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of diverse monomers to build PAE libraries remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a readily available and versatile platform for synthesizing diverse PAEs from amino acids. A series of azalactone monomers were synthesized in a simple two&#8208;step process from renewable amino acids and diverse epoxides, allowing monomers with tailored ring size, substituents, and steric bulk. The azalactone monomers underwent organocatalytic controlled ROP. We systematically investigated the effect of monomer structures, including N&#8208;substituents, lactone core substituents, stereoconfiguration and ring size, on ROP reactivity. All resulting PAEs could be depolymerized into their initial monomers in quantitative yield, exhibiting first&#8208;order kinetics. The depolymerization rate constants showed an inverse correlation with the corresponding polymerization rate constants. Thermodynamics, kinetics and recyclability studies revealed that changing the azalactone structure could regulate their ceiling temperature (&#8722;20 &#8764; 37&#160;&#176;C, 1.0&#160;mol L&#8722;1), thus adjusting the polymerizability and depolymerizability. This work offers valuable insights into the design of azalactone monomer libraries, the synthesis of PAEs, and the structure&#8208;activity relationships governing polymerization and depolymerization behavior.

         <title>Structurally Asymmetric Nonplanar &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Naphthoquinone Derivatives Modified from Natural Lawsone for High&#8208;Stability Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By implementing a nonplanar &#960;&#8208;conjugation strategy, the natural lawsone molecule is optimized to suppress the enol&#8208;keto tautomerization pathway, leading to enhanced stability in aqueous organic redox flow batteries. The results demonstrate that rational tuning of conjugated electronic structures in natural derivatives enables the development of electrochemically robust and sustainable energy storage materials.








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have attracted growing interest for grid&#8208;scale energy storage by reducing reliance on scarce mineral resources used in transition metal&#8208;based systems. Natural naphthoquinone derivatives, while environmentally friendly and abundant, suffer from poor solubility and electrochemical instability, hindering their practical use in AORFBs. To address these challenges, we report the functionalization of a naturally abundant dye, lawsone (i.e., 2&#8208;HNQ), through non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension and asymmetric intramolecular charge distribution, yielding a non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated polar naphthoquinone derivative (namely BANQ) with enhanced water solubility and redox reversibility. Computational simulations and spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the introduction of benzoic acid group imparts a polar &#960;&#8208;conjugation extended structure with asymmetric charge distribution. This structural modification efficiently enhances aqueous solubility and suppresses degradation pathways, such as Michael addition and irreversible keto&#8208;enol tautomerism. Compared with 2&#8208;HNQ precursor, BANQ exhibits lower sensitivity to nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks. The BANQ anolyte exhibited a very low&#8208;capacity decay rate of merely 0.00018% per cycle (or 0.045% per day), representing a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction compared to that of 2&#8208;HNQ (0.032% per cycle or 8.22% per day). This study highlights the potential of modifying natural&#8208;derived products with rationally designed conjugated electron structure for green and sustainable energy storage solutions.

         <title>Mesoporous Engineering of Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Industry&#8208;Level Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Membrane Electrode Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a two&#8208;step space&#8208;confinement pyrolysis strategy for the mesoporous engineering of Ni&#8208;NC catalysts. We demonstrated that the mesoporous structures of M&#8208;NC catalysts enable higher active site accessibility and improved mass transport ability compared to the microporous structure. More importantly, we also found that the pore structure engineering was able to enhance the long&#8208;term stability of the M&#8208;NC catalyst for CO2RR in MEA.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metals anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon have emerged as highly promising electrocatalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO. However, their industrial&#8208;scale application in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) is limited by inadequate Faraday efficiency (FE) and long&#8208;term stability. Herein, we propose a rational mesoporous engineering approach for Ni&#8208;NC catalysts via a two&#8208;step space&#8208;confinement pyrolysis strategy. Through cryo CO&#8208;pulse chemisorption, real&#8208;time observations of CO2 gas bubble diffusion, and finite element simulations, we demonstrate that the mesoporous structured Ni&#8208;NC (meso&#8208;Ni&#8208;NC) exhibits significantly enhanced active site accessibility and mass transport capabilities compared to microporous structured Ni&#8208;NC (micro&#8208;Ni&#8208;NC). More importantly, the mesoporous engineering enhances the internal gas&#8208;holding capacity of the catalytic layer, effectively mitigating flooding and salt deposition and thus enhancing the catalyst's long&#8208;term stability. Consequently, meso&#8208;Ni&#8208;NC achieves an industrially relevant CO partial current density of 291.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 97.3% CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO), along with stable operation for 136 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 while maintaining FECO exceeding 90% in an MEA, outperforming those of micro&#8208;Ni&#8208;NC and representing an advancement over existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts. This work highlights the critical role of pore structure in determining the performance of industry&#8208;level electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Nanocrystalline Sn for Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Stereocontrolled Oxime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative photoelectrocatalytic system was proposed to convert nitrite (NO2&#8722;) directly into high&#8208;value Z&#8208;oximes for the first time. The porous nanocrystalline Sn&#8211;C electrocatalyst exhibited rapid kinetics for *NH2OH production in weakly acid electrolyte, which rapidly coupled with aldehydes and generate Z&#8208;oximes via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanisms assisted by photocatalysts. This establishes a novel framework for stereoselective oximes synthesis through green chemistry.








Abstract
Oximes (including E/Z configurations) stand as pivotal intermediates in the synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals, with Z&#8208;configured oximes garnering significant attention owing to their distinctive pharmacological activities and specialized applications. However, the construction of thermodynamically labile Z&#8208;oximes remains formidable challenges, characterized by inherent kinetic barriers and rigorous reaction conditions. Herein, we pioneeringly develop a photoelectromediated method for synthesizing Z&#8208;oxime from nitrite and aldehyde for the first time, avoiding involving unstable hydroxylamine reagents and corrosive concentrated hydrochloric acid. Predominantly E&#8208;configuration benzaldoxime (Z:E&#160;=&#160;0.08) was obtained in the electrocatalytic system. Notably, after introducing photomediated energy transfer (EnT), the ratio of Z:E&#8208;configuration has increased to 13 times (1.06)&#160;with a well&#8208;designed porous nanocrystalline Sn in carbon nanotubes (Sn&#8211;C). The mechanism study reveals that the Sn&#8211;C presented a fast kinetic of *NH2OH production, which rapidly coupled with benzaldehyde to form E&#8208;oxime, then following a triplet&#8208;triplet EnT mechanism to generate Z&#8208;benzaldoxime under the assistant of photocatalyst. This study provides a sustainable synthetic protocol for oximes characterized by notable green chemistry attributes, while establishing an innovative stereoselective synthetic framework that addresses long&#8208;standing challenges in the precise control of oxime E/Z isomerism. This work thereby may advance both the fundamental understanding of oxime chemistry and its practical applications in pharmaceutical synthesis.

This study provides a sustainable synthetic protocol for oximes characterized by notable green chemistry attributes, while establishing an innovative stereoselective synthetic framework that addresses long-standing challenges in the precise control of oxime &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomerism. This work thereby may advance both the fundamental understanding of oxime chemistry and its practical applications in pharmaceutical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multilayer Sulfide&#8208;Electrolyte Engineering Stabilizes Interfaces for Long&#8208;Cycling, Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8211;Organic Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

An Li6PS5Cl&#8211;Li10GeP2S12&#8211;Li6PS5Cl (LPSC&#8211;LGPS&#8211;LPSC) trilayer electrolyte stabilizes the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase in lithium&#8211;organic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSOLBs), attenuating interfacial degradation and suppressing dendritic intrusion to enable durable high&#8208;rate cycling and reliable operation from 0 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Interfacial instability remains a key barrier for sulfide electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;organic batteries (ASSLOBs). While prior efforts have mainly focused on improving chemical compatibility between active materials and electrolytes, the role of mechanical stress in interfacial degradation has been largely overlooked. Here, we report dibenzo[b,i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraone (DTT) as a conductive organic cathode integrated with a Li6PS5Cl (LPSC)&#8208;Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS)&#8208;Li6PS5Cl trilayer electrolyte and a lithium metal anode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), operando pressure monitoring, and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy coupled with distribution of relaxation times (EIS&#8208;DRT) reveal that the trilayer design effectively mitigates stress accumulation and suppresses interfacial degradation, while cross&#8208;sectional backscattered scanning electron microscopy (BSEM) and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirm superior structural integrity. Benefiting from this architecture, the ASSLOB delivers 296&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 (0.1C) with remarkable long&#8208;term stability (90.2% retention after 4800 cycles at 2&#160;C, 60&#160;&#176;C), together with excellent low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;loading performance, representing the best results reported for ASSOLBs using lithium anode. Our work establishes electrolyte architecture engineering as a versatile strategy to achieve high&#8208;rate, durable, and temperature&#8208;resilient solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Monolayers on Nickel, Iron, and Steel by a Radical&#8208;to&#8208;Carbene Strategy</title>

Radical&#8208;to&#8208;carbene conversion on non&#8208;noble metals. We present an electrografting strategy enabling NHC monolayer formation on naturally oxidized Ni, Fe, and stainless steel surfaces.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have recently emerged as the next&#8208;generation surface ligands with improved stability and molecular flexibility. Despite these premises, research on NHC&#8208;enriched flat surfaces is mainly limited to noble metals, while formation of free NHCs often requires the use of vacuum, bases, or strictly air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;free conditions. We hereby report an unprecedented radical&#8208;to&#8208;carbene&#8208;based approach for fabricating NHC monolayers on earth&#8208;abundant and naturally oxidized metal surfaces of nickel, iron, and stainless steel. Following an open&#8208;cell electrografting approach, 2&#8208;azolyl radicals are firstly formed and immobilized on the metal to then rearrange into NHC monolayers apparently composed of flat&#8208;lying NHCs, as corroborated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS), sum&#8208;frequency generation (SFG), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations highlighted the role of metal adatoms in facilitating the radical&#8208;to&#8208;carbene transition. A surface stability test was conducted to assess the tolerance of the NHC&#8208;enriched surfaces toward physical, chemical, and electrochemical stress. Ultimately, this work expands the application field of carbenes&#8208;on&#8208;surfaces to cost&#8208;effective and widely used materials, while offering an agile and, until now, mechanistically unknown approach to their generation.

         <title>Amphiphilic Reactive Interfaces Enable Controlled Synthesis of Mesoscopic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel strategy to construct multifunctional emulsion interfaces via spontaneous self&#8208;assembly of amphiphic moiety derived from Schiff base reactions, which serves as a robust platform to synthesize mesoporous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with tunable mesoscopic architectures and pore sizes (17&#8211;40&#160;nm) beyond their intrinsic limitations.








Abstract
Interfaces serve as powerful, versatile platforms that have significantly advanced the development of novel materials. However, bottom&#8208;up construction of reactive interfaces for controlled synthesis of crystalline porous materials still remains a substantial challenge. Here, we constructed a stable, morphology&#8208;tunable reactive interface by spontaneous self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic moiety derived from Schiff base reactions, featuring the surfactant&#8208;free stabilization and versatile interface morphology readily adjusted by hydrophobic chain length (C4&#8211;C12) of aliphatic amines. Such interface confinement lowers nucleation barriers while the localized monomer enrichment speeds reactions, thus enabling a mild, facile, and controlled synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse mesoscopic architectures (spherical/ribbon/sheet). Further introducing colloidal SiO2 nanospheres on the interfaces can co&#8208;assemble and form stable nanoscale Pickering emulsions, yielding hierarchical porous COFs with tunable, large mesopores (17&#8208;40&#160;nm) beyond the intrinsic pore size limitation. The resulting asymmetric hemispherical hollow mCOFPEA (BET surface area of 561.9 m2 g&#8722;1) as a potential iodine host (30.18&#160;wt.% loading) delivered remarkable electrochemical performance with an initial capacity of 202.9 mAh g&#8722;1 (96.16% of theoretical value) and retained 132.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2500 cycles, profited from their mesoporosity and asymmetric morphology with an increased surface area, exposed more active sites and enhanced ion transport ability.

         <title>Yb&#8208;Doped Cu&#8208;Based Catalyst Boosting Electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ Reduction Across pH Range at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized ytterbium (Yb)&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;based catalysts that exhibited high C2+ selectivity (&gt;77%) across a broad pH range at ampere&#8208;level current densities for CO2 reduction reaction. Electrochemical in situ Raman and infrared spectroscopy revealed that Yb doping stabilizes the Cu+ species and enhances *CO adsorption on Cu terrace sites, thereby promoting the C&#9472;C coupling.








Abstract
Efficient electrochemical conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products remains significant challenges, particularly under broad pH ranges and high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions. Herein, we report ampere&#8208;level CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ electroreduction with exceptional efficiency across a wide pH range using ytterbium&#8208;doped CuOx catalysts. The catalyst achieves Faradaic efficiency of 87&#160;&#177;&#160;2%, 77&#160;&#177;&#160;1%, and 78&#160;&#177;&#160;1% under alkaline, neutral, and acidic conditions, respectively. Electrochemical in situ infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy reveal that Yb&#8208;stabilizing Cu+ species and enriching *CO on Cu terrace sites are two critical factors for enhancing C&#9472;C coupling. This work not only develops a highly efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable C2+ production, but also establishes a doping strategy for stabilizing active sites and optimizing *CO adsorption configurations.

         <title>Steering Pulsed Electrochemistry Selectivity Toward Singlet Oxygen via Dynamic Intermediate Management</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanotip architecture provided a spatial foundation for concentrating and stabilizing the *OOH intermediate, while the pulsed potential offered the dynamic regulation of *OOH and supplied the energy for its recombination. This synergy effectively bypassed the rate&#8208;limiting *OOH desorption step, unlocking a highly selective and energy&#8208;efficient pathway for electrocatalytic 1O2 production. 








Abstract
The electrocatalytic generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) from molecular oxygen activation offers a green and selective route for water decontamination. However, its practical application is fundamentally constrained by the sluggish desorption of key *OOH intermediates, leading to a pervasive &#8220;selectivity&#8208;efficiency&#8221; trade&#8208;off. Herein, we design a pulse excitation electrocatalytic system based on a copper electrode featuring tailored nanotip architecture (Cu&#8208;T) that synergistically integrates spatial electric field enhancement with dynamic potential control. Under optimized pulsed operation, the system achieves exceptional 1O2 selectivity (&gt;90%) and oxygen conversion efficiency (&gt;73%), significantly outperforming conventional potentiostatic methods. In situ spectroscopic analyses and multiphysics simulations reveal that the pulsed protocol coupling with tip effect promotes O2 adsorption, stabilizes key *OOH intermediates, and facilitates their recombination into 1O2, thereby bypassing the rate&#8208;limiting *OOH desorption step. The system also demonstrates broad applicability across diverse organic pollutants and complex water matrices, alongside robust stability in continuous&#8208;flow operation. This work establishes a general spatiotemporal strategy to steer electrocatalytic pathways toward highly selective and energy&#8208;efficient O2 activation.

         <title>Conjugated Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Polymers with p&#8208;Block Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of various p&#8208;block element motifs on the photophysical properties of conjugated inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid polymers is surveyed regarding applications in organic electronics. Recent advances in the use of heavier elements as well as heavier multiple bonds and the development of diverse (post&#8208;)functionalization strategies suggest ample scope for exciting future developments.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers with small band gaps and the ensuing semiconductivity are increasingly used as active layers in organic electronics. In order to achieve purpose&#8208;built polymers with specific band gaps and optimized charge transport properties, covalent doping with inorganic main group heteroelements has proven to be a promising strategy during the past 20 years. This review highlights recent advances in the introduction of single heteroatoms of Group 13 to 15 into the organic conjugated main chain of such hybrid polymers, with a particular focus on the fine&#8208;tuning of the photophysical properties for applications in electronic devices. The emerging field of polymers containing p&#8208;block multiple bonds is covered in the second part, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of research in the arena of conjugated polymers incorporating main group motifs in the main chain. The electronic and structural properties are significantly altered by the interaction at the inorganic&#8208;organic interface and can be optimized using regio&#8208; or stereoisomers and targeted post&#8208;functionalization. A general trend toward the heavier elements is evident, pushing the door wide open to a vast uncharted terrain with huge potential for further developments in inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid polymers for electronics and sensing materials with advanced properties.

         <title>Electrooxidative Divergent Halocyclizations of Ambident Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrooxidation enables tunable halocyclization of ambident amides, yielding either C&#8211;O or C&#8211;N products through ionic or radical pathways, respectively. While detailed experimental and analytical mechanistic studies highlight mode&#8208;dependent selectivity, in silico experimentation provided insight into the energetic origin of this divergence.








Abstract
Herein, we report a divergent electrochemical halocyclization of ambident amides that enables selective formation of either C&#8211;O or C&#8211;N bonds. Unique chemoselectivity is governed by anodic oxidation conditions, in which haliranium&#8208;mediated C&#8211;O bond formation proceeds via chloride oxidation, while amidyl radicals guide C&#8211;N bond formation under basic conditions. Various approaches to understanding reaction mechanisms have been performed, including cyclic voltammetric analyses, experimental kinetic studies, and in silico experimentation. The developed electrooxidative synthetic method offers broad functional group tolerance, highlighting electrochemistry as a powerful tool for selective halocyclization.

         <title>Advancing Structure Elucidation with a Flexible Multi&#8208;Spectral AI Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MultiModalSpectralTransformer (MMST) is an automated tool that helps identify molecular structures by combining different spectroscopic methods, including 2D and 1D NMR, IR, and MS, within a unified AI framework. Trained on 4 million simulated compounds, MMST achieves 72% top&#8208;1 accuracy in molecular identification and adapts to new chemical spaces through an innovative improvement cycle, bridging simulated and experimental data.








Abstract
Validating chemical synthesis success requires confirming the desired product using various analytical techniques. While spectroscopic data collection is increasingly automated, interpreting results remains a major bottleneck, often requiring expert input. With advances in laboratory automation and high&#8208;throughput synthesis, this challenge is expected to intensify. We introduce the MultiModalSpectralTransformer (MMST), a machine learning method that predicts chemical structures directly from diverse spectral data (NMR, IR, and MS). Trained on 4 million simulated compounds, MMST achieves 72% and 80% as top&#8208;1 and top&#8208;3 accuracy, respectively. To address out&#8208;of&#8208;distribution challenges, we implemented an active learning improvement cycle that generates molecules in similar chemical spaces, enabling the model to adapt to chemical structures beyond its original training data. We demonstrate MMST's capabilities through comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular weight ranges and chemical spaces. Notably, despite training solely on simulated data, MMST demonstrates good performance with experimental spectra. This research represents a significant advancement in automated structure elucidation, offering a powerful and adaptable tool that bridges the gap between simulated and real&#8208;world data.

         <title>Chemoenzymatically Synthesized O&#8208;Acetylated GD3 Gangliosides to Examine Viral Receptor Specificities in a Cellular Context</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
7&#8208;O&#8208;, 9&#8208;O&#8208;, and 7,9&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated GD3 gangliosides can be prepared by chemical assembly of a tetrasaccharide as &#945;&#8208;glycosyl fluoride that is coupled to sphingosine using a glycosynthase, followed by O&#8208;acetyl editing by coronaviral hemagglutinin&#8208;esterases (HEs). Cell surface remodeling of erythrocytes using the GD3 derivatives provides a tool to examine viral receptor specificities.








Abstract
Gangliosides are a class of sialic acid&#8208;containing glycosphingolipids involved in a wide range of biological processes. The terminal sialic acid of gangliosides can be O&#8208;acetylated at C7 and/or C9 hydroxyl, contributing to ganglioside structural complexity and function. It has been difficult to obtain panels of structurally well&#8208;defined O&#8208;acetylated gangliosides for binding and functional studies. We describe here a chemoenzymatic strategy that can provide, for the first time, 7&#8208;O&#8208;, 9&#8208;O&#8208;, and 7,9&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated GD3 gangliosides. It is based on the chemical assembly of a common tetrasaccharide precursor as &#945;&#8208;glycosyl fluoride that is coupled to sphingosine by a glycosynthase, followed by O&#8208;acetyl editing by coronaviral hemagglutinin&#8208;esterases (HEs). The resulting synthetic glycosphingolipids have been employed for cell surface remodeling of erythrocytes. Analysis by liquid chromatography and ion mobility mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;IM&#8208;MS) demonstrated successful integration of the glycosphingolipids into the plasma membrane with preservation of acetyl ester patterns. Using human coronavirus HKU1 spike&#8208;functionalized virus&#8208;like particles, we demonstrate that the resulting glycan&#8208;remodeled erythrocytes can be utilized in hemagglutination (HA) studies as a label&#8208;free method to investigate viral protein binding to individual glycoforms in a cellular environment.

It is based on the chemical assembly of a common tetrasaccharide precursor as &#945;-glycosyl fluoride that is coupled to sphingosine by a glycosynthase, followed by &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl editing by coronaviral hemagglutinin-esterases (HEs). The resulting synthetic glycosphingolipids have been employed for cell surface remodeling of erythrocytes. Analysis by liquid chromatography and ion mobility mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS) demonstrated successful integration of the glycosphingolipids into the plasma membrane with preservation of acetyl ester patterns. Using human coronavirus HKU1 spike-functionalized virus-like particles, we demonstrate that the resulting glycan-remodeled erythrocytes can be utilized in hemagglutination (HA) studies as a label-free method to investigate viral protein binding to individual glycoforms in a cellular environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semi&#8208;Synthesis of Immunogenic Mycobacterial Lipoproteins via Aryl Selenoester&#8208;Mediated Expressed Protein Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes a powerful semi&#8208;synthetic strategy for producing native lipoproteins using peptide selenoesters. Two mycobacterial lipoproteins, LprA and Mpt83, were generated through this method and shown to activate Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 and activate immune responses. The aryl selenoester&#8208;mediated expressed protein ligation method reported here offers a general platform for generating homogeneous lipoproteins in the future.








Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains one of the most prevalent infectious diseases worldwide. Despite decades of dedicated efforts to develop effective prevention strategies, including vaccines, TB continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. Beyond the Bacille Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) vaccine, limited progress has been made to develop more effective TB vaccines. A better understanding of the immunomodulatory roles of key Mtb protein virulence factors is therefore needed for the development of more efficacious protein&#8208;based vaccine candidates. Herein, we report a highly efficient method for the semi&#8208;synthesis of two native mycobacterial lipoproteins and glycolipoproteins, LprA and Mpt83, respectively. Capitalising on the enhanced reactivity of peptide selenoesters as acyl donors, the 21&#8211;23&#160;kDa homogeneously lipidated proteins could be generated in a single ligation step. The homogeneous mycobacterial lipoprotein and glycolipoprotein molecules were shown to be agonists of Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2) and led to the potent induction of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in cells. Taken together, this work presents a robust semi&#8208;synthetic platform for accessing lipoproteins involved in host&#8211;pathogen interactions that can help guide future TB vaccine design.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Transfer Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation Enables Regiodivergent, Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a fluoride&#8208;transfer asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) in which all reagent atoms, including the leaving group, are incorporated into the products. This atom&#8208;efficient AAA protocol enables the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of allyl fluorides and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, providing a catalyst&#8208;controlled, regiodivergent, and stereoselective access to trifluoromethylated homoallylic scaffolds.








Abstract
Asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) is a widely used strategy for stereoselective formation of C&#9472;C bonds. Yet, conventional methods often exhibit poor atom economy as the leaving group is generally wasted. Herein, we report a fluoride&#8208;transfer asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) in which all the atoms of the reagents are incorporated into the final products. The catalytic platform enables regiodivergent, stereoselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of allyl fluorides and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, where the regiochemical outcome is directed by the selective catalytic activation of one or the other electrophilic partner. The resulting atom&#8208;efficient AAA protocol provides a regiocontrollable access to homoallylic trifluoromethylated compounds from a common set of electrophilic starting materials.

         <title>Predicting the Stability of Base&#8208;mediated C&#9472;H Carboxylation Adducts Using Data Science Tools</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational approach integrating quantum chemistry and machine learning enables the prediction of CO2&#8211;adduct stability. Model interpretability and experimental validation highlight its utility for designing base&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H carboxylation reactions.








Abstract
Base&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H carboxylation is a versatile pathway for utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a C1 building block in organic synthesis. However, CO2 constitutes a notorious thermodynamic sink, which restricts this approach to activated or intrinsically reactive nucleophiles. To qualitatively assess the stability of CO2 adducts, we present a computational approach that integrates quantum chemistry with statistical modeling to build a predictive workflow. The target property is the CO2 affinity, specifically the negative Gibbs free reaction energy. This predictive workflow has been applied to 60 novel carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles, suggesting reactions that yield stable carboxylation adducts. The results have been validated through experimental methods for five carbanions, which include three stable and two unstable adducts in DMSO according to our predictions. In addition, we examined two further carbanions that were suggested to form stable CO2 adducts in DMSO, to further assess the experimental protocol and broaden its scope to structurally distinct motifs.

         <title>Organosulfur&#8208;Rich Porous Carbon Cathode Enables Soluble&#8208;Polysulfide&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organosulfur&#8208;rich porous carbon (OSPC) is fabricated via&#160;sulfur&#8208;assisted pyrolysis of low&#8208;cost polymers, creating a conductive carbon skeleton with covalently bonded short&#8208;chain sulfur species and well&#8208;developed microporosity. This structure facilitates efficient ion and electron transport while preventing soluble polysulfide formation. Consequently, OSPC exhibits excellent cycling stability (77% retention after 500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1), demonstrating enhanced sulfur utilization and redox kinetics to overcome traditional sulfur cathode limitations.








Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8211;S) batteries are emerging as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage, owing to their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the severe polysulfide shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of sulfur cathodes remain critical barriers to their practical application. Herein, a class of organosulfur&#8208;rich porous carbon (OSPC) has been developed as a high&#8208;performance cathode for soluble&#8208;polysulfide&#8208;free and high&#8208;rate K&#8211;S batteries. The as&#8208;constructed OSPC achieves molecular&#8208;scale confinement of sulfur species within the carbon skeleton via covalent bonding, which enables solid&#8211;solid sulfur redox pathways without generation of electrolyte&#8208;soluble polysulfides. Moreover, the conductive carbon skeleton of OSPC with well&#8208;developed porosity can facilitate potassium ion and electron transport within the bulk cathode and significantly improve sulfur redox kinetics. Benefiting from these integrated merits, excellent high rate capability (240.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 based on the mass of OSPC), long&#8208;term cycling stability (77% retention after 500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1), and remarkable areal capacity (4.5 mAh cm&#8722;2) can be achieved for the OSPC cathodes. Additionally, the feasibility of synthesizing OSPC from real&#8208;world waste plastics is demonstrated, which offers a dual benefit of alleviating plastic pollution and enabling the fabrication of low&#8208;cost yet high&#8208;performance cathodes for K&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Quantifying Effective Dehydrated Ion Sizes Based on Pore&#8208;Ion Steric Properties to Predict Separation Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlation relationship between ion trans&#8208;membrane energy barriers and physical pore&#8208;ion parameters was established. The diffusion rates linked to the effective dehydration radius were successfully proved to predict the separation ratio between alkali&#8208;metal ions, indicating the crucial role of hydration structure changes in controlling the ion trans&#8208;membrane process.








Abstract
Designing selective membranes for sieving specific solutes requires a deep understanding of fundamental structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationships, in which ion hydration properties under nanoconfined environment are the pivot for nanofiltration (NF) models and high&#8208;performance membrane synthesis. Herein, four nanochannels of similar components and structures but various sizes were constructed, and the transport manners of typical cations were tested for analyzing the effects of size&#8208;related dehydration process. Notably, dehydration extent reversed the ion transport rates in the nanochannels, while the trans&#8208;membrane energy barrier increased until a plateau was reached with the shrinkage of pore sizes, where the transformation from dehydration to deformation occurred in ion partitioning into the membrane pores as evidenced by theoretical calculations. Through quantitatively assessing sieving&#8208;related features of channels and cations, a correlation relationship between trans&#8208;membrane energy barriers and physical pore&#8208;ion parameters was obtained and then effective dehydrated sizes were calculated accordingly for replacing Stokes radius in diffusion description models. The diffusion rates linked to the effective radius were successfully proved to predict the separation ratio between alkali&#8208;metal ions, indicating the crucial role of hydration structure changes in controlling the ion trans&#8208;membrane process.

         <title>From Data to Physics: An Agentic Large Language Model Solves a Competitive Adsorption Puzzle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that an agentic large language model (LLM) (OpenAI o3 with deep research) can autonomously reason, write code, and iteratively refine hypotheses to derive a physically interpretable equation for competitive adsorption on metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs)&#8212;an open problem our lab had struggled with for months. In a single 29&#8208;min session, o3 formulated the governing equations, generated fitting scripts, diagnosed shortcomings, and produced a compact three&#8208;parameter model that quantitatively matches experiments across a dozen carboxylic acids.








Abstract
Scientific modeling often requires navigating a trade&#8208;off between physical interpretability and empirical accuracy&#8212;a task that can take weeks of iteration, especially in systems with partial observability, structural complexity, and experimental errors. Here, we show how an agentic reasoning&#8208;and&#8208;coding large language model (LLM), OpenAI o3, autonomously solved a modeling challenge in surface chemistry that puzzled us for months: quantifying the competitive adsorption of carboxylic acids on metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs). With experimental data and a concise problem formulation, o3 rapidly formulated a physically grounded adsorption model, derived the mathematical equations, implemented the corresponding codes to fit the experimental data, revised its assumptions, and ultimately derived a competitive adsorption model with three parameters that matched experimental data across more than a dozen tested molecules. The resulting model&#8212;simple, mechanistically transparent, and quantitatively robust&#8212;incorporates both classical Langmuir competition and structural constraints such as site accessibility. Beyond addressing this particular challenge, our findings highlight a transformative shift in scientific methodology: from manual trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches to AI&#8208;driven hypothesis generation and model refinement. This represents a new paradigm in research, wherein language models surpass the traditional roles of machine learning in data analysis and computational support, actively participating in scientific reasoning and hypothesis development.

         <title>Switchable Phenanthroline&#8208;Cu Catalysts for Enantioselective Alkynylation and Amination of Cyclic Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformationally switchable chiral phenanthroline&#8208;Cu catalysts have been developed for the enantioselective ring&#8208;opening alkynylation and amination of cyclic diaryliodoniums. A broad range of axially chiral biaryls bearing either an alkynyl substituent or an amide/oxalamide group were synthesized in good to excellent yield (up to 99%), with excellent regio&#8208; (up to&#160;&gt;99:1) and enantioselectivity (up to 99.5:0.5 enantiomeric ratio [er]).

Mechanistic studies revealed that the ion&#8208;pairing interaction between the deprotonated phenolic hydroxy group within the ligand and the cyclic diaryliodonium cation played a significant role in controlling the enantioselectivity of the alkynylation reaction. In contrast, the switched conformation of the chiral phenanthroline&#8208;Cu catalyst was found to be crucial to the high enantioselectivity obtained in the amination reaction.

         <title>Selective Ion Transport Regulation Enables High Current Density CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ Conversion in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;transport regulation strategy is developed to customize the microenvironment during CO2 electroreduction in acidic electrolyte. A hybrid adlayer of ZrO2 nanosheets and Nafion preferentially allows K+ transport through proton trapping and Donnan effect, enriching K+ and raising pH near cathode surface. Such K+&#8208;rich alkaline microenvironment suppresses hydrogen evolution and promotes C2+ products formation, resulting in a high C2+ Faraday efficiency (FE) of &#8764;81% with a partial current density of 484&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) under acidic condition offers great promise to achieve carbon&#8208;efficient CO2 electrolysis. However, acidic CO2RR has been hindered by the severe competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and sluggish carbon&#8211;carbon coupling efficiency. Herein, an ion&#8208;transport regulation strategy has been developed to customize the microenvironment near cathode surface during high current density electrolysis in acidic electrolyte. A hybrid adlayer composed of (010) planes&#8208;enclosed ZrO2 nanosheets and Nafion preferentially allows K+ transport toward cathode through proton trapping and Donnan effect, thus simultaneously enriching K+ and raising pH near cathode surface during CO2RR. Such K+&#8208;rich and alkaline microenvironment suppresses HER and favors C2+ products formation. Particularly, a remarkable C2+ Faraday efficiency (FE) of nearly 81% has been achieved with a partial current density of 484&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products on modified Cu electrode. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to boost the CO2RR performance in acidic electrolyzers for efficient and sustainable CO2 conversion.

         <title>Metalloid Coordination Reinforcing Electronic Synergy in Dual&#8208;Atom Sites for Large&#8208;Scale CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
B,N co&#8208;coordination reinforces electronic interactions between NiFe dual sites more than common N coordination. NiFe/BNC sustains &gt;95% CO FE at ampere&#8208;level currents in 100 cm2 MEA CO2 electrolyzer. The reinforced interaction induces asymmetric charge distribution, facilitating *COOH formation on Ni and CO desorption on Fe sites. This metalloid B coordination strategy also works for other DACs like Ni&#8211;Cu, Ni&#8211;Co, and Ni&#8211;Mn cases.








Abstract
Reinforcing electronic synergy in dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) is critical yet challenging for boosting electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) performances. Herein, we develop a versatile strategy introducing metalloid B to construct B,N co&#8208;coordination dual sites featuring polarized (N&#8211;B)n bridges, enforcing electron delocalization between metal centers in DACs. Taking NiFe DACs as an example, the as&#8208;obtained NiFe/BNC achieves 99% CO Faraday efficiency (FECO) and 55.7% full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, markedly outperforming the common N&#8208;coordinated counterpart (NiFe/NC) and representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance.

&lt;p&gt;B,N co-coordination reinforces electronic interactions between NiFe dual sites more than common N coordination. NiFe/BNC sustains &amp;gt;95% CO FE at ampere-level currents in 100 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; MEA CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyzer. The reinforced interaction induces asymmetric charge distribution, facilitating *COOH formation on Ni and CO desorption on Fe sites. This metalloid B coordination strategy also works for other DACs like Ni&#8211;Cu, Ni&#8211;Co, and Ni&#8211;Mn cases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinforcing electronic synergy in dual-atom catalysts (DACs) is critical yet challenging for boosting electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (ECR) performances. Herein, we develop a versatile strategy introducing metalloid B to construct B,N co-coordination dual sites featuring polarized (N&#8211;B)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; bridges, enforcing electron delocalization between metal centers in DACs. Taking NiFe DACs as an example, the as-obtained NiFe/BNC achieves 99% CO Faraday efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) and 55.7% full-cell energy efficiency (200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, markedly outperforming the common N-coordinated counterpart (NiFe/NC) and representing state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, upon scaling the cell area to 100 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, this catalyst maintains &amp;gt;95% FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; during high-current electrolysis at 1&#8211;6 A. Even at &#8722;53 &#176;C, it sustains &amp;gt;98% FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; across 50-250&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, confirming the feasibility for in situ fuel production on Mars. Systematic investigations reveal B,N co-coordination induces reversed electron transfer (Fe&#8594;Ni), distinct from weakly interacting NiFe/NC. This facilitates *COOH formation on electron-enriched Ni sites and accelerated CO desorption from electron-deficient Fe sites, synergistically enhancing ECR.

         <title>Programmable DNA Nanospheres for Photothermal&#8208;Controlled Intracellular Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable DNA nanosphere platform combines tumor&#8208;targeting aptamers, GSH&#8208;responsive disassembly, and photothermal activation to enable spatiotemporally controlled intracellular protein degradation, adaptable to diverse targets and achieving potent synergistic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Photothermal&#8208;controlled protein degradation has recently emerged as a promising ubiquitin proteasome&#8208;independent strategy for intracellular protein elimination by inducing localized heating to destroy target protein structures. However, current photothermal systems often suffer from low bioavailability and nonspecific distribution, which severely limit their therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report a programmable, photothermal&#8208;responsive DNA nanosphere (NS) for targeted and spatiotemporally controlled intracellular protein degradation. The modular NS integrates a tumor&#8208;targeting aptamer, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive disulfide linker, and a degradation unit composed of a photosensitizer and a protein&#8208;binding aptamer. After selective accumulation in tumor cells, the NS disassembles in the GSH&#8208;rich cytoplasm, releasing degradation modules that bind target proteins. Subsequent laser irradiation induces localized heating to disrupt protein conformation and activate autophagy&#8211;lysosomal clearance. This strategy enabled efficient programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) degradation across multiple cancer cell models and demonstrated adaptability to other targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby achieving synergistic antitumor effects with mild phototherapy. With improved tumor selectivity, cellular permeability, in vivo stability, and a highly modular design, this platform offers a multifunctional and translatable solution for intracellular protein degradation&#8211;based cancer therapy.

         <title>Coordination Engineering of Iron&#8208;Polyphthalocyanines with H&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for the Tandem Catalysis of Nitrate to Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem catalyst of H&#8208;substituted graphdiyne@iron&#8208;polyphthalocyanine (HsGDY@FePPc) is demonstrated for managing the NO3&#8722; to NH2OH process by engineering the coordination environment of the open Fe&#8208;N4 sites of FePPc with the diacetylene linkages of HsGDY. The diacetylene linkages work as transfer stations of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;, whereas the isolated Fe&#8208;N4 sites help to manage NO2&#8722; to NH2OH.








Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) can be generated by controlling the nitrate electroreduction process, the key of which lies in the hydrogenation of *NO. In this study, hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) is developed to engineer the growth of iron&#8208;polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) with four Fe&#8208;N4 centers around the diacetylene linkages via d&#8211;&#960; interactions, where numerous isolated electrochemical interfaces with high degrees of site exposure are achieved. Density functional theory results indicate electron transfer from Fe&#8208;N4 sites to diacetylene linkages, which prevents the hydrogenation of *NH2OH. In such a hybrid, a relay process occurs between HsGDY and FePPc, where the diacetylene linkages work as the transfer stations of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;, whereas the isolated Fe&#8208;N4 sites further help manage NO2&#8722; to NH2OH. In addition, the well&#8208;aligned nanoarrays along with the extended conjugated structure of HsGDY make it effective in directing both electron and mass transfer around FePPc. Thus, HsGDY@FePPc achieves a NH2OH yield rate of 52.3 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with a Faradic efficiency (FE) of 34.0% at&#160;&#8722;&#160;0.7 V vs RHE. When further applied in the electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime, a FE of 51.0% is achieved. This work reports a coordination method for engineering both the structure and performance of a molecular catalyst via the diacetylene linkages of HsGDY.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phase Protection Suppresses Bi Leaching for Durable Acidic CO2 Electroreduction to Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly durable BiCu bimetallic catalyst for acidic CO2 electroreduction to formic acid is developed via a metal phase&#8208;protection strategy. The interphase interaction between CuBi2O4 and Bi2O3 results in compressive strain and lattice contraction in the Bi2O3 phase, effectively strengthening the Bi&#9472;O bonds. This structural modulation suppresses Bi leaching during electrochemical reconstruction and preserves more Bi2O2CO3 active phases, thereby improving the long&#8208;term durability (500 h), outperforming the common Bi2O3 catalyst.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acidic electrolyte mitigates salt precipitation and carbon loss compared to that in alkaline and neutral electrolytes. However, the harsh acidic environments cause metal leaching and catalyst degradation, thereby impairing activity and long&#8208;term durability. Here we propose a metal&#8208;phase protection strategy that enables in situ formation of a BiCu catalyst (Bi0.31Cu1) with impressive durability for acidic CO2RR to formic acid (HCOOH). The compressive strain of the Bi2O3 phase in Bi0.31Cu1, induced by its interaction with the CuBi2O4 phase, enhances Bi&#9472;O bond strength and mitigates Bi leaching during in situ electrochemical reconstruction, thus delivering highly desired activity and durability. The Bi0.31Cu1 catalyst achieves a HCOOH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of above 90% in a wide current density range from 200 to 650&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In a 0.5&#160;M KCl electrolyte with pH 2, the Bi0.31Cu1 catalyst can continuously produce HCOOH with a FE of around 90% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 500 h. This work showcases the great promise of the metal&#8208;phase protection strategy for minimizing metal leaching and improving the long&#8208;term durability of acidic CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Tailoring Cathode Interphase Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified framework for designing robust cathode interphases is established by elucidating the TM&#8208;O hybridization (&#916;&#948;) and interfacial bonding strength (ICOHP). Leveraging this principle, NFA additive enables stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage graphite||LCO and graphite||NMC811 cells.








Abstract
To unlock the potential of cyclability and energy density of Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), cathode interphase engineering is pivotal. However, a comprehensive methodology for rational cathode interphase design remains elusive. In this study, we propose a unified framework for designing robust cathode interphases by elucidating the role of heavy transition metal (TM)&#8208;oxygen (O) hybridization [quantified by the energy gap between TM 3d and O 2p orbitals (&#916;&#948;)] and the chemical bonding strength [measured by the integrals of crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP)] at the cathode surface. A large &#916;&#948;, coupled with a low ICOHP value, is identified as critical for forming an effective and stable cathode interphase. Guided by this principle, N&#8208;fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)amine (NFA) additive with high &#916;&#948; [0.432&#160;eV for LiCoO2 (LCO) and 0.350&#160;eV for LiNiO2] and low ICOHP values (&#8722;1.461&#160;eV for Co&#8208;N and &#8722;0.377&#160;eV for O&#8208;Li) is stood out, which effectively passivates aggressive high&#8208;voltage cathodes. This strategy enables superior battery cyclic performance, with 4.55&#160;V graphite||LCO pouch cells achieving over 357 cycles and 4.6&#160;V graphite||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells exceeding 400 cycles in carbonate electrolytes with simple formulations. The proposed cathode interphase design framework offers a promising pathway toward high&#8208;voltage LIBs with ultralong lifespans.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Enhanced Anodes: A Scalable Solution to Transition&#8208;Metal Ion Crosstalk in High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we pioneer an innovative, anode&#8208;centric strategy that leverages phosphorus's intrinsic &#8220;phagotrophic&#8221; properties to counteract TM&#8208;ion crosstalk. By immobilizing TM ions and maintaining solid electrolyte interphase stability, this unique property of phosphorus can revolutionize anode design, particularly in high&#8208;voltage batteries where TM dissolution is prevalent.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high&#8208;voltage transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxide cathodes and graphite and/or silicon anodes are widely recognized for their high energy density. However, such high&#8208;energy systems are often hindered by their poor cycling stability, especially due to anode failure caused by dissolved TM ions like Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+. Herein, we discovered phosphorus's unique phagotrophic effect, which absorbs TM ions into its bulk phase rather than allowing them to accumulate on the anode surface that typically happens for graphite and silicon. This effect allows a hybrid anode design by incorporating down to 2&#160;wt.% phosphorus into graphite or silicon anodes, which is simple yet effectively prevents the TM&#8208;ion&#8208;induced decomposition of the electrolyte and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), even at high TM&#8208;ion concentrations (up to 100&#160;mM). Consequently, full cells with phosphorus&#8208;enhanced graphite or silicon anodes demonstrate remarkable extended cycling life. Importantly, this phosphorus&#8208;based TM&#8208;ion phagotrophic effect can be incorporated with standard electrode processing techniques for both graphite and silicon, ensuring seamless integration into existing LIB manufacturing. By improving the stability of graphite and silicon anodes across a variety of TM&#8208;oxide cathodes, this approach provides a practical and scalable solution for advancing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy LIBs, offering both simplicity and transformative impact for battery technology.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Twin abeo&#8208;Steroids Bufogargarizins A and B via a Divergent Intramolecular Aldol Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>

Twin natural products. This manuscript describes a concise biomimetic synthesis of twin abeo&#8208;steroids bufogargarizins A and B with an unusual [7.5.6.5] and [5.7.6.5] skeletons in 19 steps (LLS). The described synthetic approach features the application of a bioinspired regiodivergent intramolecular aldol addition reaction and a selective singlet oxygen&#8208;based oxidation followed by an endoperoxide transposition to streamline the installation of the D&#8208;ring oxidation, which has enabled the concise synthesis of bufogargarizins A and B.








Abstract
This manuscript describes a concise bioinspired synthesis of twin abeo&#8208;steroids bufogargarizins A and B with an unusual [7.5.6.5] and [5.7.6.5] skeletons and a highly oxidized D&#8208;ring with an &#945;&#8208;pyrone substituent from (+)&#8208;methyl estrone. The described synthetic approach features ozonolytic cleavage of the &#916;5,10&#8208;alkene of an easily available estrone derivative, followed by a bioinspired regio&#8208; and stereoselective intramolecular aldol addition reaction that produced the desired bufogargarizins A and B precursors with the [7.5.6.5] and [5.7.6.5] skeletons in 27% and 63% yields, correspondingly. This work provides direct evidence that proves the biosynthetic hypothesis for the first time, as prior synthetic studies suggest that only bufogargarizin B could be formed via an intramolecular aldol reaction. The subsequent installation of the &#946;17&#8208;pyrone moiety along with the &#946;14, &#946;15&#8208;epoxide and &#946;16&#8208;acetoxy group was found to be challenging due to the instability of the &#945;&#8208;pyrone moiety to a range of basic, reductive, and oxidative conditions. To address this challenge, we have developed a singlet oxygen&#8208;based oxidation method that results in a streamlined installation of the D&#8208;ring oxidation and stereochemistry from a &#916;14,16&#8208;diene precursor. This enabled the completion of the syntheses of bufogargarizins A and B in 19 steps (LLS) and 0.36 and 1.5% overall yields, respectively.

         <title>Speciation&#8208;Dependent Solvent Extraction of Polyoxopalladates Toward Separation of Critical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Migration of metal ions from water to organic media is foundational for industrial separations and purification. Here, we design processes for oxocluster&#8208;based palladium solvent extraction, a crucial metal in drug production, catalysts, and microelectronics. Extraction is effective exclusively as polynuclear Pd&#8208;forms, which are tuned with capping groups. K+ shuttles anionic Pd&#8208;oxoclusters as ion&#8208;pairs across the interface more effectively than Na+.








Abstract
Innovating robust separation methods for critical elements extraction and reuse is important to sustain the global consumption of microelectronics, energy, and pharmaceuticals. Effective separations via liquid&#8208;liquid extraction (LLE) requires molecular&#8208;level understanding and optimization of solution speciation. Here, we design LLE for palladium based on polyoxopalladates (POPs), where Pd is critical for microelectronics, catalysts, and drug production. Mild solution conditions are designed to evaluate the role of templating heterometals and ligands (arsenate, phenylarsonate, phenylphosphonate, acetate, phosphate) that drive POP assembly. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, along with compositional analysis, respectively described speciation and extraction efficiency (including separation factors for competitive Pd&#8208;Ni separation). Most effective LLE of Pd (&gt;99.9%) are arsenate/phenylphosphonate/acetate capped hexamers or heptamers without templating metals. These fragments of the larger, prior&#8208;reported Pd12/Pd15/Pd84 POPs represent simple formulations, important for translation to scaled&#8208;up processes. Comparing alkali&#8208;acetate buffers highlight that potassium is more effective than lithium or sodium, presumably due to strong ion&#8208;pairing between Pd&#8208;oxoanions and the larger alkali, facilitating transport across the aqueous&#8208;organic interface. Pd and Au&#8208;Pd LLE studies yielded the first K+&#8208;charge balanced and K+&#8208;templated POPs, illustrating simply swapping the alkali from Na+ (usually employed) to K+ can enable isolation of new topologies and inspire new applications.

         <title>Inverse NiOx&#8208;Ag Interface to Decouple Reactant Activation for Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2&#8208;Catalyzed Ester Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse NiOx&#8208;Ag interfaces on Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2 decouple the activation of H2 and ester substrates in dimethyl oxalate (DMO) hydrogenation. Electron transfer generates electron&#8208;rich Ag sites for facile H2 dissociation and adjacent electron&#8208;deficient NiOx sites for preferential DMO adsorption, mitigating competitive adsorption. This cooperative architecture enables rapid H2 spillover, timely desorption of methyl glycolate, and exceptional stability, highlighting interfacial inversion as a versatile catalytic design paradigm.








Abstract
Achieving simultaneous high activity, selectivity, and stability in ester hydrogenation remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the competitive adsorption of reactants at active sites. Here, we introduce an inverse NiOx&#8208;Ag interface as a general design platform to spatially decouple the activation of H2 and ester, exemplified with dimethyl oxalate (DMO). The catalyst (Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2), synthesized via controlled partial reduction of Ni phyllosilicate followed by Ag deposition, features electron&#8208;rich Ag sites and electron&#8208;deficient interfacial Ni sites arising from interfacial electron transfer. Comprehensive characterizations reveal abundant NiOx&#8208;Ag interfaces with modified coordination and electronic structures. In situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption/surface reaction, and H2&#8208;D2 isotope exchange experiments demonstrate that H2 is preferentially dissociated at Ag sites, while DMO adsorbs and activates on NiOx sites, effectively mitigating competitive adsorption. Theoretical calculations confirm the cooperative nature of the interface, showing low barriers for H2 dissociation and favorable desorption energetics for methyl glycolate (MG), suppressing over&#8208;hydrogenation. Accordingly, the Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2 catalyst delivers a turnover frequency of 944.4 h&#8722;1 with &#8764;99% selectivity to MG over 500&#160;h of continuous operation, among the highest reported for DMO hydrogenation. This work establishes interfacial inversion engineering as a versatile approach to optimize site complementarity in multi&#8208;step catalytic transformations.

         <title>Compressed Co&#8211;O Bonds Resist Chlorine Corrosion to Enhance the Stability of Chlorine&#8208;Involved Anodic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) over Co3O4 induces Cl corrosion through Cl coordination to Co sites. A Co3O4/SnO2 heterostructure with a shortened Co&#8211;O bond is designed to catalyze Cl&#8208;mediated epoxidation and other anodic chlorination reactions. The compressed Co&#8211;O bond of Co3O4/SnO2 leads to a restrained LOM, suppressing the interaction of Cl with Co sites and thus increasing structural stability.








Abstract
Chlorine (Cl)&#8208;involved anodic reactions are essential for green manufacturing, whereas electrocatalysts suffer from deactivation due to Cl corrosion. Here, a Co3O4/SnO2 heterostructure with a shortened Co&#8211;O bond is designed to increase structural stability. The combined results of electrochemical measurements and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that the deactivation of Co3O4 involves the coordination of Cl to Co sites due to the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). The compressed Co&#8211;O bond of Co3O4/SnO2 leads to a restrained LOM, thus resisting Cl&#8208;triggered corrosion. Therefore, Co3O4/SnO2 not only realizes the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of epoxides through the Cl&#8208;mediated method via stable and continuous electrocatalysis processes but is also suitable for other anodic chlorination reactions with enhanced durability. This work provides a facile way to prevent Cl corrosion by hindering LOM.

         <title>Dual Electric Fields in Cyclooctatetrathiophene&#8208;Based COF/ ZnIn2S4 Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction Boost Photocatalytic Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>

A novel dual&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;engineered heterostructure, JUC&#8208;704@ZIS, is constructed using a synergistic strategy of intramolecular electric field via sulfur&#8208;isomeric COTh building blocks and Z&#8208;scheme interfacial electric field. This heterostructure achieves exceptional cocatalyst&#8208;free photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance in seawater.








Abstract
The development of efficient photocatalysts for seawater&#8208;based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) represents a crucial step toward sustainable green hydrogen production. While covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show great potential due to their structural tunability and optoelectronic properties, their practical application is limited by inherent challenges of low charge mobility and rapid carrier recombination. Herein, we present an innovative dual&#8208;electric&#8208;field strategy that synergistically combines intramolecular charge asymmetry with Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction engineering to overcome these limitations. Through precise molecular design, we developed two isomeric cyclooctatetrathiophene building blocks with distinct sulfur spatial arrangements, enabling the construction of COFs with controlled asymmetric charge distributions that generate strong intramolecular electric fields. These COFs were further integrated with ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) via in situ growth to form intimate Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, creating complementary interfacial electric fields. The resulting JUC&#8208;X@ZIS (X&#160;=&#160;702, 703, or 704) systems exhibit remarkable charge separation efficiency, with the optimized JUC&#8208;704@ZIS (1:8) achieving an exceptional cocatalyst&#8208;free PHE rate of 9.46&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in seawater, outperforming most reported COF&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the spatial positioning of sulfur atoms governs both the charge asymmetry and dual electric field formation, providing new molecular&#8208;level insights for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Are i&#8208;Motif Structures in DNA Compatible with Cytosine&#8211;Ag(I)&#8211;Cytosine Base Pairs?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An i&#8208;motif/duplex junction was evaluated with respect to its ability to replace the protons from the hemi&#8208;protonated C:CH+ pairs by AgI ions to form C&#8211;AgI&#8211;C base pairs. Interestingly, only one such metal&#8208;mediated base pair can be formed before the oligonucleotide rearranges into a duplex structure. It was concluded that i&#8208;motifs in general are not compatible with C&#8211;AgI&#8211;C base pairs, in contrast to previous reports.








Abstract
To evaluate whether the protons of hemi&#8208;protonated C:CH+ base pairs in DNA i&#8208;motif structures can be replaced by silver ions, an i&#8208;motif/duplex junction (IDJ) known to be stable at pH 7 was investigated. Interestingly, only the most accessible out of five C:CH+ pairs in the structure can be converted into a C&#8211;AgI&#8211;C base pair, as was derived by 1H NMR spectroscopy, luminescence spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;dependent UV spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). When more than one silver ion is present per IDJ, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and CD spectroscopy indicate that the IDJ rearranges into a larger aggregated structure, likely to contain non&#8208;canonical silver&#8208;mediated base pairs. The study suggests that&#8212;in contrast to earlier reports&#8212;the DNA i&#8208;motif in general is not compatible with the formation of contiguous C&#8211;AgI&#8211;C pairs.

         <title>Unlocking the Orbital Interaction Mode in Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the OER performance of Li&#8211;O2 batteries primarily depends on the orbital interaction mode between the catalyst and the intermediates. In contrast to the strong Cd 4dxy&#8211;O 2Px/y orbital interaction mode between CdSe and LiO2, the weaker Cd 4dz2&#8211;O 2Py orbital interaction mode between CdSe/ZnS and LiO2 significantly reduces the charge activation energy barrier, thereby enhancing OER catalytic activity.








Abstract
Understanding electrocatalyst&#8208;intermediate orbital interaction in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is critical for designing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries, yet remains a significant challenge. In this study, we employed a CdSe&#8208;based catalyst as a model cathode to deeply investigate the catalyst&#8211;intermediate interaction and its effect on OER activity. Compared to the 4d orbital electronic states of Cd in CdSe, electron transfer from CdSe to ZnS in the CdSe/ZnS heterojunction results in a downward shift of the Cd 4d suborbital energy levels. The differences in the Cd 4d orbital electronic states between CdSe and CdSe/ZnS cause distinct orbital interaction mode with LiO2 intermediate, ultimately leading to variations in OER activity. Specifically, compared to the strong Cd 4dxy&#8211;O 2Px/y orbital interaction mode between CdSe and LiO2, the weaker Cd 4dz2&#8211;O 2Py orbital interaction mode between CdSe/ZnS and LiO2 significantly reduces the activation energy of the rate&#8208;determining step, thereby enhancing OER activity. This finding provides theoretical guidance for the design of OER electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;O2 batteries.

         <title>LiPb3GeS4Cl3: Quasi&#8208;T2&#8208;Supertetrahedral 3D Framework Enabling Superior Optical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heterometallic T2&#8208;supertetrahedron constructs LiPb3GeS4Cl3, which achieves record high optical performance in its class via lithium activated surface states. 








Abstract
The anisotropic structure building unit involving diverse chemical bond (ABUCB) has been proven effective in exploring high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, through simultaneously enhancing second harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence (&#8710;n). Building on this concept, we propose a strategy that employs different types of primary tetrahedra to construct anisotropic supertetrahedron (T2). As a demonstration, we report a novel compound assembled by a quasi&#8208;T2&#8208;supertetrahedron, LiPb3GeS4Cl3 (LPGSC), exhibiting the superior optical properties among known thiogermanate halides and supertetrahedron&#8208;chalcogenides. In the structure, there are two crystallographically independent Pb sites: Pb(1) forms the heterometallic T2&#8208;supertetrahedron [GePb(1)3S8], while Pb(2) occupies an interstitial site with a labile coordination environment. As demonstrated by a series of samples LixPb3.5&#8208;x/2GeS4Cl3 (LxPGSC, x&#160;=&#160;1&#8210;0), the Pb(2) site can be substituted by lithium. Together with theoretical studies, we demonstrate that lithium incorporation effectively activates non&#8208;bonding states (Pb&#8208;6s2, S&#8208;3p, Cl&#8208;3p) near the Fermi level. This activation significantly enhances the second&#8208;order NLO susceptibility (LPGSC: d33&#160;=&#160;36.01&#160;vs. AGS: d36&#160;=&#160;18.67 pm V&#8722;1) and polarity anisotropy (LPGSC: &#8710;ncal. = 0.09&#160;vs. AGS: 0.03 at 546&#160;nm).

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Thermal Response of Visible/NIR Emission in Er3+&#8208;Doped Layered Perovskite via Modulating Thermally Induced Oxygen Vacancies and Cross Relaxation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>

A novel Er3&#8314;&#8208;doped Bi4Ti0.5W0.5O0.5Cl layered perovskite oxyhalide exhibits unconventional thermally enhanced near&#8208;infrared upconversion (133&#8208;fold intensity gain at 494&#160;K) alongside quenched green/red emissions. Synergistic oxygen vacancy modulation and cross&#8208;relaxation enable record&#8208;high thermometric sensitivity (72.26% K&#8722;1) via fluorescence intensity ratio, showcasing a breakthrough for high&#8208;performance optical temperature sensing.








Abstract
Overcoming thermal quenching remains a pivotal challenge for the practical application of upconversion luminescence (UCL) materials. Herein, a novel UCL material based on Er3+&#8208;doped layered perovskite oxyhalide Bi4Ti0.5W0.5O8Cl is demonstrated to exhibit a unique dual thermal&#8208;response behavior: conventional thermal quenching of green/red emissions alongside remarkable thermally enhanced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) UCL within the temperature range of 293&#8211;493&#160;K. Under 980&#160;nm excitation, the NIR UCL intensity (4I9/2 &#8594; 4I15/2) in Bi4Ti0.5W0.5O8Cl:10%Er3+ at 493&#160;K reached 133&#8208;fold that at 293&#160;K. The opposite thermal response is attributed to the synergistic effects of tunable oxygen vacancy concentrations and optimized cross&#8208;relaxation processes at elevated temperatures. By leveraging the opposing thermal responses of Er3+ emissions, an ultrahigh absolute sensitivity of 72.26% K&#8722;1 was achieved at 493&#160;K based on the fluorescence intensity ratio of the NIR (4I9/2 &#8594; 4I15/2) to green (4S3/2 &#8594; 4I15/2) transitions, demonstrating exceptional performance for highly sensitive optical thermometry. This work not only provides a new strategy for designing thermally enhanced UCL materials but also underscores the great potential of layered perovskite oxyhalides as advanced platforms for optical temperature sensing.

We report the first enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydroformylation of alkenyl boronic esters. By employing either a &#8220;camouflage&#8221; or &#8220;direct&#8221; reductive asymmetric hydroformylation strategy, the enantiodivergent synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;boryl alcohols proceeds in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities with alkene 1,2&#8208;diboronic esters or alkenyl boronic esters as the starting materials and using rhodium/Ph&#8208;BPE as the catalyst.








Abstract
We herein report the first enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydroformylation of alkenyl boronic esters.

         <title>A Versatile Strategy for Light&#8208;Driven Active Transport of Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a light&#8208;driven primary active transport system based on an azobenzene carrier that drives uphill ion movement across phase&#8208;separated compartments. Tunable ion&#8208;pairing enables selective co&#8208;transport under buffered conditions, advancing synthetic systems that emulate biological ion pumps.








Abstract
Transport across compartments is essential for biology to drive its vital processes. Chemists have developed synthetic transport systems, focusing mainly on passive transport, where cargo species move along a concentration gradient. However, active transport&#8212;moving substances against a concentration gradient&#8212;remains a challenge. Light is a promising energy source for driving active transport due to its precise spatiotemporal control, high selectivity, and operation without waste accumulation. Yet only a few examples of light&#8208;driven active transport have been reported: these systems rely on specific host&#8211;guest interactions, which enable the transport of one particular species in each case. Here, we present a general, robust strategy for light&#8208;driven active transport of charged cargos, based on light&#8208;controlled membrane permeability and charge complementarity. Positively charged azobenzene derivatives act as light&#8208;responsive carriers, and their photoisomerization is coupled to transport across a liquid membrane by a molecular ratchet mechanism. Notably, their transport drives active transport of negatively charged cargos by forming ion pairs. This system can transport various anions, which are simply added as salt, and it functions even in buffered solutions. This approach utilizing charge complementarity is compatible with active transport driven by other energy sources and holds potential for biomedical applications and smart materials.

         <title>pH&#8208;Regulated Ring&#8208;Opening/Closing Transformation in Polyoxometalates Enables High&#8208;Performance Nonlinear Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by pH&#8208;regulated structural transformation, two selenium&#8208;containing polyoxometalates, NMSeO&#8208;5 and NMSeO&#8208;6, were synthesized. A reversible ring&#8208;opening/closing process dramatically boosts their nonlinear optical properties, with SHG intensity increasing from 0.07&#160;&#215;&#160;to 10&#160;&#215;&#160;that of KDP. Supported by DFT calculations, the acid&#8208;promoted mechanism reveals the construction pathway of POMs and provides a general strategy to advance SHG performance of POM&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
Inorganic polyoxometalate (POM) crystals are a promising class of materials with considerable potential in modern laser science and technology. However, the limited understanding of POM formation mechanisms and the unclear structure&#8208;property relationship between POMs and nonlinear optics (NLO) have hindered the rational design and controllable synthesis of high&#8208;performance inorganic POM&#8208;based NLO crystals. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of two novel polar heteropolymolybdates, (NH4)4[Mo5O15(SeO3)2]&#183;2H2O (NMSeO&#8208;5) and (NH4)8[Mo6O18(SeO3)4]&#183;5H2O (NMSeO&#8208;6). Supported by theoretical calculations and experimental verification, we demonstrate, for the first time, pH&#8208;regulated ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing transformations in an inorganic POM system and propose a mechanistic pathway for their formation. Specifically, NMSeO&#8208;5, containing highly symmetrical Strandberg&#8208;type [Mo5O15(SeO3)2]2&#8722; clusters, undergoes structural transformation under strongly acidic conditions (H2SeO3) into NMSeO&#8208;6, which features a lower&#8208;symmetry, Reuleaux triangular [Mo6O18(SeO3)4]8&#8722; cluster. Remarkably, this transformation results in a dramatic enhancement of the second&#8208;harmonic generation response from 0.07&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP (NMSeO&#8208;5) to 10&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP (NMSeO&#8208;6). This work provides not only mechanistic insight into POM structural evolution but also establishes a paradigm for the design of next&#8208;generation, high&#8208;performance inorganic POM&#8208;based NLO materials.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Mixed Cations in the Electrochemical Double Layer Enables Highly Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a remarkable Faradaic efficiency for CH4 (FECH4) of 88.7% with a current density of 461.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 was achieved at&#160;&#8722;1.3&#160;V vs. RHE over CuCeSiOx electrode in a ternary electrolyte of 1&#160;M tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) + 5&#160;mM KCl. Mechanistic studies reveal the synergistic effect of mixed K+ and TPA+ in the electrochemical double layer plays a critical role in boosting CO2RR to CH4 via a H&#8226; radical pathway.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 methanation is crucial for sustainable carbon recycling, transforming a greenhouse gas into a valuable fuel. However, achieving high selectivity toward CH4, particularly at high current densities, remains a significant challenge. In this study, a remarkable Faradaic efficiency for CH4 (FECH4) of 88.7% with a current density of 461.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 was achieved at&#160;&#8722;1.3&#160;V vs. RHE over CuCeSiOx electrode in a ternary electrolyte of 1&#160;M tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) + 5&#160;mM KCl, setting a new record for CO2 electroreduction to CH4. By employing other Cu&#8208;based catalysts, high CH4 selectivity can also be obtained in this ternary electrolyte. Mechanistic studies reveal the synergistic effect of mixed K+ and TPA+ in the electrochemical double layer plays a critical role in controlling the reaction pathway. Specifically, K+ modulates *CO adsorption and promotes water dissociation, generating abundant H&#8226; radicals, while TPA+ aggregates stabilize these radicals, accelerating the reaction kinetics, and facilitating the deep hydrogenation from *CO to CH4.

Hydrophobic groups can strengthen confined water networks, promoting order that propagates through the protein structure and drives recognition, creating a paradoxical hydrophobic binding hot spot. Polar groups are rejected because they disrupt the network, destabilizing the protein structure.








Abstract
The hydrophobic effect is a central force in molecular recognition, typically attributed to the ordering of water molecules around apolar groups. Hydrophobic interaction sites on proteins are therefore readily predicted based on surface polarity. Yet, in the bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4), a well&#8208;known hydrophobic hot spot is paradoxically lined by a network of water molecules. Here we combine binding assays, structural data, molecular dynamics, and free&#8208;energy calculations to resolve this apparent contradiction. We show that the water network functions as a hydrophobic recognition motif that cannot accommodate polar groups without disruption. Instead, as the protein pre&#8208;organizes the water network, apolar groups can bind with minimal entropic cost. In turn, they reinforce the surrounding hydrogen&#8208;bond network, limiting the mobility of the entire protein&#8211;water assembly. With this perspective, we identify water networks potentially functioning as hydrophobic motifs in other pharmacological targets, revealing a general but overlooked recognition element with broad implications in drug discovery and protein design.

         <title>Non&#8208;Alternant Helical Bilayer Molecular Carbons Bearing a Diaza[9]Helicene with Enhanced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy based on embedding heptagons and incorporating carbazole derivatives has been developed to create helical bilayer molecular carbons with a high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F&#160;=&#160;74%). An organic light&#8208;emitting diode device containing the molecular carbons shows a high &#951;EQE,max of 3.6%, while the enantiomers exhibit pronounced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) responses with a high CPL brightness (BCPL) of 112&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Helical bilayer molecular carbons have attracted considerable attention due to their distinct physicochemical properties. However, constrained by the limited structural diversity, helical bilayer molecular carbons typically exhibit low quantum yields and low circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness, which limits their potential applications as CPL emitters. In this work, helical bilayer molecular carbons (NDPH and NDPBu) featuring a heptagon&#8208;embedded diaza[9]helicene were successfully synthesized employing ring expansion strategy. The incorporated heptagons enhance the highly twisted and rigid bilayer geometry with a significant interlayer interaction index &#948;g (18.6), while the introduction of carbazole units yields a high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F&#160;=&#160;74%). As a result, the resultant enantiomers exhibit pronounced electronic circular dichroism and CPL responses with a high CPL brightness (BCPL) value of 112&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1. In addition, an organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) device was fabricated employing NDPH as dopant, achieving a maximum external quantum efficiency (&#951;EQE,max) of 3.6%, which demonstrates its potential optoelectronic application.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Formation of Ultrathin Conjugated Coordination Frameworks with Homogeneous Edge Effect Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using Co&#8208;DABDT, a d&#8211;&#960; conjugated conductive metal coordination framework (c&#8208;MCFs), as a model catalyst, the homogenic edge effect was regulated by the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and solvation layer of the reaction solvent environment. Reduced layer plate thickness enables homogeneous edge curvatures to optimize interface charge/electric field distribution and strengthen oxidation intermediate adsorption, achieving efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity.








Abstract
The d&#8211;&#960; conjugated conductive metal coordination frameworks (c&#8208;MCFs) are a type of emerging crystalline porous material. However, due to the interlayer conjugation effect, the clusters tend to assemble into 3D architectures, making it difficult to directly prepare ultrathin 2D structures. Herein, by reasonably regulating the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and solvation layer of the reaction solvent environment, the interlayer conjugation effect of the Co&#8208;DABDT (DABDT&#160;=&#160;2,5&#8208;diaminobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol) layer was effectively inhibited, and ultrathin c&#8208;MCFs were efficiently constructed. Using it as a suitable model catalyst, the solvent environment was optimized, and Co&#8208;DABDT with different homogenic edge curvatures was synthesized, including bulk Co&#8208;DABDT (Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;B), layered Co&#8208;DABDT (Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;L), and Co&#8208;DABDT nanosheet (Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;NS). Among these, Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;NS has the highest homogenic edge curvatures, with the optimal onset potential and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.97 and 0.82&#160;VRHE, respectively. Experimental and theoretical results show that as the layer plate thickness decreases, the homogenic edge curvatures can optimize the interface charge and electric field distribution and enhance the adsorption of oxidation intermediates, thereby achieving efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity. The results indicate that the role of this morphology&#8208;induced local field enhances the ORR kinetics and provides a new perspective for the study of catalyst morphology&#8208;field effect&#8208;catalytic kinetics.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Incorporation&#8208;Engineered Interfacial Water Modulation on Single&#8208;Atom Cu Sites for Enhanced Dilute Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of O&#8208;engineered Cu&#8208;NCOx SACs featuring asymmetric Cu&#8208;N3O1 and oxygen functionalities for dilute NO3RR. Introducing Cu&#9472;O coordination results in electron&#8208;deficient Cu, beneficial for NO3&#8722; adsorption. While the nucleophilic oxygen functionalities trap Na&#8314;&#8211;H2O being close to the electrode, ensuring the *H supply. The synergistic effects of Cu&#9472;N3O1 and oxygen functionalities collectively lead to superior NO3RR to Cu&#8211;N4 catalyst.








Abstract
The efficiency of nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is highly dependent on the complex interfacial microenvironment, where the triumvirate of alkali metal cations, water network, and NO3&#8722; adsorption dynamics collectively dictate reaction activity and selectivity. However, how the structural engineering of catalyst governing the interfacial microenvironment is still unclear, yet critical for the construction of efficient catalytic system. In this work, we develop a series of oxygen&#8208;engineered Cu&#8211;NCOx SACs featuring asymmetric Cu&#9472;N3O1 active site with tunable oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups that enable highly efficient NO3RR in dilute nitrate concentrations (100&#160;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8211;N). Experimental and theoretical results show that the introduction of Cu&#9472;O coordination results in the pronounced electron&#8208;deficient Cu site, which is beneficial for NO3&#8722; adsorption and activation. Meanwhile, the electron&#8208;rich nucleophilic oxygen functionalities specifically O = C&#9472;O and C = O can efficiently trap Na&#8314;&#8208;hydrated water (Na&#8314;&#8211;H2O) being close to the electrode through electrostatic interactions. The NO3RR performance follows a distinct volcano relationship with interfacial Na&#8314;&#8211;H2O concentration due to the enhanced HER with large localized *H enrichment. As a result, the Cu&#8211;NCOM electrocatalyst possessing optimal oxygen incorporation exhibits an exceptional NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) of 96.7% with an outstanding NH3 yield rate of 10.5&#160;mol h&#8722;1 gCu&#8722;1. This research provides an effective O&#8208;incorporation strategy to boost NO3RR performance in dilute NO3&#8722; aqueous solution by precisely controlling the interfacial water structure around asymmetric Cu SACs centers.

         <title>Low&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Threshold Triggered Irreversible Emission Transformation toward Flexible Pressure Imaging and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excessively required pressure for pressure&#8208;driven irreversible emission transformation significantly inhibiting practical applications. Here, we achieved an irreversible emission transformation in zero&#8208;dimensional (TPA)CuI2 NCs (TPA&#160;=&#160;Tetrapropylammonium) via high pressure engineering, even at pressure as low as 0.6&#160;GPa. Furthermore, (TPA)CuI2&#8208;PVA films can be utilized in flexible pressure imaging by stamping or writing. Different recovery time upon applying different pressures provides dynamic passwords and time&#8208;sensitive intelligence, thus eliminating the false and retaining the true.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;driven irreversible emission transformation as an efficient means greatly facilitates the development of the rational structural design of high performance novel metastable states. However, the excessively required pressure can only be achieved by high&#8208;pressure devices, significantly inhibiting practical applications. Here, we achieved an irreversible emission transformation in 0D copper halides (TPA)CuI2 (TPA&#160;=&#160;Tetrapropylammonium) nanocrystals (NCs) via high pressure engineering, even at pressure as low as 0.6&#160;GPa (approximately 6000 atmospheres). The large steric hindrance of organic cations (TPA+) and enhanced hydrogen bonding increased the potential barrier of phase transition, resulting in an irreversibility. The quenched samples exhibited bright green emission after pressure treatment, greatly different from the initial dull white light. The (TPA)CuI2 NCs&#8208;based film can be utilized as flexible and water&#8208;resistant pressure imaging that just required macroscopic pressure, such as stamping or writing. Furthermore, the different recovery time upon applying different pressures provides dynamic passwords and time&#8208;sensitive intelligence&#8212;&#8212;eliminating the false and retaining the true. This work develops a promising pressure&#8208;sensing material which can be easily accessible in practical applications for schlagstelle inspection of pipeline inwall and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Gradient Adsorption Energy Strategy Unlocks Ultra&#8208;Long Stability and Efficient Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis from Nitrate Over CoP/Cu3P</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modulating the cooperative catalytic sites in CoP/Cu3P for multi&#8208;step elementary reactions, a gradient absorption synergistic system including integrating strong, moderate and weak adsorption sites is constructed. The incorporated P atoms serve as an electron bridge between heterointerfaces, facilitating charge transfer and stabilizing the structure against phase reconstruction during 150 h operation. The suppressed structural evolution ensures exceptional long&#8208;term electrocatalytic stability.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NRA) is an important approach for achieving both ammonia synthesis and wastewater treatment. However, its multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;electron transfer process and the difficulty in synergistically regulating the adsorption energy of intermediates limit the reaction efficiency. In this study, a self&#8208;supported CoP/Cu3P composite nanotube array electrode (CoP/Cu3P&#8208;CF) was fabricated on copper foam through in situ growth and phosphidation. By precisely regulating synergistic catalytic sites for multiple elementary reactions, the catalyst simultaneously enhances both adsorption and desorption processes through a gradient adsorption energy strategy. The catalyst utilizes the synergistic effect of Cu and Co dual sites to enhance the adsorption and conversion of NO3&#8722; and the directed transformation of *NO2 intermediates to NH3, respectively, while P atoms act as electron transfer bridges to promote charge transport. At &#8211;0.3&#160;V vs. RHE, it achieved an exceptional ammonia production rate of 1.59&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 96.35%. The strong interfacial interaction between CoP and Cu3P effectively suppressed structural reconstruction, enabling stable operation for 150 h without significant performance degradation. Kelvin probe force microscopy and in situ characterization confirmed a broad adsorption energy distribution conducive to multi&#8208;site synergistic catalysis. This study provides new insights for the design and mechanistic understanding of highly active NRA catalysts.

Tailored POT/Fe3O4 core&#8211;shell nanoparticles enable light&#8208;driven release of charged drugs. The Fe3O4/POT heterojunction shifts the bandgap to safety wavelengths, promoting POT photooxidation and triggering drug expulsion to preserve electroneutrality. This design achieves precise, tunable, and efficient on&#8208;demand drug delivery in complex media. More in the Research Article (e202514317), Mar&#237;a Cuartero and co&#8208;workers.

Integrating elemental doping and morphological engineering enhances the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) performance of carbon electrocatalysts, as reported by Cheng Tang, Jian Liu, Zhong&#8208;Shuai Wu, and co&#8208;workers in the Research Article (e202519013). N/O dual&#8208;doping optimizes the adsorption strength of intermediates, while hierarchical pores improve mass transfer and suppress H2O2 decomposition. These effects inhibit the competitive 4e&#8211; pathway, enabling sustainable H2O2 production with remarkable performance at industrial&#8208;grade current densities.

         <title>From CO2 to C1 Liquid Fuels: Molecular Electrochemical Production of Formic Acid and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable transformation of CO2 into formic acid and methanol is key to circular carbon economies and sustainable energy. These liquid C1 products are high in energy density, easy to store, and serve as hydrogen carriers and feedstocks. Electrochemical CO2 reduction provides a promising route for carbon recycling and renewable energy integration. This minireview highlights recent advances in electrocatalysts design, mechanistic insights, and emerging strategies for next&#8208;generation CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C1 fuel conversion.








Abstract
Transforming carbon dioxide (CO2) into formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH3OH) as C1 liquid fuels is central to advancing circular carbon economies and sustainable energy applications. Both CH3OH and HCOOH possess high energy density and are easily storable and transportable. Beyond their widespread use as solvents and C1 feedstock chemicals, CH3OH can be applied in fuel cells or serve as a hydrogen precursor, making it valuable for transportation and grid&#8208;level energy storage. HCOOH similarly functions as a safe hydrogen carrier and as a fuel in formic acid fuel cells. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) to these C1 products represents a pivotal step in closing the anthropogenic carbon loop, enabling sustainable energy storage. Recent years have brought notable advances in catalyst development, mechanistic understanding, and system optimization. Although metal&#8208;free catalysts and conductive polymers have advanced at a fast pace, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;containing systems remain the most effective, offering superior activity, selectivity, stability, and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Particularly promising are dual&#8208;function systems that integrate CO2 capture/absorption with electroreduction, offering a promising route toward the direct valorization of industrial CO2 emissions. This minireview critically evaluates recent advances in molecular and polymer&#8208;based electrocatalytic systems, design strategies, and emerging directions for next&#8208;generation CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C1 liquid fuel conversion technologies.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of P(V) Skeleton via Catalytic Desymmetric Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the recent advance in the construction of enantioenriched stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;P(V) compounds via catalytic asymmetric desymmetric substitution strategy, which is divided into two pathways including nucleophilic substitution and electrophilic substitution.








Abstract
Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;P(V) skeletons exist ubiquitously in drugs, agrochemicals, organocatalysts, ligands and materials. Conventional synthetic methods mainly rely on chromatographic resolution, chiral auxiliary induction and optically active substrate control. Catalytic asymmetric transformation as an economic pathway has received much progress via racemic substrate resolution and desymmetrization of prochiral precursors. Among them, catalytic desymmetric substitution strategy has recently emerged as a new and powerful route to construct P(V) stereocenter, particularly witnessed a series of achievements in preparing seldom studied fully heteroatom&#8208;substituted P(V) scaffolds in the past one year. This minireview aims to provide a timely summary and highlight on this rapidly developing field, including reaction design, synthesis, mechanism and applications, and also perspective on the potential limitations and future trend.

         <title>Characterisation of the N&#8208;Methyltransferase SgPsmC: Application in the Kinetic Resolution of Pyrroloindolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;methyltransferase SgPsmC was characterised and applied in the kinetic resolution (KR) of easily obtainable pyrroloindolines. Substitution at 3a&#8208;position proved to be a principal determinant for the enzyme's enantioselectivity. While moving toward laboratory scale, the reaction was coupled with a methionine adenosyl transferase for in situ generation of S&#8208;adenosyl methionine, allowing the KR to proceed without any background reaction.








Abstract
Many natural products and pharmaceutical compounds bear the pyrroloindoline scaffold, highlighting the importance of the heterocyclic motif. Here, we aim at expanding the toolset for the selective synthesis of pyrroloindolines by characterising and employing the N&#8208;methyltransferase SgPsmC from Streptomyces griseofuscus, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of physostigmine, in a selective kinetic resolution of pyrroloindolines performed at a laboratory preparative scale.

         <dc:description>
This work presents the first Sorp&#8208;vection&#8208;based membrane separation for silicone oil purification, coupling sorption&#8208;driven selectivity with convective transport.

&#8220;Sorp&#8208;vection&#8221; is a membrane separation technique that synergistically combines sorption with convective flow mechanisms. Beyond its conceptual discussion, we demonstrate a sorp&#8208;vection separation achieved in a gas&#8211;liquid system, where permeation of a gas directly drives selective permeation of an organic solute across a dense polymer layer overcoming osmotic limitations of conventional membrane processes. Here, a long&#8208;standing challenge in silicone oil production is addressed, in which residual cyclic oligosiloxanes are removed from silicone oil streams through permeation of CO2 across an optimally crosslinked PDMS selective layer. A lab&#8208;scale 1st generation Sorp&#8208;vection system demonstrated, with a separation factor above 15 to remove D4 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) from low&#8208;concentration feeds using both lab&#8208;grade silicone oil (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) and an industrial&#8208;grade feed (DOW&#8208;SFD). Good agreement was found with a predictive model based on liquid D4 and high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight silicone oil sorption data in crosslinked PDMS. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study introduces the sorp&#8208;vection strategy, expanding it from conventional two&#8208;component systems to a three&#8208;component configuration in which convective flow is introduced as an independent driving entity. Addressing concentration polarization in next&#8208;generation versions of the sorp&#8208;vection process is expected to ensure stable long&#8208;term performance and to establish sorp&#8208;vection as a transformative approach for industrial purification.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents the first Sorp-vection-based membrane separation for silicone oil purification, coupling sorption-driven selectivity with convective transport. Our strategy enables highly selective removal of residual cyclic siloxanes, particularly D4, overcoming the inherent trade-offs and limitations associated with conventional membrane processes in the silicone industry.

         <title>Merging Pyrrole with Boron into Versatile Di(2&#8208;pyrryl)borane Building Blocks: &#960;&#8208;Extension, Polymerization, and Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of di(2&#8208;pyrryl)boranes, including the previously elusive unprotected N&#8211;H derivative, has been achieved that serve as versatile building blocks for &#960;&#8208;extended tetrahetarene boranes, a poly(dipyrrole borane), and a zirconium(IV) complex. The new &#960;&#8208;conjugated boranes are efficient blue&#8208;light emitters, due to a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) character of the excited state. Aggregation causes emission enhancement, resulting from the formation of highly emissive nanoaggregates.








Abstract
Conjugated di(hetaryl)boranes&#8212;particularly those of thiophene, but also of furan&#8212;have recently proven to be extremely useful building blocks for organic optoelectronic materials. The importance of the combination of boron with pyrrole, on the other hand, becomes particularly apparent when considering the well&#8208;known, versatile BODIPY dyes, in which the boron atom is tetracoordinated. However, synergistic effects of combining pyrrole with tricoordinate boron have been hardly exploited to date, which is probably due to synthetic challenges associated with the special reactivity of this five&#8208;membered heterocycle. Herein, a high&#8208;yield, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of two di(2&#8208;pyrryl)boranes is presented, including the previously elusive unprotected NH derivative. Their versatility is demonstrated by their application as building blocks for &#960;&#8208;extended tetrahetarene boranes, a polymer, and a zirconium(IV) complex. The crystallographically determined molecular structures of both di(2&#8208;pyrryl)boranes and the Zr complex show largely planar dipyrrylborane moieties. Compared to their thiophene and furan congeners, the new conjugated boranes show bathochromically shifted absorption bands and more intense fluorescence emission, with solvatochromic behavior, aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE), and solid&#8208;state emission. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations reveal that this is due to the population of twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states, giving rise to dual emission in the unprotected triarylborane.

         <title>Triply Responsive Control of Ion Transport with an Artificial Channel Creates a Switchable AND to OR Logic Gate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a triply responsive artificial ion channel, showing tuneable activity, and responsive to three distinct stimuli &#8208; light, pH, and ligand &#8211; which we use to formulate an AND to OR switchable molecular logic gate.








Abstract
Ion channels are ubiquitous in Nature, performing complex and essential tasks in our bodies. Synthetic chemists have begun to understand how to form artificial channels, which hold great promise as components in artificial cells, and in synthetic biology more widely. Future generations of these systems will be critical in the treatment of channelopathies. Despite advances in synthetic ion transporters, the current generation cannot approach the selectivity and controllability of the biological ion channels they seek to emulate, and multimodal control over activity remains hard to achieve. Herein, we present a synthetic ion channel whose activity can be controlled by three orthogonal stimuli (light, pH, guest/ligand), based on a pillar[5]arene functionalized with photoswitchable ortho&#8208;tetrafluoroazobenzene moieties. We demonstrate excellent control over ten photoswitches (E&#8208;to&#8208;Z 82%, Z&#8208;to&#8208;E quant.). We show that the most active Z&#8208;isomer forms dimeric ion channels in membranes. Single molecule planar bilayer conductance studies show high and low conductance states dependent on irradiation wavelength. We demonstrate that this activity can be modulated over 170&#8208;fold by controlling pH, irradiation, and guest addition. We use these three stimuli to design a pH switchable AND to OR logic gate system, creating a powerful addition to the canon of synthetic ion channels.

         <title>On the Nature of Improper Hydrogen Bonding in RCH2F and RCHF2 Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature of &#8216;improper&#8217; hydrogen bonds is explored in FnC&#9472;H&#8943;X systems, such as RCF2H interaction with chloride and water. It is noted that increased fluorination decreases the positive charge density on H but increases it on C, thus these interactions are dominated by electrostatic attraction to C over H. Such interactions map experimental blue and red shift IR phenomenon.








Abstract
The RCH2F and RCHF2&#160;groups are substituents of interest in medicinal and agrochemicals products. They have a polar aspect relative to the methyl (RCH3) or trifluoromethyl (RCF3) groups which results in a lowering of Log P's (water affinity). Here we use a computational approach to explore the nature of the interaction between RCH2F and RCHF2&#160;in methanes and ethanes with chloride ion (and water), as a hydrogen bonding acceptor. A key observation is that the hydrogen atoms geminal to the fluorine(s) become less positively charged with increasing fluorination, a trend anticipated to weaken, not strengthen, their hydrogen bonding interactions. However this study demonstrates a dominating role for the electrostatic interaction of the acceptor with the CF carbons and profiles a shift in negative charge density from hydrogen to the carbon and fluorine(s) as chloride ion (or water) approach. The common occurrence of blue shifts (shortening C&#9472;H length) in these &#8216;improper&#8217; or &#8216;non&#8208;classical&#8217; hydrogen bonds is also explored and is correlated with the electrostatic interactions between the acceptor and the carbon atoms. These observations are extended to C3&#9472;C6&#160;alicyclic rings containing these motifs and predict particularly strong interactions energies between chloride ion and specifically designed organo&#8208;fluoro alicycles.

The unusually high oxidation state +V of Cu, Ag, and Au is stabilized by [B11H11]4&#8211;&#8208;based anions. For (n&#8208;Bu4N)3[Ag(B11H11)2], the crystal structures were determined for both isomers with Ag+I and Ag+V. 








Abstract
We disclose the synthesis and properties of [M(B11H11)2]3&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Ag, Au) with the first gold&#8208;based anion [Au(B11H11)2]3&#8722;. The nido&#8208;[B11H11]4&#8722; ligand stabilizes complexes with copper, silver, and gold in the highest known oxidation state +V. The relative stability of [M+V(nido&#8208;B11X11)2]3&#8722;, [M+III(nido&#8208;B11X11)(closo&#8208;B11X11)]3&#8722;, and [M+I(closo&#8208;B11X11)2]3&#8722; isomers (X&#160;=&#160;H, F) was calculated at the DFT level. Unlike for [Cu(B11H11)2]3&#8722; and [Au(B11H11)2]3&#8722;, in case of [Ag(B11H11)2]3&#8722;, we discovered the equilibrium between the kinetically stable [Ag+V(nido&#8208;B11H11)2]3&#8722; (&#951;5) and kinetically labile [Ag+I(closo&#8208;B11H11)2]3&#8722; (&#951;2) by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The isomerization of the Ag complex shows signs of Ag(V)&#8211;Ag(I) redox processes. When a crystal is cooled, a phase transition occurs at 110&#8211;130&#160;K in which the coordination of the ligands on the silver changes from &#951;5 to &#951;2. The phase transition is reversible and upon heating to 170&#160;K, the &#951;2 to &#951;5 coordination is transformed. The reaction of [M(B11H11)2]3&#8722; with HF leads to the partial substitution of hydrogen atoms by fluorine atoms to form [M(B11H11&#8722;xFx)2]3&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Au; x&#160;&#8776;&#160;4). We synthesized 18 compounds containing [M(B11H11)2]3&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Ag, Au) and their derivatives, followed by structural determination (X&#8208;ray crystallography). XANES data confirm the high oxidation state of Cu in K3[Cu(B11H11)2]&#183;5H2O.

         <title>Selective, Oxygen&#8208;Tunable, and Metal&#8208;Free Functionalization of Polyethylene Through Dual&#8208;Mode Nitrosation and Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free nitrosation process enables direct C&#8211;H functionalization of polyethylene (PE) with high selectivity, producing either oxime&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;functionalized polymers. Using t&#8208;BuONO under visible light or thermal conditions, the process operates in both lab&#8208;scale and industrial settings. The resulting oxime groups serve as versatile intermediates, enabling scalable and sustainable PE upcycling. 








Abstract
Polyethylene (PE), the world's most produced synthetic polymer, is highly durable but resistant to chemical modification due to its inert carboncarbon backbone. This work presents a metal&#8208;free, nitrosation process for direct CH functionalization of PE, enabling selective formation of oxime&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;functionalized polymers. The method operates under mild visible&#8208;light conditions in solution and through thermally driven reactive extrusion, making it suitable for both laboratory and industrial applications. The key reagent, tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (t&#8208;BuONO), produces an alkoxy radical (t&#8208;BuONO&#8226;) for CH activation and a persistent nitrosyl radical (NO&#8226;) that installs ketoxime functionalities. Mechanistic studies using quantum yield determination and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy confirm the energy&#8208;transfer activation of t&#8208;BuONO and hydrogen atom transfer pathways. Unlike previous strategies, this approach yields pure oxime or keto&#8208;functionalized PE's without metals or pre&#8208;functionalization. Moreover, oxime groups serve as intermediates convertible into esters, ethers, or urethanes, allowing control over polymer polarity and thermomechanical properties. Together, this strategy transforms a venerable small&#8208;molecule transformation into a scalable, selective, and tunable route for the upcycling of PE, and enables a selective and sustainable route to valorize one of the world's most ubiquitous, but most recalcitrant plastics.

         <title>Fluorescent Probes Derived from the Polyene Class of Antifungal Drugs Reveal Distinct Localization Patterns and Resistance&#8208;Associated Vacuolar Sequestration in Candida Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes derived from all three clinically used polyene antifungals (amphotericin B, nystatin, and natamycin) enabled direct visualization of distribution in yeast cells of various Candida species. While retaining the ergosterol&#8208;dependent mode of action of their parent drugs, the probes revealed distinct, structure&#8208;specific localization patterns and uncovered enhanced vacuolar sequestration in highly polyene&#8208;resistant strains.








Abstract
Amphotericin B, nystatin, and natamycin are the only polyene antifungals in clinical use and remain last&#8208;resort therapies for severe fungal infections. These agents disrupt fungal membranes through ergosterol binding, but how structural differences between the three polyenes influence subcellular distribution, and whether such distribution is linked to resistance, remains uncharacterized. To investigate these relationships, we developed fluorescent probes from each clinically used polyene by conjugating a common fluorophore to a conserved functional group, preserving the amphoteric nature and ergosterol&#8208;dependent antifungal activity of the parent drug while enabling live&#8208;cell imaging. This unified design allowed direct comparison of localization and trafficking across Candida species, including sterol biosynthesis mutants with a high level of polyene resistance. The probes revealed structure&#8208;specific distribution patterns, with resistant strains showing enhanced accumulation within the vacuole lumen for all three polyenes. These findings suggest that vacuolar sequestration contributes to polyene resistance and may represent an unrecognized aspect of the fungal stress response. More broadly, this work provides the first direct visual evidence that polyene structure dictates subcellular distribution patterns in fungal cells.

         <title>Stepwise Reduction of Ruthenium and Growth of Magnetic Structure During Hydrothermal Crystallisation of SrRu2O6 from KRuO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ neutron powder diffraction data collected while heating the Ru(VII) reagent KRuO4 in the presence of aqueous Sr2+ reveal the crystallisation of a Ru(VI) oxyhydroxide before the expected Ru(V) oxide; at the same time evolution of antiferromagnetism in the final SrRu2O6 product follows the growth of its crystal structure.








Abstract
Using a new design of hydrothermal reactor constructed from a null&#8208;scattering TiZr alloy in situ powder neutron diffraction data are collected to follow the crystallisation of the Ru(V)&#8208;containing high temperature antiferromagnet SrRu2O6. Full pattern fitting allows quantitative analysis of the evolution of crystalline phases during reaction, revealing the decay of the Ru(VII) precursor KRuO4, the transient presence of the Ru(VI) oxyhydroxide SrRuO3(OD)2 and the eventual growth of SrRu2O6. At 140&#160;&#176;C crystallisation is retarded, prolonging the lifetime of SrRuO3(OD)2, while at 180&#160;&#176;C complete formation of SrRu2O6 is observed. At the same time, evolution of the magnetic Bragg peak intensities resulting from the antiferromagnetic ordering of Ru(V) moments in SrRu2O6 is seen. This unique observation is possible since crystallisation occurs below the N&#233;el temperature of the material. The magnetic structure is found to grow concurrently with the atomic structure, with calculated magnetic moment per Ru consistent with ex situ studies at the same temperatures. The reported experiment design will be applicable for the study of many other families of inorganic materials that crystallise under solvothermal conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a new design of hydrothermal reactor constructed from a null-scattering TiZr alloy in situ powder neutron diffraction data are collected to follow the crystallisation of the Ru(V)-containing high temperature antiferromagnet SrRu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Full pattern fitting allows quantitative analysis of the evolution of crystalline phases during reaction, revealing the decay of the Ru(VII) precursor KRuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the transient presence of the Ru(VI) oxyhydroxide SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OD)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the eventual growth of SrRu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. At 140&#160;&#176;C crystallisation is retarded, prolonging the lifetime of SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OD)&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; while at 180&#160;&#176;C complete formation of SrRu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is observed. At the same time, evolution of the magnetic Bragg peak intensities resulting from the antiferromagnetic ordering of Ru(V) moments in SrRu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is seen. This unique observation is possible since crystallisation occurs below the N&#233;el temperature of the material. The magnetic structure is found to grow concurrently with the atomic structure, with calculated magnetic moment per Ru consistent with ex situ studies at the same temperatures. The reported experiment design will be applicable for the study of many other families of inorganic materials that crystallise under solvothermal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN): Responsive Chemical Tools for Delivering an Emerging Gasotransmitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
HCN is an important biological mediator, joining NO, CO, and H2S as a regulatory gasotransmitter. This report outlines the design, development, and application of responsive, activatable, and tunable HCN donors. In&#8208;solution kinetics and selectivity data, as well as demonstration of HCN delivery in live cell environments, support the effectiveness of this broad approach for the delivery of HCN in biological environments.








Abstract
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is an emerging gasotransmitter, joining NO, CO, and H2S in a group of important endogenous signaling and regulatory molecules. Despite this importance, synthetic HCN donors that respond to broadly tunable stimuli remain absent. Here, I report a platform approach for developing synthetic HCN donors that can be tuned to release HCN on demand in response to endogenous stimuli. The reported donors are stable in solution until activated by a specific stimulus, in this case esterases, after which they release a caged cyanohydrin that is spontaneously hydrolyzed in water to generate HCN. This approach is also compatible with responsive self&#8208;immolative 1,6&#8208;elimination platforms, allowing for significant modification of release rates, while providing a general, modular, and tunable platform for HCN delivery in response to specific stimuli. Moreover, the developed donors are shown to release HCN in live cells, thereby significantly advancing the available approaches for HCN delivery in complex environments.

Synthesis of hydrolytically degradable poly(N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylacrylamide)&#8208;poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone) nanoparticles via reverse sequence polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) at 80&#160;&#176;C is studied by time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS). This technique reveals the formation of molten poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) droplets prior to water addition, a transient lamellar phase, and the mechanism of growth for the final spherical block copolymer nanoparticles.








Abstract
The mechanism of nanoparticle formation during reverse sequence polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is studied by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS). More specifically, N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylacrylamide (DMAC) monomer is added to a trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) precursor and initially polymerized in the bulk at 80&#160;&#176;C via reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. SAXS indicates the unexpected formation of molten PCL droplets dispersed within DMAC monomer. After 5&#160;min (14% DMAC conversion) at 80&#160;&#176;C, the reaction mixture is diluted with water, and the aqueous milieu is analyzed using a flow cell. A transient lamellar phase is formed immediately after water addition that subsequently transforms into nascent spherical nanoparticles. During the remaining DMAC polymerization, the overall nanoparticle diameter remains essentially constant with a concomitant reduction in the PCL core radius and the aggregation number. This suggests that individual PCL&#8208;PDMAC chains are in equilibrium with the nanoparticles. SAXS analysis indicates that the amorphous PCL cores have a mean diameter of 8.8&#160;nm at 80&#160;&#176;C: X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies confirm that such nanoscale confinement prevents their crystallization on cooling to 20&#160;&#176;C. Finally, this formulation can be combined with crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA): UV&#8208;initiated DMAC polymerization at 15&#160;&#176;C produces rod&#8208;like PCL&#8208;PDMAC nanoparticles with semicrystalline PCL cores.

         <title>De Novo Design of Hexamer&#8208;Linker Dual&#8208;Action Nano&#8208;PROTAC for Tumor&#8208;Specific Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a self&#8208;assembled, ROS&#8208;responsive hexamer&#8208;linker Nano&#8208;PROTAC with a &#8220;double&#8208;gated&#8221; system for EGFR targeting. It enables efficient degradation of proteins of various sizes via adaptive spatial regulation. Successful GPX4 degradation induced tumor&#8208;specific ferroptosis in mice, demonstrating enhanced efficacy and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity.








Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology, a groundbreaking approach in drug discovery, leverages the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system to degrade disease&#8208;related proteins. Its efficacy mainly hinges on the linker design, which critically influences ternary complex (target protein&#8208;PROTAC&#8208;E3 ligase) stability and pharmacokinetics. However, optimizing linkers for diverse targets remains challenging due to complex structure&#8208;activity relationships and laborious synthesis processes. Herein, we developed a self&#8208;assembled hexamer&#8208;linker Nano&#8208;PROTACs, which was capable of self&#8208;regulating spatial distances, enabling efficient degradation of proteins with different sizes. This barrel&#8208;like hexamer&#8208;linker has a very wide range of universality, enabling the degradation of multiple size proteins (e.g., 22, 55 and 68&#160;kDa), with a degradation efficiency of up to 99%. More importantly, compared to a linear linker, the plasma stability of this self&#8208;assembled hexamer&#8208;linker increased by 48 times. Using Nano&#8208;PROTAC with &#8220;double&#8208;gated&#8221; system combining epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting and ROS&#8208;responsiveness, degradation of the challenging protein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) was achieved on mouse models, inducing tumor&#8208;specific ferroptosis with reduced off&#8208;target toxicity. This spatially adaptable hexamer&#8208;linker Nano&#8208;PROTAC system offers a universal strategy to streamline PROTAC development, highlighting its transformative potential for targeted protein degradation therapeutics.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assemblies Regulate the Catalytic Activity of Peptide Fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic self&#8208;assembling peptides (cSAPs) form fibrils that catalyze the retro&#8208;aldol reaction of Methodol. Co&#8208;assembly with inactive peptides tunes catalytic efficiency by altering substrate accessibility and the distance to the nucleophilic lysine. This approach enables precise engineering of catalytic domains and activities in peptide&#8208;based catalytic nanostructures. 



Abstract
Short peptide sequences self&#8208;assemble into supramolecular structures through intermolecular interactions, creating a microenvironment in which chemical reactions can be catalyzed. In recent years, many peptide sequences have shown to demonstrate catalytic activity upon nanostructure formation, but the engineering of the catalytic microenvironment through co&#8208;assembly strategies have not been explored. We introduce a peptide sequence that gains retro&#8208;aldolase activity upon assembly to supramolecular peptide fibrils in aqueous buffer solution (pH 7.4). The catalytic activity is first optimized through synthetic sequence variation and the structure formation properties of the peptides are characterized. Co&#8208;assembly with inactive peptide sequences enables the up&#8208; or downregulation of the catalytic activity over a dynamic range, by modulating the likelihood for substrate interaction and thus the distance of the substrate to the nucleophilic lysine at the active site. It is observed that co&#8208;assemblies with positively charged sequences increase activity, whereas negatively charged peptide sequences decrease activity. We show that the emerging field of peptide&#8208;based catalysts can be further advanced by the engineering of the catalytic domain using heterogeneous supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Lewis Acid Adsorption Promotes CO2 Enrichment for Efficient Formic Acid Electrosynthesis on Reconstructed Bi2O2CO3 in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zr&#8208;oxo node clusters in porphyrin coordination network were decorated on bismuth oxycarbonate as well&#8208;defined Lewis acid sites, enabling enhanced CO2 adsorption/activation and facilitated hydrogenation to form the *OCHO intermediate. This synergy boosts the electrocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction to formic acid in acidic electrolytes.








Abstract
In acidic media, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to formic acid (HCOOH) represents a promising strategy for producing value&#8208;added chemicals. However, a critical challenge persists in enhancing CO2 adsorption and activation to suppress hydrogen evolution and boost product selectivity. Here, a Lewis acidic Zr&#8208;oxo cluster&#8208;rich porous confined structure decorated Bi2O2CO3 catalyst (Bi2O2CO3@PCN) is constructed via in situ electroreconstruction, which effectively promotes surface CO2 enrichment and K+ confinement in acidic conditions. Spatially adjacent Zr&#8208;oxo clusters enhance CO2 adsorption at the interface through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, facilitating the *OCHO intermediate formation. The optimized Bi2O2CO3@PCN catalyst achieves a high HCOOH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95% across a broad potential window and demonstrates a 5.9&#8208;fold higher mass activity compared to Bi2O2CO3 in acidic media at &#8210;1.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Notably, Bi2O2CO3@PCN exhibits superior HCOOH FE compared to Bi2O2CO3 under low&#8208;concentration CO2 flow. Mechanistically, the strong binding of CO2 molecules at Bi&#8211;O&#8211;Zr interfacial sites significantly lowers the hydrogenation barrier, while K+ enrichment repels protons and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. This work underscores the pivotal role of surface confinement and Lewis acidic sites in regulating interfacial microenvironments and CO2 adsorption, highlighting their potential for efficient conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2.

         <dc:description>
Biomimetic hourglass&#8208;shaped covalent organic framework (COF) membranes fabricated via scalable spray coating enable efficient H2/CO2 separation. The sandwich architecture&#8212;large&#8208;pore sulfonated COF outer layers and narrow&#8208;pore guanidinium COF middle layer&#8212;achieves high H2 permeance and selectivity. Large&#8208;area membranes (5000 cm2) show robust stability and outperform PSA in H2 recovery (94.3%).








Abstract
Efficient hydrogen purification from methanol steam reforming (MSR) faces challenges due to H2/CO2 kinetic diameter overlap and energy&#8208;intensive traditional methods. Here, we report a biomimetic hourglass&#8208;shaped covalent organic framework (COF) membrane via sequential spray coating of opposite charged COF nanosheets, mimicking aquaporin&#8208;like hierarchical channels. The sandwich structure (large&#8208;pore sulfonated COF outer layers, narrow&#8208;pore guanidinium COF middle layer) enables dual&#8208;functionality: outer TpBD&#8208;SO3H layers perform as the diffusion chamber (2.5&#160;nm pores) and protective layer, whereas the middle TpTGCl layer (0.8&#160;nm pores) traps CO2 via strong electrostatic interactions. The membrane achieves a H2 permeance of 2833 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of 21, surpassing the 2008 Robeson upper bound. Spray coating enables scalable fabrication of 5000 cm2 defect&#8208;free membranes on porous substrate with high mechanical stability and chemical resistance (mass loss&#160;&lt;&#160;0.3% in 150&#160;&#176;C methanol). Separation process simulations show a two&#8208;stage system boosts H2 purity to 96.7% with 94.3% recovery, outperforming pressure swing adsorption (PSA) in efficiency and energy consumption. This modular design offers a sustainable, scalable solution for industrial hydrogen purification and gas separation.

         <title>Domain&#8208;Trained Language Model for Inverse Design and Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Storage MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domain&#8208;specific language model (MOFs&#8208;LLM), trained on over 6&#160;000 MOF&#8208;related publications and 15&#160;000 structures, enables inverse design of synthetically accessible hydrogen storage MOFs. Integrating chemical knowledge and structural reasoning, MOFs&#8208;LLM identifies top&#8208;performing candidates and guides the successful synthesis of Cu&#8208;LLMs&#8208;1, achieving 1.33&#160;wt% H2 uptake at 25&#176;C.








Abstract
A domain&#8208;specific large language model, MOFs&#8208;LLM, is developed to accelerate the inverse design and synthesis of metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs) for hydrogen storage. Trained on 210 million tokens derived from over 6&#160;000 MOF&#8208;related publications and 15&#160;000 crystal structures, the model integrates chemical knowledge with structural features to improve structure&#8211;property reasoning. Compared to baseline methods, MOFs&#8208;LLM achieves a 46.7% enhancement in capturing structure&#8211;property relationships. It enables the inverse design of 60 candidate frameworks optimized for both hydrogen storage performance and synthetic accessibility. Guided by the model, a novel MOF (Cu&#8208;LLMs&#8208;1) was synthesized in three experimental iterations, exhibiting a hydrogen uptake of 1.33&#160;wt% at room temperature, ranking among the top five pure MOFs under comparable conditions. These findings highlight the potential of domain&#8208;trained language models to bridge virtual screening and experimental realization in materials discovery.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole Frameworks with sur&#8208;a Topology for Coupling Photoactivation of Oxygen and Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel crystalline three&#8208;dimensional covalent thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole frameworks with sur&#8208;a net were successfully synthesized and served as efficient catalysts for coupling photoactivation of oxygen and biomass. 








Abstract
Developing new topological three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) structures with strong electron donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) properties represents a promising approach for harvesting high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. In this study, we developed two unprecedented 3D COFs with sur&#8208;a topology by [3&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;4]&#8208;c strategy. The formation of sur&#8208;a topological structures relies on an elongated [3&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;c tetrahedral thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (DTZ)&#8208;based building block (DTZ&#8208;CHO) with lower C2&#8208;symmetry. This unit is formed by inserting linear asymmetric DTZ subunit (2&#8208;c vertex) between two 3&#8208;c vertices. The incorporation of strong DTZ&#8208;pyrene/vinyl electron D&#8211;A structures efficiently promote exciton separation and charge transfer during photocatalysis, thereby demonstrating high&#8208;efficiency coupling photoactivation performance toward oxygen and biomass. It delivers a hydrogen peroxide photosynthesis rate of &#8764;12&#8201;092&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 based on four&#8208;step direct Yeager&#8208;type oxygen photoreduction mechanism on DTZ active centers, pairing with efficient 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural photooxidation (&#8764;10&#8201;264&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). This work highlights the potential of topologically unique 3D COFs with robust D&#8208;A structures as high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.

This unit is formed by inserting linear asymmetric DTZ subunit (2-c vertex) between two 3-c vertices. The incorporation of strong DTZ-pyrene/vinyl electron D&#8211;A structures efficiently promote exciton separation and charge transfer during photocatalysis, thereby demonstrating high-efficiency coupling photoactivation performance toward oxygen and biomass. It delivers a hydrogen peroxide photosynthesis rate of &#8764;12&#8201;092&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; based on four-step direct Yeager-type oxygen photoreduction mechanism on DTZ active centers, pairing with efficient 5-hydroxymethylfurfural photooxidation (&#8764;10&#8201;264&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work highlights the potential of topologically unique 3D COFs with robust D-A structures as high-efficiency photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Two tetrapodal triptycene&#8208;based light&#8208;driven molecular motors with precisely oriented rotation axes&#8212;parallel or perpendicular to a gold surface&#8212;achieve full 360&#176; rotation in both solution and as monolayers.

Abstract
Two light&#8208;driven molecular motors, fused to a triptycene&#8208;based tetrapodal platform, with rotational axes oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the surface, were successfully designed and synthesized. Both systems demonstrated complete 360&#176; rotation cycles, efficient photoswitching at 385&#160;&#177;&#160;5&#160;nm (reaching &#8764;90% at the photostationary state), and quantitative thermal helix inversion with half&#8208;lives of &#8764;7&#160;min at 20&#160;&#176;C. When assembled as monolayers on gold surfaces, the motors retained their full rotational functionality, demonstrating the ability of the tetrapodal platform to minimize surface interactions. These findings highlight the potential of these systems for applications in surface&#8208;integrated molecular devices and machines.

         <title>Tailored Core&#8208;Shell Nanocarrier for Therapeutic Drug Delivery via Visible Light Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell nanocarrier activated by visible light, composed of poly(3&#8208;octylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (POT), iron oxide (II, III) (Fe3O4), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and trazodone tetraphenylborate (TRZ+ TPB&#8722;). During POT photooxidation (POT+), TRZ+ is liberated driven by the maintenance of particle's electroneutrality. The inorganic&#8208;organic POT/Fe3O4 heterojunction facilitates accurate dosage under mild irradiation, demonstrating a novel conductive polymer&#8208;based delivery platform. FPOT and FTRZ: fluorescence of POT and TRZ. 








Abstract
We present a novel drug delivery nanocarrier consisting of 300&#160;nm&#8208;sized POT/Fe3O4/TRZ+TPB&#8722; nanoparticles (NPs). The mechanism is based on the (photo)oxidation of poly(3&#8208;octylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (POT) (from POT0 to POT+), which facilitates the release of the positively charged drug trazodone (TRZ+) encapsulated in the NPs. The primary factor guiding the overall process is the maintenance of the electroneutrality condition in each NP. The incorporation of a Fe3O4 element enables the formation of an organic&#8208;inorganic heterojunction (Fe3O4/POT) in the core of the NP. This heterojunction permits us to utilize visible light to induce the POT photooxidation to trigger the release of TRZ+, unlike other platforms based on a more energetic illumination requirement. The developed nanocarrier allows for a controlled drug release, achieving doses of 3.5&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1 of TRZ under 530&#160;nm irradiation, 2.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1 at 625&#160;nm, and 1.6&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1 at 470&#160;nm within 1 h. The delivery is tested in undiluted blood serum, achieving an efficiency exceeding 90%. Overall, the integration of magnetic properties with a conductive polymer along with the adjustment of the band gap to enhance photooxidation performance in the visible range, constitute the conceptual innovation behind the controlled drug delivery system here presented, with TRZ as a model.

         <title>Cyclically Dynamic Defect Management Enables High&#8208;efficiency Sn&#9472;Pb Perovskite Photovoltaics with Enhanced Photostability and Fatigue Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active metallocene interlayer enables dynamic defect management in Sn&#9472;Pb perovskite solar cells by suppressing crystallographic imperfections and cyclically healing light&#8208;induced defects, significantly enhancing photostability and fatigue resistance under prolonged light cycling, resulting in 23.59% efficient devices with prolonged operational lifetimes.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have showcased great promise to approach the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit. Despite continuously proven elevated power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), the practical application and commercial use of Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs are hindered by poor photostability and anti&#8208;fatigue performance. These issues arise from multiple intrinsic imperfections formed during crystallization and light&#8208;triggered defects generated during device operation under intermittent illumination. Herein, we introduced a novel &#8220;dynamic defect management&#8221; (DDM) strategy that mitigated photodegradation of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites and significantly enhanced the device lifespan. The strong coordination between metallocene intercalation and metal cations (Pb2+/Sn2+) within the perovskite lattice effectively passivated the crystallographic defects, reduced the defect densities by 34.5% and suppressed the non&#8208;radiative recombination. Furthermore, the metallocene and corresponding cation could function as a redox pair, offering a dynamic and continuous healing mechanism to restore the light&#8208;induced defects in a cyclical manner. Additionally, the metallocene interlayer itself acted as a shield against the ultraviolet radiation during the light aging process. Consequently, we achieved decent PCEs up to 23.59% for the mixed Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs modified with DDM strategy, 14.7% higher than that of the reference devices, accompanied by enhanced photostability which witnessed a 7&#8208;fold enhancement compared to the pristine device under MPP operation tracking and remarkable anti&#8208;fatigue performance, retaining 83% of the original PCE after 22 accelerated fatigue test cycles (12/12&#160;h UV light/dark cycle).

         <title>Topological Structure Design of Ether Solvents for Lithium Storage Chemistry in Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal a synergistic mechanism involving electronic effects (electropositivity defined by ESPmax/electronegativity defined by ESPmin) and volume effect that modulates lithium storage behavior. An increase in |ESPmin|&#160;&#8722;&#160;ESPmax and a reduction in solvent volume facilitate the co&#8208;intercalation reaction. The solvent with enriched base structures and shortened terminal alkyl chains exhibits enhanced co&#8208;intercalation propensity. 








Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes hold great promise for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their low melting points and viscosities. However, their strong solvation ability promotes detrimental Li+&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation, leading to graphite exfoliation and limiting practical applications. Here, we employ topological structure engineering of ether solvents and demonstrate a synergistic mechanism of electronic effects (electropositivity defined by ESPmax/electronegativity defined by ESPmin) and volume of solvent in modulating lithium storage behavior in graphite. We demonstrate that increased stability (as indicated by enhanced |ESPmin|&#160;&#8722;&#160;ESPmax) and reduced volume of Li+&#8208;solvent complexes enhance the tendency for co&#8208;intercalation. This necessitates the use of solvents featuring enriched base structures (&#9472;C2H4O&#9472;) and shorter terminal alkyl chain lengths (&#9472;C2H4). Furthermore, we reveal that the primary cause of capacity decay during Li+&#8208;ether co&#8208;intercalation processes is the continuous rupture and reformation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This work provides new insights into designing ether&#8208;based electrolytes that compatible with graphite, paving a new way to develop high&#8208;performance LIBs.

&lt;p&gt;We reveal a synergistic mechanism involving electronic effects (electropositivity defined by ESP&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/electronegativity defined by ESP&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;) and volume effect that modulates lithium storage behavior. An increase in |ESP&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;|&#160;&#8722;&#160;ESP&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and a reduction in solvent volume facilitate the co-intercalation reaction. The solvent with enriched base structures and shortened terminal alkyl chains exhibits enhanced co-intercalation propensity. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ether-based electrolytes hold great promise for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their low melting points and viscosities. However, their strong solvation ability promotes detrimental Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-solvent co-intercalation, leading to graphite exfoliation and limiting practical applications. Here, we employ topological structure engineering of ether solvents and demonstrate a synergistic mechanism of electronic effects (electropositivity defined by ESP&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/electronegativity defined by ESP&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;) and volume of solvent in modulating lithium storage behavior in graphite. We demonstrate that increased stability (as indicated by enhanced |ESP&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;|&#160;&#8722;&#160;ESP&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and reduced volume of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-solvent complexes enhance the tendency for co-intercalation. This necessitates the use of solvents featuring enriched base structures (&#9472;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&#9472;) and shorter terminal alkyl chain lengths (&#9472;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Furthermore, we reveal that the primary cause of capacity decay during Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ether co-intercalation processes is the continuous rupture and reformation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This work provides new insights into designing ether-based electrolytes that compatible with graphite, paving a new way to develop high-performance LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Cyclization of 1,3&#8208;Dienes Toward &#945;&#8208;Chiral Six&#8208;Membered Silacycles</title>

         <dc:description>
Here, we realized highly enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral 6&#8208;membered silacycles with broad functional group compatibility by developing two nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive [4&#160;+&#160;2] cyclizations of 1,3&#8208;dienes. Our strategy represents the first reductive cyclization involving both C&#8211;Si bond and C&#8211;C bond formation.









Abstract
Chiral organosilanes are increasingly important in synthetic, medicinal, and materials chemistry. However, the enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral six&#8208;membered silacycles remains unexplored. Here, we report two nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive [4&#160;+&#160;2] cyclizations of 1,3&#8208;dienes using readily available chloromethyl chlorosilane or 1,2&#8208;dichlorodisilane as dielectrophiles, proceeding via distinct mechanisms. Our strategy represents the first reductive cyclization involving both C&#8211;Si bond and C&#8211;C bond formation and enables efficient and highly enantioselective access to &#945;&#8208;chiral silacyclohexenes and 1,2&#8208;disilacyclohexenes with broad functional group compatibility. Further derivatizations demonstrate the potential of this method for constructing valuable chiral silicon building blocks, underscoring its synthetic utility.

         <title>Ultrabroadband 1D and 2D NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimal control&#8208;derived saturation pulses allow 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy covering spectral ranges in the MHz range. Next to a multitude of nuclei even multinuclear spectra are possible.








Abstract
The chemical shift range of many NMR&#8208;active isotopes cannot be excited in a single experiment by classical hard pulse high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy or even conventional broadband excitation. Such nuclei can be addressed by specifically optimized saturation pulses or xy&#8208;excitation, which are derived from linear frequency sweeps that are further optimized using methods derived from optimal control theory. A multi&#8208;isotope 1D experiment covering 6&#160;MHz as well as homonuclear COSY and heteronuclear HMBC experiments covering more than 100&#160;kHz are demonstrated, which can be adapted to fit any needs for specific isotopes at any spectrometer field. In general, the approach is very useful for 1D and 2D absolute value overview spectra at high magnetic fields and/or wideband and low&#8208;gamma nuclei.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative C&#9472;C Cleavage in Lignin&#8208;Derived Oligomers and Biological Funneling of the Monomeric Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic aerobic oxidation under aqueous alkaline conditions promotes C&#8211;C cleavage in pine&#8208; and poplar&#8208;derived lignin oligomers, accessing high yields of aromatic monomers. The monomeric phenols obtained from this process then undergo effective biological conversion into cis,cis&#8208;muconic acid and 2&#8208;pyrone&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid using engineered strains of Pseudomonas putida.








Abstract
Existing methods for lignin deconstruction to aromatic monomers primarily cleave carbon&#8211;oxygen bonds within the polymer, resulting in sub&#8208;optimal monomer yields and formation of oligomers that retain intact carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Here, we demonstrate that copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation under aqueous alkaline conditions promotes oxidative cleavage of carbon&#8211;carbon bonds in lignin oligomers derived from reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of pine and poplar biomass. Fundamental insights are gained from reactions of model compounds that resemble subunits present in RCF oligomers. Optimal results are achieved in a flow reactor that provides precise control over O2 delivery, temperature, and reaction residence time. The Cu&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation conditions access aromatic monomers in 19 and 34 wt% monomer yields, respectively, from pine&#8208; and poplar&#8208;derived RCF oligomers. Overall, the sequence consisting of biomass RCF into monomers and oligomers followed by oxidative deconstruction of the RCF oligomers generates substantially higher yields of aromatic monomers from lignin. Engineered strains of Pseudomonas putida support biological funneling of the oligomer&#8208;derived oxygenated aromatic compounds into cis,cis&#8208;muconic acid from pine or 2&#8208;pyrone&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid from poplar.

         <title>Halogen Co&#8208;Mixing&#8212;An Effective Strategy for Optimizing Luminescent Performance of Copper&#8208;Based Hybrid Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research reports a novel strategy&#8211;halogen co&#8208;mixing (HCM) to prepare a copper hybrid scintillator. By shortening the Cu&#8211;Cu distance and increasing lattice asymmetry, it achieved an ultrahigh PLQY of 99.5% and light yield of 146k phonons MeV&#8722;1, which proved the effective optimization of HCM to PL and RL properties of luminescent materials. Based on it, a scintillation screen with a resolution of 30 lp mm&#8722;1 was prepared and applied in various scenes.








Abstract
Recently, copper&#8208;based hybrid scintillators have emerged as a popular research area. However, its development remains in its infancy, and there is an urgent need to explore copper&#8208;based scintillator materials with superior performance. Herein, we proposed an effective strategy of halogen co&#8208;mixing (HCM) to develop a copper&#8208;based hybrid scintillator with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 99.5% and an ultrahigh light yield (LY) of 145896 phonons MeV&#8722;1. Its light yield exceeds that of all commercial scintillators and is currently the highest record in copper&#8208;based hybrid scintillators. Based on this, a flexible imaging screen with a fantastic resolution of 30 lp mm&#8722;1 was prepared, which is able to meet various application requirements. More importantly, two monohalogen compounds were synthesized for the analysis of optimization mechanisms. After detailed comparative study, it was found that the HCM strategy effectively optimize the luminescence of copper&#8208;based hybrid scintillators by increasing the lattice asymmetry and shortening the Cu&#8211;Cu distance in the inorganic module. The proposal of HCM strategy has significant guiding significance for the development of high&#8208;performance scintillator materials.

         <title>Homogeneous SnF2&#8208;Induced Strain Modulation in Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

A precise additive regulation strategy using phenylethylammonium chloride (PEACl) enables uniform distribution of SnF2 at grain boundaries via hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance. This suppresses SnF2 phase segregation, promotes homogeneous Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite crystallization, and effectively releases lattice strain, resulting in efficient and stable all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Tin fluoride (SnF2) serves as an indispensable antioxidant in Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells, playing a critical role in the development of efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem architectures. However, excessive SnF2 often suffers from aggregation challenges, inevitably causing phase separation and tensile strain within the perovskite films, severely compromising device efficiency and stability. In this study, we report a precise regulation strategy by employing phenylethylammonium chloride (PEACl) to modulate the distribution of excess SnF2. The hydrogen bonding between PEACl and SnF2, coupled with steric hindrance effects, enables uniform dispersion of SnF2 at grain boundaries, effectively suppressing SnF2 phase segregation and promoting homogeneous crystallization of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites. Moreover, it is revealed that the precise regulation of SnF2 distribution through PEACl effectively releases local strain in perovskite thin films. Single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb devices treated with the SnF2+PEACl demonstrate an exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.52%, substantially outperforming control devices at 20.83%. The optimized two&#8208;terminal (2&#8208;T) monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells achieve a remarkable PCE of 28.89%. Notably, these tandem devices maintain over 80% of their initial efficiency after continuous operation at maximum power point under one&#8208;sun illumination for 670&#160;h, exhibiting excellent long&#8208;term stability.

A nonheme iron enzyme, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtLDOX), was repurposed to catalyze the enantioselective synthesis of a series of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives via a 1,3&#8208;migratory nitrene C&#9472;H insertion process involving hydrogen atom transfer and radical rebound steps.








Abstract
Nonheme iron enzymes are among nature's most versatile catalysts for molecular functionalization. Engineering nonheme enzymes for abiological reactions unlocks new catalytic possibilities beyond the limits of natural evolution. In this work, we engineered a nonheme enzyme, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtLDOX), to catalyze an asymmetric 1,3&#8208;migratory nitrene C(sp3)&#9472;H insertion reaction. Through directed evolution, the final optimized AtLDOX_LS variant efficiently delivers a range of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids derivatives with exceptional activity and enantioselectivity (up to 81% yield, 850 total turnover number, and 98:2 enantiomeric ratio). Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of radical intermediates for this transformation. This work advances the biocatalytic toolbox for radical involved transformations and broadens the scope of enzymatic migration chemistry.

         <dc:description>
A chiral narrow&#8208;band fluorophore undergoes aging&#8208;induced enhancement of fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals in the aggregate state, accompanied by a light&#8208;triggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) transition. The fusion strategy provides a straightforward and facile approach for constructing CPL materials with robust chiroptical performance.








Abstract
The development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials has garnered considerable interest owing to their promising applications in areas such as 3D displays and information encryption, with most efforts devoted to generating CPL activity and improving the dissymmetry factor (glum). However, the essential requirement of narrow&#8208;band emission for high&#8208;resolution organic optoelectronic applications is often overlooked. Here we employed the anthracene group as strong assembly unit and BODIPY as narrow&#8208;band fluorophore to construct with chiral binaphthyl moiety. The resulting compounds R/S&#8208;An&#8208;BDP displayed light&#8208;triggered transformation from aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) with CPL signals regulation. Moreover, R/S&#8208;An&#8208;BDP showed aging&#8208;driven narrow&#8208;band fluorescence with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 14&#160;nm and CPL activity with the |glum| value of 0.048 in the aggregate state, attributed to the combined effect of BODIPY and anthracene unit. These findings highlight a functional group fusion strategy for constructing CPL materials with large glum values and narrow emission, offering a promising approach towards high&#8208;performance CPL materials.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Carbonylative Ketone Synthesis Employing a Radical Sorting Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolytic&#8208;Ni&#8208;catalyzed general synthesis of ketones was reported, utilizing radicals and carbon monoxide as partners. The radical sorting effect was proposed within an outer sphere addition mechanism of alkyl radicals to Ni&#8208;stabilized ketyl radicals, thereby facilitating selectivity among different radicals. This protocol allows for a broad range of alkyl combinations, including numerous 13C&#8208;labeled amino acids and steroids.








Abstract
The construction of ketones with bulky units is a long&#8208;standing challenge for established nucleophilic addition or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling. In this work, a different route is reported to build bulky ketones ab initio that exploits the radical sorting effect in three&#8208;component cross coupling with electrolytic Ni catalysis. The sorting effect enables the selective construction of ketones, including all possible combinations of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl groups. In particular, the radical sorting pathway allows for efficient CO utilization and the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled ketones with a minimum amount of 13CO. In addition, square wave voltammetry was adopted as a quick tool to identify the catalyst driving both electron transfer and bond formation.

         <title>Biodegradable Nano&#8208;Regulator Reprograms Glioblastoma Immunosuppression: Pyroptosis&#8208;Metabolism&#8208;Immunity Crosstalk for Cascading Immune Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for glioma immunotherapy is reported based on a biodegradable nano&#8208;regulator that is formed by biomineralizing Mn2+ with cholesterol oxidase (CHOx) and pyruvate oxidase (POx), loading the cytokine LIGHT, and coating with glioma cell membrane. It precisely targets tumors to induce pyroptosis, reprogram immunosuppressive metabolism, and amplify immunity, ultimately provoking a robust antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Glioblastoma's (GBM) resistance to immunotherapy is primarily attributed to its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME), characterized by metabolic dysregulation and immune desertification. To tackle these challenges, we developed an innovative immune&#8208;activating nano&#8208;regulator (MnCP&#8208;LIGHT@GL) by biomineralizing with Mn2+, cholesterol oxidase (CHOx) and pyruvate oxidase (POx), and loading tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14 (LIGHT) and functionalizing with glioma cell membranes for efficient immunotherapy of GBM. MnCP&#8208;LIGHT@GL with dual enzyme activities successfully triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;dependent caspase&#8208;1&#8208;mediated pyroptosis through Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction, which is improved by the H2O2 generated from the oxidation of endogenous cholesterol and pyruvate. Concurrently, ChOx and POx disrupt cholesterol metabolism and the Warburg effect, reducing the accumulation of immunosuppressive metabolites (cholesterol and lactic acid) within TME. LIGHT drives tumor vessel normalization, induces the formation of tumor&#8208;associated high endothelial venules (TA&#8208;HEVs), and promotes the neogenesis of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). These LIGHT&#8208;mediated structural alterations synergize with damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from pyroptotic cells, collectively promoting the infiltration, and activation of immune cells into the tumor site, further potentiating the anti&#8208;tumor immune response. This study establishes a novel therapeutic paradigm against GBM immunosuppressive TME through the synergistic effect of immunogenic cell death, metabolic reprogramming, and immune amplification.

&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy for glioma immunotherapy is reported based on a biodegradable nano-regulator that is formed by biomineralizing Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with cholesterol oxidase (CHOx) and pyruvate oxidase (POx), loading the cytokine LIGHT, and coating with glioma cell membrane. It precisely targets tumors to induce pyroptosis, reprogram immunosuppressive metabolism, and amplify immunity, ultimately provoking a robust antitumor immune response.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell RNA Imaging via Clickable TriPPPro Nucleotide Reporters</title>

         <dc:description>
The intracellular delivery of trans&#8208;cyclooctene and bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne as sterically demanding groups for the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder was achieved by the triphosphate prodrug (TriPPPro) strategy. Once hydrolyzed inside cells, the modified uridines and cytidines are metabolically incorporated into nascent RNA, are labelled by a dual&#8208;fluorogenic tetrazine&#8208;dye to allow wash&#8208;free, high&#8208;contrast imaging of RNA synthesis in cells. 








Abstract
Understanding RNA synthesis and dynamics in cells requires efficient labeling strategies that are not only compatible with cellular environments but can be performed in living cells. We developed a robust, bio&#8208;orthogonal approach for live&#8208;cell RNA labeling using TriPPPro (triphosphate prodrug) chemistry. This strategy enables the intracellular delivery of sterically demanding nucleoside triphosphates modified with inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA)&#8208;reactive groups, specifically trans&#8208;cyclooctene (2TCOa) and bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN). Once hydrolyzed inside cells, these TriPPPro&#8208;modified uridines and cytidines are metabolically incorporated into nascent RNA by endogenous RNA polymerases. Subsequent IEDDA reaction with a dual&#8208;fluorogenic tetrazine&#8208;cyanine styryl dye conjugate allows wash&#8208;free, high&#8208;contrast imaging of RNA synthesis in cells. We demonstrate efficient RNA labeling, including nucleolar localization and specificity for newly transcribed RNA, validated by transcriptional inhibition and colocalization with ribosomal RNA. Comparative analyses confirm that TriPPPro delivery surpasses conventional transporter&#8208;based systems in both labeling efficiency and cellular compatibility. This platform offers a modular, non&#8208;genetic, and highly specific method for real&#8208;time RNA imaging, with broad applicability for RNA biology and antiviral research.

         <title>Flexible Single&#8208;Crystalline Perovskite Ferroelectric Thin Film for Efficient Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality, flexible single&#8208;crystal ferroelectric thin films (Benzylamine)2CsPb2Br7 are manufactured for efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection with a high sensitivity of 693 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, along with stable output under 1000 bending cycles and large bending angles. The work first reports the flexible ferroelectric single crystal for self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, shedding light on future practical applications.








Abstract
Flexible X&#8208;ray detectors with a direct&#8208;conversion working mode have attracted tremendous attention in security checks, medical diagnostics, industrial inspection, and scientific research. As promising flexible X&#8208;ray detection materials, organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) offer significant advantages, including efficient X&#8208;ray absorption, excellent charge transport, and cost&#8208;effective processing. However, reported flexible OIHP&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors are predominantly limited to polycrystalline materials, which suffer from unavoidable grain boundaries, high defect densities, and poor charge mobility. Herein, we successfully fabricate flexible single&#8208;crystal ferroelectric thin films for efficient self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. Specifically, leveraging the weak van der Waals interactions within the 2D perovskite layers of (benzylamine)2CsPb2Br7, high&#8208;quality, flexible single&#8208;crystal films are manufactured by mechanical exfoliation. Capitalizing on the intrinsic spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric photovoltaics, our flexible device demonstrates exceptional X&#8208;ray sensitivity (693 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2) under zero bias, along with stable output under 1000 bending cycles and different bending angles. As the first demonstration of non&#8208;planar self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection in flexible single&#8208;crystal ferroelectric thin films, this work provides a foundation for future wearable X&#8208;ray detection systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lead&#8208;Free Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites Exhibiting Broad Absorption and Bright Golden Emission for LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A golden&#8208;emitting high&#8208;entropy organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite, (TEA)2(Zr0.18Te0.22Hf0.2Sn0.3Pt0.1)Cl6(TEA&#160;=&#160;tetraethylammonium) was synthesized via room&#8208;temperature solution processing. This material exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;excitable emission and demonstrates potential for LED and x&#8208;ray detection applications.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanomaterials are attractive for optoelectronic applications due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties; however, lead toxicity and stability issues significantly limit their practical use. High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) leverage multi&#8208;principal component synergy to form configurational entropy&#8208;stabilized solid solutions, exhibiting unique physicochemical properties and superior stability arising from atomic&#8208;scale chemical disorder and reconstructed local electronic states. Nevertheless, their luminescence efficiency often requires improvement. Here, we report the room&#8208;temperature synthesis of a novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid high&#8208;entropy perovskite, (TEA)2(Zr0.18Te0.22Hf0.2Sn0.3Pt0.1)Cl6 (TEA&#160;=&#160;tetraethylammonium). Exploiting the synergistic effects among five diverse B&#8208;site cations, this material exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum&#8211;excitable broadband emission, producing a distinct golden light. The study demonstrates that this material retains 80% of its initial photoluminescence intensity after 1 h of continuous ultraviolet irradiation and maintains 60% of its original emission intensity even when heated to 340&#160;K. Furthermore, its facile room&#8208;temperature synthesis facilitates promising applications, such as in light&#8208;emitting diodes and x&#8208;ray detection. These findings provide crucial insights for advancing the development of efficient and stable novel optoelectronic materials.

Artificial cells containing urea cycle function are constructed to efficiently convert NH4HCO3 to urea, which are used for ammonia detoxification to rescue cells.








Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up construction of artificial cells helps to understand cell working mechanisms. It is a great challenge to build artificial cells capable of detoxification. Herein, the urea cycle pathway is reconstituted inside artificial cells for ammonium detoxification. The urea cycle pathway involves carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinate lyase, and arginase, which converts NH4HCO3 to urea using a cyclic metabolic pathway. The urea is produced in a stepwise manner with the addition of NH4HCO3 when the cyclic metabolic reaction reaches equilibrium. The urea cycle pathway and NH4HCO3 are encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles to construct artificial cells capable of ammonium detoxification. The urea is produced inside artificial cells with the conversion rate of 61.9%. The concentration of extracellular NH4HCO3 is decreased from 20.0 to 2.3&#160;mM with the addition of 1.5&#215;106&#160;mL&#8722;1 artificial cells, due to the inflow of NH4HCO3 through melittin pores in the membrane and subsequently metabolized by urea cycle pathway. It indicates the ammonium detoxification ability of artificial cells containing urea cycle pathway, which is further proved by rescuing Schwann cells in high concentration of NH4HCO3. This work paves a path to build functional artificial cells with more complicated metabolic networks for their biomedical applications.

         <title>Asymmetrically Fluorinated Alkoxysilane Single&#8208;Solvent Electrolytes Enable High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose (3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)trimethoxy silane (TTMS), which possesses both strong solvating group (&#9472;OCH3) and weakly solvating segment (&#9472;CF3), as a single solvent for lithium battery electrolytes. The optimal electrolyte with abundant contact ion pairs (CIPs) and aggregates (AGGs) facilitates the formation of inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Li surface and cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the NCM811 surface.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich oxide cathodes (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811) represent one of the most promising approaches to achieve high energy density up to 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. However, severe interfacial side reactions occur at both NCM811 cathode and lithium anode at ultrahigh voltages (&gt;4.6&#160;V). To address these issues, various electrolytes have been developed, but they still suffer from electrolyte decomposition, leading to moderate voltages and insufficient cycling. Herein, we introduce (3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)trimethoxy silane (TTMS) as an asymmetrically fluorinated single solvent, which incorporates both strongly solvating (&#9472;OCH3) and weakly solvating (&#9472;CF3) groups. The designed 2.1&#160;mol L&#8722;1 (M) LiFSI/TTMS electrolyte achieves excellent compatibility with both NCM811 cathode and Li metal anode due to its unique anion&#8208;dominating solvation structures and inorganic&#8208;rich interphase formation. Consequently, it enables stable cycling in the Li||NCM811 battery at an ultrahigh voltage of 4.8&#160;V, with 84.5% capacity retention after 300 cycles. Even under more aggressive conditions, including high temperature (60&#160;&#176;C) and anode&#8208;less configuration (N/P ratio&#160;=&#160;1.76), the Li||NCM811 battery exhibits remarkable capacity retention (&gt;80%) over 300 cycles. This work underscores the effectiveness of electrolyte engineering for developing ultrahigh&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycling battery systems.

         <title>Crystal Structures and Intermolecular Interactions in &#945;$\alpha$&#8208; and &#946;$\beta$&#8208;phosgene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite its notorious reputation as a war gas, phosgene (COCl2${\rm COCl}_2$) is one of the most important intermediate chemicals in industry. In this study, we present the crystal structures of two phosgene polymorphs as deduced from powder neutron diffraction and show which intermolecular interactions stabilise the different modifications. The first inelastic neutron scattering spectra show an unusual separation of the translational and librational modes, alongside sharp bands for the internal modes.








Abstract
The crystal structures of &#945;$\alpha$&#8208; and &#946;$\beta$&#8208;phosgene have been elucidated on the basis of variable temperature neutron powder diffraction. Although the stable &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;phase closely mirrors the published structure (I41/a$I4_1/a$, No.&#160;88), the new metastable &#946;$\beta$&#8208;phase crystallises in Cmc21$Cmc2_1$ (No. 36, at 135&#160;K: a&#160;= 10.244042(22) &#197;, b&#160;= 6.280321(21) &#197;, c&#160;= 5.46069(4) &#197;). Both modifications show dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, but only &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;phosgene shows pronounced &#963;$\sigma$&#8208;hole interactions. Quantum chemical calculations in both solid state and of model dimers in gas&#8208;phase reveal a complex interplay of intermolecular interactions. The first inelastic neutron scattering spectra of &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;phosgene shows an unusual separation of the translational and librational modes, alongside sharp bands for the internal modes. Our computational studies also show an unusual, extensive mixing of the in&#8208;phase C&#8211;Cl stretch (&#957;2$\nu _2$) and the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane bend (&#957;6$\nu _6$) modes, which are symmetry&#8208;forbidden from mixing in the gas&#8208;phase.

         <title>Ribosomal Synthesis of Topologically Defined Thioisoindole&#8208;Bridged Bicyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible in vitro translation (FIT) system&#8208;based strategy for ribosomal synthesis of thioisoindole&#8208;bridged bicyclic (TiB) peptides is developed. The flexizyme substrate Ac&#8208;Ala(NtBA)Sc&#8208;CME is efficiently incorporated into FIT to generate ribosomal peptides bearing N&#8208;terminal Ac&#8208;Ala(NtBA)Sc as the cyclization handle, which after mild deprotection undergo spontaneous cyclization with Cys and Lys to form TiB scaffolds. This platform enables sequence&#8208;diverse topologically bicyclic peptide generation and is fully compatible with mRNA display.








Abstract
Macrocyclic peptides are promising scaffolds for drug discovery due to their structural rigidity and high target specificity. Here, we report a strategy for in vitro ribosomal translation of thioisoindole&#8208;bridged bicyclic peptides. Central to this approach is a newly developed flexizyme substrate, Ac&#8208;Ala(NtBA)Sc&#8208;CME, which features a semicarbazone&#8208;masked 2&#8208;nicotinoyl benzaldehyde sidechain. We show that this amino acid can be efficiently charged onto tRNA with flexizyme and incorporated into ribosomal peptides using a customized flexible in vitro translation (FIT) system. The semicarbazone group can be post&#8208;translationally removed under mild conditions, triggering spontaneous intramolecular cyclization to cysteine and lysine sidechains in the same substrate to yield thioisoindole&#8208;bridged bicyclic (TiB) peptides. This strategy was leveraged to synthesize structurally diverse bicyclic peptides with varying sequences and ring sizes. The method maintains the integrity of mRNA and is therefore compatible with mRNA display, which opens the possibility of constructing topologically defined bicyclic peptide libraries for therapeutic peptide discovery.

This work demonstrates a stable cycling performance in Ah&#8208;level pouch cells under 90% depth of discharge and a low N/P ratio of 2.4, achieved through a (002)&#8208;textured Zn&#8211;Sn alloy anode with lattice orientation anchoring effect that enables rapid interfacial response. 








Abstract
Reversibility of zinc anode under high utilization and rational ampere&#8208;hour (Ah)&#8208;scale evaluation represents a key metrics for practical aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs), but it suffers from uncontrolled host&#8208;less plating/stripping and disordered interfacial behaviors. Herein, we develop a highly (002) plane&#8208;oriented alloy anode with lattice orientation anchoring effect and rapid interfacial response for Ah&#8208;scale AZMBs. The minimal Sn (200)&#8208;Zn (002) lattice mismatch and strong atomic bonding interactions synergistically drive epitaxial nucleation kinetics and orientation&#8208;anchored Zn (002) deposition. It also reduces the diffusion energy barrier of interfacial Zn2+, thereby facilitating the ordered ion migration and ensuring rapid ion transport channels at the interface. Consequently, the engineered symmetric cells deliver excellent cyclic stability of 890&#160;h at 80% DOD and 200&#160;h at 90% DOD, respectively. The full cells maintain cyclic stability over 5000 cycles. The pouch cells with approximately 4&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a N/P ratio of 2.56 maintain a capacity retention of 93% after 500 cycles. Remarkably, the Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells with anode areal capacity of 4.16&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, N/P ratio of 2.40, cathode loading of 20.67&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 can cycle steadily for over 200 cycles. This work contributes to a path for designing high&#8208;utilization zinc anodes for Ah&#8208;scale AZMBs.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Aqueous Polymerization Enables in Situ Formation of Biocompatible, High&#8208;Performance Organic Mixed Conductors for Bioelectronics</title>

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, initiator&#8208;free aqueous photopolymerization of a PEDOT (poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)) analogue precursor yields biocompatible, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor, enabling direct fabrication of high&#8208;performance bioelectronic devices without the use of harmful oxidants.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based organic mixed ion&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs) are a class of materials offering unique coupled dual charge transport characteristics along with appealing properties including mechanical softness, biocompatibility, tunability, volumetric capacitance, and stability. These features have been exploited in devices including organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), neuromorphic computing, energy storage, sensors, neural electrodes, and actuators. Conventionally, OMIEC polymers are prepared through chemical, vapor&#8208;phase, electrochemical, or enzymatic polymerization, typically relying on oxidants, metal catalysts, and/or organic solvents, significantly limiting their scalability, sustainability, and biocompatibility. Here, we introduce an initiator&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced polymerization of water&#8208;soluble conducting polymer precursors, enabling facile formation of high&#8208;performance and inherently biocompatible OMIECs. This novel approach allows direct photopatterning and seamless film deposition and manufacturing of OECTs across rigid, flexible, and biological substrates, exemplified by glass, textiles, and mouse skin (in vivo). Through careful optimization of the photopolymerization process, resulting OMIECs possess state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrical, electrochemical, and device properties along with exceptional compatibility and conformability with various flexible and biological surfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these photopatterned electrodes, manufactured directly on mouse skin in vivo, where they significantly enhance the recording efficacy and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of low&#8208;frequency brain activity in anesthetized mice.

         <title>Polarized N+&#8208;Mediated Charge&#8208;Transfer State Drives Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarized N&#8314; center establishes a charge&#8208;transfer (C&#8208;T) state, which promotes surface oxidation to steer the 2e&#8722; water oxidation pathway, suppresses H2O2 decomposition, and stabilizes the *OOH intermediate through electrostatic interactions, inhibiting further O&#9472;O bond cleavage.








Abstract
Achieving selective two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8722; WOR) for sustainable hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis, while suppressing the competing four&#8208;electron oxygen evolution (4e&#8722; OER), represents a formidable challenge in artificial photosynthesis. The difficulty lies in the inherent vulnerability of the *OOH intermediate to over&#8208;oxidation or disproportionation, which triggers uncontrollable chain side reactions and naturally biases the reaction toward the less selective 4e&#8722; OER pathway. Here, we present a surface&#8208;engineering strategy utilizing a ZnCdS2 photocatalyst functionalized with polarized N&#8314; surfactants, enabling molecular&#8208;level control over interfacial water oxidation pathways by establishing a charge&#8208;transfer (C&#8208;T) excited state. The polarized N&#8314; centers effectively reconfigure the surface electronic states through molecular&#8208;scale polarization, achieving i) precise modulation of hole potentials and ii) stabilization of the *OOH intermediate, thereby promoting a direct 2e&#8722; WOR pathway. Without the use of any sacrificial reagents, this design achieves an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 2.37 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 (20.26 times of pristine ZnCdS2) statically and the scalable outlet concentration of 1.61&#160;mM through a serial micro&#8208;batch flow reactor. By bridging atomic&#8208;level charge control with macroscopic catalytic performance, our work offers a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept advance in C&#8208;T excited state driven photocatalysis, highlighting how surface electronic states can drive selective multi&#8208;electron reactions.

Rapid quenching creates a strong temperature gradient, disrupting Nb&#8211;O and Nb&#8211;Cl coordination&#8212;especially via broken bridging oxygen&#8212;inducing octahedral distortion around Nb. This disorder breaks local polyhedral connectivity, forming a short&#8208;range disordered amorphous network. It lowers Na&#8314; migration barriers, weakens electrostatic confinement, and offers more ion pathways, yielding 1.51 mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 room&#8208;temperature conductivity, validating &#8220;quenching&#8594;distortion&#8594;disorder&#8594;enhanced transport&#8221; synergy.








Abstract
Oxyhalide&#8208;based sodium solid electrolytes (SSEs) distinguished by exceptionally high&#8208;voltage electrochemical stability and mechanical compliance, have commanded substantial research interest, but their practical implementation remains constrained by sub&#8208;optimal ionic conductivity (IC). Here, we demonstrate a concerted manipulation of short&#8208; and long&#8208;range structural disorder that substantially enhances Na+ transport in oxychlorides. Combined experimental characterization and machine learning molecular dynamics simulations unveil that, the sub&#8208;second quenching disrupts short&#8208;range ordering by fragmenting the original Nb&#9472;Cl coordination and inducing more Nb&#9472;O bonding, which triggers the distortion and connectivity breakage of NbO2Cl4 polyhedra. Such a unique structure endows the material with a record&#8208;high ionic conductivity of 1.51 mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 for NaNbOCl4, and 7.2 mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 for NaTaOCl4, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art oxyhalide&#8208;based SSEs. The as&#8208;achieved all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries using low&#8208;cost NaNbOCl4 as the electrolyte manifest remarkable capacity retention (82.61%) at 4&#160;V (versus Na+/Na) after 250 cycles at a 0.5C, highlighting exceptional cycling stability and rate performance. This work establishes a coupled short&#8208; and long&#8208;range disorder engineering strategy that unlocks unprecedented ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes, advancing next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage solutions.

         <title>Fragmentation of Isoxazolones to Alkynes Enabled by Anomeric Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An evidence that anomeric amides can serve as nitrenium ion precursors in reactions with nitrogen nucleophiles other than amines is reported. Building on this finding, we developed a mild, scalable, and highly chemoselective method for the fragmentation of isoxazolones to alkynes. This transformation constitutes unique functional group interconversion &#8208; alkyne from &#946;&#8208;ketoester. 








Abstract
Over the past few years, isodiazenes have reemerged as an important class of intermediates with substantial synthetic potential. The most direct route to these reactive species is via reactions of N&#8208;nucleophiles with nitrenium ion precursors (e.g., anomeric amides). While emerging methodologies are almost exclusively focused on amine&#8208;derived isodiazenes, analogous transformations based on other nitrogen functionalities (e.g., oximes, heterocycles) are largely overlooked. Herein, we present evidence that the reactivity of nitrenium ion precursors can be expanded beyond its current scope, supported by the development of an unprecedented reaction between anomeric amides and isoxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones. This unorthodox transformation provides an operationally simple, scalable, and highly chemoselective route to challenging sterically hindered alkynes. Moreover, we demonstrate that anomeric amides can behave as surrogates of nitrosonium cation.

         <title>Environment&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly and Coupled&#8208;Network Effect in Dynamic Replicating Nucleopeptide Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates the self&#8208;organization mechanism in nucleobase/peptide dynamic reaction networks, where environmentally responsive assemblies regulate network equilibria through cooperative/competitive replication behaviors, further achieving signal transduction across molecular networks through base&#8208;pairing.








Abstract
The development of complex, adaptive behaviors in chemical systems hinges on the intricate coupling between reaction networks and self&#8208;organizing processes. Self&#8208;assembling networks, particularly those capable of self&#8208;replication, provide a unique platform for studying how molecular interactions drive temporally evolving, system&#8208;level behaviors. While environmental factors are known to shape the dynamic evolution of such networks, most studies have focused on static or single&#8208;class systems, such as isolated peptides or nucleic acids. This approach overlooks two critical dimensions of complexity: 1) nonlinear interspecies dynamics in multicomponent systems, and 2) inter&#8208;network coupling phenomena. Here, we investigate dynamic nucleopeptide networks exhibiting environment&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly, demonstrating how nucleobases and short peptides dynamically synergize under specific conditions to form organized, self&#8208;replicating structures. And we reveal how such networks orchestrate the interplay between cooperative and competitive species to achieve dynamic adaptation to environmental parameters (e.g., pH, temperature, and ionic strength). Furthermore, inspired by nucleobases&#8217; genetic information function, we utilized the base&#8208;specific recognition in nucleopeptide assemblies for hierarchical network coupling&#8212;transmitting environmental signals from stimulus&#8208;sensitive to stimulus&#8208;insensitive systems. These findings offer new insights into temporal and cross&#8208;network regulation of self&#8208;assembly and reaction dynamics, providing a framework for designing adaptive, life&#8208;like chemical systems that evolve and communicate with environmental signals.

         <title>Covalently Anchored Cationic Groups Tailor Electric Double Layer for Supporting&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Free CO2 Reduction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic groups covalently anchored around molecular catalytic sites generate a strong local electric field and modulate the double&#8208;layer structure. Their electrostatic effect stabilizes polar intermediates of CO2 reduction, lowers H+ concentration in the diffuse layer, and disrupts the interfacial hydrogen bond network for H+ transport, enabling CO2 electroreduction in acidic media free of any supporting electrolyte.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acidic media without supporting electrolytes&#8212;including dissolved alkali salts or cationic polyelectrolytes coated on the catalyst surface&#8212;remains highly challenging. A promising strategy is to covalently anchor cationic groups near catalytic sites, generating local electric fields to stabilize polar intermediates. Here, we employed carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;immobilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) derivatives as model catalysts, functionalized with quaternary ammonium groups at distinct positions of the phenyl rings. Using vibrational Stark and Tafel analyses, we probed how these cationic groups shape the electric double&#8208;layer and CO2RR performance. When anchored at ortho&#8208;sites, the cationic groups induced a strong local electric field near the Co site, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 94% in pure acidic electrolyte. These cationic groups at the ortho&#8208;sites demonstrated greater ability to promote acidic CO2RR compared to alkali cations or cationic polyelectrolyte modification layers. This enhancement is attributed to the covalent anchoring approach, which enables the creation of a higher cation density around the catalytic site, thereby more substantially increasing the local electric field strength.

         <title>Thiol&#8211;Ene Photoclick Chemistry for Efficient Bicyclic Peptide Synthesis and Genetically Encoded Peptide Library</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8211;ene photoclick chemistry enables rapid, selective, and high&#8208;yield bicyclization of unprotected peptides under mild, biocompatible conditions, compatible with all amino acids and phage display, facilitating the discovery of high&#8208;affinity ligands for target proteins. 








Abstract
Bicyclic peptides have emerged as privileged scaffolds in chemical biology and drug discovery owing to their high target affinity, enhanced metabolic stability, and rigid conformational structure. Conventional bicyclization strategies often face challenges related to efficiency and chemoselectivity, which can limit their broader applicability. Here, we present the first application of thiol&#8211;ene photoclick chemistry for the bicyclization of unprotected peptides, employing TAIC as a trifunctional crosslinker. This photochemical approach enables rapid, high&#8208;yield, and highly selective cyclization under mild, biocompatible conditions and is compatible with all proteinogenic amino acids. The reaction reaches completion within 6 minutes and is fully compatible with phage display, allowing high&#8208;throughput generation and selection of genetically encoded bicyclic peptide libraries. Using this platform, we identified two submicromolar ligands targeting cyclophilin A, both of which showed substantially improved binding affinity compared to their linear counterparts. These findings establish thiol&#8211;ene photoclick chemistry as a robust and versatile platform for the discovery of conformationally constrained peptide ligands, particularly suited for addressing therapeutically challenging protein&#8211;protein interactions.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Photoredox Catalysis Beyond the Singlet Bottleneck Through Triplet Charge Recombination and Magnetic Field Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy combining triplet charge recombination in micellar nanoreactors with magnetic field regulation achieves a 300% enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency. The magnetic field suppresses detrimental back electron transfer by regulating the spin dynamics of key radical&#8208;ion&#8208;pair intermediates. This work establishes a transformative framework for manipulating photoredox pathways to achieve high&#8208;performance catalysis.








Abstract
Organic photosensitizers with redox&#8208;active excited states have revitalized photoredox catalysis, but their efficiency is often hindered by spontaneous back electron transfer (BET), particularly in singlet&#8208;driven pathways. Enhancing triplet utilization is therefore critical for improving catalytic performance but remains challenging, especially without structural modifications to the catalyst. Here, using phenothiazine&#8208;type photosensitizers as a model system, we demonstrate a synergistic strategy that enhances reaction efficiency by almost 300%. Triplet charge recombination (TCR) is shown to be significantly promoted within the nonpolar micellar core, enhancing triplet generation and facilitating efficient triplet&#8208;substrate interactions. Furthermore, an external magnetic field is introduced along the triplet pathway to depress BET by inhibiting spin conversion of radical&#8208;ion&#8208;pair intermediates from triplet to singlet. The developed kinetic modeling provides quantitative insights and mechanistic validation of the magnetic field effect. This work establishes a powerful synergistic strategy to control photoredox mechanisms, offering a new framework for advancing catalytic performance.

Furthermore, an external magnetic field is introduced along the triplet pathway to depress BET by inhibiting spin conversion of radical-ion-pair intermediates from triplet to singlet. The developed kinetic modeling provides quantitative insights and mechanistic validation of the magnetic field effect. This work establishes a powerful synergistic strategy to control photoredox mechanisms, offering a new framework for advancing catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Noble Metal&#8208;Free Photosensitive Terpyridine Coordination Assemblies for Efficient Single&#8208;Molecule H2O2 Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photosensitive terpyridine complexes via precise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly were synthesized. The high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic total synthesis of H2O2 was achieved under an air atmosphere via a unique synergetic process of energy and electron transfer. Notably, an outstanding photocatalytic rate of up to 40&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 1.23% were obtained.








Abstract
Conventional molecular photocatalysts characterized by long&#8208;lived excited states, such as Ru and Ir complexes are widely recognized and used in photocatalysis. However, developing new heavy atom&#8208;free photosensitive coordination complexes by manipulating their molecular structures to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic reactions remains challenging. In this study, a series of novel terpyridine complexes, S1&#8211;S4, with a rigid donor&#8211;acceptor configuration was designed and synthesized via precise heteroleptic, coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Experimental data, combined with theoretical calculations, confirmed that long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;transfer excited states were generated, enabling excellent photosensitivity. Furthermore, high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic total synthesis of H2O2 was achieved in pure water under an air atmosphere via a synergetic process of energy transfer and electron transfer to form 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8211;, respectively, in these complexes, differing significantly from previous reports on polymer catalysts. Notably, complex S1 exhibited an outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 10&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming most organic photocatalytic systems. In addition, S1 achieved a photocatalytic rate of up to 40&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 1.23% with the sacrificial agent. This study not only paves the way for the development of novel noble metal&#8208;free photocatalysts but also introduces a novel photocatalytic paradigm for the green and high&#8208;performance synthesis of H2O2.

         <title>Electrostatic and Geometric Regulation of &#8220;Third Terminal&#8221; in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaics</title>

Inspired by the structural characteristics of INIC, we first proposed to establish the &#8220;third terminals&#8221; of NFAs by regulating delicate electrostatic and geometric of INCN analogues (NQ, DCNQ, and TCNC) at backbone centers, aiming to improving charge transfer/transport in OSCs. As a consequence, the OSC based on CH56 binary device achieves a surprising VOC &gt;1&#160;V and ternary device displays an excellent efficiency of 20.16%.








Abstract
Inspired by the dominant role of 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroinden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene) malononitrile (INCN) terminal in regulating molecular packing, an innovative strategy to construct &#8220;third terminals&#8221; of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is proposed by introducing INIC&#8208;mimicking motifs to molecular backbone center. Through delicate electrostatic and geometric regulation of INCN analogues (NQ, DCNQ, and TCNC), newly designed NFAs (CH56, CH57, and CH58) render not only an inverted distribution of molecular frontier orbitals, but also the substantial HOMO&#8211;LUMO overlap for CH56 while pronounced spatial separation for others. Especially, the puckered TCNC with the most LUMOs distribution yet minimal involvement in molecular packings drives CH58 to adopt a pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (3D) packing network and inferior electron migration in sharp contrast to CH56. Moreover, the twisty CH57 and CH58 also exhibit unexpectedly quenched fluorescence due to the severe skeletal vibrations DCNQ and TCNC, further resulting in the large energy losses and poor photovoltaic performance. Finally, CH56&#8208;based OSCs yield a surprising open&#8208;circuit&#8208;voltage of 1.007&#160;V for binary devices and an excellent 20.16% efficiency for ternary devices. Our trials on &#8220;third terminal&#8221; has enabled the extensive exploration of novel architectures of NFAs beyond conventional structural paradigms.

This study uses 4&#8208;sulfophthalic acid triammonium salt (SATS) as a multifunctional additive in both PEDOT:PSS and perovskite precursor.&#8203; SATS modifies PEDOT:PSS's physicochemical properties and slows perovskite crystallization, aiding better&#8208;crystallinity films. Via these synergies, optimized single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs reach an efficiency of 23.85%. Integrating them into two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandems achieves 28.74% efficiency, showing SATS's value for tandem tech.








Abstract
Mixed tin&#8211;lead (Sn&#8211;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are critical for advancing all&#8211;perovskite tandem solar technologies, as they resolve the efficiency limitations of single&#8208;junction devices. However, the widely used hole transport layer (HTL) poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) restricts performance and durability due to its acidic nature and moisture absorption. Additionally, the rapid crystallization of Sn&#8208;containing perovskites hinders the fabrication of uniform, high&#8208;quality mixed SnPb perovskite films. To address these challenges, this study incorporates 4&#8208;sulfophthalic acid triammonium salt (SATS) as a multifunctional additive into both the PEDOT:PSS layer and perovskite precursor solution. SATS modifies the physicochemical properties of PEDOT:PSS and slows perovskite crystallization, promoting films with enhanced crystallinity. Through these synergistic effects, the optimized single&#8208;junction SnPb PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.85%. Integrating these devices into two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem architectures further delivers a remarkable efficiency of 28.74%.

         <title>PSMA&#8208;Triggered Phase Separation of Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugates Enables Zinc&#8208;Dependent Tumor Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally adaptive peptide&#8208;drug conjugate composed of a tumor&#8208;targeting peptide ligand (LE) and an inhibitor (HOA) underwent self&#8208;assembly into nanomicelles under aqueous conditions, improving drug stability. Prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on the tumor cell surface triggered disassembly of the micelles, whereupon the inhibitor suppressed the Zn2&#8314;&#8208;dependent enzymatic activity of PSMA, leading to liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS), and structural conversion into nanofiber assemblies that rapidly anchored to the tumor membrane.








Abstract
Peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDC) have emerged as a promising modality for targeted tumor therapy, offering high specificity, and design flexibility. However, the therapeutic efficacy of PDC is often limited by rapid systemic clearance, inadequate control over drug release kinetics, and difficulty in forming stable drug&#8208;tumor interfaces in vivo. These challenges highlight the need for next&#8208;generation PDC systems capable of spatiotemporal regulation and enhanced pharmacological activity. In this study, a structurally adaptive PDC platform termed LE&#8208;HOA was developed based on cascade reconstruction induced by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). This platform was constructed by covalently linking a tumor&#8208;targeting peptide (LE) ligand with the inhibitor 4&#8208;(hydroxyamino)&#8208;4&#8208;oxobutanoic acid (HOA). LE&#8208;HOA could self&#8208;assemble into nanomicelles under physiological conditions, enhancing drug stability during circulation. Under PSMA induction, HOA was exposed through disassembly, which in turn inhibited the zinc&#8208;dependent enzymatic activity of PSMA. This further induced LLPS, resulting in the rapid formation of nanofiber that expanded drug&#8208;tumor recognition interface. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that LE&#8208;HOA enabled sustained pharmacological signaling and effective tumor suppression with good biosafety. These findings suggest a new strategy to address limitations in PDC therapeutics by integrating intelligent response and dynamic phase behavior for enhanced lesion&#8208;targeted action.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on the tumor cell surface triggered disassembly of the micelles, whereupon the inhibitor suppressed the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;-dependent enzymatic activity of PSMA, leading to liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS), and structural conversion into nanofiber assemblies that rapidly anchored to the tumor membrane.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptide-drug conjugates (PDC) have emerged as a promising modality for targeted tumor therapy, offering high specificity, and design flexibility. However, the therapeutic efficacy of PDC is often limited by rapid systemic clearance, inadequate control over drug release kinetics, and difficulty in forming stable drug-tumor interfaces in vivo. These challenges highlight the need for next-generation PDC systems capable of spatiotemporal regulation and enhanced pharmacological activity. In this study, a structurally adaptive PDC platform termed LE-HOA was developed based on cascade reconstruction induced by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This platform was constructed by covalently linking a tumor-targeting peptide (LE) ligand with the inhibitor 4-(hydroxyamino)-4-oxobutanoic acid (HOA). LE-HOA could self-assemble into nanomicelles under physiological conditions, enhancing drug stability during circulation. Under PSMA induction, HOA was exposed through disassembly, which in turn inhibited the zinc-dependent enzymatic activity of PSMA. This further induced LLPS, resulting in the rapid formation of nanofiber that expanded drug-tumor recognition interface. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that LE-HOA enabled sustained pharmacological signaling and effective tumor suppression with good biosafety. These findings suggest a new strategy to address limitations in PDC therapeutics by integrating intelligent response and dynamic phase behavior for enhanced lesion-targeted action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Industrial&#8208;Grade H2O2 Electrosynthesis via N/O&#8208;Doped Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanoreactors with Remarkable Yield and Stability</title>

The N/O dual&#8208;doped hierarchically porous carbon nanoreactors regulated through targeted heteroatom doping and morphological engineering is demonstrated toward highly selective H2O2 production under an industrial&#8208;grade current density.








Abstract
The two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) enables sustainable electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), providing a green alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Herein, we report N/O dual&#8208;doped hierarchically porous carbon nanoreactors (N/O&#8208;HPCNs) derived from ZIF&#8208;8 via a facile one&#8208;step pyrolysis. The optimized catalyst achieves &#8764;90% H2O2 selectivity over a wide potential range in 0.10&#160;M KOH. Crucially, in a flow cell, N/O&#8208;HPCNs deliver an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 92.8% Faradaic efficiency and a remarkable H2O2 yield of 17.3&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, while maintaining&#160;&gt;&#160;80% Faraday efficiency for 100&#160;h. Finite element simulations confirm that hierarchical pores enhance mass transfer and reduce H2O2 residence time, while DFT calculations elucidate the distinct roles of N doping for activity and oxygen functional groups in promoting 2e&#8211; ORR selectivity. This work provides a scalable strategy for sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Vertically Aligned Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Arrays as Protective Layers for Durable Zinc Anodes with Low Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;induced morphological regulation strategy via a facile and universal electrodeposition is developed to directly fabricate binder&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable morphologies as protective layers on Zn foil. Particularly, the VAA&#8208;ZnTMA@Zn with vertically aligned MOF arrays possesses fast transport of Zn2+, stable Zn deposition/dissolution and suppressed dendrite formation.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high safety and low cost, yet side reactions and dendrite growth limit their practicality. Although protective layers on Zn anodes can address these issues, conventional protective layers containing polymer binders often hinder Zn2+ transport and Zn deposition/dissolution. In this study, we develop a ligand&#8208;induced morphological regulation strategy via an electrodeposition approach to directly fabricate binder&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as protective layers on Zn anodes, including vertically aligned MOF arrays on Zn (VAA&#8208;ZnTMA@Zn), shaggy horizontal nanosheets on Zn (SHN&#8208;ZnMI@Zn), and compact nanoparticles on Zn (CNP&#8208;ZnTPA@Zn). Among them, the VAA&#8208;ZnTMA@Zn electrode exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 20&#160;mV and an extended cycle life of up to 2400&#160;h. Moreover, the VAA&#8208;ZnTMA@Zn//MnO2@CC full cell exhibits exceptional durability with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% and a capacity retention of 82% after 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. Through electrochemical analyses, theoretical calculations, and finite element simulations, it is revealed that the vertically aligned MOFs channels, uniform electrical field distribution, and abundant deposition sites in VAA&#8208;ZnTMA@Zn facilitate accelerated Zn2+ transport and uniform Zn deposition, effectively suppressing dendrite formation. This work provides an efficient route toward durable Zn anodes for aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Atomistic Landscape of Pt Nanoparticles via Machine Learning: How Size Effect and Hydrogen Adsorption Govern Structural Ensembles and Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature and structure of Pt nanoparticles under a pressure of hydrogen is studied using machine learning potential guided grand&#8208;canonical global optimization, generating more than one million stable and metastable PtxHy structure candidates for analysis. A noncrystalline&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline transformation of Pt configurations is revealed at the atomic level, driven by the adsorption of hydrogen or the increased size of the nanoparticle. 








Abstract
Understanding the atomistic structure and fluxionality of Pt nanoparticles under reactive conditions is essential for rational design of effective catalysts, yet their structural complexity presents a great challenge. In this work, we combine grand canonical global optimization methods and machine learning potentials to explore the atomistic landscape of nanometer&#8208;sized (1&#8764;2&#160;nm) Pt nanoparticles under a pressure of hydrogen, resulting in a comprehensive library of PtxHy nanoparticles with over one million low&#8208;energy metastable structures. We found that hydrogen adsorption drives a size&#8208;dependent transformation from an amorphous to a crystalline structure, leading to sharp phase transitions for smaller nanoparticles and smooth transformations for larger ones. This behavior is governed by a competition between distinct core configurations, as well as the formation of rigid and fluxional local domains, where stability is dictated by specific surface motifs at low H coverage and by the crystalline core at high H coverage. By applying this structural library for reactivity modeling of methane dehydrogenation and ethylene hydrogenation, we show a marked discrepancy between the abundance of a surface site and its catalytic contribution, indicating that the active sites are rare, structurally distinct motifs, not the most common sites.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Electro&#8208;Fenton Oxidation Enabled by CoCu Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Oxygen Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#160;+&#160;1e&#8211; ORR electrocatalyst (CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN) with Co&#8208;Cu diatomic pairs and cyano groups exhibits excellent performance in the electrochemical generation and activation of hydrogen peroxide, owing to its high oxygen utilization efficiency.








Abstract
The Electro&#8208;Fenton (EF) technique offers a promising strategy for recalcitrant organic pollutant removal by coupling the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) for H2O2 synthesis with its subsequent activation to &#8226;OH via one&#8208;electron (1e&#8211;) reduction. To address the distinct favorable active sites and mismatched selectivity between 2e&#8211; ORR and 1e&#8211; H2O2 activation, we develop an integrated 2&#160;+&#160;1e&#8211; tandem ORR catalyst with CoCu diatomic pairs (CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN) and cyano modification to improve oxygen capture and utilization efficiency (OUE, 39.8%). The CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN&#8208;based EF system achieves 100.0% of bisphenol A (BPA) in 40.0&#160;min with a high&#8208;rate constant of k&#160;=&#160;0.57 min&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations indicate that the&#160;&#8722;CN moieties in CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN greatly facilitate O2 adsorption, which further migrates to the Co site to proceed 2e&#8211; ORR with a reduced energy barrier. The generated H2O2 spontaneously migrates to the surrounding Cu site for in situ activation to generate &#8226;OH. Long&#8208;term operation of a CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN&#8208;equipped flow&#8208;cell device that maintains 100.0% bisphenol A removal even without O2/air pumping. Technoeconomic analysis indicates that the CoCu&#8208;DACs&#8208;CN&#8208;based EF process effectively reduced electrical energy consumption by 74.4%, demonstrating its promise for energy&#8208;efficient wastewater treatment.

To address the distinct favorable active sites and mismatched selectivity between 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR and 1e&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation, we develop an integrated 2&#160;+&#160;1e&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; tandem ORR catalyst with CoCu diatomic pairs (CoCu-DACs-CN) and cyano modification to improve oxygen capture and utilization efficiency (OUE, 39.8%). The CoCu-DACs-CN-based EF system achieves 100.0% of bisphenol A (BPA) in 40.0&#160;min with a high-rate constant of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.57 min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical calculations indicate that the&#160;&#8722;CN moieties in CoCu-DACs-CN greatly facilitate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, which further migrates to the Co site to proceed 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR with a reduced energy barrier. The generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spontaneously migrates to the surrounding Cu site for in situ activation to generate &#8226;OH. Long-term operation of a CoCu-DACs-CN-equipped flow-cell device that maintains 100.0% bisphenol A removal even without O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/air pumping. Technoeconomic analysis indicates that the CoCu-DACs-CN-based EF process effectively reduced electrical energy consumption by 74.4%, demonstrating its promise for energy-efficient wastewater treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rechargeable Aprotic Zinc&#8211;Oxygen Batteries with Reversible ZnO Formation on Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible redox mechanism between O2 and ZnO (discharge products) of a novel aprotic zinc&#8211;oxygen (Zn&#8208;O2) battery chemistry. This discovery indicates that ZnO&#8212;typically an insulating byproduct in traditional Zn&#8208;O2 batteries&#8212;acts as an independent and reversible discharge product of oxygen cathodes for the first time. The unique electrolyte environment promotes the selective formation of defect&#8208;rich ZnO featuring abundant oxygen vacancies, enhancing the ease of Zn&#9472;O bond cleavage and O2 release during charging.








Abstract
Mastering the redox reactions of oxygen&#8212;a naturally abundant and high&#8208;energy material&#8212;holds transformative potential to address the limitations in energy density, cost, and resource availability of current batteries. Despite their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, conventional aqueous zinc&#8211;oxygen (Zn&#8208;O2) batteries were born with poor rechargeability. Critically, whether reversible oxygen electrochemistry can be established in aprotic Zn&#8208;based electrolytes remains an open question. Herein, we show that ZnO, traditionally regarded as an insulating byproduct, can be harnessed as an exclusive and reversible cathode product, hence opening access to a rechargeable Zn&#8208;O2 battery chemistry. At the heart of this O2/ZnO redox is the combined use of high&#8208;donicity aprotic electrolytes and Ru&#8208;based catalysts, which enables selective oxygen reduction to form a chemically inert (toward electrolytes) but defect&#8208;rich ZnO phase, whose oxygen vacancies promote low&#8208;polarization Zn&#9472;O bond breaking upon recharge to release O2. The resulting reversibility of the oxygen cathode, coupled with stable Zn plating/stripping at the anode, ensures a prolonged cycle lifespan exceeding 1000&#160;h for aprotic Zn&#8208;O2 cells. A semi&#8208;solid pouch cell with an energy density of 120&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 is further achieved using a high utilization&#8208;rate (40%) Zn anode. This work advances oxygen redox understanding and balances rechargeability with energy density in Zn batteries.

         <title>Regulating the Li/Ni Mixing Ratio to Enhance Transition Metal&#8208;Lattice Oxygen Interaction for Achieving Long Life Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>

The modification mechanism of LLO through moderate Li/Ni mixing, including the enhancement of 3D Li+ transport channels, alleviation of lattice distortion, and reduction of O2 release.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) emerge as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their superior specific capacity characteristics. The similar ionic radii of Li+ (0.72 &#197;) and Ni2+ (0.69 &#197;) inevitably cause Li/Ni mixing. However, the relationship between Li/Ni mixing and the electrochemical performance of LLOs remains poorly understood. This study investigates LLOs with varying Li/Ni mixing ratios. The results indicate that an optimal increase in Li/Ni mixing can strengthen TM&#9472;O bond, reduce lattice strain, and thus enhance the cycling stability of LLOs. When the Li/Ni mixing further increases, Ni atoms tend to aggregate in the Li layer, which reduces the structural stability of LLOs and causes severe electrolyte decomposition. In comparison to the sample with lower Li/Ni mixing (1.90%), the LLOs with optimized Li/Ni mixing (4.07%) exhibit an enhancement in initial Coulombic efficiency from 83.0% to 87.4%, along with an improvement in capacity retention from 71.7% to 85.2% after 500 cycles at 1C. Moreover, the corresponding pouch cell maintains 82.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.3C. This study elucidates the impact of Li/Ni mixing ratio on the electrochemical performance of LLOs, providing valuable insights for synthesizing high&#8208;performance LLOs.

         <title>Csp, Csp2, and Csp3 Hydrocarbyl Group Migration from Pd(II) to P(III): Accessing Metallophosphoranes via Nonspectator Ligand Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined migration of Csp, Csp2, and Csp3 hydrocarbyls from Pd(II) compounds to a nontrigonal P(III) ligand scaffold is reported. The structural and spectroscopic features of the resulting complexes reveal a conserved Pd&#9472;P interaction. The results demonstrate the nonspectator role of structurally constrained tricoodinate P(III) ligands in palladium chemistry.








Abstract
Migration of palladium&#8208;bound hydrocarbyl ligands to tricoordinate phosphorus ligand P(N(o&#8208;N(2&#8208;pyridyl)C6H4)2) (L) is demonstrated across a series of Pd(II) organometallic complexes bearing Csp, Csp2, and Csp3 groups. Treatment of ligand L with cis&#8208;[(TMEDA)PdI(C6H5)], cis&#8208;[(TMEDA)PdBr(CH2C6H5)], [(&#951;3&#8208;C3H5)PdCl]2, and trans&#8208;[PdBr(C&#8801;C&#9472;C6H5)(PPh3)2], respectively, results in migration of the hydrocarbyl group from Pd to P, yielding isolable (&#963;4&#8208;P)&#9472;Pd palladaphosphoranes: LAllyl&#8226;PdCl, LBn&#8226;PdBr, LPh&#8226;PdI, and LCCPh&#8226;PdBr. The mechanistic pathway of the palladaphosphorane formation was investigated by in situ NMR experiments and DFT calculations, suggesting an &#945;&#8208;migration mechanism. Halide exchange with NaBr or NaI affords the corresponding bromide and iodide congeners without disrupting the palladaphosphorane connectivity. 31P NMR chemical shifts correlate systematically with the identity and hybridization of the hydrocarbyl group, and electronic structure analyses attribute observed trends to variations in the s/p hybrid compositions of the local P&#9472;C bond orbitals. This work establishes an underappreciated facet in the reactivity landscape of Pd complexes bearing tricoordinate phosphorus (&#963;3&#9472;P) ligands by demonstrating their ability to undergo nonspectator metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand group transfer, with implications for designing bifunctional ligand architectures capable of cooperative catalysis.

         <title>Construction of Biaryl Skeletons Initiated with Benzyne Insertion into C&#9552;S Double Bond of Pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;thiones</title>

This study presents an efficient approach for introducing aryl groups onto a benzene ring through the benzyne insertion technique. Not only can this method be effectively utilized for constructing metacyclophanes, but the products obtained also serve as multidentate ligands, capable of coordinating with a diverse array of metal ions.








Abstract
Benzyne insertion reactions have become a versatile strategy for introducing diverse functional groups onto the benzene ring under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. However, research on employing this method to introduce aryl/alkenyl groups onto the benzene ring is rather limited, with constrained structural scopes. Here, biaryl skeletons are readily prepared by harnessing the insertion of benzyne into C&#9552;S double bond of pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;thiones, where a pyridyl and an arylthio or alkenylthio group are simultaneously introduced on the formal triple bond of a benzyne. It is worth noting that these compounds can not only be further derivatized into 1,2&#8208;diarylbenzenes or 2&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls via desulfurization, but can also form various complexes with different metals through diverse coordination modes.

         <title>Controlled&#8208;Disorder Asymmetrical Donors Enable Efficient All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Solar Cells with Excellent Solution&#8208;Processability</title>

A novel side&#8208;chain engineering strategy for asymmetric small&#8208;molecule donors enables precise control of intercomponent interactions, crystallization, and morphology in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule solar cells. The resulting material, MPhS&#8208;OP, shows delayed crystallization in solution, forms interpenetrating donor&#8211;acceptor networks morphology, and yields a record 18.12% efficiency with excellent processability.








Abstract
All&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (all&#8208;SMOSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics owing to their well&#8208;defined molecular structures and excellent batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility, yet their efficiency is limited by morphology control and processability. Here, we report three asymmetric small molecule donors&#8212;MPhS&#8208;HF, MPhS&#8208;OP, and MPhS&#8208;PF&#8212;engineered with distinct side&#8208;chain functionalities to systematically investigate the interplay between molecular design, solution&#8208;state interactions, crystallization kinetics, and blend morphology. Among them, MPhS&#8208;OP demonstrates delayed crystallization and favorable miscibility with the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO, enabling the formation of finely interpenetrating network morphologies that facilitate efficient exciton dissociation, balanced charge transport, and suppressed recombination losses. As a result, binary MPhS&#8208;OP:L8&#8208;BO devices achieve a record power conversion efficiency of 18.12% under conventional spin&#8208;coating, along with exceptional processing tolerance, maintaining&#160;&gt;&#160;16.4% efficiency in thick&#8208;film, high&#8208;speed blade&#8208;coated, green solvent&#8208;processed, and large&#8208;area devices. In situ spectroscopy and thermodynamic modeling reveal that the superior performance arises from the distinct film&#8208;formation dynamics of MPhS&#8208;OP, which delays donor precipitation relative to L8&#8208;BO, suppressing premature phase segregation and ensuring reproducible nano&#8208;interpenetrating morphologies across processing conditions. This work establishes asymmetric small molecule donor design as a powerful strategy to couple molecular packing control with solution processability, offering a viable route toward scalable and high&#8208;performance all&#8208;SMOSCs.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Access to Chiral S(VI) Stereocenters by Kinetic Resolution of Sulfonimidoyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioconvergent approach for the kinetic resolution of S(VI) stereocenters that leverages the electrophilic reactivity of the chiral sulfur atom is described. The catalytic process provides access to sulfonimidoyl chlorides and sulfonimidates, which are among the least studied S(VI) functionalities. Mechanistic studies reveal key roles of substrate interactions with the unfunctionalized catalyst backbone in the enantioselective process.








Abstract
Sulfur chirality has recently gained in importance across a wide range of chemical domains. However, the dearth of catalytic approaches for sulfur(VI) stereocenters continues to present a challenge for the broader utilization of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;sulfur motifs. We report herein the development of a previously unexplored approach for the kinetic resolution of chiral sulfur(VI) functionalities that leverages the electrophilic reactivity of sulfur(VI) stereocenters. This catalytic strategy provides enantioconvergent access to sulfonimidoyl chlorides and sulfonimidates, which are some of the least explored and catalytically accessible stereogenic S(VI) functionalities. This study also elucidates the key roles of noncovalent interactions and highlights the importance of the unfunctionalized backbone of the catalyst in imparting high enantioselectivity to the kinetic resolution of heteroatom stereocenters.

         <title>Generation of the NCN Radical from Co&#8208;Conversion of N2 and CO2 Mediated by the Niobium Oxide Cluster Anion Nb2O3&#8211;</title>

         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;conversion of N2 and CO2 mediated by the niobium oxide cluster anion Nb2O3&#8211; to form the unexpected product, the NCN radical, has been identified by mass spectrometry and quantum chemistry calculations.








Abstract
Cyanonitrene radical (NCN) is a valuable species involved in many subareas of chemistry including combustion, atmospheric, interstellar, and synthetic chemistry. However, the generation of NCN via C&#9472;N coupling from the abundantly available molecules N2 and CO2 remains a significant challenge due to the inertness of their chemical bonds and competing side reactions. In this study, by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mass spectrometry and quantum chemistry calculations, the niobium oxide cluster anion Nb2O3&#8211; is shown to enable the co&#8208;conversion of N2 and CO2 at room temperature, achieving the formation of two C&#9472;N bonds and the generation of a free NCN radical upon external energy input. The prior complete dissociation of N2 on Nb2O3&#8211; was found to generate two bridgingly bonded nitrogen atoms (Nb), together with adjacent metal centers, which function as Lewis acid&#8722;base pairs (Nb&#948;+&#9472;N&#948;&#8211;) to activate CO2, leading to the spontaneous formation of the first C&#9472;N bond. The nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals and dinuclear metal (Nb) centers play pivotal roles in promoting the formation of the second C&#9472;N bond and in facilitating the removal of two oxygen atoms from CO2, culminating in the generation of NCN. This study introduces a novel route for NCN radical generation through the unprecedented co&#8208;conversion of N2 and CO2.

         <title>Tuning Polyacrylate Composition to Recognize and Modulate Fluorescent Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Random hetero oligomers (RHOs) of defined compositions are synthesized and fractionated to identify the chemical design criteria (charge, length, hydrophobicity) required to achieve nanomolar binding to green fluorescent protein, resulting in&#160;&gt;100% fluorescence increases. 








Abstract
Molecular definition is usually regarded as a prerequisite to achieve protein recognition and functional modulation, particularly for macromolecular interactions. Herein, we report that polymers with specific combinations of monomers arranged into random sequences [random hetero oligomers (RHOs)] can selectively bind to a model protein. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a target, polyacrylates were developed that bound with nanomolar affinity and enhanced fluorescence by&#160;&gt;100%. Purification of the polymerization product revealed subpopulations of compositions with distinct affinities and selectivity for GFP over a competing protein. Experimental and computational binding analyses confirmed that there are distinct RHO&#8211;GFP interactions, which are influenced by RHO chemical composition. These findings show that sequence&#8208;defined structures are not a prerequisite for selective protein recognition. Synthetic polymers can instead serve as scalable, tunable platforms for molecular recognition&#8212;representing a significant leap towards next&#8208;generation sensing, therapeutic, responsive, and catalytic materials in domains previously dominated by biologics or complex peptide scaffolds.

&lt;p&gt;Random hetero oligomers (RHOs) of defined compositions are synthesized and fractionated to identify the chemical design criteria (charge, length, hydrophobicity) required to achieve nanomolar binding to green fluorescent protein, resulting in&#160;&amp;gt;100% fluorescence increases. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular definition is usually regarded as a prerequisite to achieve protein recognition and functional modulation, particularly for macromolecular interactions. Herein, we report that polymers with specific combinations of monomers arranged into random sequences [random hetero oligomers (RHOs)] can selectively bind to a model protein. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a target, polyacrylates were developed that bound with nanomolar affinity and enhanced fluorescence by&#160;&amp;gt;100%. Purification of the polymerization product revealed subpopulations of compositions with distinct affinities and selectivity for GFP over a competing protein. Experimental and computational binding analyses confirmed that there are distinct RHO&#8211;GFP interactions, which are influenced by RHO chemical composition. These findings show that sequence-defined structures are not a prerequisite for selective protein recognition. Synthetic polymers can instead serve as scalable, tunable platforms for molecular recognition&#8212;representing a significant leap towards next-generation sensing, therapeutic, responsive, and catalytic materials in domains previously dominated by biologics or complex peptide scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ru Single Atoms Anchored on Multicomponent Metal Oxides for Enhanced Chlorine Evolution and Reactive Oxygen Species Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst was designed for the simultaneous chlorine evolution reaction and reactive oxygen species generation. The electrocatalyst, coupled with a self&#8208;designed continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer, achieves 95% pollutant degradation within 30&#160;min. This study provides guidance for reducing the fabrication cost of commercial DSA electrodes and enabling their application in advanced electrochemical oxidation processes. 








Abstract
The electrochemical production of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) offers potential for water treatment. Although chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and ROS generation had been widely investigated in acidic media, further exploration was warranted under tap&#8208;water conditions. In this study, a ruthenium single&#8208;atom&#8208;based electrocatalyst (Ru SAs/IrCeOx/Co3O4) was developed, which achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5% for CER in acidic electrolyte and demonstrated stable operation for 1750&#160;h at 625&#160;mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 during an accelerated durability test. The electrocatalyst generated 1.4&#160;ppm total oxidants within 2&#160;min in simulated tap water, and showed stability for 1630&#160;h in a medium&#8208;salinity electrolyte. Theoretical analyses demonstrated that Ru SAs/Co3O4 surface lowered the thermodynamic barrier for Cl2 formation, the moderate chlorine adsorption energy of IrO2 establishes an electrocatalytic interface for the reaction system, CeO2 facilitated the spontaneous generation of *O species and promoted O&#8208;O coupling, endowing the electrocatalyst with bifunctional activity toward both CER and ROS production under simulated tap water conditions. The electrocatalyst, coupled with a self&#8208;designed continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer, achieves 95% pollutant degradation within 30&#160;min. This study provides guidance for reducing the fabrication cost of commercial DSA electrodes and enabling their application in advanced electrochemical oxidation processes.

         <title>Enhanced CO Oxidation on PtOx Raft Species Synthesized via Citric Acid&#8208;Assisted Electrostatic Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of Pt/CeO2 catalysts in CO oxidation was significantly improved through the formation of single&#8208;layer raft nanostructures, achieved via a citric acid&#8208;assisted strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) strategy. This approach exploited the competitive adsorption between noble metal precursors and organic ligands, thereby facilitating the controlled nanostructuring of Pt species.








Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based catalysts have attracted considerable attention for CO oxidation, with their activity critically dependent on the nanostructures of Pt species. Herein, raft&#8208;structured PtOx species on CeO2 support (Pt/CeO2&#8208;CA) were successfully prepared via a citric acid&#8208;assisted strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) method, which leveraged competitive adsorption between noble metal precursors and organic compounds. The Pt/CeO2&#8208;CA catalyst exhibits a T50 (temperature for 50% CO conversion) over 120&#160;&#176;C lower than those of Pt single atoms and PtOx clusters&#8208;based catalysts, and the lowest apparent activation energy among the catalysts investigated, as well as reported analogues, demonstrating its excellent activity in CO oxidation. Combined catalyst characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate enhanced CO adsorption on PtOx rafts with respect to Pt/CeO2 reference catalysts composed of Pt single atoms or PtOx clusters, and favored CO interaction with O* atoms from PtOx rafts and the CeO2 surface. We propose that this mitigates CO poisoning effects by circumventing competitive adsorption with O2, thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction. Our findings highlight promising design strategies for tuning the morphology of supported noble metal (oxide) nanostructures to further enhance their catalytic performances.

         <title>Local Coordination&#8208;Dependent CO2 Reduction Activity of Bimetallic Cu&#9472;Al Catalysts for Selective Ethylene/Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
While bimetallic catalysts enhance C2+ yield, product selectivity remains elusive. We demonstrate that atomic coordination governs the bifurcation at the *CHCOH intermediate: Cu/CuAlO2 interface&#8208;rich catalyst cleaves C&#8211;O to favor ethylene, whereas Al&#8208;doped Cu catalyst breaks Cu&#8211;C to boost ethanol. This structure&#8208;selectivity relationship, validated by spectroscopy and theory, establishes a design principle for selective CO2 electroreduction. 








Abstract
The formation of bimetallic catalysts has been widely adopted to improve CO2 reduction selectivity. However, discrepancies in product distribution in the literature, even among catalysts with identical bimetal compositions, suggest the involvement of distinct reaction pathways. Here, we report that ethylene and ethanol selectivity are strongly influenced by the atomic coordination of metals. We prepared two model catalysts, namely interface&#8208;CuAl (dominated by Cu/CuAlO2 interfaces) and doping&#8208;CuAl (with Al doped into the Cu lattice). Both catalysts demonstrate excellent C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 65%&#8211;85%. However, interface&#8208;CuAl primarily produces ethylene with an FE of 67.6%, seven&#8208;fold higher than FEethanol. Conversely, doping&#8208;CuAl favors ethanol production, reaching a maximum FEethanol of 43.7%, four times higher than FEethylene. Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectrometry reveal distinct adsorption abilities of Cu and different intermediate coverages. Complementary theoretical calculation further elucidates the critical role of *CHCOH bifurcation. Specifically, favorable C&#8211;O cleavage at interface&#8208;CuAl promotes ethylene production, whereas Cu&#8211;C scission at doping&#8208;CuAl favors ethanol production. Beyond CO2 electroreduction, CuAl catalysts also demonstrate phase&#8208;dependent nitrate reduction activity, underscoring the importance of atomic coordination in catalysis. This study provides fundamental insights into the structure&#8208;selectivity relationship of bimetallic catalysts for selective chemical production.

         <title>Empowering Chemistry Experts with Large Language Models for Literature Interpretation in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis Toward Advanced Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large language models now enable chemistry experts to extract structured data&#160;from voluminous literatures. Here we present a human&#8208;centered workflow that lets chemistry experts explore, curate, and formalize LLM&#8208;extracted data without programming barriers. This work establishes a practical paradigm for collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence and urges chemistry experts to work directly with the extracted data to safeguard human judgment, chemical intuition, and critical thinking at the center of discovery.








Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) hold considerable promise for large&#8208;scale data extraction from scientific literatures for catalyst design and practical optimization. Yet, turning such outputs into reliable, formalized chemical knowledge would heavily rely on domain expertise rather than end&#8208;to&#8208;end automation. Herein, we present a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop workflow integrating LLM&#8208;facilitated structured data extraction with iterative, expert&#8208;guided curation and analysis. As a proof of concept, we take single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as an example, enabling efficient data extraction, rigorous curation, and statistically driven interpretation. Thus, we uncover the key correlations among metal types, coordination environments, reaction substances, and catalytic performance, providing deeper mechanism insights into SAC&#8208;driven AOPs. In contrast to fully automated, end&#8208;to&#8208;end models, our approach relies on human&#8208;driven optimization at multiple stages, and underscores human insight as central to understand LLM outputs. By introducing human&#8208;driven prompt refinement, model comparison, and expert&#8208;led analysis, our method ensures that human cognition remains central to interpreting LLM outputs and converting structured data into reliable scientific knowledge. Our work addresses the limitations inherent in fully automated, end&#8208;to&#8208;end methodologies and effectively bridges the gap between structured outputs and catalytically meaningful insights.

This work establishes a practical paradigm for collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence and urges chemistry experts to work directly with the extracted data to safeguard human judgment, chemical intuition, and critical thinking at the center of discovery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) hold considerable promise for large-scale data extraction from scientific literatures for catalyst design and practical optimization. Yet, turning such outputs into reliable, formalized chemical knowledge would heavily rely on domain expertise rather than end-to-end automation. Herein, we present a human-in-the-loop workflow integrating LLM-facilitated structured data extraction with iterative, expert-guided curation and analysis. As a proof of concept, we take single-atom catalysts (SACs) for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as an example, enabling efficient data extraction, rigorous curation, and statistically driven interpretation. Thus, we uncover the key correlations among metal types, coordination environments, reaction substances, and catalytic performance, providing deeper mechanism insights into SAC-driven AOPs. In contrast to fully automated, end-to-end models, our approach relies on human-driven optimization at multiple stages, and underscores human insight as central to understand LLM outputs. By introducing human-driven prompt refinement, model comparison, and expert-led analysis, our method ensures that human cognition remains central to interpreting LLM outputs and converting structured data into reliable scientific knowledge. Our work addresses the limitations inherent in fully automated, end-to-end methodologies and effectively bridges the gap between structured outputs and catalytically meaningful insights.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanically Induced Nickel&#8208;Catalyst Activation in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions by Abrasion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the role of mechanical abrasion in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions under ball&#8208;milling conditions. We demonstrate that common solids and abrasives, including Celite, BaTiO3, MgO, diamonds, and tungsten carbide, contribute to the abrasion of stainless steel, which then serves as a reductant to enable Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling under mechanochemical conditions, thus pointing out abrasion as an important factor to consider in mechanochemical synthesis.








Abstract
In this study, we unravel the noninnocent role of mechanical abrasion in mechanochemical cross&#8208;coupling reactions catalyzed by nickel salts, demonstrating that abrasion of stainless steel in ball milling efficiently activates nickel catalysts even in the absence of piezoelectric redox materials or intentionally added zerovalent&#8208;metal reductants. The abrasion is facilitated by the addition of solid additives, which include Celite, BaTiO3, MgO, diamond, and tungsten carbide powders. Detailed scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed the formation of zerovalent iron&#8208; and chromium&#8208;coated heterogeneous particles during ball milling, which activate nickel salts catalyzing cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These findings challenge the common view of ball&#8208;milling equipment as being an inert material, demonstrating the importance of mechanical phenomena along with the chemical composition of ball&#8208;milling materials typically used in catalytic reactions.

         <title>Frame&#8208;Shifted Synthesis of Oligoheterocycles as a Platform for Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern chemistry seeks to turn the simple raw materials into complex molecules that matter in health, agriculture, and technology. Among these, oligoheterocycles stand out for their versatility, yet they are most often built by cross&#8208;coupling reactions that often rely on expensive metal catalysts. We outline a complementary path: an iterative construction platform that draws on high&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state carbon modules derived from commodity feedstocks. The bifunctional units we describe participate in condensation sequences and counterintuitively open routes to frameworks beyond the reach of traditional methods.








Abstract
Chemists continue to develop strategies that leverage abundant feedstocks to accelerate the production of medicines, agrochemicals, and materials. Oligoheterocycles are a broad class of molecules that span these disciplines. Cross&#8208;coupling strategies are commonly used to assemble oligoheterocycles; however, these methods can be challenging and often rely on precious metal catalysts and building blocks whose production entails significant environmental and economic costs. We present a strategy for the iterative construction of oligoheterocycles that leverages sustainable building blocks designed around high&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state carbon. By utilizing feedstocks from the base of the chemical supply chain, we generate bifunctional building blocks that chemoselectively engage with a variety of partners through simple condensation manifolds. This approach has enabled the creation of novel scaffolds previously inaccessible by conventional means, exemplifying sustainable design strategies.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting at the Integrated Rh&#8211;MoRhOx Cluster Heterostructure on InGaN/GaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated Rh&#8211;MoRhOx cluster heterostructures on InGaN/GaN nanowires facilitate efficient charge extraction and spatially coupled hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, thereby fundamentally accelerating the overall water splitting kinetics.








Abstract
The quest for efficient solar&#8208;driven water splitting, a promising avenue for clean fuel production, faces challenges due to limited solar energy conversion efficiency. Traditional approaches study the overall water splitting as two spatially separate half reactions on two unrelated sites, hindering full utilization of photogenerated charge and water molecules. To overcome these limitations, an integrated cluster heterostructure catalyst on InGaN/GaN semiconductor nanowires is proposed for the effective utilization of photogenerated charge carriers and water molecules on the same redox localization. By establishing the fast charge extraction kinetics based on InGaN/GaN nanowires, the integration of Rh and MoRhOx clusters on the nanowire surface enables simultaneous and fast hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions at the cluster heterostructure. Furthermore, the integrated strategy can enhance the charge redistribution across the heterostructure between the two clusters, further optimizing adsorption of reaction intermediates on each cluster for boosted photocatalytic water splitting activity. Consequently, the integrated heterostructure triggers a 40&#8208;fold increased hydrogen production efficiency in an artificial leaf system. This study provides valuable insights for the rational design of advanced heterostructured photocatalysts for water splitting and beyond.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;exchange strategy enables direct carbonyl&#8208;to&#8208;silicon replacement in lactones. Scope evaluation and derivatization of the resulting silacycles demonstrate broad functional group compatibility and synthetic utility.

Abstract
Sila substitution, the strategy of replacing a specific carbon atom in organic molecules with silicon has garnered significant interest for the development of new functional compounds. However, the synthesis of silicon analogs remains challenging and is typically achieved through de novo methods. A promising alternative is the direct replacement of a carbon atom with silicon at a later stage of molecular construction. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;to&#8208;silicon (CO&#8208;to&#8208;Si) atom swapping in lactones. Mechanistic studies reveal that the transformation proceeds via direct decarbonylation followed by silicon insertion. This method enables the efficient conversion of a broad range of lactones, including coumarins, isocoumarins, and dibenzopyranones, into their corresponding silacyclic analogs through decarbonylative silicon insertion. The resulting silacycles serve as versatile building blocks and undergo further derivatization. Notably, this strategy facilitates late&#8208;stage skeletal editing of pharmaceutical and natural product derivatives, providing a streamlined route to silicon&#8208;containing scaffolds from readily available lactones.

         <title>Balancing Oxidative Stability and Ion Transport in Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolytes via Chlorine&#8208;Driven Halogenation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel chlorine&#8208;driven halogenation strategy addresses the inherent trade&#8208;off in polyether electrolytes. This approach precisely modulates the electronic environment, achieving exceptional electrochemical stability (up to 5.0&#160;V) and high ionic conductivity (1.14 mS cm&#8722;1). The resulting PCMO electrolyte enables robust cycling, high&#8208;voltage resilience, and reliable low&#8208;temperature performance, providing a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
Polyether&#8208;based solid electrolytes offer significant promise for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet their practical application is limited by poor room&#8208;temperature ion transport efficiency and severe oxidative breakdown at high voltages.

&lt;p&gt;A novel chlorine-driven halogenation strategy addresses the inherent trade-off in polyether electrolytes. This approach precisely modulates the electronic environment, achieving exceptional electrochemical stability (up to 5.0&#160;V) and high ionic conductivity (1.14 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The resulting PCMO electrolyte enables robust cycling, high-voltage resilience, and reliable low-temperature performance, providing a scalable platform for next-generation solid-state lithium metal batteries (LMBs).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyether-based solid electrolytes offer significant promise for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet their practical application is limited by poor room-temperature ion transport efficiency and severe oxidative breakdown at high voltages. A key challenge arises from the inherent trade-off between boosting ionic conductivity and widening the electrochemical stability window, rendering simultaneous optimization difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a novel halogenation strategy that precisely modulates the electronic environment of ether oxygen atoms. This approach effectively reduces the nucleophilicity of terminal &#9472;OH groups and inhibits dehydrogenation reactions initiated by main-chain ether oxygens, while simultaneously optimizing Li&#8314; coordination dynamics for efficient transport. Our systematic investigation of fluorine (&#9472;F), chlorine (&#9472;Cl), and bromine (&#9472;Br) reveals that Cl exhibits the most balanced electron-withdrawing effect. This leads to an exceptional electrochemical stability window of up to 5.0&#160;V and an ionic conductivity of 1.14 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Inactivation of the Burkholderia Toxin Malleicyprol by Enzymatic Cyclopropanol Ring Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei are dangerous pathogens that cause severe diseases with high mortality rates. Their virulence relies in part on malleicyprols, potent toxins containing a highly reactive cyclopropanol group. In this study, we identify BurK, a heme&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase that neutralizes malleicyprols by enzymatically opening the cyclopropanol ring.








Abstract
Pathogenic bacteria of the Burkholderia pseudomallei group cause life&#8208;threatening infections in humans and animals. Their virulence factors include malleicyprols bearing a reactive cyclopropanol moiety essential for toxicity. Inactivating this reactive motif, therefore, is a promising way to neutralize these toxins. Here, we identify a heme&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase (BurK) that cleaves the cyclopropanol warhead. Mutational analyses and in vivo radical capturing show that BurK catalyzes a radical ring opening to yield a propanone fragment. Characterizing BurK orthologs across various bacterial phyla suggests broader ecological roles of these unusual enzymes. Using a nematode model, we demonstrate that BurK&#8208;producing helper bacteria neutralize malleicyprols, significantly reducing toxicity and enhancing host survival. In addition to uncovering a novel biocatalyst, this work lays the foundation for antivirulence approaches using therapeutic microbes against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.

         <title>Dual Self&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization towards Cationic Polypeptoids with Stable Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes dual self&#8208;promoted polymerization to construct helical cationic polymers. Unlike conventional polypeptides where cationic side chains typically disrupt helicity, these cationic polypeptoids exhibit remarkably stable helices.








Abstract
Cationic helices play crucial roles in various biological processes. While polypeptides containing lysine and guanidine side chains are among the most prevalent cationic polymers, their helical structures are often unstable due to side&#8208;chain electrostatic repulsion. Here, bulky, chiral tertiary amine side chains were incorporated into polypeptoids by controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization, inducing achiral backbones into stable helices. Despite the highly steric side chains, the cyclic monomer underwent efficient polymerization via a dual self&#8208;promoted mechanism involving side chain&#8208;mediated proton transfer and helix&#8208;induced acceleration. Subsequent quaternization yielded structurally diverse polyproline&#8208;I&#8208;like helical cationic polypeptoids. Unlike conventional polypeptides where cationic side chains typically disrupt helicity, these cationic polypeptoids exhibited remarkably stable helices. The cationic side chains stabilize the helices by enforcing cis&#8208;amide backbone conformations through two key interactions: 1) C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bonding between side chains and backbone; 2) steric hindrance of side chains. Preliminary studies demonstrated that cationic helical polypeptoids exhibited significantly lower cytotoxicity and faster cellular uptake kinetics compared to the conventional cationic polypeptide poly(l&#8208;lysine). The dual self&#8208;promoted synthesis, coupled with cationic side chain&#8208;mediated helix stabilization, provides new insights for designing advanced functional polymers. Moreover, these cationic polypeptoids, with robust helices, low cytotoxicity and high cellular uptake, hold great promise for various biological applications.

         <title>Boosting Nitrate Reduction through Ru&#8208;CO32&#8722; Microenvironment Modulated Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia suffers from slow proton transfer. We constructed a carbonate&#8208;modulated microenvironment around Ru single&#8208;atom sites that reorganizes the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond network. This Ru&#8208;CO32&#8722; configuration facilitates proton transport and suppresses competing reactions, enhancing nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. The work provides a practical strategy for wastewater purification and ammonia production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;)&#8208;rich wastewater to ammonia (NH3) offers an attractive and sustainable strategy for green and cost&#8208;effective NH3 synthesis. However, slow proton transfer kinetics remains a persistent challenge, limiting both reaction activity and selectivity. We develop a strategy of leveraging anion (CO32&#8722;)&#8208;modulated microenvironments around single&#8208;atom (ruthenium, Ru) sites to accelerate proton transfer leveraging. By modulating the electrolyte composition, we constructed a Ru&#8208;CO32&#8722; microenvironment that facilitated a highly interconnected hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) network and promoted proton transfer kinetics. This microenvironment significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance, enabling an NH3 production of 76.36&#160;mg&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;mgcat.&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 90% for NO3RR in an integrated electrocatalytic system. This approach offers a cost&#8208;effective and practical strategy for converting NO3&#8722;&#8208;rich wastewater into valuable NH3, while providing mechanistic insights into proton transfer and interfacial regulation.

         <title>Electroactive Model&#8208;Guided Design of Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Heterojunctions for Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mathematically guided strategy has been developed to predict optimal shell thickness in core&#8211;shell heterojunctions using a universal electroactive model. The model is broadly applicable to various c&#8208;MOFs, offering a predictive framework for engineering high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active heterojunctions. This approach enables the rational design of c&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based heterostructures with a high photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Heterojunction engineering in nanomaterials has been a cornerstone of research in diverse fields owing to its profound impact on charge transport and interfacial properties. However, despite recent insights suggest that precise control over the heterostructures is critical for optimal functionality, a universally guideline defining the optimal heterostructures remains elusive. Herein, we proposed a novel &#8220;electroactive model guidance&#8221; approach to guide the nanostructures design in redox&#8208;active conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) based p&#8208;n heterojunction for high performance photocatalyst. Chosen Cu2O@c&#8208;MOFs core&#8208;shell heterostructures as model, we optimized the shell thickness based on a mathematical electroactive model. The optimized structure achieved a tenfold photocurrent enhancement compared to pristine Cu2O&#8212;a record&#8208;high for heterojunctions. The heterojunctions with optimal shell thicknesses exhibited outstanding degradation efficiency for tetracycline, with a catalytic degradation efficiency up to 99.35% and exhibited the rate constant of 0.065 min&#8722;1, this represents the highest rate constant, reported to date for such systems. Furthermore, the universality of this theoretical model extends to other c&#8208;MOFs, such as Cu&#8208;OHPTP and Cu&#8208;DBC, which similarly exhibit significantly enhanced performance. This work not only provides a robust framework for the rational design of redox&#8208;active semiconductor heterojunction but also offers valuable insights into optimizing their functional properties for advanced applications.

&lt;p&gt;Heterojunction engineering in nanomaterials has been a cornerstone of research in diverse fields owing to its profound impact on charge transport and interfacial properties. However, despite recent insights suggest that precise control over the heterostructures is critical for optimal functionality, a universally guideline defining the optimal heterostructures remains elusive. Herein, we proposed a novel &#8220;electroactive model guidance&#8221; approach to guide the nanostructures design in redox-active conductive metal-organic frameworks (c-MOFs) based p-n heterojunction for high performance photocatalyst. Chosen Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O@c-MOFs core-shell heterostructures as model, we optimized the shell thickness based on a mathematical electroactive model. The optimized structure achieved a tenfold photocurrent enhancement compared to pristine Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8212;a record-high for heterojunctions. The heterojunctions with optimal shell thicknesses exhibited outstanding degradation efficiency for tetracycline, with a catalytic degradation efficiency up to 99.35% and exhibited the rate constant of 0.065 min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, this represents the highest rate constant, reported to date for such systems. Furthermore, the universality of this theoretical model extends to other c-MOFs, such as Cu-OHPTP and Cu-DBC, which similarly exhibit significantly enhanced performance. This work not only provides a robust framework for the rational design of redox-active semiconductor heterojunction but also offers valuable insights into optimizing their functional properties for advanced applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Utilizing Similarity Measures to Map Chemical Reactivity</title>

         <dc:description>
Autonomous chemistry demands unbiased, adaptable tools for monitoring reactivity. We present a general method using similarity analysis of spectroscopic data, independent of prior knowledge. Demonstrated across diverse techniques and reactions, this approach reveals kinetics and dynamics, establishing a foundation for self&#8208;guided chemical platforms and accelerating the future of automated discovery.








Abstract
The development of fully autonomous chemical synthesis platforms requires robust, real&#8208;time assessment of reactivity that does not rely on prior mechanistic knowledge. Existing methods often depend on predefined reaction models or chemical intuition, limiting their generalizability and adaptability. To address this challenge, we introduce a chemically agnostic approach that quantifies reactivity dynamics by applying similarity metrics to the full informational content of in&#8208;situ spectroscopic data. Using NMR, UV/Vis, IR, and EPR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that spectral similarity trajectories can reliably indicate reaction progress, detect kinetic features such as autocatalysis, and resolve complex behaviours including oscillations. Across diverse reaction classes, this method enabled estimated end&#8208;point detection and kinetic profiling without reaction&#8208;specific tuning. For example, the formation of lophine was followed by NMR at different reaction temperatures revealing Arrhenius&#8208;type kinetics. In a different experiment, the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction was monitored by UV/Vis and the chemical oscillation with a periodicity of 7.25 s was captured. These results establish a generalizable framework for real&#8208;time, data&#8208;driven reactivity monitoring, representing a critical step toward autonomous synthesis guided by multidimensional spectroscopic feedback.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Enriched Pt&#8208;In Synergistic Sites for Highly Selective and Direct Photo&#8208;Reforming of PET Plastic Wastes into Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;site synergistic interface promotes interfacial charge redistribution on the catalyst surface, achieving efficient and highly selective photo&#8208;reforming of waste plastic into acetic acid and H2. The catalyst enables selective acetic acid production of beverage bottles without pretreatment, providing a sustainable route for simultaneous waste plastic valorization and H2 production.








Abstract
Photocatalytic selective upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into valuable C2 products is an ideal strategy. However, over&#8208;oxidation and nonselective activation of C&#9472;C/C&#9472;O bonds by active sites in the local microenvironment have limited prior studies to produce C2 products. By designing Pt/ZnO&#8208;ZIS catalysts that feature a dynamically coupled Pt&#8208;In dual&#8208;site synergistic interface, this study achieves in situ upcycling of PET wastes via tuning the electronic structure and chemical environment of the Pt&#8208;In active sites and optimizing the adsorption configuration of plastic wastes. The dual active sites (Pt&#8208;In), which are spatially adjacent yet functionally distinct, achieves an HOAc production rate of 882.46 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with nearly 100% selectivity. Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations reveal that the high selectivity is attributed to the Pt sites adsorbing and protecting the terminal hydroxyl group (&#8208;OH) oxidation, and then activating the C&#9472;O bond to undergo proton substitution. The electron&#8208;rich Pt sites further inhibit the over&#8208;oxidation of C&#9472;C bond, ensuring high selectivity of HOAc. Simultaneously, the In sites facilitate oxidation of &#8208;OH to form carboxyl species during the reaction. This study provides an insightful understanding of dual sites with dynamic reconstruction toward highly selective photo&#8208;reforming of plastic wastes at the atomic scale.

         <title>Overcoming the Activity&#8208;CH4 Reducibility Trade&#8208;off in Dry Reforming of Methane via Spatially Separated Rh1 and Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially isolated Rh single&#8208;atoms and frustrated Lewis pairs on porous CeO2 break the activity&#8208;CH4 reducibility trade&#8208;off in dry reforming of methane, achieving record CO production at 450 &#176;C with exceptional stability and 2.3 molCO2 molCH4&#8722;1 reducibility.








Abstract
Achieving high CO2 conversion with minimal reductant input is essential for enabling a sustainable carbon cycle. Dry reforming of methane (DRM) represents a key pathway toward this goal, yet it is typically limited by CH4 reducibility (moles of CO2 consumed per mole of CH4) of 1 molCO2 molCH4&#8722;1, and temperatures&#160;&gt;700&#160;&#176;C. These limitations arise from an inherent trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and CH4 reducibility, imposed by thermodynamic and kinetic constraints. Herein, we report a catalyst comprising spatially isolated Rh atoms (Rh1) and frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) on porous CeO2 nanorods, which decouples the DRM process into two elemental steps: CO2 reduction and CH4 partial oxidation. This spatial separation enables simultaneous high activity and exceptional CH4 reducibility by facilitating *O migration form FLPs (for CO2 reduction and *O storage) to Rh1 (for CH4 partial oxidation). The optimized catalyst exhibits a CO production rate of 83.4&#160;mol gRh&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 450&#160;&#176;C, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, while achieving a CH4 reducibility of 2.54 molCO2 molCH4&#8722;1, significantly exceeding the conventional DRM limit. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrates outstanding stability over 350&#160;h. This work offers a robust strategy for overcoming classical trade&#8208;off in DRM, rendering it a promising candidate for industrial application.

         <title>Bifunctional Aziridines from Photochemically Generated FSO2NH2 for SuFEx Diversification of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemically generated FSO2NH2 serves as a safe, practical nitrene precursor for Rh&#8208;catalyzed aziridination of alkenes, granting access to previously inaccessible fluorosulfonyl aziridines. These bifunctional electrophiles merge aziridine ring strain with SuFEx reactivity to provide a modular platform toward aliphatic sulfamoyl fluoride derivatives and ultimately S(VI)&#8208;containing molecules including sulfamides and sulfamate esters.








Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have emerged as ubiquitous reactive motifs in fields ranging from medicinal chemistry to materials science, with applications as chemical warheads and as clickable units via Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx). However, methods for introducing sulfamoyl fluorides, the nitrogen&#8208;containing congeners, into functional&#8208;group rich scaffolds remain scarce. Herein, we report the synthesis of fluorosulfonyl aziridines from FSO2NH2 as a versatile and modular platform for alkene diversification. A safe and practical synthesis of FSO2NH2 was optimized via photodegradation of fluorosulfonyl azide (FSO2N3) in solution, enabling the development of a Rh&#8208;catalyzed aziridination with a broad alkene scope that merges the innate reactivity of the strained heterocycle with the modularity of SuFEx click chemistry. The unprecedented bifunctional electrophile was exploited in selective reactions with a wide array of nucleophiles under mild conditions, delivering sulfamoyl fluorides as well as S(VI)&#8208;containing linkages of pharmaceutical relevance, including sulfamides and sulfamate esters.

         <title>Amination and Para&#8208;C&#9472;H Arylation of Aryl Fluorides Enabled by &#945;&#8208;Methylnaphthyl (MeNAP) Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts generated from the halogen&#8208;bridged methylnaphthyl&#8208;palladium dimer [Pd(1&#8208;MeNAP)Br]2 and biarylphosphine ligands in combination with the base LiHMDS promote Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig type aminations and para&#8208;C&#9472;H arylations of non&#8208;activated aryl fluorides already at 60&#160;&#176;C. Their enabling performance is attributed to the efficient generation of monoligated Pd(0)&#8208;species.








Abstract
The C&#9472;F bond is among the strongest in organic molecules and can be cleaved only by few transition metal catalysts under harsh conditions or with highly reactive nucleophiles. We herein report that a methyl naphthyl (MeNAP) palladium bromide / BrettPhos catalyst with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS) as the base promotes aminations of non&#8208;activated aryl fluorides already at 40&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C to give primary, secondary, and tertiary anilines. A related catalyst system further enables para&#8208;C&#9472;H arylations of tritylated anilines with aryl fluorides, yielding biarylamines.

         <title>Reversible Thermally Driven Phenyl Torsion in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Releases Strain for Heat&#8208;Resilient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that a thermally driven, reversible phenyl torsion in a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) hole transporting layer can serve as an interfacial molecular buffer. This mechanism alleviates perovskite residual strain introduced during fabrication and enables sustained strain dissipation under operational temperature variations. Consequently, inverted perovskite solar cells with Torsioner SAM exhibit significantly exceptional isothermal and thermocycling stability, as verified by the ISOS protocol.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) long&#8208;term stability remains constrained by intrinsic strain induced by thermal processes and fluctuating operating conditions. Here, we introduce a carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) hole transporting layer, (6&#8208;(3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)hexyl) phosphonic acid, termed as Torsioner SAM, which features reversible, thermally driven phenyl torsion behavior. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations confirm a dynamic, linear modulation of the torsion angle by 0.07&#176; K&#8722;1 within the critical temperature window spanning perovskite deposition and practical operation. The Torsioner SAM with two thermal driven phenyl units serves as a molecular buffer, effectively releasing residual strain caused by interfacial mismatch. Furthermore, the Torsioner SAM mitigates thermal activated lattice distortions and continuously dissipates additional strain under operational temperature variations. As a result, the corresponding devices exhibit markedly improved isothermal and thermocycling stabilities, retaining over 91.3% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h under the ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I protocol and 94.4% after over 200 thermal cycles (25&#8211;85 &#176;C) under the ISOS&#8208;T&#8208;1 protocol. The incorporation of the Torsioner SAM also suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and enhances hole transport, yielding champion power conversion efficiencies of 26.26% (0.09 cm2) and 24.24% (1 cm2).

         <title>Template&#8208;Controlled Mechanochemical Dissociation of a Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence or absence of the Pd template used in rotaxane formation selectively leads to two different mechanochemical dissociation pathways. The Pd maintains a smaller cavity size that favors dissociation by unstoppering. Removal of the Pd template atoms increases the size and flexibility of the macrocycle, which allows for disassembly by dethreading. The ability to selectively switch the mechanochemical behavior of rotaxanes could be used to control the mechanical properties of polymer materials.








Abstract
The mechanochemical dissociation of rotaxanes has been used in the design of materials with the ability to dissipate energy and of force&#8208;controlled release systems. The former takes advantage of the dissociation by dethreading, a noncovalent process in which the macrocycle is forced over a stopper, while in the latter, the forceful contact between the macrocycle and stopper provokes the rupture of a covalent bond and release of the stoppering unit. As the dissociation pathway is dictated by the relative size of the macrocycle and the stopper, a rotaxane under tension can usually only undergo one of these two pathways. However, the ability to control the mechanochemical reactivity of a rotaxane in situ would allow the creation of multiresponsive materials. Here, we show how to selectively access unstoppering and dethreading pathways from the same rotaxane structure by respectively keeping or removing a single Pd atom to alter the size of the cavity of the macrocycle in a rotaxane built around a PdII template. We anticipate that these findings will have applications in the design of force&#8208;responsive materials and devices in which the mechanical response can be tuned to suit specific uses.

         <title>Engineering Full&#8208;Spectrum Upconversion Through Coherent Energy Recycling in NaYF4:Yb,Tm/Cs4PbBr6 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamics&#8208;controlled epitaxial growth strategy enables the precise coating of Cs4PbBr6 onto NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNPs, achieving structural evolution from core&#8208;shell to UCNP&#8208;in&#8208;LHP solids heterostructures. These high&#8208;quality heterostructures exhibit widely tunable upconversion emission across the entire visible spectrum&#8212;from blue to green to red&#8212;governed by a dynamic energy recycling mechanism between Tm3+ and the perovskite layer. 








Abstract
Hybrid heterojunctions integrating lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and lead&#8208;halide perovskites (LHPs) offer compelling opportunities for multimodal luminescence and tailored photon conversion. However, the synthesis of well&#8208;defined UCNP/LHP heterostructures is hindered by the rapid crystallization kinetics and ionic character of perovskites, while the energy transfer mechanisms&#8212;particularly the role of LHPs in modulating upconversion&#8212;remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a thermodynamics&#8208;controlled epitaxial growth strategy that enables the fabrication of high&#8208;quality NaYF4:Yb,Tm/Cs4PbBr6 heterostructures with tunable architecture&#8212;from core/shell to UCNP&#8208;in&#8208;LHP solids. Crucially, the Cs4PbBr6 layer acts not merely as a passive energy acceptor, but as a functional sub&#8208;energy level that facilitates back energy transfer to Tm3+ and redirects its excited&#8208;state population. This coherent energy recycling enables broadly tunable upconversion emission across the entire visible spectrum. Our findings provide a robust route to high&#8208;quality UCNP/LHP heterostructures and establish LHPs as active participants in the engineering of upconversion pathways.

Its hybrid planar&#8211;twisted geometry enhances donor strength, narrows the HOMO&#8211;LUMO bandgap, and suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay, thereby improving light absorption and emission efficiency compared to classical donors, showing great promise in optical and biomedical applications.








Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) architectures have emerged as a preeminent paradigm in optoelectronic engineering and biomedical applications. However, conventional D&#8211;A NIR emitters often suffer from aggregation&#8208;induced quenching or weak absorption owing to the use of planar (e.g., carbazole) or highly twisted (e.g., triphenylamine) donor units, which impairs their versatile utility in molecular and aggregated states. Herein, we proposed a unique chair&#8208;shaped indoline donor (cID) with a hybrid planar&#8211;twisted conformation, which affords bright various states (solution, solid, microspheres, nanoparticles, and films) NIR emission spanning 650&#8211;1200&#160;nm, with tails extending to 1600&#160;nm. The cID donor promotes electron localization, imparting higher oscillator strength and a smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap to the designed NIR fluorophores, which together enhance light&#8208;harvesting capacity and induce red&#8208;shifted emission. Meanwhile, the sterically hindered nonconjugated group in cID effectively restricts low frequency vibration&#8208;induced non&#8208;radiative decay, as evidenced by the reduced reorganization energy and Huang&#8211;Rhys factor in both isolated and crystalline phase. Through structurally &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension, these NIR fluorophores exhibit robust various&#8208;state NIR&#8208;I (photoluminescence quantum yields up to 67.8% and brightness up to 15668 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) and NIR&#8208;II emission, which allows diverse advanced applications in porous ceramic damage detection, stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, and NIR&#8208;II vascular imaging, thereby positioning cID as a versatile toolkit to create a novel NIR dye library for biomedical and optoelectronic field.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Enhanced Photoiniferter Polymerization: Ultrafast, Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant, and Biocompatible Synthesis of Well&#8208;Defined Polymers Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triplet&#8208;enhanced photoiniferter polymerization (TEPP) is developed, which enables ultrafast kinetics through rapid photolysis while preserving excellent control via enhanced reversible deactivation and fast chain transfer, overcoming the trade&#8208;offs between speed, control, and oxygen sensitivity. This system also shows high biocompatibility with live cells.








Abstract
Photoiniferter polymerization offers an attractive, additive&#8208;free strategy for precision polymer synthesis but is often constrained by a trade&#8208;off between speed and control, oxygen sensitivity, and the need for high&#8208;energy light. In this study, we introduce a triplet&#8208;enhanced photoiniferter strategy that overcomes these limitations. Through computationally guided design, we developed methyl 2&#8208;((3&#8208;methoxypyrazole&#8208;1&#8208;carbonothioyl)thio)propanoate (MOP), a photoiniferter exhibiting exceptional photophysical properties: a large triplet energy (ET&#160;=&#160;43.5&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1), a remarkable triplet quantum yield (&#934;T&#160;=&#160;82.9%), and a low C&#9472;S bond cleavage barrier (8.5&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). These attributes collectively enable ultrafast polymerization kinetics via rapid photolysis while preserving excellent control through enhanced reversible deactivation and faster degenerative chain transfer. This triplet&#8208;enhanced photoiniferter polymerization (TEPP) achieves high monomer conversion within minutes under ambient, open&#8208;to&#8208;air conditions while maintaining low dispersity (&#272;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.1), with intrinsic oxygen tolerance conferred by efficient triplet oxygen sensitization to singlet oxygen. We further demonstrate the versatility and biocompatibility of this system through high&#8208;throughput synthesis, sunlight&#8208;driven polymerization, and in situ polymerizations that achieve &gt;95% cell viability. This work establishes a powerful and versatile platform for precision polymer synthesis under mild, ambient conditions, with broad potential in surface coating, biomaterials, and additive manufacturing.

         <title>Ethanol Synthesis by CO2 Photoreduction Catalyzed by Self&#8208;Optimized Ti&#948;+&#8208;Based Heterojunction</title>

Self&#8208;generated oxygen vacancy in TiO2&#8722;x brought by BNF leads to different electron densities of adjacent Ti sites which achieved C2H5OH record yield of 51.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a global selectivity of 99%.








Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 to ethanol (C2H5OH) is a promising carbon&#8208;neutral technology for renewable energy. Nevertheless, low efficiency of multielectron utilization and high C&#9472;C coupling energy barrier cause poor performance in C2H5OH production. Here, we report a TiO2&#8722;x/BNF (boron nitride flower) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction microreactor to steer the asymmetric Ti active sites configuration and redox potential, thereby enhancing the thermodynamic and kinetic formation of C2H5OH. The S&#8208;scheme TiO2&#8722;x/BNF heterostructure provides spatially separated sites for CO2 reduction and water oxidation with efficient charge carrier utilization. The flower&#8208;like structure of BNF improves the local concentration of *CO within microreactors originated from confinement effect to satisfy the coupling process. Self&#8208;generated oxygen vacancy in TiO2&#8722;x brought by BNF leads to different electron densities of adjacent Ti sites, which strengthens the adsorption of *CO and reduces the *CO&#8208;CHO formation energy. C2H5OH dehydration is often difficult within the hydrophilic TiO2&#8722;x/BNF microreactor, thus it tends to produce C2H5OH rather than C2H4. Through the synergizing effects, the well&#8208;constructed microreactor delivers an excellent C2H5OH production rate of 51.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 99% and unprecedented global stability. Our work can serve as inspiration for developing Ti&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 conversion to C2H5OH using solar energy.

Cationic covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework as a bifunctional host enables efficient proton transport and enhanced battery cyclability performance, outperforming the previously reported solid&#8208;state proton battery (PB) systems.








Abstract
Despite promising prospects afforded by high power density and abundant proton sources, proton batteries (PBs) face practical limitations. Liquid electrolytes induce anode dissolution and parasitic reactions, while solid electrolytes suffer from low proton conductivity and poor electrode compatibility. Herein, we introduce a bifunctional strategy for PBs using a cationic covalent organic framework (EB&#8208;COF). Synthesized from ethidium bromide (EB) and 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP), this bifunctional host simultaneously stabilizes phosphomolybdate (PMo12) clusters anode and confines H3PO4 as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte within its nanochannels. The resulting EB&#8208;COF:H3PO4 electrolyte exhibits superior proton conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1) and a wide electrochemical stability window (3.3&#160;V versus SCE). The assembled PB delivers exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, retaining 91% capacity over 15&#160;000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1, surpassing all reported solid&#8208;state PBs. This performance stems from excellent electrode&#8208;electrolyte compatibility and the high structural stability of the EB&#8208;COF:H3PO4 system. This study provides valuable insights for developing reliable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state PBs.

         <title>Design of a Multienzyme Derived from Mouse Fatty Acid Synthase for the Compartmentalized Production of 2&#8208;Pyrone Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multienzyme was formed and evaluated by covalently linking 4&#8208;coumarate ligase (4CL1) from Piper methysticum to a non&#8208;reducing murine fatty acid synthase. 4CL1 acylates the acyl carrier protein (ACP). The ketosynthase (KS) was engineered to accept the non&#8208;native cinnamoyl substrate, which is elongated by malonyl&#8208;CoA loaded via the malonyl&#8208;acetyl&#8208;transferase (MAT), to form styrylpyrone. Styrylpyrone is a precursor for psychoactive kavalactones.









Abstract
Compartmentalizing biosynthetic pathways is a key objective in protein engineering, particularly in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. It can improve catalytic efficiency, stabilize reactive intermediates, reduce by&#8208;product formation, and, beyond these advantages, enable synthetic complexity by coordinating multistep pathways. In this study, we established a chemoenzymatic platform for producing 2&#8208;pyrones&#8212;specifically styrylpyrones and hispidin&#8212;within a multienzyme based on a non&#8208;reducing&#160;(nr) variant of the murine fatty acid synthase&#160;(FAS), which naturally produces palmitic acid. By introducing two amino acid substitutions in the ketosynthase&#160;(KS) domain, we enhanced the nrFAS&#8208;mediated synthesis of styrylpyrones from non&#8208;native substrates, including halogenated derivatives. The engineered enzyme exhibited a 66&#8208;fold increase in activity compared to the non&#8208;mutated nrFAS, surpassing the styrylpyrone synthase of the kavalactone pathway in Piper methysticum. Additionally, we integrated a 4&#8208;coumarate ligase (4CL1) loading module into the compartment using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system, enabling the activation and direct transfer of cinnamic acid derivatives to the nrFAS. The resulting styrylpyrones are direct precursors of pharmaceutically active kavalactones, while hispidin serves as the precursor of fungal bioluminescence.

         <title>Surface Halide Inversion Mitigates Voltage Losses in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for Efficient Tandem</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodine&#8208;rich surface with a localized bandgap narrowing is uncovered as an inherent cause for VOC loss of wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs. A rational halide inversion strategy is developed, achieving 20.89% efficiency in single&#8208;junction devices and 29.15% in tandems, with superior operational stability.








Abstract
Substantial energy loss at the wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite/fullerene interface poses a fundamental bottleneck for efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (APTSCs). Surface defects of WBG perovskite are a known source of non&#8208;radiative recombination and have been well&#8208;passivated, but this interface still remains with low quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) with considerable voltage loss. Here, we reveal another critical source of the interfacial loss, that WBG perovskite surface features an iodine&#8208;rich nature with a locally narrower bandgap (Eg). The simulations reveal that the narrow local Eg induces serious non&#8208;radiative recombination at both surface and bulk regions, and the bromine&#8208;rich is preferable with aligned energy levels. From this mechanistic insight, we systematically compared distinct strategies of surface polishing, bromine compensation and halide inversions via functional agents. Comparably, inverting surface into a bromine&#8208;rich via cesium fluoride (CsF) demonstrates as the most effective pathway for less undesirable recombination and higher QFLS. Additionally, Cs/F substitutions can strengthen surface lattice, significantly enhancing the phase stability. Consequently, we achieve a champion efficiency of 20.89% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.368&#160;V for WBG perovskite photovoltaics. After stacking to tin&#8208;lead subcell, an impressive efficiency of 29.15% in APTSCs is realized, coupled with good T90 operational stability of 1000&#160;h.

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity of Chalcogen Bonding over Halogen Bonding Catalyzed C&#8208;glycosylation Through Differentiated Intermediate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing chalcogen bonding (ChB) catalysis, an exclusive access into a highly stereoselective strain&#8208;release C&#8208;glycosylation pathway was discovered. This was surprisingly not replicable by the conceptually similar halogen bonding (XB) catalysis. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the stereoselectivity divergence can be traced to the privileged ChB activation of a downstream bicyclic intermediate by a phosphonochalcogenide (PCH) catalyst. 








Abstract
&#963;&#8208;hole&#8208;based noncovalent interactions are gaining intense attention as robust tools in stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis. However, the mechanistic understanding behind the differing performance between chalcogen bonding (ChB) catalysis versus halogen bonding (XB) catalysis in chemical glycosylations still remains unresolved. Herein, we disclose a remarkable instance whereby phosphonochalcogenide (PCH) catalysis displays pronounced selectivity and reactivity elevation in aryl&#8208;C&#8208;glycosylations compared to XB catalysis. Mechanistic studies revealed that the enhanced stereocontrol can be attributed to the differentiated downstream activation of a key bicyclic intermediate. Hammett analysis supported that ChB catalysis shifted the C&#8208;glycosylation toward the SN1 domain, while the XB catalysis proceeded with SN2 characteristics. DFT calculations further illuminated that the downstream ChB catalytic engagement involved all four selenium &#963;&#8208;holes engaging in two bifurcated ChB modes. This study thus sheds new light that the selectivity benefits of ChB catalysis could be accounted for by privileged mechanistic access into an otherwise inaccessible stereoselective pathway.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fused Carbonyl/Nitrogen Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enable Efficient Pure&#8208;Red Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused C&#9552;O/N&#8208;based multi&#8208;resonance emitters with small energy gaps of 1.97&#160;eV are developed by integrating electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl and electron&#8208;rich nitrogen atom into a conjugated diene skeleton, giving pure&#8208;red narrowband electroluminescence at 628&#160;nm with small full&#8208;width at half maxima of 37&#160;nm, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiencies of 24.2% at maximum with very small roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) narrowband emitters are attractive for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, but their development is hindered by scarcity of red&#8208;emitting molecular skeletons. Here, we propose a new design strategy for efficient pure&#8208;red carbonyl/nitrogen (C&#9552;O/N) MR emitters, by integrating electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl (C&#9552;O) and electron&#8208;rich nitrogen (N) into a non&#8208;fused conjugated diene skeleton. Unlike the counterparts having fused polycyclic skeletons with only one C&#9552;C bond between adjacent C&#9552;O and N atoms, the non&#8208;fused MR emitters allow insertion of two conjugated C&#9552;C bonds between them, which not only lowers energy gap (1.97&#160;eV) to redshift emission, but also retains short&#8208;range charge transfer with atomically alternating highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) distributions along the diene framework to achieve narrowband emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence effect. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the emitters exhibit pure&#8208;red electroluminescence at 628&#160;nm with small full&#8208;width at half maxima (FWHMEL) of 37&#160;nm, together with high external quantum efficiencies of 24.2% at maximum and 23.8% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which to our best knowledge, makes them the first example of pure&#8208;red C&#9552;O/N MR emitters with FWHMEL below 40&#160;nm. The results provide new insight for developing long&#8208;wavelength MR emitters by expanding their material systems from fused polycyclic frameworks to non&#8208;fused conjugated polyene skeletons.

         <title>Dual Proton/Anion Binding Through Reciprocal Allostery in Platinum(II) Lantern&#8208;Shaped Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple lantern&#8208;shaped Pt(II) cages show nuanced dual&#8208;action behaviour, where affinities for binding anions and protons are simultaneously enhanced, revealing the first example of a supramolecular system capable of reciprocal allostery. 








Abstract
Reciprocal allosteric regulation, where binding events influence each other simultaneously, is a key target for supramolecular chemists designing biomimetic systems. Platinum(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages, formed from a series of ligands bearing central protonatable sites of varied basicity through rational tuning of the backbone, featured nuanced dual action host&#8208;guest chemistry. This reveals the first example of reciprocal allostery in a supramolecular system, between protonation and anion binding. Switching studies were conducted using acid/base and silver/chloride stimuli, with single and multi&#8208;anion systems.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Schiff&#8208;Base Nickel Complexes as Cathode Interlayers for High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three Schiff&#8208;base nickel complexes Ni&#8208;Me, Ni&#8208;iPr, and Ni&#8208;tBu were designed and synthesized as CILs through two steps with an overall yield up to 73%, with a low cost of 0.76 $ g&#8722;1, lower than PDINN of 1.56 $ g&#8722;1. When Ni&#8208;Me was employed as CIL achieved a high PCE of 19.11% in PM6:L8&#8208;BO OSCs, which is higher than PDINN (18.52%) and PNDIT&#8208;F3N (18.5%), and Ni&#8208;Me showed excellent universality (19.06% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and 19.62% for D18:L8&#8208;BO).








Abstract
Efficient cathode interlayers (CILs) materials are crucial for high performance bulk&#8208;heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ&#8208;OSCs). Herein, we report three excellent and low&#8208;cost CILs Ni&#8208;Me, Ni&#8208;iPr, and Ni&#8208;tBu based on Schiff&#8208;base nickel complexes for the first time. The target molecules are obtained by highly efficient reactions and simple purification methods, affording a high overall yield of over 73%. These CILs show great work function tuning capability and film&#8208;forming property. Among them, Ni&#8208;Me demonstrates the highest electron conductivity (6.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and electron mobility (5.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1), surpassing those of the widely used high&#8208;performance CILs PDINN (5.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1, 1.76&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1), and PNDIT&#8208;F3N (3.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1, 2.64&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1). Grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray scattering measurements indicate that Ni&#8208;Me has higher crystallinity than Ni&#8208;iPr and Ni&#8208;tBu. When employed as the CIL in PM6:L8&#8208;BO OSCs, Ni&#8208;Me delivers a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.11%, outperforming PDINN (18.52%) and PNDIT&#8208;F3N (18.5%). The Ni&#8208;Me CIL also shows excellent universality (19.06% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and 19.62% for D18:L8&#8208;BO). This work demonstrates that Schiff&#8208;base nickel complexes have great potential as CILs in OSCs.

         <title>Synergistic Action of Crystallophore and Imaging&#8208;Crystallophore Enhances the Production and Imaging of Protein Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Imaging&#8208;crystallophore (Im&#8208;Xo4), a Tb(III) complex substituted by &#960;&#8208;conjugated antennas emits in the green and accumulates in the protein crystals, enabling an easy crystal detection using fluorescence microscopy. However, its nucleating properties are not as effective as ones of Tb&#8208;Xo4. Finally, the synergetic mixture of Tb&#8208;Xo4/Im&#8208;Xo4 (10/0.2 mM), called mix, combines the best of nucleating and imaging properties. 








Abstract
The synthesis and photophysical characterization of a new family of terbium(III) complexes called Imaging&#8208;crystallophore, substituted by &#960;&#8208;conjugated antennas, is reported. Previous crystallophore variants (such as Tb&#8208;Xo4) have shown very interesting nucleating properties to obtain high&#8208;quality protein crystals. In addition, the Imaging&#8208;crystallophore emits in the green and accumulates in the protein crystals, enabling very easy crystal detection using fluorescence microscopy under one&#8208;photon but also under two&#8208;photon excitations. X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the binding site of the Imaging&#8208;crystallophore in hen&#8208;egg white lysozyme (HEWL) is similar to that of the Tb&#8208;Xo4 but present additional hydrophobic interactions with the conjugated antennas. However, its nucleating properties are not as effective as those of Tb&#8208;Xo4. Finally, we emphasize the synergy between the two generations of crystallophore by preparing and analyzing the properties of the mix (10/0.2) corresponding to a mixture of Tb&#8208;Xo4 and Imaging&#8208;crystallophore. By combining the best of nucleating and imaging properties, we can easily obtain and detect high&#8208;quality protein crystals

         <title>Ionomer&#8208;Driven Reaction Microenvironment Control in Bicarbonate&#8208;Mediated Integrated CO2 Capture and Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proton&#8208;conducting ionomer regulates the reaction microenvironment by increasing the local CO2 concentration around a catalyst particle, resulting in a record CO partial current density of 410&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 3.09&#160;V. The impressive bicarbonate electrolysis performance enables a promising bicarbonate&#8208;mediated integrated CO2 capture and electrolysis process.








Abstract
Bicarbonate electrolysis coupling upstream CO2 capture with electrochemical conversion of captured CO2 presents an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to existing CO2 electrolysis route. Yet, its practical application is impeded by unsatisfactory reaction rate and energy efficiency. Here, we have improved the bicarbonate electrolysis performance through manipulating reaction microenvironments by introducing ionomers into cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) electrodes. The Nafion&#8208;incorporated CoPc electrode exhibits a maximum CO partial current density of 410&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 3.09&#160;V in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer. Electrode structure characterization and finite element simulation results indicate that the proton conductivity of the Nafion ionomer increases the local concentration of in situ generated CO2 around CoPc catalyst, resulting in impressive CO production performance. A closed&#8208;loop demonstration using the Nafion&#8208;incorporated CoPc electrode and a simulated flue gas underscores the great promise of the bicarbonate&#8208;mediated integrated CO2 capture and electrolysis process.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Enabled Skeletal Rearrangement of Cyclic Ketones into Strained Cyclopropane&#8208;Fused Medium Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet energy transfer enables a skeletal topological leap, converting readily accessible five&#8208; to eight&#8208;membered cyclic ketones into strained cyclopropane&#8208;fused medium rings (CFMR) in a single&#8208;step. The broadly applicable and functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant transformation proceeds through a 1,4&#8208;carbonyl migration&#8208;induced ring expansion&#8211;collapse cascade, as supported by DFT calculations.








Abstract
Cyclopropane&#8208;fused medium rings (CFMR) are attractive structural motifs that combine high strain with unique three dimensionality, however their efficient and modular synthesis remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a general photocatalytic skeletal editing strategy that enables a direct topological leap&#8212;a single&#8208;step reorganization that simultaneously alters both ring size and fusion topology&#8212;from readily available five&#8208; to eight&#8208;membered cyclic ketones into diverse seven&#8208; to ten&#8208;membered cyclopropane&#8208;fused medium rings. This transformation proceeds through a novel energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;induced, diradical&#8208;mediated 1,4&#8208;carbonyl migration, orchestrating a &#8220;ring expansion&#8211;collapse&#8221; cascade to forge the strained bicyclic frameworks straightforward, which is supported by DFT calculations. This strategy features broad substrate scope, excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, and high efficiency, enabling the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex molecules and exploration of CFMR chemical space that was previously inaccessible. Moreover, integration of this strategy with further skeletal modification enables rapid construction of versatile [n.3.0] bicycles.

         <title>Overcoming Copper Instability via Nickel Alloying for Efficient Plasmon&#8208;Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable CuNi bimetallic catalyst (CuNi/Al2O3) was developed for plasmon&#8208;enhanced photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. Under the irradiation, a remarkable CO production rate of 4813&#160;&#181;mol/g/h is achieved, outperforming most noble metal (Au, Ag)&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts. The synergy between Ni and light markedly lowers the reaction activation energy and furnishes Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts with an metallic valence state throughout the reaction to suppress CO poisoning. This strategy addresses the long&#8208;standing stability bottlenecks of conventional Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts.








Abstract
The development of efficient, stable, and low&#8208;coat plasmonic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation via the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction remains a significant challenge. Conventional Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts suffer from poor stability due to the valence state fluctuation, nanoparticle sintering, and CO poisoning. Herein, we report a low&#8208;cost CuNi bimetallic plasmonic catalyst (CuNi/Al2O3) that address these bottlenecks, achieving a remarkable CO production rate of 4813&#160;&#181;mol/g/h under light irradiation at a relatively low temperature (300 &#176;C), outperforming conventional Cu&#8208;based and noble metal catalysts. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ni incorporation enhances catalytic activity and stability by reducing activation energy, maintaining surface valence stability and suppressing nanoparticle sintering. In situ characterization further confirms that light not only drives the CO2 hydrogenation via the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Cu but also synergizes with Ni to suppress CO poisoning and promote surface reducibility, ensuring long&#8208;term stability. This work provides a rational design strategy for low&#8208;cost, stable Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts and deepens the mechanistic understanding of alloy&#8208;mediated plasmonic CO2 conversion, offering insights for advancing solar&#8208;driven CO2 valorization.

Abstract
Acetylcholine (ACh) is a critical neurotransmitter that regulates diverse physiological functions, such as cognition and muscle contraction, through synaptic transmission. However, in situ quantitative chemical analysis of single&#8208;vesicle storage and release dynamics at single&#8208;cell level remains a major technical challenge, hindering mechanistic understanding of cholinergic synaptic plasticity across physiological and pathological states. To address this, we developed an Ti3C2Tx MXene/enzyme&#8208;functionalized (M@E@CF) nanosensor, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of vesicular ACh storage and exocytotic release in primary cholinergic neurons and human spinal cord organoids. Our findings reveal a sub&#8208;quantal release mode in both mouse and human&#8208;derived neurons. To further elucidate the regulatory principles of exocytosis kinetics, we classified single&#8208;vesicle exocytosis patterns based on signal peak shapes using a 1D convolutional neural network (1D&#8208;CNN) deep learning model, uncovering significant differences in the number of released molecules and kinetic parameters across modes. Critically, in Down syndrome models, we observed significantly reduced single vesicle ACh storage and release alongside an elevated release fraction, concurrent with shortened fusion pore durations during exocytosis. Thus, the M@E@CF nanosensor platform establishes a versatile tool for spatiotemporal investigation of neurotransmitter storage and release dynamics, providing a critical technical foundation for exploring physiological functions and pathological mechanisms of the cholinergic system.

         <title>Realizing Cocktail Effects in Catalytic High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (HEMOFs) via Predictive Density of State Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a computationally led approach to predicting synergistic cocktail effects in high&#8208;entropy metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HEMOFs). Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate a key intermediate for CO2 epoxidation, establishing a correlation between composition and catalytic activity based on differences in the valence edge peak in the band gap. Synthesized HEMOFs validated DFT predictions, confirming an optimal composition with 40% greater activity than the least active variant.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials, particularly high&#8208;entropy metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HEMOFs), represent a promising class of catalysts amenable to imparting superior activity via harnessing cocktail effects. However, optimal leveraging of these effects remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a promising, computationally driven roadmap for the rational selection of metal compositions in catalytic HEMOFs. Density functional theory (DFT) was first used to probe a key catalytic intermediate for CO2 epoxidation in a series of compositionally related high&#8208;entropy polynuclear clusters. A direct correlation between composition and predicted catalytic activity trends was established, capitalizing on clear differences in a new valence edge peak in the band gap as function of active metal site. Following that, a series of HEMOFs with DFT&#8208;predetermined compositions were successfully synthesized. Remarkably, catalytic tests demonstrated the trends predicted by DFT, emphasizing the direct correlation between electronic structure and activity. The DFT&#8208;predicted optimal HEMOF composition was validated experimentally and shown to exhibit over 40% greater activity than the least active variant. The strategy described herein demonstrates the immense promise of harnessing cocktail effects in HEMOFs, wherein synergistic intermetallic effects impart superior catalytic activity. Finally, this work serves as a first step toward enabling machine learning&#8208;driven approaches to optimize catalytic performance through tailored metal compositions.

         <title>Carbonized Polymer Dots as Versatile Nanocarrier for Bioincompatible Fluorophore Imaging</title>

Orthogonal anchoring unlocks the potential of CPDs as efficient bioincompatible fluorescent dye nanocarriers.








Abstract
Fluorophores with excellent emission often come at the cost of cell permeability, and this long&#8208;standing dilemma has limited their effective applications in fluorescence bioimaging to some degree. We report a paradigm&#8208;shifting discovery that carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) can function as a versatile, noncovalent translocation platform for a vast spectrum of otherwise impermeable fluorophores. Our investigation began with the serendipitous observation that a new molecule, 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;7&#8208;carboxylic acid (HECA), forms a stable, cell&#8208;permeable nanocomplex with carbonized polymer dots (CPDs&#8208;280) via noncovalent interactions (loading capacity &#8764;50.8%). This prompted a systematic exploration, which revealed that CPDs&#8208;280 possess a remarkable capacity to override the innate targeting signals of diverse organelle&#8208;specific dyes, rerouting them to the cytosol and demonstrating a carrier&#8208;dominated localization mechanism. The platform's generality was rigorously proven by delivering custom&#8208;designed, membrane&#8208;impermeable amphiphilic dyes (ESY&#8208;Na+ and ESY), which remained inert alone but produced intense intracellular luminescence upon noncovalent complexation. This robust, cargo&#8208;agnostic delivery capability is rooted in the abundant orthogonal anchor domains on the CPD's surface, enabling multimodal binding without chemical modification. This work unveils a generic strategy to breach biological barriers, instantly unlocking the vast repository of underutilized fluorescent probes for advanced bioimaging and theranostics.

Our investigation began with the serendipitous observation that a new molecule, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-oxo-1,2,3,5-tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-7-carboxylic acid (HECA), forms a stable, cell-permeable nanocomplex with carbonized polymer dots (CPDs-280) via noncovalent interactions (loading capacity &#8764;50.8%). This prompted a systematic exploration, which revealed that CPDs-280 possess a remarkable capacity to override the innate targeting signals of diverse organelle-specific dyes, rerouting them to the cytosol and demonstrating a carrier-dominated localization mechanism. The platform's generality was rigorously proven by delivering custom-designed, membrane-impermeable amphiphilic dyes (ESY-Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ESY), which remained inert alone but produced intense intracellular luminescence upon noncovalent complexation. This robust, cargo-agnostic delivery capability is rooted in the abundant orthogonal anchor domains on the CPD's surface, enabling multimodal binding without chemical modification. This work unveils a generic strategy to breach biological barriers, instantly unlocking the vast repository of underutilized fluorescent probes for advanced bioimaging and theranostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic NaK Channel Membrane Enabled by a Crown Ether&#8208;Coordinated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial membranes mimicking biological NaK functions are realized by coordinating UiO&#8208;66&#8208;COOH with carboxybenzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5. These membranes exhibit tunable ion selectivity, switching between K+/Mg2+ (102) and Na+/K+ (103) under single&#8208; and mixed&#8208;salt conditions, and enables dynamic Mg2+&#8208;gated ion transport. This work opens new avenues for next&#8208;generation iontronic devices and artificial cells requiring precise and adaptive ion control.








Abstract
Biological NaK channels integrate exquisite ion selectivity with dynamic gating to regulate life processes, yet achieving such multifunctionality in synthetic channels has remained a formidable challenge. Here, we present a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) channel membrane that combines two complementary ion&#8208;conduction motifs: carboxyl groups from UiO&#8208;66&#8208;COOH and carboxybenzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5&#8208;COOH), assembled in a one&#8208;step coordination strategy. This hybrid architecture recapitulates essential NaK channel functions, offering both ultrahigh ion selectivity and controllable gating. The membrane enables highly selective conduction of monovalent cations while effectively excluding Mg2+, yielding M+/Mg2+selectivity above 102. Under mixed&#8208;ion conditions, it achieves unprecedented Na&#8314;/K&#8314; selectivity exceeding 103, far surpassing reported artificial ion channels. Remarkably, Mg2+ ions dynamically gate Na&#8314; and K&#8314; transport with sustainable on&#8211;off ratios around 30. These outstanding performances arise from the synergistic interplay of crown ether and carboxyl groups confined within subnanometer MOF pores. This work establishes a versatile strategy for designing multifunctional artificial ion channels, opening avenues toward advanced ionic devices for artificial cells and biomedical technologies.

         <title>Anthracene Bisurea as a Supramolecular Chloride Receptor for Additive&#8208;Free, Broad&#8208;Scope Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(I) chloride complexes are excellent precatalysts to activate unsaturated C&#9472;C bonds but typically require problematic silver salts for chloride scavenging. A supramolecular chloride receptor embedded in a phosphine ligand removes the need for inorganic chloride scavengers. Detailed mechanistic studies explain the key role of the quintuple H&#8208;bond donor motif in cleaving the Au&#9472;Cl bond to promote fast, broad&#8208;scope, additive&#8208;free catalysis.








Abstract
Gold catalysis provides access to a remarkable array of complex carbon scaffolds, but the use of silver salts to activate gold(I) chloride precatalysts can be problematic due to Ag(I) light sensitivity, hygroscopicity, redox activity, and interference with the desired catalysis. Although H&#8208;bond donors are a promising alternative to silver salts, they still suffer from much lower activity and narrower applicability, as Au&#8211;Cl cleavage remains rate limiting. To address these limitations, we have rationally designed a self&#8208;activating phosphine Au(I) chloride complex that incorporates a supramolecular chloride receptor in the form of an anthracene bisurea quintuple H&#8208;bond donor. In the absence of any additive, this complex promotes multiple intra&#8208; and intermolecular reactions, with a catalytic activity rivalling traditional inorganic chloride scavengers. Mechanistic studies for the model reaction show that the exceptional chloride binding ability of the anthracene bisurea unlocks access to a zwitterionic catalyst resting state where the Au&#9472;Cl bond has been cleaved, thus significantly reducing barriers for catalysis. The principles uncovered in this work show how supramolecular anion recognition moieties impact catalyst speciation and enhance performance, enabling for the first time H&#8208;bond donors to compete with inorganic chloride scavengers in terms of activity and generality.

The thiourea&#8208;bearing ionizable lipid 4A3&#8208;LNSC8 enables systemic mRNA delivery to the spleen and lymph nodes by binding halide anions via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, selectively targeting splenic macrophages. Leveraging iodine's CT contrast properties, the iodide&#8208;coordinated I&#8208;4A3&#8208;LNSC8 nanoparticles further facilitates dual&#8208;modal CT and bioluminescence imaging of lymphatic metastasis.








Abstract
Systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to non&#8208;hepatocytes using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) remains challenging. Inspired by anion coordination chemistry, here we report the rational chemical design of thiourea&#8208;functionalized ionizable lipids (TUILs) for delivering mRNA potently and specifically to the secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). The leading TUIL, namely 4A3&#8208;LNSC8, features an impressive thiourea&#8208;based linker capable of binding with various halide anions (F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, I&#8722;) through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction, enabling precise regulation of LNP organotropism in vivo. When administered systemically, the representative Cl&#8208;4A3&#8208;LNSC8 LNPs exclusively redirected mRNA delivery from the liver to SLOs, yielding a 65&#8208;fold and 29&#8208;fold increase in splenic mRNA expression compared to DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA and SM102 LNPs with the addition of anionic lipid (18PA). Notably, upon intravenous injection of 0.2&#160;mg kg&#8722;1 Cre mRNA, Cl&#8208;4A3&#8208;LNSC8 LNPs demonstrated strong tropism for splenic macrophages with high gene editing efficiency up to 65.7%, outperforming the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spleen&#8208;targeted LNPs. Moreover, by leveraging iodine's CT contrast properties, I&#8208;4A3&#8208;LNSC8 LNPs mediated efficient theranostic mRNA delivery to lymph nodes, allowing early detection of lymphatic metastasis via dual&#8208;modal CT and bioluminescence imaging. This work provides new insights into the development of cell&#8208;specific ionizable lipids, advancing future applications of macrophage&#8208;targeted therapies.

         <title>Geometric Preorganization Enables Entropy&#8208;Constrained Proton Migration for Ultrafast and Stable Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangular preorganization funnels protons into coherent low&#8208;entropy pathways, enabling high capacity and durable aqueous proton storage.








Abstract
The development of aqueous proton batteries (APBs) is hindered by the scarcity of electrode materials capable of regulating proton migration. Although organic electrodes are promising candidates, they often suffer from Coulombic repulsion and entropy&#8208;induced disorder, leading to performance degradation. Herein, we propose a molecular&#8208;engineering strategy based on geometric preorganization to construct low&#8208;entropy proton transport pathways by designing a C3&#8208;symmetric triangular molecule, 1, 3, 5&#8208;tris (2, 6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1, 2, 5, 6&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;3, 4&#8208;dihydropyrazinyl) benzene (DBH). Its rigid trigonal scaffold preorganizes C&#9552;N and C&#9552;O redox centers, enabling symmetric charge distribution to mitigate repulsion. Moreover, geometric confinement reduces configurational disorder and restricts accessible microstates, directing proton migration along defined pathways while preserving electronic delocalization. As a result, the DBH electrode delivers high and ultrafast proton&#8208;storage capacity, reaching 277.9&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and retaining 207.8&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 even at 100&#160;A g&#8722;1. When assembled into a full cell, the device achieves 100% capacity retention after 30&#160;000 cycles, along with an energy density of 111.97&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a power density of 40 441.2&#160;W kg&#8722;1. These results demonstrate that triangular preorganization combined with entropy regulation enables organic electrodes to exhibit high proton&#8208;storage capacity, rapid kinetics, and exceptional long&#8208;term stability.

&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric triangular molecule, 1, 3, 5-tris (2, 6-dioxo-1, 2, 5, 6-tetrahydro-3, 4-dihydropyrazinyl) benzene (DBH). Its rigid trigonal scaffold preorganizes C&#9552;N and C&#9552;O redox centers, enabling symmetric charge distribution to mitigate repulsion. Moreover, geometric confinement reduces configurational disorder and restricts accessible microstates, directing proton migration along defined pathways while preserving electronic delocalization. As a result, the DBH electrode delivers high and ultrafast proton-storage capacity, reaching 277.9&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and retaining 207.8&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; even at 100&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. When assembled into a full cell, the device achieves 100% capacity retention after 30&#160;000 cycles, along with an energy density of 111.97&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a power density of 40 441.2&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These results demonstrate that triangular preorganization combined with entropy regulation enables organic electrodes to exhibit high proton-storage capacity, rapid kinetics, and exceptional long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupling Adsorption of Key Intermediates Enabled by Asymmetric 3d&#8208;5d&#8208;Orbital Hybridization: Durable High&#8208;Performance AEM Water Electrolysis and Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that an asymmetric 3d&#8208;5d&#8208;orbital hybridization strategy can effectively break the conventional activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in electrocatalysis. The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis based on PtCo@NPC catalyst demonstrated stable operation for over 522&#160;h at a current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a decay rate as low as 0.103&#160;mV h&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the assembled Zn&#8211;air batteries achieved an exceptionally long cycle life exceeding 2520 cycles.








Abstract
Decoupling key intermediates&#8217; adsorption via asymmetric 3d&#8208;5d&#8208;orbital hybridization overcomes the intrinsic scaling relation bottleneck, enabling rational design of high&#8208;performance, durable multifunctional electrocatalysts for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) and Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Here, we reveal that asymmetric 3d&#8208;5d&#8208;orbital hybridization, engineered through the synergy of lattice strain and defect structures in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported PtCo alloy (PtCo@NPC), effectively decouples these adsorption energies of key intermediates. PtCo@NPC demonstrates exceptional multifunctional electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations suggest that electronic structure modulation tunes the adsorption characteristics of intermediates, while X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy confirms the corresponding changes in the electronic states of surface Pt and Co atoms. When deployed in devices, PtCo@NPC enables AEMWEs to operate stably for 522&#160;h at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a voltage decay rate of only 0.103&#160;mV h&#8722;1 and empowers ZABs to achieve a long cycle life of over 2520 cycles at 5.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study highlights electronic&#8208;structure modulation as a powerful strategy for advanced energy technologies.

         <title>Design of Adsorption&#8210;Diffusion Dual&#8208;Driven MOF Membranes for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the adsorption&#8211;diffusion dual&#8208;driven design principle and assisted by high&#8208;throughput computational screening, CAU&#8208;10pydc was identified as a promising membrane material. It experimentally achieved a CO2 permeability of 2847 Barrer and a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 185, surpassing the 2019 upper bound and demonstrating strong potential for industrial application.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer exceptional tunability in pore structure and functionality, holding considerable potential for advanced gas separation membranes. However, their advancement is restricted by the permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off and inefficient empirical screening. Herein, we propose an adsorption&#8211;diffusion dual&#8208;driven design strategy balancing moderate CO2 adsorption affinity (1 &lt; &#945;ads,HTCS&#160;&lt;&#160;10) and high CO2 diffusivity selectivity (&#945;diff,HTCS&#160;&gt;&#160;10) within a pore&#8208;limiting diameter range of 3.8&#8211;4.4&#160;&#197;. This rationale is corroborated by high&#8208;throughput computational screening and experimental membrane performance. Three yfm&#8208;topology MOF membranes&#8212;CAU&#8208;10H, CAU&#8208;10pydc, and KMF&#8208;1 with finely tuned pore microenvironments were synthesized, with the former two meeting the proposed criteria and KMF&#8208;1 serving as a counterexample. As anticipated, CAU&#8208;10H and CAU&#8208;10pydc exceed the 2019 upper bound for CO2/CH4 separation, with CAU&#8208;10pydc exhibiting a remarkable CO2 permeability of &#8764;2847 Barrer and a selectivity of 185, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Moreover, despite sharing the same kinetic diameter as CO2, C2H2 exhibits 1.5 times higher adsorption affinity, resulting in a significantly lower permeability of only 39 Barrer under the same conditions. These results confirm the adsorption&#8211;diffusion dual&#8208;driven design principle, providing both theoretical insight and practical guidance for other challenging gas separation scenarios.

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free photocatalytic Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction of alkynyl triazenes is described, proceeding via cyanocarbene intermediates. This strategy enables the efficient construction of highly substituted asymmetric carbon centers with broad substrate scope, delivering synthetically valuable nitriles.








Abstract
Doyle&#8211;Kirmse rearrangement reactions are widely recognized as versatile and powerful synthetic tools, promoting the simultaneous generation of C&#9472;C and C&#9472;S bonds. While notable progress has been attained, Doyle&#8211;Kirmse rearrangement reactions involving cyanocarbenes have rarely been reported owing to the limited strategies available for the preparation of cyanocarbene precursors and its inherently restricted reactivity. Herein, we report photochemical Doyle&#8211;Kirmse rearrangement reactions of alkynyl triazenes via intermediate cyanocarbenes under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions, leading to valuable &#945;&#8208;mercapto&#8208;nitriles in generally moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. In contrast to existing methods that utilize alternative cyanocarbene precurors, this approach delivers the possibility to access highly substituted stereogenic carbon centers and it offers a safer alternative by avoiding hazardous reagents. The reactions proceed under mild conditions, and demonstrate broad substrate compatibility. In addition, upscaling of the reaction was successfully demonstrated. Besides the use of allylsulfides, propargyl as well as allenylsulfides were also feasible substrates demonstrating the great synthetic potential of the transformation.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Induced Confined Synthesis of Metastable &#947;&#8208;MnO2 Nanoclusters in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Ozone Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An universal dual&#8208;induce strategy for preparing MOF&#8208;confined sub&#8208;3&#160;nm metal&#8208;oxide nanocluster (UMONs@MOF) was constructed with exceptional compatibility to incorporate diverse metal oxides across the periodic table and various canonical MOFs. Replacing the pristine components with the composite, the ozone decomposition efficiency of UMONs@MOF maintains 100% under entire humidity for 100&#160;h owing to the nanoconfinement, spatial restriction and cluster&#8211;cluster cooperative effects, thus substantially lowering the activation energy.








Abstract
Ultrafine metal oxide nanoclusters (UMONs) exhibit remarkable catalytic potential due to their high specific surface area; however, achieving precise control over both the size and crystal phase of UMONs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;induced confined synthesis strategy that couples hydrophobic gating with thermally triggered phase transformation to precisely confine UMONs within the pores of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). 13 UMONs@MOF composites were successfully synthesized with the metal cations in UMONs spanning different regions of the periodic table. Notably, sub&#8208;3&#160;nm metastable &#947;&#8208;MnO2 was stabilized and confined within MIL&#8208;101(Fe) for the first time. The optimized 15% &#947;&#8208;MnO2@MIL&#8208;101(Fe) showed a durable 100% O3 removal efficiency for over 100&#160;h. This performance was maintained in a continuous air flow containing 40&#160;ppm O3 at a high gas hourly space velocity of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;h&#8722;1 over a wide humidity range of 10%&#8211;90%. Mechanistic studies reveal that its superior catalytic activity originates from the synergistic effect between the confined &#947;&#8208;MnO2 active sites and the Fe3O clusters in the MIL&#8208;101(Fe). This work provides a universal approach for the precise control of the size and crystal phase of UMONs, paving the way for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts.

Notably, sub-3&#160;nm metastable &#947;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was stabilized and confined within MIL-101(Fe) for the first time. The optimized 15% &#947;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@MIL-101(Fe) showed a durable 100% O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; removal efficiency for over 100&#160;h. This performance was maintained in a continuous air flow containing 40&#160;ppm O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at a high gas hourly space velocity of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over a wide humidity range of 10%&#8211;90%. Mechanistic studies reveal that its superior catalytic activity originates from the synergistic effect between the confined &#947;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; active sites and the Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O clusters in the MIL-101(Fe). This work provides a universal approach for the precise control of the size and crystal phase of UMONs, paving the way for designing high-performance catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable DNA Nanostructures for hTERT Compartmentalization and Translocation in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA condensate is self&#8208;assembled from DNA&#8208;based modules mediated by telomerase inside cancer cells, achieving the regulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) translocation by controlling its export from the nucleus and preventing its mitochondrial localization. This process induces mitochondrial dysfunction and effectively inhibits cancer cell proliferation. 








Abstract
Protein translocation is essential for cellular function, and compartmentalizing proteins can regulate their activity. However, constructing artificial intracellular compartments to control this process remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the artificial dynamic assembly of DNA condensates in the cytoplasm, enabling the specific compartmentalization of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and effectively inhibiting its canonical and non&#8208;canonical activities. DNA&#8208;based condensates are formed through the dynamic assembly of branched DNA structures incorporating a mitochondria&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphine and a telomerase primer for telomerase recognition. Upon uptake by cancer cells, the primer interacts with telomerase, triggering a strand displacement reaction that releases X&#8208;shaped DNA. The sticky palindromic sequences in the X&#8208;shaped DNA promote self&#8208;assembly, forming DNA condensates on mitochondria. These condensates disrupt mitochondria functions, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and stimulating the export of hTERT from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, hTERT is specifically captured by the DNA condensates, preventing its translocation to mitochondria. The reduction of hTERT in both nucleus and mitochondria further results in impaired cellular proliferation and mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells. This work provides a highly controllable strategy for manipulating protein translocation through compartmentalization in living cells, offering a promising new avenue for modulating cellular behavior.

         <title>Regulation of the D&#8208;Band Center Through Ligand Engineering in Silver Cluster&#8208;Based MOFs Enhances Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;engineered regulation of d&#8208;band center in silver cluster&#8208;based MOFs facilitates CO2 adsorption and reaction intermediate activation, achieving high performance of electroreduction of CO2 to CO under acidic conditions.








Abstract
Acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) offers a promising way for achieving high CO2 utilization efficiency and circumventing carbonate deposition issues. However, it is plagued by a compromised catalytic performance due to the severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, two types of silver chalcogenolate cluster&#8208;based MOFs were synthesized through ligand engineering by anchoring Ag12 clusters with tri&#8208;topic imidazole and pyridyl ligands respectively. The imidazole&#8208;based MOF Ag12THIT demonstrated outstanding performance for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. In acidic electrolyte of pH&#160;&#8776;&#160;2, it achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5% with a commercial current density of 328.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at&#160;&#8722;&#160;1.6&#160;V versus RHE. Moreover, the CO partial current density (jCO) reached a maximum of 447.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a FECO of 96.8% at&#160;&#8722;&#160;1.7&#160;V versus RHE. No obvious degradation was observed during 70&#160;h of continuous operation, and the performance significantly outperformed those of pyridyl&#8208;based MOFs Ag12TPEB and Ag12TPMA. Mechanistic studies revealed that the imidazole ligand endows Ag12THIT with enhanced Lewis basicity and superior &#963;&#8208;donating ability, thereby strengthening the ligand field with an upshifted d&#8208;band center and reduced energy barriers. This ligand effect facilitates more efficient electron transfer to *COOH intermediates, thus promoting acidic CO2 to CO conversion.

         <title>Geometry Controls Confined Water Dynamics in Lipidic Mesophases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An archaeal&#8208;inspired lipidic mesophase allows precise control of interfacial curvature and water&#8208;channel connectivity. Combining structural, thermodynamic, and ultrafast spectroscopies, we reveal that curvature governs the structure and reorientation dynamics of confined water, establishing a molecular&#8208;level link between topology and dynamics in soft nanoconfinement.








Abstract
Water under nanoscale confinement is central to biological function, catalysis, and soft materials, yet how geometry dictates its structure and dynamics remains unresolved. Here, we establish a direct link between interfacial curvature and confined water behavior using an archaeal&#8208;inspired phytantriol&#8208;water lipidic mesophase platform. By systematically tuning curvature across lamellar, double&#8208;gyroid cubic, and reverse micellar phases, and integrating structural, thermodynamic, and ultrafast spectroscopies, we show that geometry controls the dimensionality and mobility of the hydrogen&#8208;bond network. Planar interfaces enforce 2D networks that slow down interfacial water through spatial constrain, whereas curved bicontinuous and micellar topologies promote 3D networks with accelerated reorientation. These findings reveal a geometric principle for governing water dynamics in soft nanoconfinement, providing molecular level design rules for confined transport and reactivity in membranes and functional materials.

         <title>Selective Singlet Oxygen Generation over a Silver&#8211;Porphyrin Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalyst for Ultrafast Sulfide Photooxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
A silver&#8211;porphyrin single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalyst (Ag&#8208;TMPP) enables ultrafast sulfide photooxidation under mild conditions. This self&#8208;assembled framework achieves near&#8208;quantitative methyl phenyl sulfide conversion in 15&#160;min (TOF&#160;=&#160;3112&#160;h&#8722;1) with excellent recyclability and broad substrate tolerance.








Abstract
The selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides represents a fundamental transformation in synthetic and pharmaceutical chemistry, yet most catalytic systems require harsh conditions or long reaction times. Herein, we report a silver&#8211;porphyrin single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalyst (Ag&#8208;TMPP; TMPPH2 = tetrakis(4&#8208;methylphenyl)porphyrin) that enables ultrafast photooxidation of sulfides under mild conditions. Ag&#8208;TMPP is readily obtained by a simple solution&#8208;phase self&#8208;assembly of AgNO3 and TMPPH2, affording a well&#8208;ordered three&#8208;dimensional framework stabilized by C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The catalyst achieves nearly quantitative conversion of methyl phenyl sulfide to sulfoxide within 15&#160;min, delivering a turnover frequency of 3112 h&#8722;1&#8212;among the highest reported for heterogeneous metal&#8208;based systems. It exhibits excellent recyclability and broad substrate tolerance, efficiently oxidizing both aryl and alkyl sulfides. Mechanistic investigations supported by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exceptional performance originates from the highly selective generation of singlet oxygen (1O2), whereas other metalloporphyrins (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Co, Zn etc.) favor competing reactive oxygen species. This study provides an accessible and efficient strategy for harnessing 1O2 in photooxidation catalysis.

         <title>Selective N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Peptides and Proteins Using Fatty Acyl Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective modification of peptides and proteins is vital for their development as therapeutics. Here, the adenylation domain of a carboxylic acid reductase enzyme from Segniliparus rugosus (CARsr&#8208;A) was used to generate reactive acyl adenylates in situ from carboxylic acids. Functionalized and simple fatty acids were incorporated with excellent selectivity at the N&#8208;termini of therapeutically relevant peptides and proteins.








Abstract
The selective modification of proteins and peptides is an important chemical biology tool with a wide variety of applications, including the production of biopharmaceuticals or the study of post&#8208;translational modifications. In particular, the selective acylation of the N&#8208;terminus over side chains in peptides and proteins is a highly desirable but challenging reaction in this field. Current methods have a range of shortcomings, including lack of selectivity or narrow substrate scope. Here we report a biomimetic approach using the in situ enzymatic reagent activation (ERA) of carboxylic acids with ATP to generate acyl&#8208;adenosine monophosphates. This method displays high selectivity for the N&#8208;termini of peptides and proteins, including pharmaceutically relevant liraglutide, glucagon and insulin. The ERA acylation tolerates a broad range of unsubstituted and substituted fatty acids, including azido and dicarboxylic acids, thus making it suitable for N&#8208;terminal bioorthogonal labelling strategies. Moreover, this strategy can also be applied to the modification of antibodies. In general, the ERA acylation is a versatile and bioorthogonal method that we envisage finding wider applications in the field of bioconjugation and the production of stable peptide and protein conjugates.

         <title>Catalytic 1,2&#8208; and 1,1&#8208;Carbocyclization of Alkenes Employing Adamantanols as Tertiary Carbocation Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses the challenge of utilizing tertiary carbocations in catalytic electrophilic cyclization. A Br&#248;nsted acid system facilitates efficient 1,2&#8208; or formal 1,1&#8208;addition of adamantyl cations to various alkenes, yielding adamantylated heterocycles with high selectivity. DFT calculations indicate that the stabilized, moderate electrophilicity of the adamantyl cation and the effect of the nucleophilic tether are key to the success.








Abstract
Catalytic alkene cyclization initiated by carbon electrophiles represents an emerging strategy for constructing valuable and challenging molecular architectures. However, due to reactivity issues, the realization of such reactions with tertiary carbon electrophiles remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report an efficient Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed system that overcomes this limitation. Using 1&#8208;adamantanols as precursors of tertiary carbocation electrophiles, and through TfOH catalysis, alkenes tethered with carboxyl, sulfonamide, and hydroxyl groups, including those with relatively low reactivity such as alkyl&#8208;substituted and terminal alkenes, can be converted into a variety of adamantylated heterocycles in hexafluoroisopropanol with good yields via 1,2&#8208;addition or formal 1,1&#8208;addition, with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The products serve as versatile synthetic building blocks and can be readily transformed into valuable adamantyl&#8208;containing compounds, including derivatives with anti&#8208;influenza A activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments indicate that the moderate electrophilicity of the adamantyl carbocation and the hyperconjugative effect of the adamantyl group in stabilizing carbocations form the basis for achieving the electrophilic cyclization. Additionally, they also reveal that different nucleophilic groups can influence the progression of the reaction. These findings provide references for the design of new electrophilic reactions.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Melonine and (+)&#8208;N4&#8208;Oxy Melonine Enabled by an Intramolecular Alkene Diamination Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complexity&#8208;generating intramolecular alkene diamination constitutes the pivotal step in the enantioselective synthesis of the title natural products featuring a strained, cage&#8208;like pentacyclic architecture. 








Abstract
Among more than four thousand monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) isolated to date, only a few feature a 2,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted indoline moiety. (+)&#8208;Melonine and (+)&#8208;N4&#8208;oxy melonine possess a highly rearranged carbon framework, presumably arising from cyclization of a rearranged iminium ion of quebrachamine precursor. We report herein the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;melonine and (+)&#8208;N4&#8208;oxy melonine featuring: a) a highly enantioselective CBS reduction followed by a stereospecific Johnson&#8208;Claisen rearrangement for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;substituted &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated ester; b) Bower's bis&#8208;cyclizative diamination of alkene, enabling the conversion of a functionalized cycloheptene to the tetracyclic core of the natural products; and c) an AlMe3&#8208;mediated lactamization that concurrently achieves desymmetrization at the C20 prochiral center.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimulus Triggered Programmable Transformation of Molecular Motor Based Chiral Supramolecular Polymers in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report aldehyde motor&#8211;based chiral supramolecular polymers that exhibit light and chemically driven dual responsiveness in water. The supramolecular polymers show transformation and amplification of multi&#8208;state chirality into diverse geometries, offering dynamic control of supramolecular chirality and architectures.








Abstract
A notable characteristic of living organisms is their capacity to adapt to environmental changes and transform external signals into distinct responsiveness, facilitating the execution of diverse functions with motility as a key parameter. To better mimic such lifelike behavior, researchers have developed various supramolecular assembled systems with responsive behavior toward a variety of stimuli. However, exploiting motion along length scales and achieving collective control over the responsiveness to multiple stimuli in supramolecular systems is still challenging. Here we present the development of molecular motor based supramolecular polymers that are responsive toward multi&#8208;stimulus and exhibit multi&#8208;state assembly and chirality. Taking advantages of aldehyde functionalized motors, we realized photo&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers featuring boosted photo&#8208;efficiency, near quantitative photoconversions, programmable behavior and responsiveness to multiple stimuli in a reversible manner in aqueous media. The various stimuli including light and different chemicals could act on the motor building blocks and subsequently trigger the transformation of the supramolecular polymers toward reversible polymerization, direct post&#8208;functionalization and chirality modulation. The interplay between the rotary molecular motion and the supramolecular systems assembly process, taking advantage of different external stimuli to govern the assembly state, provides a basis for multi&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials

         <title>Surface Hydroxyl Network Promoted Hydrogen Transfer Dynamics for Efficient Photocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism is realized in photocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation by establishing a hydroxyl network over the hydroxyl&#8208;modified carbon nitride (C3N4&#8208;OH)/Ni(OH)2 composite. The hydroxyl network provides a strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment to adsorb interfacial water and accelerate hydrogen transfer dynamics.








Abstract
Photocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) to ethylene (C2H4) is seriously limited by the inefficient generation and directional transfer of active hydrogen species. Here, we report a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism for photocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation by establishing a hydroxyl network over hydroxyl&#8208;modified carbon nitride (C3N4&#8208;OH)/Ni(OH)2 composite. Such a hydroxyl network not only enhances photogenerated charge separation but also establishes a strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment for adsorbing interfacial water and facilitating hydrogen transfer dynamics. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, in situ photochemical infrared spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and active hydrogen (H*)&#8208;trapping reveal that the fast proton transfer via a PCET mechanism, rather than a conventional hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathway. Eventually, the C3N4&#8208;Ni(OH)2 achieves an exceptionally high C2H4 production rate of 15.7&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a C2H4 selectivity of 98.2% under simulated solar irradiation. For purifying a crude C2H4 stream containing 0.5&#160;vol% C2H2, the C2H2 conversion remains &#8764;98% over a long&#8208;term continuous&#8208;flow operation. This work elucidates the pivotal role of surface hydroxyl networks in governing hydrogen kinetics and paves a new avenue for the design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

This work elucidates the pivotal role of surface hydroxyl networks in governing hydrogen kinetics and paves a new avenue for the design of high-performance photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Paired&#8208;Cell Ammonia over Black CoWO4 via Electrocatalysis&#8211;Acidification Cascade from Wastewater at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paired NO3RR&#8208;UOR system using bifunctional oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich black CoWO4 achieves unprecedented bipolar NH3 production with an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 173.12% and an NH3 yield rate of 9.43&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. 








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) offers a sustainable alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, its practical implementation is limited by the sluggish and energy&#8208;demanding oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. Herein, we report a strategically designed paired&#8208;electrolysis system coupling NO3RR with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), followed by chemical acidification, to establish an economical route of bipolar ammonia (NH3) production, using a black CoWO4 (B&#8208;CoWO4) with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) as the electrocatalyst. B&#8208;CoWO4 shows a record&#8208;breaking performance with a current density of &#8764;1.25 A cm&#8722;2 at an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Combined spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal a &#8220;fill&#8208;restore&#8221; cycle of OVs during NO3RR: oxygen from NO3&#8722; incorporates into the OVs, which are subsequently restored after the formation of NH3. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the OVs modify the electronic structure of the catalyst and facilitate the formation of key intermediate (NO3H*). Importantly, in the coupled NO3RR||UOR flow&#8208;cell system, B&#8208;CoWO4 delivers an apparent bipolar NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 173.12% and a production rate of 9.43&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This integrated strategy boosts overall energy efficiency and enables simultaneous valorization of nitrate&#8208;contaminated water and urea&#8208;rich wastewater streams.

         <title>Electrochemical Degradation of Perfluoroalkyl Sulfonates via Sulfonate to Carboxylate Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel approach for the degradation of perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) involving a controlled, electromediated, sulfonate&#8208;to&#8208;carboxylate headgroup conversion. We apply this method to shorter chain PFSAs and provide key mechanistic insights that contribute to a broader understanding of the molecular pathways underlying pollutant degradation and highlight the power of organic electrochemistry in addressing environmental challenges.








Abstract
Efficient, scalable, and well&#8208;understood methods for degrading per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are essential for limiting their numerous negative human health and environmental effects. Electrochemical methods are promising for PFAS degradation but are currently not yet well developed for use in non&#8208;aqueous conditions relevant for PFAS sorbent regeneration without resorting to specialized electrode materials. Herein, we report the mediated electrochemical conversion of perfluoroalkyl sulfonates to carboxylates using commercial Pt electrodes in acetonitrile. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was converted primarily to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) alongside several shorter&#8208;chain carboxylates through a proposed radical desulfonation and hydroxide coupling process explored in a detailed mechanistic study. Following the near&#8208;complete conversion of PFOS to perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, all species are mineralized to fluoride and non&#8208;fluorinated carbon byproducts using established low&#8208;temperature DMSO/NaOH conditions. HPLC&#8208;MS, ion chromatography, and quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods determined a significant loss in fluorine and carbon balance after electrochemistry, which we attribute to the production of volatile byproducts. This degradation approach provides new insights into PFAS degradation mechanisms under highly oxidative, non&#8208;aqueous conditions and highlights the potential for organic electrochemistry to address environmental challenges by promoting controlled and selective destruction pathways for common organic pollutants.

         <title>M&#8211;O&#8211;C Catalysts: Copper Single Atoms Supported on Oxocarbon Covalent Networks as Electrocatalysts for Glycerol Oxidation to Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a new class of single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts based on oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in oxocarbon networks (M&#8211;O&#8211;C), alternative to traditional M&#8211;N&#8211;C materials. A Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C catalyst derived from oxocarbon precursors exhibits highly dispersed Cu single atoms and delivers faster glycerol oxidation kinetics and higher formate selectivity than conventional Cu&#8208;based and Cu&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.








Abstract
N&#8208;doped carbon single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) have emerged as some of the most efficient electrocatalysts, offering both high activity and selectivity. To date, stabilization of single atoms on conductive carbon has been achieved almost exclusively through coordination with nitrogen atoms. Here, we introduce copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (Cu SACs) uniquely coordinated by oxygen within a stable oxocarbon network derived from tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ)&#8208;Cu metal&#8208;organic frameworks. By thermal condensation with MgCl2&#183;6H2O at 600 &#176;C, we achieve an oxygen&#8208;rich carbonaceous material (30 wt% O) hosting highly dispersed Cu atoms. Advanced electron microscopic, spectroscopic, and scattering techniques, including high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR&#8208;STEM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), pair distribution functions (PDF), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), provide definitive experimental evidence of predominant Cu&#8211;O coordination, distinguishing these catalysts (M&#8211;O&#8211;C) from conventional nitrogen&#8208;coordinated SACs. The resulting Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C catalyst exhibits high selectivity (85% Faradaic efficiency) for electrochemical glycerol oxidation into formic acid under alkaline conditions, outperforming traditional Cu&#8208;based systems. In comparison with traditional Cu&#8211;N&#8211;C system, Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C shows faster reactions kinetic, arising from unique Lewis basicity of oxygen coordination, facilitating electron&#8208;proton transfer reactions. This study not only pioneers Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C SACs but also introduces oxocarbons as promising supports, offering novel pathways for designing highly efficient single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Dual Catalytic Sites Enable Asymmetric C&#9472;C Coupling for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW catalyst was successfully developed with precisely engineered Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Cu sites, achieving a maximum FEethanol of 57.3% in CO2RR. Combined 13CO2&#160;+&#160;12CO co&#8208;feed experiments and a collection of operando/in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the enhanced ethanol selectivity originates from asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling between *CO (generated at in&#8208;situ formed LS Fe(II) sites) and *CHO (formed at O&#8208;bridged Cu sites).








Abstract
Understanding C&#9472;C coupling pathways is essential for achieving selective CO2 conversion into multi&#8208;carbon products. However, controlling intermediates dimerization remains highly challenging due to both the complexity of the catalytic systems and the limited mechanistic knowledge into the C&#9472;C coupling process. In this work, a model dual&#8208;site catalyst with precisely configured Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Cu sites is designed by covalently grafting iron&#8208;phthalocyanine (FePc) onto copper nanowires via oxygen bridges (FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW), which enables probing of atomic&#8208;level mechanistic insights into the C&#9472;C coupling pathways during electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Remarkably, the FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW exhibits a 23.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene Faradaic efficiency ratio as compared to O&#8208;Cu NW, achieving&#160;&gt;&#160;80% C2+ Faradaic efficiency at an industrially relevant current density of 1&#160;A cm&#8722;2. 13CO2/12CO co&#8208;feed experiments together with a collection of operando/in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the enhanced ethanol selectivity over FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW arises from asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling between *CO and *CHO intermediates, where *CO is generated at the low&#8208;spin single&#8208;Fe&#8208;atom site, while *CHO is produced at the oxygen&#8208;bridged Cu site. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further unveil that the oxygen&#8208;bridged Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Cu site can not only stabilize the in situ generated low&#8208;spin Fe(II) active site for enhancing CO2 activation and lowering *CO desorption energy but also construct an oxygen&#8208;bridged Cu active site to stabilize the *OCHO intermediate, significantly lowering the *OCHO&#8208;to&#8208;*CHO conversion energy barrier, orchestrating an efficient asymmetric *CO&#9472;*CHO coupling path and boosting the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion.

Combined &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;+&#160;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CO co-feed experiments and a collection of &lt;i&gt;operando/&lt;/i&gt;in-situ characterizations reveal that the enhanced ethanol selectivity originates from asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling between *CO (generated at in-situ formed LS Fe(II) sites) and *CHO (formed at O-bridged Cu sites).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding C&#9472;C coupling pathways is essential for achieving selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion into multi-carbon products. However, controlling intermediates dimerization remains highly challenging due to both the complexity of the catalytic systems and the limited mechanistic knowledge into the C&#9472;C coupling process. In this work, a model dual-site catalyst with precisely configured Fe-O-Cu sites is designed by covalently grafting iron-phthalocyanine (FePc) onto copper nanowires via oxygen bridges (FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-O-Cu NW), which enables probing of atomic-level mechanistic insights into the C&#9472;C coupling pathways during electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). Remarkably, the FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-O-Cu NW exhibits a 23.6-fold enhancement in the ethanol-to-ethylene Faradaic efficiency ratio as compared to O-Cu NW, achieving&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;80% C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency at an industrially relevant current density of 1&#160;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CO co-feed experiments together with a collection of &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt;/in-situ characterizations reveal that the enhanced ethanol selectivity over FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-O-Cu NW arises from asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling between *CO and *CHO intermediates, where *CO is generated at the low-spin single-Fe-atom site, while *CHO is produced at the oxygen-bridged Cu site. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further unveil that the oxygen-bridged Fe-O-Cu site can not only stabilize the in situ generated low-spin Fe(II) active site for enhancing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and lowering *CO desorption energy but also construct an oxygen-bridged Cu active site to stabilize the *OCHO intermediate, significantly lowering the *OCHO-to-*CHO conversion energy barrier, orchestrating an efficient asymmetric *CO&#9472;*CHO coupling path and boosting the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetraaza[7]&#8211;[15]helicenes Synthesized by Two&#8208;Step Strategy: Length&#8208;Controlled Chiral &#960;&#8208;Systems Exhibiting Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

A modular two&#8208;step strategy provides tetraaza[n]helicenes (n&#160;=&#160;7&#8211;15) as a homologous series with tunable photophysical and chiroptical properties. Extension beyond n&#160;=&#160;11 induces pronounced through&#8208;space &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, narrowing the energy gap and amplifying circularly polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Helicenes are chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules whose properties strongly depend on their lengths. Systematic studies of these compounds have been limited by synthetic challenges. Here we report a concise two&#8208;step strategy (defined as the helicene&#8208;forming sequence from aminohelicene precursors) to access a homologous series of tetraaza[7]&#8211;[15]helicenes. Optical spectra converge beyond [11]H, defining a conjugation ceiling, while chiroptical responses amplify sharply, yielding |glum| up to 0.028. Fluorescence quantum yields show a nonmonotonic dependence, with [7]H and [15]H maintaining both high &#934;F (0.39 and 0.36) and large |glum|, resulting in outstanding, albeit semi&#8208;quantitative, CPL performance, with figures of merit reaching 0.010 and CPL brightness values of approximately 490. TD&#8208;DFT calculations attribute this amplification to the delayed alignment of electric and magnetic transition dipoles, while 1H NMR shifts of inner protons provide an independent probe of structural reorganization within the helical cavity. Additionally, experiment and theory have consistently identified [11]H as the critical helicene length at which the framework undergoes a qualitative transition. Notably, the [15]helicene constitutes the longest helicene ever resolved into its enantiomers, underscoring the synthetic power of this modular approach. Importantly, our synthetic route is effective for constructing higher&#8208;order helicenes, offering a generalizable platform for length&#8208;controlled, heteroatom&#8208;containing helicenes. These findings establish long tetraazahelicenes as a rare platform where through&#8208;bond conjugation and through&#8208;space orbital coupling act cooperatively to govern photophysical and chiroptical properties.

         <title>Non&#8208;Statistical Assembly of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cages for Light&#8208;Induced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8211;acceptor functionalized cages [Pd2D2A2]4+ with defined stoichiometry and stereoconfiguration were assembled in a single step by employing the shape complementary assembly (SCA) strategy. While the redox functionalities remain largely independent in the ground state, photoexcitation results in ultrafast ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer, as unraveled by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and transient absorption spectroscopy.








Abstract
We report light&#8208;triggered charge separation in two discrete supramolecular architectures that self&#8208;assemble in a single step from donor (D) and acceptor (A) functionalized bridging ligands and Pd(II) cations. The &#8220;shape complementary assembly&#8221; (SCA) strategy allows for exclusive formation of the cis&#8208;[Pd2D2A2]4+ cage isomer. Compared to previously reported statistical DA assemblies, lacking stoichiometry and stereo control, the number of possible electron transfer routes was reduced. This enables a better understanding and tunability of the excited state dynamics. Cage assembly was investigated by NMR, MS, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Steady&#8208;state absorption and electrochemical properties indicate that donor and acceptor moieties remain largely independent in the electronic ground state. Femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy in the visible and infrared was applied to compare the fate of photoexcited states for pure ligands, donor&#8208; and acceptor&#8208;only assemblies, and the donor&#8211;acceptor heteroleptic cages. For the latter, ultrafast intracage ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge separation is followed by two back electron transfer pathways, occurring on timescales of hundreds of picoseconds and around one nanosecond, assignable to D/A ligands facing each other in cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;position. Our work shows that non&#8208;statistical modular self&#8208;assembly can be used for the precise positioning of photoredox&#8208;active components in defined distances on the nanoscale.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidatively stable benzoyl&#8208;fused peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene ribbons with NIR emission were synthesized. Their good spectral overlap enabled cascaded F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) antennae in a nematic liquid crystal phase, achieving directional energy transfer. The final light&#8208;harvesting system exhibits a two&#8208;step FRET efficiency of 0.70 and extended visible absorption, providing efficient panchromatic light&#8208;harvesting capability.








Abstract
In this work, we present a modular donor&#8211;acceptor strategy that produces oxidatively stable, benzoyl&#8208;fused peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX) ribbons with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and light&#8208;harvesting properties. Benzoyl fusion at the pseudo&#8208;peri positions, achieved through intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts planarization, creates the first benzoyl&#8208;functionalized PXX monomers, dimers, and trimers that exhibit deep red&#8211;NIR absorption and emission without significantly raising the HOMO level. The ribbons display strong, tunable absorption and fluorescence bands, with up to 63% of emission in the NIR and an NIR fluorescence quantum yield&#160;reaching 0.36 in solution. Lewis adducts formed between boron&#8208;based Lewis acids and carbonyl acceptor sites further enhance the electron&#8208;accepting nature of the ketones, producing pure NIR emission (&#934;FNIR$\mathit{\Phi}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{NIR}}$ &#8776; 0.15&#8211;0.16). Spectroelectrochemical investigations uncover reversible electrochromism and electrofluorochromism, allowing&#160;redox&#8208;gated switching and NIR absorption signatures, useful for sensing and display technologies. When embedded in a nematic liquid crystal phase, the ribbons function as cascaded F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) antennas, achieving near&#8208;quantitative single&#8208;step energy transfer (&#934;$\mathit{\Phi}$FRET&#160;=&#160;0.97) and highly efficient two&#8208;step transfer (&#934;$\mathit{\Phi}$FRET&#160;=&#160;0.70), enabling directional energy funneling. Their complementary absorption broadens the excitation window to cover the entire visible spectrum, making them highly efficient panchromatic light&#8208;harvesting materials.

Utilizing this strategy, PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM achieves a record&#8208;high iodine uptake of 88.58&#160;wt% and exhibits remarkable kinetics (k1&#160;=&#160;0.025&#160;min&#8722;1), surpassing all previously reported benchmark adsorbents under industrial conditions.

Capturing radioactive molecular iodine (I2) from nuclear waste under industrial conditions remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we developed for the first time a pore space multiple&#8208;layer functionalization (PSMLF) strategy, which enables directionally distribute functional sites across the multi&#8208;layer regions of large pore space, thereby enhancing the I2 adsorption ability by optimizing pore space utilization. Utilizing this approach, the optimized adsorbent PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM achieves a record&#8208;high I2 uptake of 88.58&#160;wt% under simulated industrial conditions (150&#160;&#176;C and 150&#160;ppmv I2), a 108&#8208;fold improvement over its parent material, PAF&#8208;1. This performance significantly surpasses that of industrial Ag@MOR and all previously benchmarked adsorbents under the same conditions. Furthermore, adsorption kinetic of PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM (k1&#160;=&#160;0.025 min&#8722;1) are significantly higher than those of all other porous adsorbents reported to date. These results thus establish PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM as a new benchmark for high&#8208;temperature I2 adsorbents. Mechanism investigation reveals a new insight that the I2 adsorption capacity is positively correlated with the pore space utilization rate. Our work not only develops a promising adsorbent for industrial radioactive I2 capture but also establishes a general design principle for creating high&#8208;temperature I2 adsorbents suitable for practical applications.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Antigenicity Evaluation of an O&#8208;Antigen Octadecasaccharide from Helicobacter pylori</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic total synthesis of the H. pylori SS1 O&#8208;antigen octadecasaccharide was achieved by stereoconvergent [6&#160;+&#160;4] assembly and protecting&#8208;group&#8208;controlled enzymatic site&#8208;specific fucosylation. Glycan microarray screening of the synthetic O&#8208;antigen and its fragments identified a simpler antigenic epitope, providing a key target for glycoconjugate vaccine design.








Abstract
Helicobacter pylori infection represents a major global health challenge, characterized by high prevalence, significant association with gastric cancer, and rising antibiotic resistance. Carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccines targeting the O&#8208;antigen of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) present a promising alternative to conventional antimicrobial therapies. To explore the immunogenicity of LPS O&#8208;antigen from clinical isolate H. pylori SS1, we report an integrated chemoenzymatic strategy for the first synthesis of its octadecasaccharide O&#8208;antigen and related fragments for antigenicity evaluation. Our strategy features modular chemical synthesis of a decasaccharide precursor containing a high&#8208;carbon sugar (D,D&#8208;Hep) residue, a unique oligomeric &#946;1,2&#8208;linked ribofuranosyl tetrasaccharide motif and a switchable glucosamine (GlcNH2) residue through stereoconvergent [6&#160;+&#160;4] assembly, followed by protecting&#8208;group&#8208;controlled enzymatic elongation to precisely install hybrid Lewis antigen moiety (Ley&#8208;Lex) in a site&#8208;specific fucosylation manner to afford the target octadecasaccharide bearing five challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages. Chemical stereoselective construction of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosidic and 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosidic linkages was accomplished by reagent&#8208;controlled glycosylation and 4&#8208;O&#8208;acyl remote participation, respectively. Enzymatic site&#8208;specific installation of the remaining three 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosidic linkages was achieved using two robust fucosyltransferases and a strategically designed GlcNH2 residue. Glycan microarray&#8208;based screening of the synthetic O&#8208;antigen and its subunits with H. pylori&#8208;infected patient sera identified an undecasaccharide as a simpler and key epitope for vaccine development.

         <dc:description>
In this report, we demonstrate that simple N&#8208;methoxyamide substrates bearing a tethered heteroatom can be used to access oxo&#8208; and aza&#8208;heterocycles of different ring sizes. The catalytic system couples a Cu(I)&#8208;induced radical generation and the subsequent 1,5&#8208;H&#8208;atom transfer together with a Cu(III)&#8208;involved &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;radical trapping by a tethered heteroatom, realizing a redox&#8208;neutral C&#8211;H amination and oxygenation without external oxidants.








Abstract
Cyclative C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of unactivated C&#9472;H bonds with heteroatoms is a straightforward way to construct saturated aza&#8208; and oxo&#8208;heterocycles, which continues to display ever&#8208;increasing prevalence in drug design. Building upon our recently reported copper catalysis that used simple N&#8208;methoxyamides as radical precursors, we report a method to access diverse aza&#8208; and oxo&#8208;heterocycles, including cyclic sulfonamides, cyclic ethers, and lactones of different ring sizes. By placing a heteroatom in the N&#8208;methoxyamide substrate, the carbon radical formed at the &#947;&#8208;position from the intramolecular H&#8208;abstraction by the amidyl radical could be trapped with the pendant heteroatom, leading to a redox&#8208;neutral Cu&#8208;catalyzed cyclative &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization. The syntheses of a wide range of saturated aza&#8208; and oxo&#8208;heterocycles demonstrate the versatility of this method.

         <dc:description>
This work presents a water&#8208;processable covalent&#8208;and&#8208;supramolecular polymeric binder that unites poly(acrylic acid), eight&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol), and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 host&#8211;guest interactions into a single adaptive network. Through strong adhesion, reversible stress dissipation, and uniform lithium&#8208;ion transport, the binder enables silicon&#8211;carbon anodes with outstanding interfacial stability and long&#8208;term cycling durability.








Abstract
Silicon/carbon (Si/C) composite anodes are among the most promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries but suffer from severe volume fluctuation and interfacial degradation during cycling. Herein, we report a water&#8208;processable covalent&#8208;and&#8208;supramolecular polymeric binders (CSPBs) that synergistically dissipate mechanical stress and promote Li+ transport to stabilize the Si/C anode interface. The CSPBs integrate poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), amine&#8208;terminated eight&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol) (8arm&#8208;PEG&#8208;NH2), and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7/secondary ammonium host&#8211;guest complexes through amidation during electrode fabrication. The covalent linkages impart strong structural integrity, while the reversible supramolecular interactions act as sacrificial bonds to dissipate stress arising from Si volume expansion. Additionally, oxygen&#8208;rich PEG chains form continuous Li+ conduction pathways, enabling efficient ion transport. As a result, the CSPB&#8208;2&#8208;based Si/C anode delivers a high specific capacity of 582.0 mAh g&#8722;1 after 265 cycles at 1C, with superior rate capability than the electrodes based on PAA or solely covalently cross&#8208;linked binders (CCBs). Kinetic analysis reveals an enhanced Li+ diffusion coefficient, confirming the improved ionic conductivity of the binder system. This work demonstrates a new strategy for integrating covalent anchoring and dynamic supramolecular adaptability within a sustainable, water&#8208;processable polymeric binder system, paving the way for the design of durable and high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anodes.

Its strong fluorogenicity and photoswitching behavior support super&#8208;resolution microscopy, revealing dynamic membrane processes, nanoparticle trafficking, and nanoscale architecture in diverse live and fixed cell types.








Abstract
The plasma membrane exhibits diverse substructures, such as pseudopodia, membrane nanotubes, and migrasomes, that are essential for cellular communication and cargo transport. Imaging these fine structures remains challenging due to their nanoscale dimensions and limitations of existing fluorescent probes. Here, we report the development of two rhodamine&#8208;based probes, RSD1 and RSD2, incorporating anionic membrane&#8208;anchoring groups and pyrrolidine auxochromes to enable wash&#8208;free, serum&#8208;compatible, long&#8208;term plasma membrane imaging. RSD2, in particular, demonstrates superior fluorogenicity, brightness, and photoswitching properties, facilitating high&#8208;resolution imaging in both live and fixed cells. It selectively labels membrane substructures across diverse cell types and maintains membrane specificity in the presence of serum. RSD2 is compatible with advanced microscopy techniques including confocal microscopy, instant structured illumination microscopy (iSIM), and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), achieving up to 40&#160;nm resolution. Using two&#8208;color dSTORM, we visualize silica nanoparticle trafficking via membrane nanotubes and gondola&#8208;like bulges in neuronal cells, marking the first such observation. RSD2 also enables imaging of migrasomes and retraction fibers, revealing dynamic membrane&#8208;mediated transport processes. This probe offers a robust and versatile platform for investigating membrane architecture and function, with broad applicability in cell biology, nanomedicine, and super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Programmed Generation of Coordination, Ionic, and All&#8208;In&#8208;One Cu(I) Chloride Architectures with Highly Efficient Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;programmed synthetic strategy directs ligand protonation and nucleation pathways to produce coordination, ionic, and all&#8208;in&#8208;one Cu(I) chlorides, yielding six new structures with tunable 520&#8211;625 nm emission. Among them, the 1D AIO phase A&#8208;1H[CuCl2] (A = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)pyridine, 4AMP) exhibits record photoluminescence quantum yield, outstanding stability, and excellent solution processability, enabling rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free, robust solid&#8208;state lighting and high&#8208;brightness emitting devices.








Abstract
Copper(I)&#8208;based hybrid halides feature highly designable structures, systematic tunability, and excellent photoluminescence; however, developing design rules that can predictably modulate their emission across different structural types remains under explored. Here, we report an acid&#8208;programmed generating approach, in which reaction acidity simultaneously modulates ligand protonation and the nucleation barrier, thereby generating coordination, ionic, and all&#8208;in&#8208;one copper(I) chloride architectures by tuning reaction acidity and affording six new compounds with emissions spanning 520&#8211;625&#160;nm. Among these, the AIO compound 3 A&#8208;1H[CuCl2] (A&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;(aminomethyl)pyridine, 4AMP) exhibits a record&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 99%, setting a new benchmark for AIO Cu(I)&#8208;based emitters. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveal that the ultrahigh PLQY originates from enhanced lattice rigidity and a triplet phosphorescence pathway. Solubility and thin film fabrication demonstrate excellent processability, while long&#8208;term stability stands in stark contrast to the notorious instability of conventional Cu(I) halides. Moreover, mixing compounds yields broad&#8208;range white&#8208;light emission, underscoring the potential of materials for tunable and high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state lighting. This study establishes acid&#8208;driven structural integration as a general strategy for constructing functional copper(I) halide compounds, laying the foundation for stable, solution&#8208;processable, and high&#8208;performance optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Salt Cluster With Surface Defect Shows Anomalous Acid&#8211;Base Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acid displacement of formic acid in sea&#8208;salt aerosols, releasing HCl, challenges conventional acid&#8211;base chemistry. Our gas&#8208;phase experiments show that this reaction occurs on pure NaCl cluster ions in the absence of water. Surface defects of the NaCl cluster ions enable this reaction via enhanced electrostatic interactions of the salt ions with the formate, outweighing the gas&#8208;phase acidity difference between HCl and formic acid.








Abstract
The acid displacement reaction of formic acid in sea&#8208;salt aerosols to release hydrogen chloride is an enigma in atmospheric chemistry: a weak acid transfers a proton to the conjugate base of a strong acid, reversing solution&#8208;phase acid&#8211;base chemistry. To shed light on this question, we compared the reactivity of formic acid with Na13Cl12+ and Na14Cl13+ under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions in a mass spectrometer. No reaction was observed with Na14Cl13+, a known magic cluster that corresponds to a cubic section of the crystal lattice. Na13Cl12+, which corresponds to the cubic section with a surface defect, reacts readily with release of hydrogen chloride and incorporation of formate into the salt structure. Quantum chemical calculations show that the reaction is substantially endothermic for the magic cluster. The surface defect, however, makes it exothermic. The reason lies in the induced fit of the formate ion in the Na13Cl11(HCOO)+ cluster. Its oxygen atoms interact with five sodium ions. In sum, these electrostatic interactions more than offset the 49 &#177; 13&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 difference in gas&#8208;phase acidity between hydrogen chloride and formic acid.

         <title>Selectively Electrocatalytic Reductive Dehydroxylation of 2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol to 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol over Cu Nanowire Arrays at Industrial Current Densities</title>

         <dc:description>
A sustainable and low&#8208;cost electrocatalytic strategy is highlighted for selectively reductive dehydroxylation of 1,4&#8208;butenediol (BED) to 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol (BTO) under ambient conditions. Cu nanowire arrays accelerate the dissociation of C&#9472;OH bond in BED and exhibit a high BTO production rate of 190.8 mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at an industrial current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reductive dehydroxylation is a promising strategy for sustainable synthesis of commodity and high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals but remains a formidable challenge due to the high dissociation energy of C&#9472;OH bond. Here, we report a selectively electrocatalytic reductive dehydroxylation of 1,4&#8208;butenediol (BED) to produce 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol (BTO) over Cu nanowire arrays (Cu NWAs) under ambient conditions. A high BED conversion of &#8764;90.5% and a BTO selectivity of &#8764;80.2% are achieved at &#8211;0.9&#160;V versus RHE. Even in a large&#8208;scale two&#8208;electrode H&#8208;type elecrolyser (1&#160;L), the Cu NWAs stably exhibit a BED conversion of &#8805;&#160;92.3%, a BTO selectivity of &#8805;&#160;82.7%, and a BTO production rate of 190.8 mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at an industrial current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the Cu surface facilitates the dissociation of C&#9472;OH bond in BED and the desorption of BTO, which thus promotes the selective dehydroxylation of BED to BTO. This work highlights a sustainable and efficient strategy for producing high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Dual Modification Strategy of Ionic Liquid for Durable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual modification strategy utilizing 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (BM) has been implemented to simultaneously improve the uniformity of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and passivate defects in perovskite. The inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) attains a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.59%, while the perovskite solar module (PSM) achieves an exceptional efficiency of 22.50% with an aperture area of 12.8&#160;cm2. Notably, these PSCs exhibits outstanding photostability, maintaining unchanged PCE even after 1000&#160;h of continuous solar irradiation.








Abstract
The inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC), featuring self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as the hole transport layer, has achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 27%. However, the non&#8208;uniformity of SAMs and intrinsic defects within the perovskite film continue to constrain further enhancements in device performance. Herein, we developed a strategy for the synchronous modification of SAMs and perovskite by incorporating an ionic liquid of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (BM) to enhance the uniformity of SAMs and passivate defects in perovskite. Specifically, BM was incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution to effectively occupy halide vacancies and passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+. Meanwhile, owing to its ionic properties and the interaction between its functional groups and SAM, BM can effectively regulate the colloidal properties and reduce surface roughness, achieving a more uniform SAM layer. By employing this dual modification strategy, BM significantly modulates the crystallization kinetics, thereby facilitating the formation of highly crystalline perovskite films characterized by substantially enlarged grain sizes and a markedly reduced defect density. Consequently, the device incorporating dual modification of BM achieved a champion PCE of 26.59%, demonstrating exceptional operational stability with no observable PCE degradation after continuous power output at maximum power point (MPP) for 1000&#160;h.

     alt="Dual Modification Strategy of Ionic Liquid for Durable Perovskite Photovoltaics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dual modification strategy utilizing 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole-hexafluorophosphate (BM) has been implemented to simultaneously improve the uniformity of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and passivate defects in perovskite. The inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) attains a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.59%, while the perovskite solar module (PSM) achieves an exceptional efficiency of 22.50% with an aperture area of 12.8&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, these PSCs exhibits outstanding photostability, maintaining unchanged PCE even after 1000&#160;h of continuous solar irradiation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Polyphenol Colchicine Nanoparticles Targeting Oxidative Stress and Inflammation for Treatment of Atherosclerosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atherosclerosis is a major cause of mortality, driven by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. While colchicine shows potential in reducing cardiovascular events, its therapeutic application remains limited and requires further optimization. This study introduces a coordination&#8208;driven, self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle system combining colchicine, tannic acid, and zinc to enhance therapeutic effects of atherosclerosis.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;inflammatory colchicine therapy has emerged as a new era for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, the therapeutic benefit of colchicine has not been clearly defined. Herein, we present a double coordination&#8208;driven approach to fabricate a stable metal&#8208;organic nano&#8208;assembly of colchicine (COL&#8208;TA&#8208;Zn) by uniting the tropolone ring of colchicine (COL), phenolic groups of tannic acid (TA), and Zn2+ ions. This design leverages the antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties of COL and TA to create a nanoscale platform capable of scavenging radicals and modulating inflammatory pathways. Through robust Zn2+ coordination, the resulting COL&#8208;TA&#8208;Zn nanocomplexes exhibit enhanced stability under physiological conditions, ensuring efficient delivery and sustained bioactivity. In vitro assays confirm suppression of foam cell formation and multiple inflammatory mediators, suggesting significant potential for managing atherosclerosis by targeting both oxidative stress and inflammation. Intravenous administration of COL&#8208;TA&#8208;Zn in Apoe&#8722;/&#8722; mice significantly reduces atherosclerotic plaque area, MMP&#8208;9, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thereby illustrating its superior anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy compared to COL alone. These findings highlight the promise of the dual coordination&#8208;driven nanoplatform in cardiovascular disease treatment.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of the Prototypical n&#8208;Type Polymer P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) Enables Capacity Enhancement and High&#8208;Temperature Stability in Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular engineering of the prototypical n&#8208;type polymer P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) through side&#8208;chain shortening and donor simplification yields P(NDI2BO&#8208;V) with 1.51&#8208;fold increase in capacity (56.9 &#8594; 86.0 mAh g&#8722;1). Both polymers maintain long&#8208;term cycling stability at 60 &#176;C&#8212;where small&#8208;molecule organic electrodes typically fail&#8212;thereby revealing design rules that link backbone structure to electron transport, Li+ diffusion, and thermal durability.








Abstract
Conjugated n&#8208;type polymers have long been explored as organic cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet the widely studied P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) has received limited attention as a practical cathode because of its modest capacity (&#8764;55 mAh g&#8722;1). Here, we report the first systematic effort to re&#8208;engineer this prototypical polymer through side&#8208;chain shortening and donor simplification. Replacing bulky 2&#8208;octyldodecyl (2OD) chains with 2&#8208;butyloctyl (2BO) and simplifying the bithiophene (T2) donor to a vinylene (V) produced P(NDI2BO&#8208;V), which delivers a 1.51&#8208;fold higher capacity (56.9&#8594;86.0 mAh g&#8722;1) while retaining excellent cycling stability. Crucially, we show that n&#8208;type polymers can achieve remarkable cycling stability at elevated temperatures: both polymers remained stable at 60 &#176;C, where small molecules fail, with P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) keeping 97% after 1000 cycles and P(NDI2BO&#8208;V) 80% after 600 cycles. Mechanistic studies combining electrochemical analysis with density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how donor linker units dictate structure and transport. Crystalline P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) exhibits higher electronic conductivity and undergoes a one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron redox process, whereas amorphous P(NDI2BO&#8208;V) offers enhanced Li+ diffusivity but follows a stepwise pathway. This work establishes a molecular design framework for conjugated polymer cathodes that combine high capacity, efficient charge transport, and long&#8208;term thermal stability, advancing their potential for practical LIB applications.

Abstract
We present di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP)&#8208;catalyzed long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;induced Group 13, 14, and 15 elementalizations of alkenes and alkynes, through in situ production of tert&#8208;butyl radicals, followed by a hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer process generating silyl, germyl, stannyl, alkyl, boryl, and phosphoryl radicals. This mild and photosensitizer&#8208;free methodology employing blue (450&#160;nm)/green (530&#160;nm)/orange (600&#160;nm) LEDs affords high chemoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance compared to conventional use of shorter&#8208;wavelength light. Synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational data are consistent with a vibration&#8208;mediated photolysis mechanism of DTBP involving electronic excitation from vibrationally excited ground states (S0&#956;n) to the excited state (S0&#956;n&#8594;Sn transitions), driven by ultraweak absorption of long&#8208;wavelength visible light.

         <title>Radical Electroprecipitation from a Water|Oil|Electrode Interface Prolongs &#8220;Electro&#8221;Chemiluminescence of the Tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)Ruthenium(II) and Benzoyl Peroxide System by 103</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiphase systems, including ones with liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundaries, are the home to many curious chemistries including reaction acceleration and spontaneous formation of reactive species. Here we show the liquid&#8208;liquid interface causes electrochemiluminescence and afterglow chemiluminescence lifetime to be enhanced by 220,000% in&#8208;time, far beyond when the electrical potential is applied.








Abstract
Reactive intermediates, including radicals and other short&#8208;lived molecules, are ubiquitous in pure chemical processes and often highly difficult to isolate. Recently, we found that energetic, reactive radical species can be trapped through electroprecipitation, where the precipitate contains a reactive intermediate. The principle is straight&#8208;forward: If a solubility equilibrium can be exceeded before the reactive intermediate lifetime, the intermediate can be precipitated. Classically, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a process where electrical energy is transferred to chemical energy, and then the chemical energy is released in the form of light emission (often in the presence of an electroactive luminophore). The apparent luminescence lifetime, limited by radical lifetimes, of ECL reactions in solution is short (sub&#8208;microsecond), and thus can hinder the performance of the technique as light emission is confined to the electrode surface and occurs only when the electrical potential to the system is applied. Here, we show that with a high concentration (10&#8211;250&#160;mM) of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) being co&#8208;reduced with a tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) complex, we can achieve an ECL emission that lasts for hundreds of seconds after potential arrest, corresponding to a thousand&#8208;fold (103) increase in apparent afterglow chemiluminescence lifetimes. This electroprecipitation process occurs at an aqueous|organic multiphase boundary, which are present all through nature and are arguably more representative of natural chemical processes. Furthermore, experimental parameters, including BPO concentration, applied potential, and electrode material, were investigated. Competitive and parasitic processes, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction and decarboxylation, diminish the electroprecipitation of reactive intermediates, and we detail mitigation and optimization efforts.

&lt;p&gt;Multiphase systems, including ones with liquid-liquid phase boundaries, are the home to many curious chemistries including reaction acceleration and spontaneous formation of reactive species. Here we show the liquid-liquid interface causes electrochemiluminescence and afterglow chemiluminescence lifetime to be enhanced by 220,000% in-time, far beyond when the electrical potential is applied.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive intermediates, including radicals and other short-lived molecules, are ubiquitous in pure chemical processes and often highly difficult to isolate. Recently, we found that energetic, reactive radical species can be trapped through electroprecipitation, where the precipitate contains a reactive intermediate. The principle is straight-forward: If a solubility equilibrium can be exceeded before the reactive intermediate lifetime, the intermediate can be precipitated. Classically, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a process where electrical energy is transferred to chemical energy, and then the chemical energy is released in the form of light emission (often in the presence of an electroactive luminophore). The apparent luminescence lifetime, limited by radical lifetimes, of ECL reactions in solution is short (sub-microsecond), and thus can hinder the performance of the technique as light emission is confined to the electrode surface and occurs only when the electrical potential to the system is applied. Here, we show that with a high concentration (10&#8211;250&#160;mM) of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) being co-reduced with a tris(2,2&#8242;-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) complex, we can achieve an ECL emission that lasts for hundreds of seconds after potential arrest, corresponding to a thousand-fold (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) increase in apparent afterglow chemiluminescence lifetimes. This electroprecipitation process occurs at an aqueous|organic multiphase boundary, which are present all through nature and are arguably more representative of natural chemical processes. Furthermore, experimental parameters, including BPO concentration, applied potential, and electrode material, were investigated. Competitive and parasitic processes, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction and decarboxylation, diminish the electroprecipitation of reactive intermediates, and we detail mitigation and optimization efforts. Overall, this work reveals that multiphase interfaces can be used to electroprecipitate reactive radicals, separating their use in space and time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Growth, Dissolution and Segregation of Genetically Encoded RNA Droplets by Ribozyme Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ribozymes enable sequence&#8208;encoded turnover of RNA droplet material, resulting in transiently active droplets that selectively segregate based on their genotype. This establishes a direct link between genetic information and droplet behavior, marking a step toward programmable, evolvable RNA&#8208;based compartments with life&#8208;like properties.








Abstract
Active droplets, membraneless compartments driven by internal chemical reactions, are compelling models for protocells and synthetic life. A central challenge is to program their dynamic behaviors using heritable genetic information, which would grant them the capacity to evolve. Here, we create transiently active RNA droplets by integrating sites for ribozyme catalysis directly into the sequence of self&#8208;assembling, four&#8208;arm RNA nanostars. To enable perfusion and observe the resulting dynamics over time, we develop a method for trapping individual droplets in hydrogel cages by targeted in situ photopolymerization. This enables us to quantify the sequence&#8208;programmable droplet dissolution and to control the degradation kinetics by choosing between fast (hammerhead) and slow (hairpin) ribozymes. Furthermore, we trigger the segregation of mixed droplet populations via the sequence&#8208;specific cleavage of a chimeric linker RNA. The droplet&#8208;encapsulated DNA templates code for the regrowth of new droplets, establishing the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for a minimal, genetically encoded cycle of dissolution and regrowth. By directly linking RNA sequence to droplet stability, composition, and life&#8208;cycle dynamics, our work provides a robust platform for engineering evolvable materials and advancing the bottom&#8208;up construction of synthetic&#160;cells.

         <title>Energy Level Engineering of Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks Through &#960;&#8208;Expansion of Cores Toward Tandem Photocatalytic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several kinds of 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different &#960;&#8208;extended dihydrophenazine cores were designed and synthesized. These COFs can serve as efficient and recyclable tandem photocatalysts toward two polymerization reactions through energy&#8208;level engineering.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating photoredox&#8208;active motifs show great promise as heterogeneous catalysts, yet their applications have been largely confined to one&#8208;step transformations. In this work, we design and synthesize a series of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs with different &#960;&#8208;extended dihydrophenazine cores to achieve superior photocatalytic performance. These 3D COFs exhibit excellent crystallinity, high surface areas, and remarkable chemical stability. More importantly, they can work as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for photocatalytic tandem polymerization reactions using styrene and fluoroalkyl anhydrides as substrates, yielding fluoroalkylated polystyrene polymers with narrow dispersity. These COFs constitute the first examples as tandem photocatalysts toward polymerization reactions. Moreover, optimal energy level alignment and enhanced photophysical properties are identified as key factors contributing to their high efficacy. This work not only provides a viable design strategy for multifunctional COF catalysts, but also expands their utility in complex synthetic sequences involving tandem catalytic processes.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Biohybrid Upcycling of Polylactic Acid Plastics to Alanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;photosynthesis hybrid system that integrates enzymatic PLA depolymerization and photocatalytic LA upgrading was constructed, which enables the PLA waste transformed into alanine under ambient conditions with a considerable yield rate of 61.91&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Upcycling of waste plastics into commodity chemicals such as amino acids represents a promising route toward achieving negative carbon emissions and enabling a circular carbon economy. However, existing thermocatalytic methods typically require harsh conditions. While photocatalytic upcycling operates under mild conditions, its dependence on a high&#8208;temperature hydrolysis step for plastic pretreatment undermines its overall practicality. Here we report a bio&#8208;photocatalytic hybrid system that converts polylactic acid (PLA) plastics into alanine under ambient conditions. The integrated system begins with enzymatic depolymerization of PLA to lactic acid (LA) with 92% conversion at 55&#176;C and pH 10, catalyzed by an engineered peptidase derived from the Micromonospora sp. strain. Without any purification, the resulting hydrolysate is fed directly to the photosynthesis system, where the LA monomers are converted to alanine over a Ni/ZnIn2S4 catalyst using ammonia as a nitrogen source. This photocatalytic process, which proceeds via an oxygen&#8208;centered radical intermediate pathway, achieves an alanine production rate of 61.91&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and an overall yield of 60%. Life cycle assessment demonstrates that our tandem bio&#8208;photoconversion system substantially reduces the carbon footprint compared to single&#8208;step thermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems. This work thus establishes a sustainable route for valued chemicals production from low&#8208;cost feedstocks.

         <title>Ga&#8208;Induced Reversal of Pd Electronic States in ZrO2&#8208;Supported Pd2Ga1 Nanoparticles for Enhanced Ethanol Electrooxidation via the C1 Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga&#8208;induced electronic redistribution reverses the Pd electronic states, endowing the catalyst with outstanding EOR activity and durability as well as high selectivity toward the C1 pathway.








Abstract
Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are recognized as a promising energy conversion technology due to their high energy density and the renewable, eco&#8208;friendly nature of ethanol. However, their commercialization is hindered by the lack of anode catalysts that simultaneously offer high activity, stability, and selectivity toward the C1 pathway in the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Herein, we report a rationally designed Pd2Ga1&#8208;ZrO2@NC electrocatalyst, in which Pd2Ga1 alloy nanoparticles are anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;encapsulated ZrO2 nanoframework. In alkaline media, this catalyst exhibits exceptional EOR performance, achieving a remarkable mass activity of 27.3 A mgPd&#8722;1, 3.6 and 21.8 times higher than those of Pd&#8208;ZrO2@NC and commercial Pd/C, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates a high C1 pathway selectivity of 58.7% at 0.8 VRHE&#160;and retains 48.9% of its initial activity after 2000 accelerated durability test cycles, significantly outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks. Combined experimental and DFT studies reveal the crucial function of Ga as an electron donor, which reverses the electron transfer around Pd from outward (in Pd&#8208;ZrO2@NC) to inward (in Pd2Ga1&#8208;ZrO2@NC), creating an electron&#8208;rich Pd state. This electronic restructuring thereby lowers the *CO oxidation barrier, strengthens *OH adsorption, and enhances metal&#8208;support interaction, collectively boosting both the C1 pathway selectivity and the overall EOR performance. This work provides valuable insights for the design of high&#8208;performance alloy&#8208;oxide composite electrocatalysts.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Engineering Guides the Design of &#946;&#8208;Sheet Inhibitor to Anchor Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction Interfaces</title>

The amino acid side&#8208;chain engineering strategy, proposed based on the amino acid pairing in natural proteins, can modulate the complementarity of noncovalent interactions between side chains in engineered &#946;&#8208;sheets. This enables the construction of stable &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors for effective targeting of PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Customizing inhibitors for &#946;&#8208;sheet mediated protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) remains a challenge in medicinal chemistry research. Directly separating &#946;&#8208;sheet elements from the PPI interface as inhibitors represents a feasible strategy. Although useful, peptides derived from PPIs typically lose their natural secondary structure, resulting in low affinity. How to construct stable &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors remains elusive, mainly due to the lack of reliable strategies to guide the design of &#946;&#8208;sheet backbones. In this study, we propose an amino acid side&#8208;chain engineering strategy (AASE) to design of &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors. Specifically, this strategy was based on the amino acid pairing (AAP) principle observed in the &#946;&#8208;sheets of natural proteins, and further integrates the complementarity of various non&#8208;covalent interactions between &#946;&#8208;strand side chains. When combined with high&#8208;throughput peptide screening technology, above strategy can generate structurally defined &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors. We validated the physicochemical properties of the &#946;&#8208;sheet structures obtained under the aforementioned strategy and prioritized the peptide EH. The &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitor formed by EH exhibits potent biological functions, enabling high&#8208;resolution imaging of tumors in the NIR window and guiding tumor resection. In addition, EH can inhibit tumor growth as a PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade. This strategy provides valuable guidance for the design of PPI inhibitors with &#946;&#8208;sheet structures.

&lt;p&gt;The amino acid side-chain engineering strategy, proposed based on the amino acid pairing in natural proteins, can modulate the complementarity of noncovalent interactions between side chains in engineered &#946;-sheets. This enables the construction of stable &#946;-sheet inhibitors for effective targeting of PD-L1.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Electricity and Light for Efficient Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Recycling of Polystyrene Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic interplay of electricity, light and earth&#8208;abundant, nontoxic iron catalysis allowed for the efficient recycling of post&#8208;consumer polymers into value&#8208;added products. This robust depolymerization strategy was viable on multigram&#8208;scale, where the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction presents an attractive opportunity for a green hydrogen production.








Abstract
Due to their intensive use in every aspect of our everyday life, plastics are accumulating in the environment, hence representing a major societal challenge. The accumulation of plastic waste in the oceans is expected to reach 40 billion tons by 2050. Thus, efficient methods for chemical plastic waste recycling continue to be in high demand toward a future circular economy. Herein, we report a powerful and user&#8208;friendly strategy merging inexpensive and earth&#8208;abundant iron catalysis, light irradiation and electricity to recycle polystyrene and styrene&#8208;containing copolymers into value&#8208;added benzoyl products with up to 73% yield. The robustness of this approach using iron&#8208;electrocatalysis under light irradiation was further demonstrated using postconsumer waste, also viable on multigram scale. Cathodic formation of molecular hydrogen through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) offers an outstanding potential for a decentralized green hydrogen economy through a societally useful anodic oxidative transformation.
