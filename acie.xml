         <title>Heterogeneous Nucleation Regulation Amends Unfavorable Crystallization Orientation and Defect Features of Antimony Selenosulfide Film for High&#8208;Efficient Planar Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) has obtained widespread concern for photovoltaic applications as a light absorber due to superior photoelectric features. Accordingly, various deposition technologies have been developed in recent years, especially hydrothermal deposition method, which has achieved a great success. However, device performances are limited with severe carrier recombination, relating to the quality of absorber and interfaces. Herein, bulk and interface defects are simultaneously suppressed by regulating heterogeneous nucleation kinetics with barium dibromide (BaBr2) introduction. In details, the Br adsorbs and dopes on the polar planes of cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, promoting the exposure of nonpolar planes of CdS, which facilitates the favorable growth of [hk1]&#8208;Sb2(S,Se)3 films possessing superior crystallinity and small interface defects. Additionally, the Se/S ratio is increased due to the replacement of S/Se by Br, causing a downshift of the Fermi levels with a benign band alignment and a shallow&#8208;level defect. Moreover, Ba2+ is located at grain boundaries by coordination with S and Se ions, passivating grain boundary defects. Consequently, the efficiency is increased from 7.70% to 10.12%. This work opens an avenue towards regulating the heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of Sb2(S,Se)3 film deposited via hydrothermal deposition approach to optimize its crystalline orientation and defect features.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrow Alkane Product Distribution in Polyethylene Waste Hydrocracking by Zeolite Micropore Diffusion Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastic pollution poses a pressing environmental challenge in modern society. Chemical catalytic conversion offers a promising solution for upgrading waste plastics into valuable liquid alkanes and other high value products. However, the current methods yield mixed products with a broad carbon distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce a tandem catalytic system that features matched acidic sites and confined metals for the conversion of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) into liquid alkanes. This system achieves a liquid alkane yield of 94.0%, with 84.8% of C5&#8208;C7 light alkanes. Combined with in situ FTIR and molecular dynamics simulation, the shape&#8208;selective mechanisms is elucidated, which ensures that only olefins of the appropriate size can diffuse to the encapsulated Pt sites within the zeolite for hydrogenation, resulting in an ultra&#8208;narrow product distribution. Furthermore, due to the rapid diffusion of olefins within the hierarchical zeolite, the catalyst exhibits higher catalytic efficiency and resistance to coking tendency. Our findings contribute to the design of efficient catalysts for plastic waste valorization.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Calix[4]arenes with Both Inherent and Axial Chirality via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8211;H Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherently chiral calixarenes have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties, yet the development of efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis methods remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes featuring inherent or both inherent and axial chirality via a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation/annulation strategy in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt; 99% ee and &gt; 20:1 dr). Electrooxidation was also suitable for this transformation to obviate the sacrificial metal oxidants, underscoring the environmentally friendly potential of this approach. A key octahedral cobaltacycle intermediate was synthesized and characterized, providing valuable insights into the mode of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol of this protocol. Noteworthy photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.94 were measured, underscoring the potential of these compounds in the domain of organic fluorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation via Aniline&#8208;Decorated ZIF&#8208;8 Membrane: Lattice Rigidity Adjustment and Adsorption Site Introduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes excel in molecular separation, attracting significant research interest. The crystallographic microstructure and selective adsorption capacity of MOFs closely correlate with their gas separation performance. Here, aniline was added to the ZIF&#8208;8 synthesis in varying concentrations. Aniline, encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 cavities, interacts strongly with the 2&#8208;methylimidazole linker, resulting in both a shift in crystallographic phase from I_43m to Cm in Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the selective adsorption behavior between propylene and propane. Consequently, an aniline decorative ZIF&#8208;8 (Anix&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) membrane was prepared using a fast current&#8208;driven synthesis method, which exhibits good propylene/propane separation selectivity of up to 85. Calculation of the interaction energy between aniline and the various crystallographic phases of ZIF&#8208;8 using density functional theory (DFT) further verifies that aniline not only promotes the formation of crystallographic Cm phase, but also enhances the adsorption selectivity of propylene over propane.&#160;Aniline modification effectively tunes the crystallographic microstructure of ZIF&#8208;8, thereby, improving molecular sieving capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Activity Identification of Noble Metal Single&#8208;Sites for Electrocatalytic Chlorine Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximal atom&#8208;utilization have emerged as promising alternatives for chlorine evolution reaction (CER) toward valuable Cl2 production. However, understanding their intrinsic CER activity have so far been plagued due to the lack of well&#8208;defined atomic structure controlling. Herein, we prepare and identify a series of atomically dispersed noble metals (e.g., Pt, Ir, Ru) in nitrogen&#8208;doped nanocarbons (M1&#8211;N&#8211;C) with an identical M&#8211;N4 moiety, which allows objective activity evaluation. Electrochemical experiments, operando Raman spectroscopy, and quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses collectively reveal that all the three M1&#8211;N&#8211;C proceed the CER via a direct Cl&#8208;mediated Vomer&#8208;Heyrovsk&#253; mechanism with reactivity following the trend of Pt1&#8211;N&#8211;C &gt; Ir1&#8211;N&#8211;C &gt; Ru1&#8211;N&#8211;C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that this activity trend is governed by the binding strength of Cl*&#8211;Cl intermediate (&#916;GCl*&#8211;Cl) on M&#8211;N4 sites (Pt &lt; Ir &lt; Ru) featuring distinct d&#8208;band centers, providing a reliable thermodynamic descriptor for rational design of single metal sites toward Cl2 electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells through Solution&#8208;Processed and Structurally Ordered Fullerene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron transporting layer (ETL) used in high performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is typically composed of C60, which requires time&#8208;consuming and costly thermal evaporation deposition, posing a significant challenge for large&#8208;scale production. To address this challenge, herein, we present a novel design of solution&#8208;processible electron transporting material (ETM) by grafting a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor fragment onto C60. The synthesized BTPC60 exhibits an exceptional solution processability and well&#8208;organized molecular stacking pattern, enabling the formation of uniform and structurally ordered film with high electron mobility. When applied as ETL in inverted PSCs, BTPC60 not only exhibits excellent interfacial contact with the perovskite layer, resulting in enhanced electron extraction and transfer efficiency, but also effectively passivates the interfacial defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination. Resultant BTPC60&#8208;based inverted PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.3% and retain almost 90% of the initial values after aging at 85&#176;C for 1500 hours in N2. More encouragingly, the solution&#8208;processed BTPC60 ETL demonstrates remarkable film thickness tolerance, and enables a high PCE up to 24.8% with the ETL thickness of 200 nm. Our results highlight BTPC60 as a promising solution&#8208;processed fullerene&#8208;based ETM, opening an avenue for improving the scalability of efficient and stable inverted PSCs.</dc:description>

Resultant BTPC60-based inverted PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.3% and retain almost 90% of the initial values after aging at 85&#176;C for 1500 hours in N2. More encouragingly, the solution-processed BTPC60 ETL demonstrates remarkable film thickness tolerance, and enables a high PCE up to 24.8% with the ETL thickness of 200 nm. Our results highlight BTPC60 as a promising solution-processed fullerene-based ETM, opening an avenue for improving the scalability of efficient and stable inverted PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Methyl Glycolide with Bifunctional Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bifunctional thiourea&#8208;amine&#8208;based organocatalyst (Takemoto&#8217;s catalyst), employing a metal&#8208;free approach, is presented for the regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of optically active (D and L) methyl glycolide (MG). In this study, a chiral version of Takemoto&#8217;s catalyst efficiently promotes the ROP of MG at room temperature, yielding poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acids) (PLGAs) with predicted molecular weights and narrow polydispersity indices (PDI&#8804;1.2). These PLGAs exhibit highly alternating structures without transesterification, as confirmed by 1H NMR, SEC, and MALDI&#8208;TOF analyses. Additionally, various macromolecular architectures, including linear and star&#8208;shaped PLGAs, were successfully synthesized using corresponding multi&#8208;functional alcohol initiators while maintaining the same alternating structures and regioselectivity with PLGA obtained from benzyl alcohol as initiator. Computational studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism of alternating PLGA formation, revealing two key transition states (TSs): TS&#8208;1, which implicates the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the initiator or propagating chain on the carbonyl carbon of MG, and TS&#8208;2, which involves the subsequent ring&#8208;opening of the cyclic ester. The results indicate that ring&#8208;opening occurs at both the glycolyl and lactyl sites, with a preference for the glycolyl site, as supported by experimental results. The resulting atactic PLGAs are amorphous, rendering them suitable for drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Landscape of Phosphorous&#8208;Based Open Shell Species: Stable Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Trianionic Radicals Based on a Contorted Triphosphaalkene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stepwise reduction of the highly contorted truxene&#8208;based triphosphaalkene 1 using KC8 led to the isolation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;and tri&#8208;anionic species. The solid&#8208;state molecular structures of mono&#8208; and diradical anionic species were elucidated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, revealing elongated P&#8208;C bonds and a pronounced &#8220;indene&#8221; aromatization compared to the parent system. All three radical species displayed distinct Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra, providing compelling evidence for the open&#8208;shell electronic configuration of both the diradical and triradical species&#8212;an observation unprecedented in any previously reported phosphorous&#8208;based anionic polyradicals. Mulliken spin density calculations revealed a dominant localization of radical spin on a single phosphorous atom in the monoanion. In the dianion, spin localization is observed on two phosphorous atoms (~34% each), with a minor contribution from the third phosphorous (0.13%), while the trianion demonstrates a uniform distribution of spin density (~30%) across each phosphorous atom.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission, typified by antimony (Sb), with broadband characteristics, represents the next generation of materials for solid&#8208;state lighting and radiation detection. However, little is known about the multiexciton behavior of the Sb emission center. Here, we proposed a general approach for designing antimony&#8208;centered multi&#8208;exciton emitting materials through self&#8208;assembly. Benefitting from controllable multiexciton behavior, dual&#8208;band white light emission spanning the entire visible spectrum was achieved. Relying on the reduction of an effective atomic number brought by self&#8208;assembly, excellent scintillation response to &#946;&#8208;rays was attained. This study offers unprecedented insight into hybrid single/triple STE emission and unveils new avenues for single&#8208;emitter white&#8208;light emission, as well as radiographic testing using low&#8208;risk &#946;&#8208;rays as sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Gold(I) Complex with Rotational Freedom: A Platform Integrating Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence, Polymorphism, and Linearly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;coordinate coinage metal complexes have been exploited for various applications. Herein, a new donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;M&#8208;A) complex PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT, using bulky pyrazine&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (PZI) and trioxytriphenylamine (TOT) ligands, was synthesized. PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT displays decent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with a quantum yield of 93% in doped film. The crystals of PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT show simultaneous TADF, polymorphism, and linearly polarized luminescence (LPL). The polymorph&#8208;dependent emission properties with widely varied peaks from 560 to 655 nm are attributed to different packing modes in terms of isolated monomers, discrete &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked dimers or dimer PLUS. Two well&#8208;defined microcrystals of PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT exhibit linearly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence with a degree of polarization up to 0.64. This work demonstrates that the molecular rotational flexibility of D&#8208;M&#8208;A type complexes endows an integration of multiple functions into one complex through manipulation of supramolecular aggregation. This type of complexes is expected to serve as a versatile platform for the fabrication of crystal materialsfor advanced photonic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Clar's Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Sextet Rule for the Construction of Red Multiple Resonance Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the proliferation of multiple resonance (MR) materials in the blue to green spectral ranges, red MR emitters remain scarce in the literature, an area that certainly warrants attention for future applications. Here, through a clever application of classic Clar's aromatic &#960;&#8208;sextet rule, we triumphantly constructed the first red MR emitter by substituting the conventional benzene ring core with anthracene (fewer &#960;&#8208;sextets). Theoretical studies indicate that the quantity of &#960;&#8208;sextets ultimately determines the optical bandgap of a molecule, rather than the number of fused benzene rings. Benefiting from the high photoluminescence quantum yield of ~94% and horizontal dipole ratio of ~90%, the corresponding narrowband red (luminescence wavelength: 608 nm) organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a high external quantum efficiency of 27.3%, with only a slight decrease of 3.7% at an elevated luminance level of 100,000 cd/m2.</dc:description>

         <title>Zincophilic Sites Enriched Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework as Multifunctional Regulating Interfacial Layers for Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To construct an efficient regulating layer for Zn anodes that can simultaneously address the issues of dendritic growth and side reactions is highly demanded for stable zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, we fabricate a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with zincophilic sites as a multifunctional layer to regulate Zn anodes with controlled spatial ion flux and stable interfacial chemistry (MA&#8208;BTA@Zn). The framework with abundant H&#8208;bonds helps capture H2O and remove the solvated shells on [Zn(H2O)6]2+, leading to suppressed side reactions. The HOF layer also helps form electrolyte&#8208;philic surfaces and expose Zn (002) crystal planes which benefit for rapid conduction and uniform deposition of Zn2+, and weakened sides reactions. Additionally, the electrochemically active zincophilic sites (C=O, &#8208;NH2 and triazine groups) favor the targeted guidance and penetration of Zn2+ and provide advantageous sites for uniform Zn deposition. High Young&#8217;s modulus of the HOF layer further contributes to a high interfacial flexibility and stability against Zn plating&#8208;associated stress. The MA&#8208;BTA@Zn symmetric cells thereby obtain a substantially extended battery life over 1000 h at 4 mA cm&#8208;2. The MA&#8208;BTA@Zn||Cu half&#8208;cell demonstrates a highly reversible Zn stripping/plating process over 1500 cycles with impressive average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5% at 10 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

The MA-BTA@Zn symmetric cells thereby obtain a substantially extended battery life over 1000 h at 4 mA cm-2. The MA-BTA@Zn||Cu half-cell demonstrates a highly reversible Zn stripping/plating process over 1500 cycles with impressive average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5% at 10 mA cm-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Asymmetric Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a novel type of macrocycles with attractive planar chirality, pillar[5]arenes have gained increasing research interest over the past decades, enabling their widespread applications in diverse fields such as porous materials, molecular machines, and chiral luminescence materials. However, the catalytic methodology towards the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes remains elusive. Here we report a novel method for the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via asymmetric Sonogashira coupling, giving access to a wide range of highly functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, including both homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;rimmed ones, with excellent enantioselectivities. Attractively, the resultant planar chiral pillar[5]arenes show great potential for widespread use in many areas such as chiral luminescent materials. This work not only enables the successful synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes with abundant structural and functional diversity as key building blocks for practical applications but also enriches the asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling methodologies in organic synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>An n&#8208;doping cross&#8208;linkable quinoidal compound as a new type of electron transport material for fully stretchable inverted organic solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic activity and inherent brittleness of ZnO, which is commonly used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted organic solar cells (OSCs), have impeded advancements in device stability and the development of fully stretchable OSCs. In this study, we have developed an intrinsically stretchable ETL for inverted OSCs through a side&#8208;chain cross&#8208;linking strategy. Specifically, cross&#8208;linking between bromine atoms on the side chains of a quinoidal compound and the amino groups in polyethylenimine resulted in a film, designated QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50, with high electrical conductivity (0.049 S/m) and excellent stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain &gt;45%). When used as the ETL in inverted OSCs, QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 was markedly superior to ZnO in terms of device performance and stability, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.27% and a T80 lifetime exceeding 10000 h. Moreover, incorporation of QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 in fully stretchable inverted OSCs yielded a PCE of 14.01%, and 80% of the initial PCE was maintained after 21% strain, showcasing its potential for wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multiresponsive Ferrocene&#8208;Based Chiral Overcrowded Alkene Twisting Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reversible modulation of chirality has gained significant attention not only for fundamental stereochemical studies but also for numerous applications ranging from liquid crystals (LCs) to molecular motors and machines. This requires the construction of switchable molecules with (multiple) chiral elements in a highly enantioselective manner, which is often a significant synthetic challenge. Here, we show that the dimerization of an easily accessible enantiopure planar chiral ferrocene&#8208;indanone building block affords a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dimer (FcD) with pre&#8208;determined double bond geometry, helical chirality, and relative orientation of the two ferrocene motifs in high yield. This intrinsically planar chiral switch can not only undergo thermal or photochemical E/Z isomerization but can also be reversibly and quantitatively oxidized to both a monocationic and a dicationic state which is associated with significant changes in its (chir)optical properties. Specifically, FcD acts as a chiral dopant for cholesteric LCs with a helical twisting power (HTP) of 13 &#181;m&#8722;1 which, upon oxidation, drops to near zero, resulting in an unprecedently large redox&#8208;tuning of the LC reflection color by up to 84 nm. Due to the straightforward stereoselective synthesis, FcD, and related chiral switches, are envisioned to be powerful building blocks for multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular machines and in LC&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Cycloadditions in the Solid State via Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reactions conducted in the solid phase (specifically, crystalline) are much less numerous than solution reactions, primarily due to reduced motion, flexibility, and reactivity. The main advantage of crystalline&#8208;state transformations is that reactant molecules can be designed to self&#8208;assemble into specific spatial arrangements, often leading to high control over product regiochemistry and/or stereochemistry. In crystalline&#8208;phase transformations, typically only one type of reaction occurs, and a sacrificial template molecule is frequently used to facilitate self&#8208;assembly, similar to a catalyst or enzyme. Here, we demonstrate the first system designed to undergo two chemically unique and orthogonal cycloaddition reactions simultaneously within a single crystalline solid. Well&#8208;controlled supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two molecules containing different reactive moieties affords orthogonal reactivity without use of a sacrificial template. Using only UV light, the simultaneous [2+2] and [4+4] cycloadditions are achieved regiospecifically, stereospecifically, and products are obtained in high yield, whereas a simultaneous solution&#8208;state reaction affords a mixture of isomers in low yield. Application of dually&#8208;reactive systems toward (supra)molecular solar thermal storage materials is also discussed. This work demonstrates fundamental chemical approaches for orthogonal reactivity in the crystalline state and highlights the complexity and reversibility that can be achieved with supramolecular design.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer via Engineering Palladium Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters for Scalable Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of H2O2 from oxygen reduction reaction via a two&#8208;electron pathway is vital as an alternative for the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, this process is largely hindered in neutral and alkaline conditions due to sluggish kinetics associated with the transformation of intermediate O2* into OOH* via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer sourced from slow water dissociation. Herein, we developed Pd sub&#8208;nanoclusters on the nickel ditelluride nanosheets (Pd SNCs/NiTe2) to enhance the performance of H2O2 electrosynthesis. The newly&#8208;developed Pd SNCs/NiTe2 exhibited a H2O2 selectivity of as high as 99% and a positive shift of onset potential up to 0.81 V. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental studies (e.g., X&#8208;ray absorption and attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectra measurements) revealed that the Pd sub&#8208;nanoclusters supported by NiTe2 nanosheets efficiently reduced the energy barrier of water dissociation to generate more protons, facilitating the proton feeding kinetics. When used in a flow cell, Pd SNCs/NiTe2 cathode efficiently produced H2O2 with a maximum yield rate of 1.75 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and current efficiency of 95% at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. Further, an accumulated H2O2 concentration of 1.43 mol L&#8208;1 was reached after 10 hours of continuous electrolysis, showing the potential for practical H2O2 electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rigid Ligand Confined Synthesis of Carbon Supported Dimeric Fe Sites with High&#8208;performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity for Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimeric metal sites (DiMSs) in carbon&#8208;based single atom catalysts (SACs) offer distinct advantages in optimizing the adsorption energies of the catalytic intermediates and reaction pathways over single atom sites, and thus inspires the investigations on the rational design of DiMSs&#8208;based SACs and the accurate discernment of catalytic mechanisms. Here, dimeric Fe sites on carbon blacks (DiFe&#8208;N/CBs) are prepared using the precursor of metal&#8208;organic complex with a controlled structure, and the rigid ligand confinement secures the preservation of dimeric Fe sites during the thermal treatment. DiFe&#8208;N/CBs shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a positive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.917 V, and excellent durability with negligible activity decay. Theoretical studies reveal that the dimeric Fe sites have an optimal adsorption of OOH* with the Yeager&#8208;type binding, illustrating the advantages of DiMSs over SAs in catalyzing ORR. The rechargeable aqueous and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air battery assembled using DiFe&#8208;N/CBs&#8208;based air cathodes achieve small voltage gaps after long term charge/discharge test, showing great promises for practical applications. This synthetic strategy serves a novel platform to produce a scope of catalysts incorporating multimeric metal sites, and studies on the catalytic mechanism lay the foundation for establishing cooperative effect for multidentate adsorption reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Anilines Formation via Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Reaction of Ynones with Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multi&#8208;substituted anilines are widely found in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science. The quest for robust and efficient methods to construct a diverse array of these compounds using readily accessible starting materials under simple reaction conditions is of utmost importance. Here, we report an unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines. With a simple molybdenum(VI) catalyst, a wide range of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines were efficiently prepared in generally good to excellent yields from readily accessible ynones and allylic amines. The synthetic potential of this methodology was further underscored by its applications in several synthetic transformations, gram&#8208;scale reactions, and derivatization of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that this aniline formation might involve a cascade of aza&#8208;Michael addition, [1, 6]&#8208;proton shift, cyclization, dehydration, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization, and aromatization. This novel strategy provided a robust, simple, and modular approach for the syntheses of various valuable di&#8208; or trisubstituted anilines, some of which were otherwise challenging to access.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Amine Complex&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Coupling of Gallates: A Bioinspired Solution to the Atroposelective Synthesis of Ellagitannins.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total syntheses of the C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannins (&#8722;)&#8208;punicacortein A, (&#8722;)&#8208;epipunicacortein A and (+)&#8208;castalin were accomplished for the first time, and those of the glucopyranosic ellagitannins (+)&#8208;tellimagrandin I and (+)&#8208;pedunculagin were revisited. The atroposelective construction of their characteristic hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) and nonahydroxyterphenoyl (NHTP) units relied on the use of different cupric&#8208;amine complexes under different reaction conditions to mediate the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of galloyl groups at different positions of glucose cores. In particular, the monodentate n&#8208;butylamine and the bidentate (&#8211;)&#8208;sparteine were found to be complementary in their capacity to promote the regio&#8208; and atroposelective coupling of galloyl groups on a 4C1&#8208;glucopyranosic core into 2,3&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208; and/or 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208;HHDP units. Furthermore, replacing (&#8211;)&#8208;sparteine by its optical antipode not only counteracted the substrate&#8208;controlled induction of atroposelectivity to forge a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP unit, but it also enabled a 4C1 to 1C4 ring flip of the glucopyranosic core and hence the formation of 2,4&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208; and 3,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP units, such as those featured in the glucopyranosic ellagitannins phyllanemblinin B and geraniin.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective and Enantioselective Hydrophosphinylations of Conjugated Enynes, Allenes and Dienes via Synergistic Pd/Co Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different from the reported work focusing on the construction of single P&#8208; or C&#8208;stereocenter via hydrophosphinylation of unsaturated carbon bonds, the highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation reaction of allenes, conjugated enynes and 1,3&#8208;dienes is achieved via a designed Pd/Co dual catalysis and newly modified masked phosphinylating reagent. A series of allyl motifs bearing both a tertiary C&#8208; and P&#8208;stereocenter are prepared in generally good yields, &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;20:1 rr and 99% ee. The unprecedented diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes is established to generate skeletons containing both a P&#8208;stereocenter and a nonadjacent chiral axis. The first stereodivergent hydrophosphinylation reaction is also developed to achieve all four P&#8208;containing stereoisomers. The present protocol features the use of only 3&#8208;minutes reaction time and 0.1% catalyst, and with the observation of up to 730 TON.

         <title>Evaluation of Active Oxygen Species Derived from&#160;Water Splitting for Electrocatalytic&#160;Organic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active oxygen species (OH*/O*) derived from water electrolysis are essential for the electrooxidation of organic compounds into high&#8208;value chemicals, which can determine activity and selectivity, whereas the relationship between them remains unclear. Herein, using glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation as a model reaction, we systematically investigated the relationship between GLY oxidation activity and the formation energy of OH* (&#916;GOH*). We first identified that OH* on Au demonstrates the highest activity for GLY electrooxidation among various pure metals, based on experiments and density functional theory, and revealed that &#916;GOH* on Au&#8208;based alloys is influenced by the metallic composition of OH* coordination sites. Moreover, we observed a linear correlation between the adsorption energy of GLY (Eads) and the d&#8208;band center of Au&#8208;based alloys. Comprehensive microkinetic analysis further reveals a volcano relationship between GLY oxidation activity, the &#916;GOH* and the adsorption free energy of GLY (&#916;Gads). Notably, Au3Pd and Au3Ag alloys, positioned near the peak of the volcano plot, show excellent activity, attributed to their moderate &#916;GOH* and &#916;Gads, striking a balance that is neither too high nor too low. This research provides theoretical insights into modulating active oxygen species from water electrolysis to enhance organic electrooxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The first catalytic atroposelective preparation of cyclopentenyl[b]indoles with multiple elements of stereogenicity has been established via an unusual rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols. This new type of alkene atropisomers possess promising utilities such as in discovering antitumor drug candidates and fluorescence imaging materials. Theoretical calculations have elucidated the possible reaction pathway.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective preparation of alkene atropisomers with multiple stereogenic elements and discovery of their applications have become significant but challenging issues in the scientific community due to the unique structures of this class of atropisomers. We herein report the first catalytic atroposelective preparation of cyclopentenyl[b]indoles, a new kind of alkene atropisomers, with stereogenic point and axial chirality via an unusual rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols under asymmetric organocatalysis. Notably, this novel type of alkene atropisomers have promising applications in developing chiral ligands or organocatalysts, discovering antitumor drug candidates and fluorescence imaging materials. Moreover, the theoretical calculations have elucidated the possible reaction mechanism and the non&#8208;covalent interactions to control the enantioselectivity. This approach offers a new synthetic strategy for alkene atropisomers with multiple stereogenic elements, and represents the first catalytic enantioselective rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols, which will advance the chemistry of atropisomers and chiral indole chemistry.

         <title>Mesoporous Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Heteroatom&#8208;Tuned Crystallinity and Photocatalytic Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three mesoporous vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) derived from a methylthiazolyl&#8208;based monomer were built up by Knoevenagel condensation. Their crystallinity and semiconducting properties could be fine tuned by embedding heteroatoms into the backbones, which resulted in significantly different visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activities.







Abstract
Owing to its prominent &#960;&#8208;delocalization and stability, vinylene linkage holds great merits in the construction of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with promising semiconducting properties. However, carbon&#8208;carbon double bond formation reaction always exhibits relatively low reversibility, unfavorable for the formation of high crystalline frameworks through self&#8208;error correction and assembling processes. In this work, we report a heteroatom&#8208;tuned strategy to build up a series of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vinylene&#8208;linked COFs by Knoevenagel condensation of an electron&#8208;deficient methylthiazolyl&#8208;based monomer with different triformyl substituted (hetero&#8722;)aromatic derivatives.

     alt="Mesoporous Vinylene-Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Heteroatom-Tuned Crystallinity and Photocatalytic Behaviors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three mesoporous vinylene-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) derived from a methylthiazolyl-based monomer were built up by Knoevenagel condensation. Their crystallinity and semiconducting properties could be fine tuned by embedding heteroatoms into the backbones, which resulted in significantly different visible-light photocatalytic activities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to its prominent &#960;-delocalization and stability, vinylene linkage holds great merits in the construction of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with promising semiconducting properties. However, carbon-carbon double bond formation reaction always exhibits relatively low reversibility, unfavorable for the formation of high crystalline frameworks through self-error correction and assembling processes. In this work, we report a heteroatom-tuned strategy to build up a series of two-dimensional (2D) vinylene-linked COFs by Knoevenagel condensation of an electron-deficient methylthiazolyl-based monomer with different triformyl substituted (hetero&#8722;)aromatic derivatives. The resulting COFs show high-quality periodic mesoporous structures with high surface areas. Embedding heteroatoms into the backbones enables significantly improving their crystallinity, and finely tailoring their semiconducting structures. Upon visible light stimulation, one of the as-prepared COFs with donor-&#960;-acceptor structure could deliver a nearly seven-fold increase in the catalytic activity of hydrogen generation as compared with the other two. Meanwhile, in combination with high crystallinity and the matched conduction band energy level, such kind of COFs can be able to selectively generate singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals in a high ratio of up to 30&#8201;:&#8201;1, allowing for catalyzing aerobic thioanisole oxidation in distinctly tunable activities through the substituent electronic effect of the substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Gradient Desodiation Chemistry in Layered Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface gradient desodiation strategy is proposed to solve capacity decay and voltage drop without compromising the initial specific capacity of layered cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. This tactic not only inhibits transition&#8208;metal&#8208;ion migration at high voltage, but also endows a stable interface by reducing the generation of Ni4+ and Co4+ ions on the surface of the cathode materials.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage have received unprecedented attention. However, the cathodes in SIBs generally suffer from detrimental cathode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial side reactions and structural degradation during cycling, which leads to severe capacity fade and voltage decay. Here, we have developed an ultra&#8208;stable Na0.72Ni0.20Co0.21Mn0.55Mg0.036O2 (NCM&#8208;CS&#8208;GMg) cathode material in which a Mg&#8208;free core is encapsulated by a shell with gradient distribution of Mg using coprecipitation method with Mg&#8208;hysteretic cascade feedstock followed by calcination. From the interior to outer surface of the shell, as the content of electrochemically inactive Mg gradually increases, the Na+ deintercalation amount gradually decreases after charged. Benefiting from this surface gradient desodiation, the surface transition metal (TM) ion migration from TM layers to Na layers is effectively inhibited, thus suppressing the layered&#8208;to&#8208;rock&#8208;salt phase transition and the resultant microcracks. Besides, the less formation of high&#8208;valence TM ions on the surface contributes to a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The as&#8208;prepared NCM&#8208;CS&#8208;GMg exhibits remarkable cycling life over 3000&#8197;cycles with a negligible voltage drop (0.127&#8197;mV per cycle). Our findings highlight an effective way to developing sustainable cathode materials without compromising on the initial specific capacity for SIBs.

         <title>Simultaneous Defect Passivation and Co&#8208;Catalyst Engineering Leads to Superior Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution on Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) photocatalysts are bi&#8208;functionalized with lead sulfide (PbS) and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) co&#8208;catalysts on the surface. PbS can passivates the defects of MHPs and MoSx provides active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thus synergistically enhancing the charge transport efficiency and HER catalysis and achieving a superior solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) energy conversion efficiency of 4.63&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as attractive candidates for producing green hydrogen via photocatalytic pathway. However, the presence of abundant defects and absence of efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active sites on MHPs seriously limit the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) conversion efficiency. Herein, to address this issue, we present a bi&#8208;functionalization strategy through decorating MHPs with a molecular molybdenum&#8208;sulfur&#8208;containing co&#8208;catalyst precursor. By virtue of the strong chemical interaction between lead and sulfur and the good dispersion of the molecular co&#8208;catalyst precursor in the deposition solution, a uniform and intimate decoration of the MHPs surface with lead sulfide (PbS) and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) co&#8208;catalysts is obtained simultaneously. We show that the PbS co&#8208;catalyst can effectively passivate the Pb&#8208;related defects on the MHPs surface, thus retarding the charge recombination and promoting the charge transfer efficiency significantly. The amorphous MoSx co&#8208;catalyst further promotes the extraction of photogenerated electrons from MHPs and facilitates the HER catalysis. Consequently, drastically enhanced photocatalytic HER activities are obtained on representative MHPs through the synergistic functionalization of PbS and MoSx co&#8208;catalysts. A solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) conversion efficiency of ca. 4.63&#8201;% is achieved on the bi&#8208;functionalized FAPbBr3&#8208;xIx (FA=CH(NH2)2), which is among the highest values reported for MHPs.

         <title>Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Single Crystals of A Three&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Covalent Framework Containing Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals of a chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid three&#8208;dimensional covalent framework (named CityU&#8208;22) were prepared, which is a non&#8208;carbon Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O bond&#8208;based network with the srs topology. CityU&#8208;22 shows good stability under the treatment of different common solvents or heat. CityU&#8208;22 also exhibits an ultraviolet nonlinear optical behavior with a second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4. CityU&#8208;22 is the first chiral organic&#8211;inorganic covalent framework with a high SHG response.







Abstract
Extending covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into crystalline carbon&#8208;free covalent backbones is an important strategy to endow these materials with more exotic functions. Integrating metal&#8208;free inorganic and organic components into one covalent framework is an effective way to address the issue of poor thermal/solvent stability in the field of nonlinear optics (NLO). However, constructing such structures is very challenging. Here, we linked 3&#8208;connected nods (BO3) and 2&#8208;connected organic building blocks (Te(Ph)2) together to produce colorless single crystals (size up to 400&#8197;&#956;m) of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) chiral covalent framework (CityU&#8208;22). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals that CityU&#8208;22 has a non&#8208;carbon Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O bond&#8208;based network with the srs topology. The chiral CityU&#8208;22 displays good stability under the treatment of different common solvents or heat (the decomposition temperature above 300&#8201;&#176;C). Due to its non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone (&#8722;Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O&#8722;), CityU&#8208;22 shows an ultraviolet NLO behavior with a second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4 (KDP).

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Kinetics of Anionic Redox in O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 through Controlled P2 Intergrowth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic recombination is an effective strategy to boost the electrochemical properties of sodium layered oxides. Here, we deploy a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in the manganese&#8208;enriched O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 model compound with the overall composition maintained, enabling a high energy density to be achieved.







Abstract
Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27&#8201;% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87&#8201;%, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Diffraction. The as&#8208;prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese.

&lt;p&gt;Biphasic recombination is an effective strategy to boost the electrochemical properties of sodium layered oxides. Here, we deploy a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in the manganese-enriched O3-NaLi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; model compound with the overall composition maintained, enabling a high energy density to be achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium-ion batteries, O3-NaLi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27&#8201;% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87&#8201;%, comparable to the state-of-the-art Li-rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction. The as-prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bis&#8208;Silylene&#8208;Supported Aluminium Atoms with Aluminylene and Alane Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient aluminylene intermediate supported by a pincer bis&#8208;silylene ligand is proposed to form from the reduction of its iodide precursor. It rapidly dimerizes in a [2+2] cycloaddition to give the isolable Si2Al2 heterocycle. In the presence of Fe0, the aluminylene can be stabilized as a dative AlI&#8594;Fe0 type complex. The Fe0&#8208;aluminylene complex transforms in solution to foster a silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated Fe0 complex.







Abstract
The suitability of electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;silylenes, specifically the neutral chelating [SiII(Xant)SiII] ligand (SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si, Xant=9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) and the anionic [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]&#8722; pincer ligand (NAcrid=2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethylacridane), has been successfully probed to stabilize monovalent bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;supported aluminium complexes (aluminylenes). At first, the unprecedented aluminium(III) iodide precursors [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlI2+ I&#8722; 1 and [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]AlI2 2 were synthesized using AlI3 and [SiII(Xant)SiII] or [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Li(OEt2)], respectively, and structurally characterized. While reduction of 1 with KC8 led merely to unidentified products, the dehalogenation of 2 afforded the dimer of the desired {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} aluminylene with a four&#8208;membered SiIV2AlIII2 ring. Remarkably, the proposed aluminylene intermediates [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlII and {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} could be produced through reaction of 1 and 2 with Collman's reagent, K2Fe(CO)4, and trapped as AlI:&#8594;Fe(CO)4 complexes 5 and 6, respectively. While 6 is stable in solution, 5 loses one CO ligand in solution to afford the silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated iron(0) complex 7 from an intramolecular substitution reaction. The electronic structures of the novel compounds were investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Triaza[5]triangulene through Cyclodehydrogenation and its Magnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triaza[5]triangulene, containing three graphitic nitrogen atoms, and its derivatives were successfully synthesized through cyclodehydrogenation and C&#8722;N bond cleavage from 4,8,12&#8208;Tris(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,8,12&#8208;triazatriangulenium on Au(111). Their chemical structures and spin states were investigated with a combination of bond&#8208;resolved STM, STS, and DFT calculations at low temperature.







Abstract
Triangulenes as neutral radicals are becoming promising candidates for future applications such as spintronics and quantum technologies. To extend the potential of the advanced materials, it is of importance to control their electronic and magnetic properties by multiple graphitic nitrogen doping. Here, we synthesize triaza[5]triangulene on Au(111) by cyclodehydrogenation, and its derivatives by cleaving C&#8722;N bonds. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy provided detailed structural information and evidence for open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. The antiferromagnetic arrangement of the spins in positively doped triaza[5]triangulene was further confirmed by density function theory calculations. The key aspect of triangulenes with multiple graphitic nitrogen is the extra pz electrons composing the &#960; orbitals, favoring charge transfer to the substrate and changing their low&#8208;energy excitations. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phases of matter in heteroatom doped organic systems.

         <title>Facilitating Formate Selectivity via Optimizing eg* Band Broadening in NiMn Hydroxides for Ethylene Glycol Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, structural distortions in Ni(OH)2 induced by Mn doping can effectively modulate its electronic states around the Fermi level. It was found that Mn doping could lead to the broadening of eg* band, which enhanced the performance of EGOR. Product analysis and DFT calculations revealed that the adsorption of key intermediates of glyoxal was enhanced by eg* band broadening, resulting in the formate selectivity enhancement and inhibition of Cannizzaro reaction that generating glycolate by&#8208;product. These insights into the electronic state regulation of catalysts significantly advance the design of highly selective and efficient Ni(OH)2&#8208;based electrocatalysts, paving the way for future innovations in the development of electrocatalysts for alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol electro&#8208;oxidation reaction (EGOR) on nickel&#8208;based hydroxides (Ni(OH)2) represents a promising strategy for generating value&#8208;added chemicals, i.e. formate and glycolate, and coupling water&#8208;electrolytic hydrogen production. The high product selectivity was one of the most significant area of polyols electro&#8208;oxidation process. Yet, developing Ni(OH)2&#8208;based EGOR electrocatalyst with highly selective product remains a challenge due to the unclear cognition about the EGOR mechanism. Herein, Mn&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 catalysts were utilized to investigate the EGOR mechanism. Experimental and calculation results reveal that the electronic states of eg* band play an important role in the catalytic performance and the product selectivity for EGOR. Broadening the eg* band could effectively enhance the adsorption capacity of glyoxal intermediates. On the other hand, this enhanced adsorption could lead to reduced side reactions associated with glycolate formation, simultaneously promoting the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds. Consequently, the selectivity for formate was notably augmented by these enhancements. This work offers new insights into the regulation of catalyst electronic states for improving polyol electrocatalytic activity and product selectivity.

         <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Upcyclable Gel Membranes for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study details the synthesis of an ionogel membrane with copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ionic liquids, enhancing its mechanical strength, self&#8208;healing, recycling, and upcycling capabilities. These enhancements, combined with superior carbon dioxide selectivity, affirm its potential as a sustainable, high&#8208;performance material for efficient gas separation.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are prized for their selective dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to their widespread use in ionogel membranes for gas separation. Despite their advantages, creating sustainable ionogel membranes with high IL contents poses challenges due to limited mechanical strength, leakage risks, and poor recyclability. Herein, we leverage copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ILs to develop ionogel membranes with high mechanical strength, zero leakage, and excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;This study details the synthesis of an ionogel membrane with copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ionic liquids, enhancing its mechanical strength, self-healing, recycling, and upcycling capabilities. These enhancements, combined with superior carbon dioxide selectivity, affirm its potential as a sustainable, high-performance material for efficient gas separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionic liquids (ILs) are prized for their selective dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), leading to their widespread use in ionogel membranes for gas separation. Despite their advantages, creating sustainable ionogel membranes with high IL contents poses challenges due to limited mechanical strength, leakage risks, and poor recyclability. Herein, we leverage copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ILs to develop ionogel membranes with high mechanical strength, zero leakage, and excellent self-healing and recycling capabilities. These membranes exhibit superior ideal selectivity for gas separation compared to other reported ionogel membranes, achieving a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/nitrogen selectivity of 61.7 and a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/methane selectivity of 24.6, coupled with an acceptable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability of 186.4 Barrer. Additionally, these gas separation ionogel membranes can be upcycled into ionic skins for sensing applications, further enhancing their utility. This research outlines a strategic approach to molecularly engineer ionogel membranes, offering a promising pathway for developing sustainable, high-performance materials for advanced gas separation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Microscopically Heterogeneous Colloid Electrolyte for Extremely Fast&#8208;Charging and Long&#8208;Calendar&#8208;Life Silicon&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A microscopically heterogeneous colloid electrolyte is engineered to tackle the critical issues of inadequate fast&#8208;charging capability and limited calendar life in silicon&#8208;based batteries. Leveraging multiscale noncovalent interactions, this electrolyte demonstrates exceptional fast&#8208;charging capability. Moreover, the mesoscopic medium in the colloid electrolyte strongly adsorbs H2O and HF, significantly extending the calendar life of the full cell.







Abstract
Fast&#8208;charging capability and calendar life are critical metrics in rechargeable batteries, especially in silicon&#8208;based batteries that are susceptible to sluggish Li+ desolvation kinetics and HF&#8208;induced corrosion. No existing electrolyte simultaneously tackles both these pivotal challenges. Here we report a microscopically heterogeneous covalent organic nanosheet (CON) colloid electrolyte for extremely fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;calendar&#8208;life Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Theoretical calculations and operando Raman spectroscopy reveal the fundamental mechanism of the multiscale noncovalent interaction, which involves the mesoscopic CON attenuating the microscopic Li+&#8208;solvent coordination, thereby expediting the Li+ desolvation kinetics. This electrolyte design enables extremely fast&#8208;charging capabilities of the full cell, both at 8&#8197;C (83.1&#8201;% state of charge) and 10&#8197;C (81.3&#8201;% state of charge). Remarkably, the colloid electrolyte demonstrates record&#8208;breaking cycling performance at 10&#8197;C (capacity retention of 92.39&#8201;% after 400 cycles). Moreover, benefiting from the robust adsorption capability of mesoporous CON towards HF and water, a notable improvement is observed in the calendar life of the full cell. This study highlights the role of microscopically heterogeneous colloid electrolytes in enhancing the fast&#8208;charging capability and calendar life of Si&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries. Our work offers fresh perspectives on electrolyte design with multiscale interactions, providing insightful guidance for the development of alkali&#8208;ion/metal batteries operating under harsh environments.

A MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructured electrocatalyst with interfacial dual active sites and build&#8208;in electric field is constructed for nitrite reduction reaction, delivering an NH3 yield of 11.46&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) is an important route for sustainable NH3 synthesis and environmental remediation. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one family of promising NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts, however, there is plenty of room to improve in their performance, calling for new design principles. Herein, a MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructured electrocatalyst with interfacial dual active sites and build&#8208;in electric field is fabricated for efficient NO3&#8722;RR to NH3 production. By growing Co&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanorods on Ni&#8208;BDC (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) nanosheets, experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the formation of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Co bonds at the interface of MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructure, leading to dual active sites tailed for NO3&#8722;RR. The Ni sites facilitate the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8722;, while the Co sites boost the H2O decomposition to supply active hydrogen (Hads) for N&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation on adjacent Ni sites, cooperatively reducing the energy barriers of NO3&#8722;RR process. Together with the accelerated electron transfer enabled by built&#8208;in electric field, remarkable NO3&#8722;RR performance is achieved with an NH3 yield rate of 11.46&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;%, outperforming most reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Redox Concomitant Formation Method for Fabrication of Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/Polymer Composites with Antifouling Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method called Redox Concomitant Formation (RCF) is presented for the fabrication of Cu(I) metal&#8211;organic frameworks polypyrrole (Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy) composite. The monomer, as a molecular scalpel, reduces Cu(II) sites into Cu(I) sites while polymerizing as molecular sutures protecting in situ phase transition. Owing to the steady release of Cu+ ions and exceptional photothermal ability, Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy exhibits superior antifouling properties.







Abstract
Marine biofouling, which is one of the technical challenges hindering the growth of the marine economy, has been controlled using cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles due to the exceptional antifouling properties of Cu(I) ions. However, Cu2O nanoparticles have encountered bottlenecks due to explosive releases of Cu+ ions, high toxicity at elevated doses, and long&#8208;term instability. Here, we present a novel method called Redox Concomitant Formation (RCF) for fabricating a hierarchical Cu(I) metal&#8211;organic framework polypyrrole (Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy) composite. This method enables in situ phase transition via successive redox reactions that change the chemical valence state and coordination mode of Cu(II)&#8722;MOF, resulting in a new structure of Cu(I)&#8722;MOF while creating a PPy layer surrounded by the hierarchical structure. Owing to the steady release of Cu+ ions from the Cu(I) sites and photothermal properties of PPy, Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy exhibits superior and broad&#8208;spectrum resistance to marine bacteria, algae, and surface&#8208;adhered biofilms in complex biological environments, as well as long&#8208;term stability, resulting in 100&#8201;% eradication efficiency under solar&#8208;driven heating. Mechanistic insights into successive structural redox reactions and formation using the RCF method are provided in detail, enabling the fabrication of novel MOFs with the desired composition and structure for a wide range of potential applications.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Ring Mobility on the Macroscopic Properties of Doubly Threaded Slide&#8208;Ring Gel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gels (dt&#8208;SRGs) exhibit enhanced swelling, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics on account of the mobility of their crosslinking rings. dt&#8208;SRG with larger rings exhibit softer mechanical properties and faster stress relaxation. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of dt&#8208;SRGs can be adjusted by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility through remetalation.







Abstract
The integration of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) into polymeric materials has led to the development of mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs). One class of MIPs that have gained attention in recent years are slide&#8208;ring gels (SRGs), which are generally accessed by crosslinking rings on a main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane. The mobility of the interlocked crosslinking moieties along the polymer backbone imparts enhanced properties onto these networks. An alternative synthetic approach to SRGs is to use a doubly threaded ring as the crosslinking moiety, yielding doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gel networks (dt&#8208;SRGs). In this study, a photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread was used to assemble a series of metal&#8208;templated pseudo[3]rotaxane crosslinkers that allow access to polymer networks that contain doubly threaded interlocked rings. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of these dt&#8208;SRGs with varying size of the ring crosslinking moieties were investigated and compared to an entangled gel (EG) prepared by polymerizing the metal complex of the photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread, and a corresponding covalent gel (CG). Relative to the EG and CG, the dt&#8208;SRGs exhibit enhanced swelling behavior, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics.

     alt="Exploring the Impact of Ring Mobility on the Macroscopic Properties of Doubly Threaded Slide-Ring Gel Networks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubly threaded slide-ring gels (dt-SRGs) exhibit enhanced swelling, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics on account of the mobility of their crosslinking rings. dt-SRG with larger rings exhibit softer mechanical properties and faster stress relaxation. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of dt-SRGs can be adjusted by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility through remetalation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) into polymeric materials has led to the development of mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs). One class of MIPs that have gained attention in recent years are slide-ring gels (SRGs), which are generally accessed by crosslinking rings on a main-chain polyrotaxane. The mobility of the interlocked crosslinking moieties along the polymer backbone imparts enhanced properties onto these networks. An alternative synthetic approach to SRGs is to use a doubly threaded ring as the crosslinking moiety, yielding doubly threaded slide-ring gel networks (dt-SRGs). In this study, a photo-curable ligand-containing thread was used to assemble a series of metal-templated pseudo[3]rotaxane crosslinkers that allow access to polymer networks that contain doubly threaded interlocked rings. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of these dt-SRGs with varying size of the ring crosslinking moieties were investigated and compared to an entangled gel (EG) prepared by polymerizing the metal complex of the photo-curable ligand-containing thread, and a corresponding covalent gel (CG). Relative to the EG and CG, the dt-SRGs exhibit enhanced swelling behavior, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics. In addition, the macroscopic properties of dt-SRGs could be altered by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility in the structure through remetalation, highlighting the impact of the mobility of the crosslinks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in a Photostable Ion&#8208;Paired Yb&#8722;Eu Heteronuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upconversion emission of Eu3+ was achieved in a pure ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] and the sites of Eu3+ and Yb3+ in the complex can be clarified. In addition, [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] demonstrated excellent photostability during continuous high&#8208;power density 980&#8197;nm laser irradiation, with a LT95 of 420&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion molecular complexes have potential application in diverse fields and attracted considerable research interest in recent years. However, the similar coordination reactivity of lanthanide ions has constrained the designability of target molecule with well&#8208;defined structure, and many attempts obtained statistical mixtures. Herein, an ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] (TpPy=tris[3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolyl]hydroborate, ND=3&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridin&#8208;4&#8208;olate) was designed and synthesized. Thanks to the radius difference between Eu3+ (1.07&#8197;&#197;) and Yb3+ (0.98&#8197;&#197;) ions, the hexadentate TpPy ligand was selected to coordinate with Eu3+ and the Yb3+ with a smaller radius was chelated by bidentate ND ligand. As a result, the sites of Eu3+ and Yb3+ in the complex can be clarified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis. Upon the excitation of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm, the upconversion emission of Eu3+ was realized through a cooperative sensitization process. Furthermore, [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] demonstrated excellent photostability during continuous high&#8208;power density 980&#8197;nm laser irradiation, with a LT95 (the time to 95&#8201;% of the initial emission intensity) of 420&#8197;minutes. This work provides the first example of a pure ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex upconversion system and may bring insights into rational design of lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion molecular complexes.

         <title>The Effects of Pore Defects in &#960;&#8208;Extended Pentadecabenzo[9]helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up synthesis strategy was used to introduce pore defects into the fully conjugated &#960;&#8208;extended helicene. This modification transformed the helicene with original aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) characteristics into a series of novel helicenes with dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. Consequently, the application range of the helicene in chiral luminescent materials was expanded.







Abstract
The introduction of precise pore defects into nanocarbon structures results in the emergence of distinct physicochemical characteristics. However, there is a lack of research on non&#8208;planar chiral nanographene involving precise pore defects. Herein, we have developed two analogues to the &#960;&#8208;extended pentadecabenzo[9]helicene (EP9H) containing embedded pore defects. Each molecules, namely extended dodecabenzo[7]helicene (ED7H; 1) or extended nonabenzo[5]helicene (EN5H; 2), exhibits dual&#8208;state emission. Significantly, the value of |glum| of 1 is exceptionally high at 1.41&#215;10&#8722;2 in solution and BCPL as 254&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In PMMA film, |glum| of 1 is 8.56&#215;10&#8722;3, and in powder film, it is 5.00&#215;10&#8722;3. This study demonstrates that nanocarbon molecules with pore defects exhibit dual&#8208;state emission properties while maintaining quite good chiral luminescence properties. It was distinguished from the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect corresponding to the nanocarbon without embedded defect. Incorporating pore defects into chiral nanocarbon molecules also simplifies the synthesis process and enhances the solubility of the resulting product. These findings suggest that the introduction of pore defects can be a viable approach to improve nanocarbon molecules.

         <title>Stable Lithium Oxygen Batteries Enabled by Solvent&#8208;diluent Interaction in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide&#8208;based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally selected methyl nonafluorobutyl ether (M3) diluent is introduced into the N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA)&#8208;based electrolyte to construct a localized high concentration electrolyte. The interaction between the DMA solvent and M3 diluent increases the coordination number of Li+&#8208;anions, facilitating the formation of an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase to improve the Li metal stability and consequently realizing stable and high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries.







Abstract
In the pursuit of next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8722;O2 batteries, it is imperative to develop an electrolyte with stability against the strong oxidation environments. N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA) is a recognized solvent known for its robust resistance to the highly reactive reduced oxygen species, yet its application in Li&#8722;O2 batteries has been constrained due to its poor compatibility with the Li metal anode. In this study, a rationally selected hydrofluoroether diluent, methyl nonafluorobutyl ether (M3), has been introduced into the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte to construct a localized high concentration electrolyte. The stable &#8722;CH3 and C&#8722;F bonds within the M3 structure could not only augment the fundamental properties of the electrolyte but also fortify its resilience against attacks from O2&#8722; and 1O2. Additionally, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;F) presented in the M3 diluent could facilitate coordination with the electron&#8208;donating groups (&#8722;CH3) in the DMA solvent. This intermolecular interaction promotes more alignments of Li+&#8208;anions with a small amount of M3 addition, leading to the construction of an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI that enhances the stability of the Li anode. As a result, the Li&#8722;O2 batteries with the DMA/M3 electrolyte exhibit superior cycling performance at both 30&#8201;&#176;C (359th) and &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C (120th).

To investigate lysine methylation comprehensively, a robust method for Kme1 enrichment was established. Dimethoxyaryl diazonium crosslinked Kme1 with high reactivity and selectivity among tryptic peptides from cell samples. As a result, over 10000&#8197;Kme1 sites were identified by proteomic analysis. Furthermore, we found a significant amount of methyl marks that were not S&#8208;adenosyl methionine&#8208;dependent by isotope labeling experiments.







Abstract
Proteomics is a powerful method to comprehensively understand cellular posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Owing to low abundance, tryptic peptides with PTMs are usually enriched for enhanced coverage by liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC&#8211;MS/MS). Affinity chromatography for phosphoproteomes by metal&#8208;oxide and pan&#8208;specific antibodies for lysine acetylome allow identification of tens of thousands of modification sites. Lysine methylation is a significant PTM; however, only hundreds of methylation sites were identified by available approaches. Herein we report an aryl diazonium based chemoselective strategy that enables enrichment of monomethyllysine (Kme1) peptides through covalent bonds with extraordinary sensitivity. We identified more than 10000 Kme1 peptides from diverse cell lines and mouse tissues, which implied a wide lysine methylation impact on cellular processes. Furthermore, we found a significant amount of methyl marks that were not S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent by isotope labeling experiments.

&lt;p&gt;To investigate lysine methylation comprehensively, a robust method for Kme1 enrichment was established. Dimethoxyaryl diazonium crosslinked Kme1 with high reactivity and selectivity among tryptic peptides from cell samples. As a result, over 10000&#8197;Kme1 sites were identified by proteomic analysis. Furthermore, we found a significant amount of methyl marks that were not &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl methionine-dependent by isotope labeling experiments.

         <title>DNA Logical Computing on a Transistor for Cancer Molecular Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transistor&#8208;based DNA molecular computing platform that is capable of simultaneously detecting multiple microRNAs and rapidly providing diagnostic results through built&#8208;in logic computing. The platform enables both accurate and efficient diagnosis of cancers, showing great potential in precision medicine and personalized therapy.







Abstract
Given the high degree of variability and complexity of cancer, precise monitoring and logical analysis of different nucleic acid markers are crucial for improving diagnostic precision and patient survival rates. However, existing molecular diagnostic methods normally suffer from high cost, cumbersome procedures, dependence on specialized equipment and the requirement of in&#8208;depth expertise in data analysis, failing to analyze multiple cancer&#8208;associated nucleic acid markers and provide immediate results in a point&#8208;of&#8208;care manner. Herein, we demonstrate a transistor&#8208;based DNA molecular computing (TDMC) platform that enables simultaneous detection and logical analysis of multiple microRNA (miRNA) markers on a single transistor. TDMC can perform not only basic logical operations such as &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;, but also complex cascading computing, opening up new dimensions for multi&#8208;index logical analysis. Owing to the high efficiency, sensing and computations of multi&#8208;analytes can be operated on a transistor at a concentration as low as 2&#215;10&#8722;16 M, reaching the lowest concentration for DNA molecular computing. Thus, TDMC achieves an accuracy of 98.4&#8201;% in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma from 62 serum samples. As a convenient and accurate platform, TDMC holds promise for applications in &#8220;one&#8208;stop&#8221; personalized medicine.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Deracemization Enabled Enantioselective and Modular Access to Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a novel photoredox catalytic strategy for deracemization of axially chiral molecules, overcoming the challenge of relying on energy transfer mechanisms for chiral center removal that necessitate feedstocks with low triplet energy levels. This strategy has been verified by the precise synthesis of valuable and hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic deracemization is highly esteemed as an ideal tool for organic synthesis due to its exceptional atom economy and synthetic efficiency. Consequently, successful instances of deracemization of allenes have been established, where the activated energy of photosensitizer should surpass that of the substrates, representing an intrinsic requirement. Accordingly, this method is not applicable for axially chiral molecules with significantly high triplet energies. In this study, we present a photoredox catalytic deracemization approach that enables the efficient synthesis of valuable yet challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones. The substrate scope is extensive, allowing for both 3&#8208;axis and unmet 1&#8208;axis assembly through facile oxidation of diverse central chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones that can be easily prepared and achieve enantiomer enrichment via deracemization. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of photosensitizer selection in attaining excellent chemoselectivity and highlight the indispensability of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid in enabling highly enantioselective protonation to accomplish efficient deracemization.

         <title>Small, Fluorinated Mn2+ Chelate as an Efficient 1H and 19F MRI Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Placed at an appropriate and controlled distance from the paramagnetic Mn2+ ion, 19F atoms in MnL1 experience adequate acceleration of their longitudinal relaxation, while the line&#8208;broadening effect remains moderate. This allows for efficient visualization of this small paramagnetic complex both in 19F and 1H MRI, also in the living mouse.







Abstract
We explore the potential of fluorine&#8208;containing small Mn2+ chelates as alternatives to perfluorinated nanoparticles, widely used as 19F MRI probes. In MnL1, the cyclohexanediamine skeleton and two piperidine rings, involving each a metal&#8208;coordinating amide group and an appended CF3 moiety, provide high rigidity to the complex. This allows for good control of the Mn&#8722;F distance (rMnF=8.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197; determined from 19F relaxation data), as well as for high kinetic inertness (a dissociation half&#8208;life of 1285&#8197;h is estimated for physiological conditions). The paramagnetic Mn2+ leads to a ~150&#8208;fold acceleration of the longitudinal 19F relaxation, with moderate line&#8208;broadening effect, resulting in T2/T1 ratios of 0.8 (9.4&#8197;T). Owing to its inner sphere water molecule, MnL1 is a good 1H relaxation agent as well (r1=5.36&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, 20&#8197;MHz). MnL1 could be readily visualized in 19F MRI by using fast acquisition techniques, both in phantom images and living mice following intramuscular injection, with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and short acquisition times. While applications in targeted imaging or cell therapy monitoring require further optimisation of the molecular structure, these results argue for the potential of such small, monohydrated and fluorinated Mn2+ complexes for combined 19F and 1H MRI detection.

         <title>Dissolution&#8208;Recrystallization: A Novel Mechanism for Fluorochromic Detection of Th4+ Using Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs). The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8208;recrystallization mechanism, which transforms a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.







Abstract
Thorium, a predominant actinide in the Earth's crust, presents significant environmental and health risks due to its radioactive nature. These risks are particularly pronounced during the mining and processing of monazite for rare earth elements (REEs), which contain substantial thorium concentrations. Current instrumental analysis methods for thorium, offer high accuracy but require laborious sample preparations and expensive instruments, making them unsuitable for on&#8208;site analysis. Herein, we present a class of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) as fluorochromic sensors for Th4+ cations. Utilizing a heterobimetallic Eu3+/Tb3+ doping strategy, the luminescence colors of EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH can be finely tuned from red, to orange, and to green. More intriguingly, the higher Lewis acidity of Th4+ facilitates the transformation of EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH into a UiO&#8208;type Th&#8208;MOF via a dissolution&#8208;recrystallization mechanism. This process results in a gradual reduction of characteristic Ln3+ emissions and the emergence of blue color ligand&#8208;based fluorescence, thereby leading to selective fluorochromic responses with increasing Th4+ concentrations and enabling visible detection of Th4+ cations. Additionally, a custom&#8208;built portable optoelectronic device is fabricated, which directly converts luminescence colors into red&#8208;green&#8208;blue (RGB) values. This device enables easy quantification of Th4+ concentrations without the need for complex instrumentation.

Utilizing a heterobimetallic Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doping strategy, the luminescence colors of Eu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Tb&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;-BDC-OH can be finely tuned from red, to orange, and to green. More intriguingly, the higher Lewis acidity of Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; facilitates the transformation of Eu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Tb&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;-BDC-OH into a UiO-type Th-MOF via a dissolution-recrystallization mechanism. This process results in a gradual reduction of characteristic Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; emissions and the emergence of blue color ligand-based fluorescence, thereby leading to selective fluorochromic responses with increasing Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations and enabling visible detection of Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cations. Additionally, a custom-built portable optoelectronic device is fabricated, which directly converts luminescence colors into red-green-blue (RGB) values. This device enables easy quantification of Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations without the need for complex instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Record C2H2 Packing Density for Highly Efficient C2H2/C2H4 Separation with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Prepared by a Scalable Synthesis in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that achieves a record acetylene packing density, which is pivotal for the highly efficient purification of ethylene. The synthesis of this material is readily scalable to the kilogram level using pure water as solvent, thereby establishing it as a leading candidate for practical industrial applications.







Abstract
Adsorptive C2H2/C2H4 separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged as a promising technology for the removal of C2H2 (acetylene) impurity (1&#8201;%) from C2H4 (ethylene). The practical application of these materials involves the optimization of separation performance as well as development of scalable and green production protocols. Herein, we report the efficient C2H2/C2H4 separation in a MOF, Cu(OH)INA (INA: isonicotinate) which achieves a record C2H2 packing density of 351&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 0.01&#8197;bar through high affinity towards C2H2. DFT (density functional theory) calculations reveal the synergistic binding mechanism through pore confinement and the oxygen sites in pore wall. The weakly basic nature of binding sites leads to a relatively low heat of adsorption (Qst) of approximately 36&#8197;kJ/mol, which is beneficial for material regeneration and thermal management. Furthermore, a scalable and environmentally friendly synthesis protocol with a high space&#8208;time yield of 544&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3 day&#8722;1 has been developed without using any modulating agents. This material also demonstrates enduring separation performance for multiple cycles, maintaining its efficacy after exposure to water or air for three months.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Nanocatalyst for Precise In&#8208;Situ Antimicrobial Synthesis via Photoredox&#8208;Catalytic Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A red light&#8208;activated nanocatalyst MB@PMOF has been developed to facilitate in situ synthesis of antimicrobials through a photoredox&#8208;catalytic click reaction in bacterial infected tissue. This approach enables precise and potent treatment against severe bacterial infections, providing innovative design concepts for a new generation of alternative antibacterial therapies.







Abstract
The excessive and prolonged use of antibiotics contributes to the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant S. aureus strains and potential dysbacteriosis&#8208;related diseases, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Herein, we present a light&#8208;activated nanocatalyst for synthesizing in situ antimicrobials through photoredox&#8208;catalytic click reaction, achieving precise, site&#8208;directed elimination of S. aureus skin infections. Methylene blue (MB), a commercially available photosensitizer, was encapsulated within the CuII&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, MOF&#8208;199, and further enveloped with Pluronic F&#8208;127 to create the light&#8208;responsive nanocatalyst MB@PMOF. Upon exposure to red light, MB participates in a photoredox&#8208;catalytic cycle, driven by the 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic carboxylate salts (BTC&#8722;) ligand presented in the structure of MOF&#8208;199. This light&#8208;activated MB then catalyzes the reduction of CuII to CuI through a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process, efficiently initiating the click reaction to form active antimicrobial agents under physiological conditions. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated the effectiveness of MB@PMOF&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis in inhibiting S. aureus, including their methicillin&#8208;resistant strains, thereby accelerating skin healing in severe bacterial infections. This study introduces a novel design paradigm for controlled, on&#8208;site drug synthesis, offering a promising alternative to realize precise treatment of bacterial infections without undesirable side effects.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A high&#8208;efficiency PtZnCd nanozyme was screened with density functional theory (DFT) and unique d&#8208;orbital coupling features for sensitive enrichment and real&#8208;time analysis of CO&#8208;releasing molecule&#8208;3 (CORM&#8208;3). Multi&#8208;catalytic sites in the nanozyme showed a high reactivity of up to 72.89 min&#8208;1 for peroxidase&#8208;like enzymes (POD) reaction, which was 2.2, 4.07, and 14.67 times higher than that of PtZn (32.67 min&#8208;1), PtCd (17.89 min&#8208;1), and Pt (4.97 min&#8208;1), respectively. Normalization of the catalytic sites showed that the catalytic capacity of the active site in PtZnCd was 2.962 U &#956;mol&#8208;1, which was four times higher than that of pure Pt site (0.733 U &#956;mol&#8208;1). DFT calculations showed that improved d&#8208;orbital coupling between different metals reduces the position of the center of the shifted whole d&#8208;band relative to the Fermi energy level, thereby increasing the contribution of the sites to the electron transfer from the active center, accompanied with enhanced substrate adsorption and intermediate conversion in the catalytic process. The potential adsorption principle and color development mechanism of CORM&#8208;3 on PtZnCd were determined, and the practical application in drug metabolism was validated in vitro, in zebrafish and mice as a model, demonstrating that transition metal doping effectively engineers high&#8208;performance nanozymes and optimizes artificial enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance Complementary Electrochromic Batteries using Nb18W16O93 by the Synergistic Effects of Aqueous Al3+/K+ Dual&#8208;ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent ions, especially Al3+ in aqueous electrolyte contributes to higher capacity and color contrast for more sustainable post&#8208;lithium electrochromism and energy storages. However, the lack of suitable cathodic and anodic electrochromic materials is a major challenge for Al&#8208;ion electrochromic batteries, which limits their optical contrast and lifespan. Herein, we report that Wadsley&#8208;Roth phase Nb18W16O93 with open structure achieves Al3+ intercalation/extraction reversibly. The complementary electrochromic energy storage devices based on Nb18W16O93 coupled with Prussian blue using hybrid Al3+/K+ aqueous electrolytes show a fast response, a high capacity and a large coloring efficiency. The superior performances are due to the cations of Al3+ and K+ selectively insert/extract in the electrode of Nb18W16O93 and Prussian blue, respectively. This work provides an effective strategy for high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost electrochromic batteries with higher sustainability.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplifying Colossal Thermal Expansion of a Martensitic Molecular Crystal through Interlayer Shear&#8208;induced Side&#8208;chain Liberation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular crystals capable of colossal thermal expansion (TE) are fascinating owing to their substantial and continuous volume changes and reasonably linear responses to temperature. This makes them promising candidates for micromachine applications. Macroscopic motion is driven by subtle yet cooperative movements of molecules that respond to the thermal motions of dynamic functional units. The study of p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB presented here offers a compelling case highlighting the relationship between the degree of dynamicity of functional units and TE behavior. In its &#945;&#8208;phase, the p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB crystal undergoes an irreversible martensitic transition to the &#946;&#8208;phase, accompanied by significant cooperative interlayer shear. This process substantially enhances the mobility of the side&#8208;chains driven by the increased free volume surrounding them. This nearly doubles the volumetric TE coefficient from 255.3 (10) to 444.9 (32) MK&#8208;1, particularly in the actuation direction from 175.0 (7) to 291.7 (20) MK&#8208;1, enabling about 4.5% elongation/contraction. As demonstrated here, p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB exhibits a decent force density (&gt; 1.4 &#215; 107 N m&#8208;3) and precise motion control capabilities due to its hysteresis&#8208;free and non&#8208;abrupt TE nature. Furthermore, we demonstrated the limited operating distance of colossal TE materials can be amplified by utilizing levers, highlighting the high potential of these materials for use in micromachines.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Molecular crystals capable of colossal thermal expansion (TE) are fascinating owing to their substantial and continuous volume changes and reasonably linear responses to temperature. This makes them promising candidates for micromachine applications. Macroscopic motion is driven by subtle yet cooperative movements of molecules that respond to the thermal motions of dynamic functional units. The study of p-TIPS-DSB presented here offers a compelling case highlighting the relationship between the degree of dynamicity of functional units and TE behavior. In its &#945;-phase, the p-TIPS-DSB crystal undergoes an irreversible martensitic transition to the &#946;-phase, accompanied by significant cooperative interlayer shear. This process substantially enhances the mobility of the side-chains driven by the increased free volume surrounding them. This nearly doubles the volumetric TE coefficient from 255.3 (10) to 444.9 (32) MK-1, particularly in the actuation direction from 175.0 (7) to 291.7 (20) MK-1, enabling about 4.5% elongation/contraction. As demonstrated here, p-TIPS-DSB exhibits a decent force density (&amp;gt; 1.4 &#215; 107 N m-3) and precise motion control capabilities due to its hysteresis-free and non-abrupt TE nature. Furthermore, we demonstrated the limited operating distance of colossal TE materials can be amplified by utilizing levers, highlighting the high potential of these materials for use in micromachines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anodic Commodity Polymer Recycling: The Merger of Iron&#8208;Electrocatalysis with Scalable Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are omnipresent in our everyday life, and accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste in our environment represents a major societal challenge. Hence, methods for plastic waste recycling are in high demand for a future circular economy. Specifically, the degradation of post&#8208;consumer polymers towards value&#8208;added small molecules constitutes a sustainable strategy for a carbon circular economy. Despite of recent advances, chemical polymer degradation continues to be largely limited to chemical redox agents or low energy efficiency in photochemical processes. We herein report a powerful iron&#8208;catalyzed degradation of high molecular weight polystyrenes through electrochemistry to efficiently deliver monomeric benzoyl products. The robustness of the ferraelectrocatalysis was mirrored by the degradation of various real&#8208;life post&#8208;consumer plastics, also on gram scale. The cathodic half reaction was largely represented by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The scalable electro&#8208;polymer degradation could be solely fueled by solar energy through a commercially available solar panel, indicating an outstanding potential for a decentralized green hydrogen economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Characterization of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Hyponitrite Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavodiiron NO reductases (FNORs) are important enzymes in microbial pathogenesis, as they equip microbes with resistance to the human immune defense agent nitric oxide (NO). Despite much efforts, intermediates that would provide insight into how the non&#8208;heme diiron active sites of FNORs reduce NO to N2O could not be identified. Computations predict that iron&#8208;hyponitrite complexes are the key species, leading from NO to N2O. However, the coordination chemistry of non&#8208;heme iron centers with hyponitrite is largely unknown. In this study, we report the reactivity of two non&#8208;heme iron complexes with preformed hyponitrite. In the case of [Fe(TPA)(CH3CN)2](OTf)2, cleavage of hyponitrite and formation of an Fe2(NO)2 diamond core is observed. With less Lewis&#8208;acidic [Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2(OTf)2] (2), reaction with Na2N2O2 in polar aprotic solvent leads to the formation of a red complex, 3. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that 3 is a tetranuclear iron&#8208;hyponitrite complex, [{Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2}2(&#956;&#8208;N2O2)](OTf)2, with a unique hyponitrite binding mode. This species provided the unique opportunity to us to study the interaction of hyponitrite with non&#8208;heme iron centers and the reactivity of the bound hyponitrite ligand. Here, either protonation or oxidation of 3 is found to induce N2O formation, supporting the hypothesis that hyponitrite is a viable intermediate in NO reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Aryl&#8208;Tetrazines into Bioorthogonal Scissors for Systematic Cleavage of trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal bond&#8208;cleavage reactions have emerged as a powerful tool for precise spatiotemporal control of (bio)molecular function in the biological context. Among these chemistries, the tetrazine&#8208;triggered elimination of cleavable&#160;trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (click&#8208;to&#8208;release) stands out due to high reaction rates, versatility, and selectivity. Despite an increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, application of this reaction remains limited by the cumulative performance trade&#8208;offs (i.e., click kinetics, release kinetics, release yield) of existing tools. Efficient release has been restricted to tetrazine scaffolds with comparatively low click reactivity, while highly reactive aryl&#8208;tetrazines give only minimal release. By introducing hydroxyl groups onto phenyl&#8208; and pyridyl&#8208;tetrazine scaffolds, we have developed a new class of &#8216;bioorthogonal scissors&#8217; with unique chemical performance. We demonstrate that hydroxyaryl&#8208;tetrazines achieve near&#8208;quantitative release upon accelerated click reaction with cleavable&#160;trans&#8208;cyclooctenes, as exemplified by click&#8208;triggered activation of a caged prodrug, intramitochondrial cleavage of a fluorogenic probe (turn&#8208;on) in live cells, and rapid intracellular bioorthogonal disassembly (turn&#8208;off) of a ligand&#8208;dye conjugate.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Acetals as Expanding Monomers to Reduce Shrinkage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polarity&#8208;reversal catalysts (PRCs) for hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer reactions have been known in radical chemistry for more than 60 years but are rarely described and utilized in the field of photopolymerization up to now. Herein, we present the use of thiols in a unique dual function as thiol&#8208;ene click reagents and as polarity&#8208;reversal catalyst (PRC) for the radical&#8208;mediated redox rearrangements of benzylidene acetals. During the rearrangement reaction, cyclic benzylidene acetals are transformed into benzoate esters leading to a significant volumetric expansion to reduce thermoset shrinkage. We were able to show that this expansion on a molecular level reduces shrinkage and polymerization stress but does not significantly affect the (thermo&#8208;)mechanical properties of the cross&#8208;linked networks. One of the key advantages of this process lies in its simplicity. No additives like sensitizers or combinations of different initiators (radical and cationic) are needed. Furthermore, the same light source can be used for both the polymerization reaction and expansion through rearrangement. Additionally, the applied photoinitiator enables spatial and temporal control of the polymerization; thus, the developed system can be an excellent platform for additive manufacturing processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Fighting Mutations with Mutations: Evolutionarily Adapting a DNA Aptamer for High&#8208;Affinity Recognition of Mutated Spike Proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An on&#8208;going challenge with COVID&#8208;19, which has huge implications for future pandemics, is the rapid emergence of viral variants that makes diagnostic tools less accurate, calling for rapid identification of recognition elements for detecting new variants caused by mutations. We hypothesize that we can fight mutations of the viruses with mutations of existing recognition elements. We demonstrate this concept via rapidly evolving an existing DNA aptamer originally selected for the spike protein (S&#8208;protein) of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#160;to enhance the interaction with the same protein of the Omicron variants. The new aptamer, MBA5SA1, has acquired 22 mutations within its 40&#8208;nucleotide core sequence and improved its binding affinity for the S&#8208;proteins of diverse Omicron subvariants by &gt; 100&#8208;fold compared to its parental aptamer (improved from nanomolar to picomolar affinity). Deep sequencing analysis reveals dynamic competitions among several MBA5SA1 variants in response to increasing selection pressure imposed during in vitro selection, with MBA5SA1 being the final winner of the competition. Additionally, MBA5SA1 was implemented into an enzyme&#8208;linked aptamer binding assay (ELABA), which was applied for detecting Omicron variants in the saliva of infected patients. The assay produced a sensitivity of 86.5% and a specificity of 100%, which was established with 83 clinical samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Oxetanes Catalyzed by an Engineered Halohydrin Dehalogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although biocatalysis has garnered widespread attention in both industrial and academic realms, the enzymatic synthesis of chiral oxetanes remains an underdeveloped field. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) are industrially relevant enzymes that have been engineered to accomplish the reversible transformation of epoxides. In our work, a biocatalytic platform was constructed for the stereoselective kinetic resolution of chiral oxetanes and formation of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alcohols. HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 was engineered to identify key variants capable of catalyzing the dehalogenation of &#947;&#8208;haloalcohols (via HheC M1&#8208;M3) and ring opening of oxetanes (via HheC M4&#8208;M5) to access both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configured products with high stereoselectivity and remarkable catalytic activity, yielding up to 49% with enantioselectivities exceeding 99% ee and E&gt;200. The current strategy is broadly applicable as demonstrated by expansion of substrate scope to include up to 18 examples for dehalogenations and 16 examples for ring opening.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although biocatalysis has garnered widespread attention in both industrial and academic realms, the enzymatic synthesis of chiral oxetanes remains an underdeveloped field. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) are industrially relevant enzymes that have been engineered to accomplish the reversible transformation of epoxides. In our work, a biocatalytic platform was constructed for the stereoselective kinetic resolution of chiral oxetanes and formation of 1,3-disubstituted alcohols. HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 was engineered to identify key variants capable of catalyzing the dehalogenation of &#947;-haloalcohols (via HheC M1-M3) and ring opening of oxetanes (via HheC M4-M5) to access both (R)- and (S)-configured products with high stereoselectivity and remarkable catalytic activity, yielding up to 49% with enantioselectivities exceeding 99% ee and E&amp;gt;200. The current strategy is broadly applicable as demonstrated by expansion of substrate scope to include up to 18 examples for dehalogenations and 16 examples for ring opening. Additionally, the functionalized products are versatile building blocks for pharmaceutical applications. To shed light on the molecular recognition mechanisms for the relevant variants, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed. The current strategy expands the scope of HHDH-catalyzed chiral oxetane ring constructions, offering efficient access to both enantiomers of chiral oxetanes and 1,3-disubstituted alcohols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Like Contraction Enables the Fabrication of High&#8208;Purity Selenium Films for Efficient Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lanthanide contraction involves a reduction in atomic radius among f&#8208;block elements below the expected level. A similar contraction is observed in group&#8208;16 elements. The atomic radius of Se (117 pm) is slightly larger than that of S (104 pm) arising from the presence of d electrons, compared to the significant increase in atomic radius from O (73 pm) to S. This lanthanide&#8208;like contraction contributes to Se's robust oxidative resistance. Here we report a selective oxidation strategy utilizing Se's strong antioxidative property to remove coexisting narrow&#8208;bandgap Te impurities from Se feedstocks. This strategy selectively oxidizes volatile Te impurities into involatile TeO2 that remains in the evaporation source, while only volatile Se deposits onto the substrate during the thermal&#8208;evaporation deposition process. This enables the fabrication of high&#8208;purity Se films possessing a wide bandgap of 1.88 eV, ideally suited to the optimal bandgap for indoor photovoltaics (IPVs). The resulting Se photovoltaics exhibit an efficiency of 20.1% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination, outperforming market&#8208;dominant amorphous silicon and all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs. Unencapsulated Se devices show no efficiency degradation after 20,000 hours of storage in ambient atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Silver&#8208;Based&#160;Hybrid Pyroelectric Enabling&#160;Wide Spectral Photo&#8208;Pyroelectricity for Birefringence&#160;Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystal, which has the capacity to manipulate polarization light, holds an indispensable position in optics and optoelectronics, while it remains challenging to fulfill the modulation of birefringence. Here, we present wide spectral photo&#8208;pyroelectric effect in a silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric, (N&#8208;CHM)Ag2I3 (N&#8208;CHM = N&#8208;cyclohexylmethylamine), serving as a feasible strategy to regulate birefringence through light stimuli. As the first silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric, (N&#8208;CHM)Ag2I3 exhibits strong room&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;pyroelectricity with a large polarization of ~3.23 &#956;C/cm2 and high voltage responsivity of ~0.96 m2/C across the UV&#8722;NIR spectral region. Strikingly, the photomodulation of its in&#8208;plane birefringence is established through pyroelectric effect, giving a saturation value of ~1.68&#215;10&#8722;2 that is among the highest level achieved to date. This study on the birefringence photomodulation of lead&#8208;free hybrid pyroelectric is anticipated to boost future development of new smart optical and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Direction Modulation of Intramolecular Electric Field Boosts Hole Transport in Phthalocyanines for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the strength of intramolecular electric field (IEF) in conjugated molecules has emerged as an effective approach to boost charge transfer. While direction manipulation of IEF would be a potential way that is still unclear. Here, we leverage the control of peripheral substituents of conjugated phthalocyanines to chemically tune the spatial orientation of IEF. By analyzing the spatial swing of side chains using the Kolmogorov&#8208;Arnold representation and least squares algorithm, a comprehensive mathematical&#8208;physical model has been established. This model enables rapid evaluation of the IEF and maximum hole transport performance induced by spatial swings. The champion phthalocyanine as dopant&#8208;free hole transport material in perovskite solar cell realizes a record performance of 23.41%. Greatly device stability is also exhibited. This work affords a new way to enhance hole transport capabilities of conjugated molecules by optimizing their IEF vector for photovoltaic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Switchable Lattice Oxygen Sites for Selective C&#8722;H and C(O)&#8722;C Bond Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lattice&#8208;oxygen is highly oxidizable, ideal for electrocatalytic C&#8722;H oxidation but insufficient alone for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage due to the non&#8208;removable nature of lattice sites. Here, we present a visible light&#8208;assisted electrochemical method of in&#8208;situ formulating removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in a nickel&#8208;oxyhydroxide (ESE&#8208;NiOOH) electrocatalyst. This catalyst efficiently converts aromatic alcohols and carbonyls with C(O)&#8722;C fragments from lignin and plastics into benzoic acids (BAs) with high yields (83&#8211;99%). Without light irradiation, ESE&#8208;NiOOH&#8217;s intrinsic lattice&#8208;oxygen is non&#8208;removable and inert for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage. In&#8208;situ characterizations show light&#8208;induced lattice&#8208;oxygen removal and regeneration via OH&#8211; refilling. Theoretical calculations identify the nucleophilic oxygen attack on ketone&#8208;derived carbanion as a rate&#8208;determining step, which can be remarkably facilitated by removable lattice&#8208;oxygen to activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an &#8220;electrochemical funnel&#8221; strategy is developed for high&#8208;efficiency upgrading aromatic mixtures with C(O)&#8722;C moieties into BA with up to 94% yield. This in&#8208;situ removal&#8208;regeneration approach for lattice sites opens an avenue for the tailored design of interfacial electrocatalysts to selectively upcycle waste carbon sources into valuable products.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Printing Strategy Achieves Precise Anchoring of Dual&#8208;Copper Atoms on C2N Structure for Efficient CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolated metal sites catalysts (IMSCs) play crucial role in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with potential industrial applications. However, tunable synthesis strategies for IMSCs are limited. Herein, we present an atomic printing strategy that draws inspiration from the ancient Chinese "movable&#8208;type printing technology". Selecting customizable combinations of metal atoms as metal precursors form an extensive binuclear metal library. A series of dual&#8208;atom catalysts were prepared by utilizing the edge nitrogen atoms in the C2N cavity as anchoring "pincers" to capture metal atoms. To prove utility, the dual atom catalyst Cu2&#8208;C2N is investigated as electrocatalytic CO2RR catalyst. The synergistic interaction of dual Cu atoms promotes C&#8208;C coupling and guarantees FEC2+ (90.8%) and FEC2H4. (71.7%) at &#8208;1.10 V vs RHE. DFT calculations revealed the Cu2 site would be subtly flipped during CO2RR for enhancing *CO adsorption and dimerization. We validate that atomic printing strategies are applicable to wide range of metal combinations, representing a significant advancement in the development of IMSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;State Electrochromism in Tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine&#8208;terephthalaldehyde&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of massive interest due to their potential application spanning diverse fields such as gas storage and separation, catalysis, drug delivery systems, sensing, and organic electronics. In view of their application&#8208;oriented quest, the field of electrochromism marked a significant stride with the reporting of the first electrochromic COF in 2019 [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 19831&#8722;19838]. Since then, new and novel COF structures with electrochromic features (denoted as ecCOFs) have been searched continuously. Yet, only a handful of ecCOFs have been constructed to date. A closer look at these reports suggests that multielectrochromism (showing at least three redox color states) in a COF assembly has only been achieved once, manifested through three&#8208;state electrochromism [Angew. Chem. 2021, 133, 12606 &#8211; 1261]. Herein, we report four&#8208;state electrochromism in tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine&#8208;terephthalaldehyde (TAPA&#8208;PDA)&#8208;based COF constructed through the metal&#8208;catalyst free Schiff base approach. The four&#8208;state (orange, pear, green, and cyan) electrochromism demonstrated by the TAPA&#8208;PDA ecCOF opens several futuristic avenues for ecCOF's end use in flip&#8208;flop logic gates, intelligent windows, decorative displays, and energy&#8208;saving devices.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of massive interest due to their potential application spanning diverse fields such as gas storage and separation, catalysis, drug delivery systems, sensing, and organic electronics. In view of their application-oriented quest, the field of electrochromism marked a significant stride with the reporting of the first electrochromic COF in 2019 [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 19831&#8722;19838]. Since then, new and novel COF structures with electrochromic features (denoted as ecCOFs) have been searched continuously. Yet, only a handful of ecCOFs have been constructed to date. A closer look at these reports suggests that multielectrochromism (showing at least three redox color states) in a COF assembly has only been achieved once, manifested through three-state electrochromism [Angew. Chem. 2021, 133, 12606 &#8211; 1261]. Herein, we report four-state electrochromism in tris(4-aminophenyl)amine-terephthalaldehyde (TAPA-PDA)-based COF constructed through the metal-catalyst free Schiff base approach. The four-state (orange, pear, green, and cyan) electrochromism demonstrated by the TAPA-PDA ecCOF opens several futuristic avenues for ecCOF's end use in flip-flop logic gates, intelligent windows, decorative displays, and energy-saving devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cascading Macrocycle and Helix Motions in a Foldarotaxane Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of a dynamically assembled foldarotaxane was envisioned with the aim of operating as a two cascading triggers&#8208;based molecular shuttle. In acidic conditions, both the macrocycle and helix were localized around their respective best molecular stations because they are far enough from each other not to alter the stability of complexes. The pH&#8208;dependent localization of the macrocycle along the encircled axle allowed us to modulate the association between the helical foldamer and its sites of interaction on the axle. Under kinetic control,&#160;at low concentration and room temperature,&#160;when the foldarotaxane supramolecular architecture is kinetically stable, the pH&#8208;responsive translation of the macrocycle along the thread triggered the gliding of the helix away from its initial best station. At higher concentration,&#160;when helix assembly/disassembly process is accelerated,&#160;the system reached the equilibrium state. A new foldarotaxane isomer then appeared through the change of the relative position of the helix and macrocycle along the thread. In this isomer, the helix segregated the macrocycle away from its best station. The fine control of the kinetic and thermodynamic processes, combined with the control of pH, allowed the reciprocal segregation of the helix or the ring away from their respective best sites of interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Dialkyl Chloronium Salts: Synthesis and Reactivity for Fluoroalkylation and Hydride Abstraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis of highly electrophilic fluorinated dialkyl chloronium salts [Cl(CH2CF3)2][M(OTeF5)n] (M=Sb, n=6; M=Al, n=4), which are able to alkylate weak nucleophiles, while their high hydride ion affinity enables the activation of linear alkanes leading to the formation of branched carbocations.







Abstract
A new concept for the synthesis of dialkyl chloronium cations [R&#8722;Cl&#8722;R]+ is described (R=CH3, CH2CF3), that allows the formation of fluorinated derivatives. By utilizing the xenonium salt [XeOTeF5][M(OTeF5)n] (M=Sb, n=6; M=Al, n=4) chlorine atoms of chloroalkanes or the deactivated chlorofluoroalkane CH2ClCF3 are oxidized and removed as ClOTeF5 leading to the isolation of the corresponding chloronium salt. Since the resulting highly electrophilic cation [Cl(CH2CF3)2]+ is able to alkylate weak nucleophiles, this compound can be utilized for the introduction of a fluorinated alkyl group to those. In addition, the fluorinated alkyl chloronium cation displays a high hydride ion affinity, enabling the activation of linear hydrocarbons by hydride abstraction even at low temperatures ultimately leading to the formation of branched carbocations.

         <title>Solvent Minimized Synthesis of Amides by Reactive Extrusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct amidation of esters is converted from a ball&#8208;milled process into a continuous solvent&#8208;minimised reactive extrusion protocol capable of delivering 500&#8197;grams (1.3&#8197;mols) of amide product over a continuous operation for 7&#8197;hours. Key to this, was translation of heating profiles used for the ball&#8208;milling study directly to the extruder and consideration of the physical form of input substrates.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the translation of a small scale ball&#8208;milled amidation protocol into a large scale continuous reactive extrusion process. Critical components to the successful translation were: a) understanding how the different operating parameters of a twin&#8208;screw extruder should be harnessed to control prolonged continuous operation, and b) consideration of the physical form of the input materials. The amidation reaction is applied to 36 amides spanning a variety of physical form combinations (liquid&#8208;liquid, solid&#8211;liquid and solid&#8208;solid). Following this learning process, we have developed an understanding for the translation of each physical form combination and demonstrated a 7&#8208;hour reactive extrusion process for the synthesis of an amide on 500&#8197;gram scale (1.3&#8197;mols of product).

         <title>A High&#8208;Quality Photoswitchable Probe that Selectively and Potently Regulates the Transcription Factor ROR&#947;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptor &#947; (ROR&#947;) is a nuclear hormone receptor with multiple biological functions. As an experimental therapeutic target in inflammation and immunity, there is great interest in spatially&#8208;localised ROR&#947; inhibition; and its cyclic temporal role in circadian rhythms also makes it an intriguing target for time&#8208;resolved pharmacology. To create tools that can study ROR&#947; biology with appropriate spatial and temporal resolution, we designed light&#8208;dependent inverse ROR&#947; agonists by building azobenzene photoswitches into ligand consensus structures. Optimizations gave photoswitchable ROR&#947; inhibitors with a large degree of potency photocontrol, plus remarkable on&#8208;target potency, plus excellent selectivity over related off&#8208;target receptors. This still&#8208;rare, but urgently&#8208;needed combination of performance features, distinguishes them as high quality photopharmaceutical probes; and they can now serve as high precision tools to study the spatial and dynamic intricacies of ROR&#947; action in signaling and in inflammatory disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxindolyl&#8208;based Radicals with Tunable Mechanochromic and Thermochromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic radicals based dynamic covalent chemistry is promising in preparing stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials, due to their simplicity of dissociation/association, accompanied with distinct color changes during the process. However, suitable organic radicals for dynamic covalent chemistry have not been widely explored yet. Herein, a series of oxindolyl&#8208;based mono&#8208;radicals (OxRs) with different substituents were successfully synthesized and studied systematically as potential building blocks for stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials. These OxRs would dimerize spontaneously to form their corresponding dimers. The structures of dimers were unambiguously confirmed through low&#8208;temperature 1H&#8208;NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Dynamic interconversion between monomers and dimers was achieved by reversible cleavage and recovery of the &#963;&#8208;bond upon soft external stimuli (temperature, pressure, and solvent polarity), accompanied by significant color changes. It is interesting that the stability of the mono&#8208;radical could be tuned through changing different substituents, and consequently altering the bond dissociation energy of the dynamic covalent bond between monomers. These new OxRs characterized by appreciable properties are entitled to more opportunities in developing mechanochromic and thermochromic materials, where their responsiveness to stimuli can be readily controlled by the substituents adhered.</dc:description>

It is interesting that the stability of the mono-radical could be tuned through changing different substituents, and consequently altering the bond dissociation energy of the dynamic covalent bond between monomers. These new OxRs characterized by appreciable properties are entitled to more opportunities in developing mechanochromic and thermochromic materials, where their responsiveness to stimuli can be readily controlled by the substituents adhered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving the Selectivity and Stability of Supported Cobalt Catalysts via Static Bi&#8208;Doping and Dynamic Trace CO2 Co&#8208;feeding during Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneously enhancing selectivity and stability on supported propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report a combined static and dynamic strategy to address these issues synergistically. Firstly, we demonstrate a feasible sol&#8208;gel method for preparing atomically&#8208;dispersed Bi&#8208;decorated metal nanoparticle catalysts (MBi/Al2O3, M= Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn). In PDH testing, the total selectivity of by&#8208;products (CH4 and C2H6) significantly decreases to 4% for CoBi catalysts due to the static Bi&#8208;doping, compared with 16% for Co&#8208;supported catalysts. Secondly, to enhance catalytic stability, we introduce a dynamic trace CO2 co&#8208;feeding route. 10CoBi/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit superior durability against coke formation for 330 hours in PDH under a 40% C3H8 atmosphere followed by pure C3H8 conditions at 600 &#176;C while maintaining propylene selectivity at 96%. Notably, introducing trace CO2 leads to a remarkable 6&#8208;fold decrease in the deactivation rate constant (kd). Multiple characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that charge transfer from atomically&#8208;distributed Bi to Co nanoparticles benefits lowering the energy of C3H6 adsorption thereby suppressing by&#8208;products. Furthermore, the dynamic co&#8208;feeding of trace CO2 facilitates coke removal, suppressing catalyst deactivation. The static Bi&#8208;doping and dynamic trace CO2 co&#8208;feeding strategy contributes simultaneously to increased selectivity and stability on supported PDH catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Enrichment of Free Radicals through Nanoconfinement Boosts Electrochemiluminescence of Carbon Dots Derived from Luminol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Local enrichment of free radicals at the electrode interface may open new opportunities for the development of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) applications. The sensing platform was constructed by assembling ECL&#8208;emitting luminol derived carbon dots (Lu CDs) onto the heterojunction Tungsten disulfide/Covalent organic frameworks (WS2@COF) for the first time, establishing a nanoconfinement&#8208;reactor with significantly heightened ECL intensity and stability compared to the Lu CDs&#8208;H2O2 system. This enhanced performance is credited to the COF domain's restricted pore environment, where WS2@COF exhibits a more negative adsorption energy for H2O2, effectively enriching H2O2 in the catalytic edge sites of WS2. Furthermore, the internal electric field at the WS2 and COF interface accelerates electron flow, boosting WS2's catalytic activity and achieving domain&#8208;limited catalytic enhancement of ECL. Self&#8208;designed DNA nanomachines combined with cascading molecular keypad locking mechanisms are integrated into the biosensors, effectively guaranteeing the accuracy of the sensing process while providing crucial safeguards for molecular diagnostics and information security applications. In essence, this innovative approach represents the first system to enhance local free radical concentrations by enriching co&#8208;reactants on the electrode surface through nanoconfinement catalysis, yielding heightened ECL luminescence intensity. The potential impact of this novel strategy and sensing mechanism on real&#8208;bioanalysis applications is promising.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of An Ideal Chain Antiferromagnet [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)](H3O)2Fe2F10 with Spin S = 5/2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) magnets are of great interest owing to their intriguing quantum phenomena and potential application in quantum computing. We successfully synthesized an ideal antiferromagnetic spin S = 5/2 chain compound [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)](H3O)2Fe2F10 (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) 1, using a single&#8208;step low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal method under conditions that favors the protonation of the bulky bidentate ligand 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy. Compound 1 consists of well&#8208;separated (Fe3+&#8722;F&#8722;)&#165; chains with a large Fe&#8722;F&#8722;Fe angle of 174.8&#176;. Both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements show that 1 does not undergo a magnetic long&#8208;range ordering down to 0.5 K, despite the strong Fe&#8722;F&#8722;Fe intrachain spin exchange J with J/kB = &#8211;16.2(1) K. This indicates a negligibly weak interchain spin exchange J&#8242;. The J&#8242;/J value estimated for 1 is extremely small (&lt; 2.8&#215;10&#8208;6), smaller than those reported for all other S = 5/2 chain magnets. Our hydrothermal synthesis incorporates both [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)]2+ and (H3O)+ cations into the crystal lattice with numerous hydrogen bonds, hence effectively separating the (Fe3+&#8722;F&#8722;)&#165; spin chains. This single&#8208;step hydrothermal synthesis under conditions favoring the protonation of bulky bidentate ligands offers an effective synthetic strategy to prepare well&#8208;separated 1D spin chain systems of magnetic ions with various spin values.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;activation of Tolane&#8208;based Synthetic Ion Channel for Transmembrane Chloride Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While natural channels respond to external stimuli to regulate ion concentration across cell membranes, creating a synthetic version remains challenging. Here, we present a photo&#8208;responsive uncaging technique within an artificial ion channel system, which activates the ion transport process from a transport&#8208;inactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based caged system. From the comparative ion transport screening, 1b emerged as the most active transporter. Interestingly, its bis(o&#8208;nitrobenzyl) derivative, i.e., protransporter 1b' was inefficient in transporting ions. Detailed transport studies indicated that compound 1b is an anion selective transporter with a prominent selectivity towards chloride ions by following the antiport mechanism. Compound 1b' did not form an ion channel, but after the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl groups were photocleaved, it released 1b, forming a transmembrane ion channel. The channel exhibited an average diameter of 6.5 &#177; 0.2 &#197; and a permeability ratio of PCl&#8208;&#8260;PK+ = 7.3 &#177; 1.5. The geometry&#8208;optimization of protransporter 1b' indicated significant non&#8208;planarity, corroborating its inefficient self&#8208;assembly. In contrast, the crystal structure of 1b demonstrates strong self&#8208;assembly via the formation of an intermolecular H&#8208;bond. Geometry optimization studies revealed the plausible self&#8208;assembled channel model and the interactions between the channel and chloride ion.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;Br Substituted Benzophenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrogenation of benzophenones, catalyzed by low&#8208;activity earth&#8208;abundant metal copper, has hitherto remained a challenge due to the substrates equipped with two indistinguishably similar aryl groups. In this study, we demonstrated that the prochiral carbon of the ortho&#8208;bromine substrate exhibits the highest electrophilicity and high reactivity among the ortho&#8208;halogen substituted benzophenones, as determined by the Fukui function (f+) analysis and hydrogenation reaction. Considering that the enantiodirecting functional bromine group can be easily derivatized and removed in the products, we successfully achieved a green copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ortho&#8208;bromine substituted benzophenones. This method yielded a series of chiral benzhydrols with excellent results. The utility of this protocol has been validated through a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent product transformations. Hirshfeld partition (IGMH) and energy decomposition analysis (EDA) indicate that the CH&#183;&#183;&#183;HC multiple attractive dispersion interactions (MADI) effect between the catalyst and substrate enhances the catalyst&#8217;s activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production via Covalent Triazine Frameworks Constructed from Fused Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered attention for their potential in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, their photocatalytic efficiency is impeded by insufficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport. Constructing COFs with superior planarity is an effective way to enhance the &#960;&#8208;conjugation degree and facilitate electron&#8208;hole separation. Nonetheless, the conventional linear linkers of COFs inevitably introduce torsional strain that disrupts coplanarity.Herein, we address this issue by introducing inherently coplanar triazine rings as linkers and fused building blocks as monomers to create covalent triazine frameworks (fused CTFs) with superior coplanarity.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered attention for their potential in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, their photocatalytic efficiency is impeded by insufficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport.

         <title>Carbonylation Reactions at Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with an Adjacent Heteroatom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatoms are essential to living organisms and present in almost all molecules with medicinal usage. The catalytic functionalization at the carbon&#8208;centered radical with an adjacent heteroatom provides an effective way to value added moiety while retaining the unique physicochemical and pharmacological properties of heteroatoms, which can promote the development of pharmaceutical and fine chemical production. Carbonylative transformation was discovered nearly a century ago which is an efficient method for the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing molecules with potent applications in both industry and academia. Despite numerous advances in new reaction development, carbonylative transformation involving adjacent heteroatom carbon radical remain a subject that deserves to be discussed. In this minireview, we systematically summarized and discussed the recent advances in carbonylative transformations involving carbon&#8208;centered radicals with an adjacent heteroatom, including oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), boron (B), fluorine (F), and chlorine (Cl). The related reaction mechanism was also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Stable Electrochemical CO2&#160;Capture using Redox&#8208;Active Heterocyclic Benzodithiophene Quinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon capture offers a promising alternative to thermal amine technology, which serves as the traditional benchmark method for CO2&#160;capture. Despite its technological maturity, the widespread deployment of thermal amine technologies is hindered by high energy consumption and sorbent degradation. In contrast, electrochemical methods, with their inherently isothermal operation, address these challenges, offering enhanced energy efficiency and robustness. Among emerging strategies, electrochemical carbon capture systems using redox&#8208;active materials such as quinones stand out for their potential to capture CO2.However, their practical application is currently limited by their low stability in the presence of oxygen. We demonstrate that benzodithiophene quinone (BDT&#8208;Q), a heterocyclic quinone, exhibits high stability in electrochemical carbon capture processes with oxygen&#8208;containing feed gas. Conducted in a cyclic flow system with a simulated flue gas mixture containing 13% CO2&#160;and 3.5% O2&#160;for over 100 hours, the process demonstrates high oxygen stability with an electron utilization of 0.83 without significant degradation, indicating a promising approach for real world applications. Our study explores the potential of new heterocyclic quinone compounds in the context of carbon capture technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Sensitized Switching of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Norbornadienes for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Norbornadiene&#8208;based photoswitches have emerged as promising candidates for harnessing and storing solar energy, holding great promise as a viable solution to meet the growing energy demands. Despite their potential, the effectiveness of their direct photochemical conversion into the resulting quadricyclanes has room for improvement owing to (i) moderate quantum yields, (ii) poor overlap with the solar spectrum and (iii) photochemical back reactions. Herein, we present an approach to enhance the performance of such molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems through the triplet&#8208;sensitized conversion of aryl&#8208;substituted norbornadienes. Our study combines deep spectroscopic analyses, irradiation experiments, and quantum mechanical calculations to elucidate the energy transfer mechanism and inherent advantages of the resulting MOST systems. We demonstrate remarkable quantum yields using readily available sensitizers under both LED and solar light irradiation, significantly surpassing those achieved through direct excitation with photons of higher energy. In contrast to the conventional approach, light&#8208;induced back reactions of the high&#8208;energy products do not play any role, allowing quantitative switching within minutes. These results not only underscore the potential of triplet&#8208;sensitized MOST systems to leverage the high energy storage capabilities of multistate photoswitches but they might also stimulate the broader usage of sensitization strategies in photochemical energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Suspension Bead Loading (SBL): An Economical Protein Delivery Platform to Study URM1&#8217;s Behavior in Live Cells.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uniquely modified synthetic proteins are difficult to produce in large quantities, which could limit their use in various in vitro settings and in cellular studies. In this study, we developed a method named &#8220;suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL), to deliver protein molecules into suspended living cells using glass beads, which significantly reduces the amount of protein required for effective delivery. We investigated the delivery efficiency of functionally different proteins and evaluated the cytotoxic effect of our method and the chemical and functional integrity of the delivered protein. We utilized SBL to address questions related to ubiquitin&#8208;related modifier 1 (URM1). Employing minimal protein quantities, SBL has enabled us to study its behavior within live cells under different redox conditions, including subcellular localization and conjugation patterns. We demonstrate that oxidative stress alters both the localization and conjugation pattern of URM1 in cells, highlighting its possible role in cellular response to such extreme conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Doping In Vivo Alkylation in E. coli by Introducing the Direct Sulfurylation Pathway of S. cerevisiae</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylation and alkylation are important techniques used for the synthesis and derivatisation of small molecules and natural products. Application of S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) in biotechnological hosts such as Escherichia coli lowers the environmental impact of alkylations compared to chemical synthesis and facilitates regio&#8208; and chemoselective alkyl chain transfer. Here, we address the limiting factor for SAM synthesis, methionine supply, to accelerate in vivo methylation activity. Introduction of the direct sulfurylation pathway, consisting of O&#8208;acetylhomoserine sulfhydrolase (ScOAHS) and O&#8208;acetyltransferase (ScMET2), from S. cerevisiae into E. coli and supplementation with methanethiol or the corresponding disulfide improves atom&#8208;economic methylation activity in three different MT reactions. Up to 17&#8208;fold increase of conversion compared to the sole expression of the MT and incorporation of up to 79% of the thiol compound added were achieved. Promiscuity of ScOAHS allowed in vivo production of methionine analogues from organic thiols. Further co&#8208;overproduction of a methionine adenosyltransferase yielded SAM analogues which were further transferred by MTs onto different substrates. For methylation of non&#8208;physiological substrates, conversion rates up to 73% were achieved, with an isolated yield of 41% for N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;aminonitrophenol. Our here described technique enables E. coli to become a biotechnological host for improved methylation and selective alkylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atomic&#8208;scale Explanation For The High Selectivity Towards Carbon Dioxide Reduction Observed On Liquid Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low&#8208;temperature liquid metals Ga&#8208;In and Ga&#8208;Sn&#160;have previously showcased &gt;95% selectivity towards the electrochemical reduction of CO2&#160;to formate, occuring only when the alloys are melted, not solid.&#160;Here, density functional theory molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations reveal that CO2&#160;does not directly adsorb to the Ga&#8208;alloy surface, but instead is reduced indirectly by reaction with an adsorbed hydrogen. The reaction barrier is vastly more favourable when this process occurs at In or Sn sites (average: 0.26 eV), than when it occurs on Ga (average: 0.47 eV). However, there is no difference in barrier between solid and liquid surfaces. Instead, we find that Hads&#160;is mobile only on the liquid surface, travelling due to the motion of the liquid beneath. This process drives Hads&#160;to In/Sn sites, allowing low&#8208;barrier CO2&#160;reduction to occur only on the liquid. Therefore, the dynamic motion of liquid metal catalysts can underpin their unique reactivity. The result has far reaching implications for any protonation reaction conducted with a liquid metal catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Multi&#8208;Complexation of CO2 to Alkaline Earth Metal Ion&#8208;Pair at 400 ppm and 298 K</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient capture of low&#8208;pressure CO2 remains a significant challenge due to the lack of established multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to active sites in microporous materials. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of reversible multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to alkaline earth metal (AEM) ion pairs, utilizing a host site in ferrierite&#8208;type zeolite (FER). This unique site constrains two AEM ions in proximity, thereby enhancing and isotopically spreading their electrostatic potentials within the zeolite cavity. This electrostatic potential&#8208;engineered micropore can trap up to four CO2 molecules, forming M2+&#8211;(CO2)n&#8211;M2+ (n = 0&#8208;4, M = Ca, Sr, Ba) complexes, where each CO2 molecule is stabilized by interactions between terminal oxygen (Ot) in CO2 and the AEM ions. Notably, the Ba2+ pair site exhibits higher thermodynamic stability for multiple adsorptions due to the optimal binding mode of Ba2+&#8211;Ot&#8211;Ba2+. Through high&#8208;accuracy energy calculations, we established the relationship among structure, CO2 uptake, and operating temperature/pressure, demonstrating that the Ba2+ pair site can reversibly capture four CO2 molecules even at concentrations as low as 400 ppm and at 298 K. The findings in the present study provide a new direction for developing efficient CO2 adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Origami Vesicle Sensors with Triggered Single&#8208;Molecule Cargo Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interacting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Utilizing DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor with single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a DNA origami nanostructure. In a vesicle&#8208;free environment, the ssDNA coils, ensuring high FRET efficiency. Upon vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, reducing FRET efficiency. As the next step, the sensing strand serves as molecular cargo that can be transferred to the vesicle through a triggered strand displacement reaction. Depending on the number of cholesterols on the displacer strands, we either induce a diffusive release of the fluorescent load towards neighboring vesicles or a stoichiometric release of a single cargo&#8208;unit to the vesicle on the nanosensor. Ultimately, our multi&#8208;functional liposome interaction and detection platform opens up pathways for innovative biosensing applications and controllable stoichiometric loading of vesicles with single&#8208;molecule control.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Chemistry towards On&#8208;Site Construction of Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Stable Metallic Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversibility of metallic Zn anode serves as the corner stone for the development of aqueous Zn metal battery, which motivates scrutinizing the electrolyte&#8208;Zn interface. As the representative organic zinc salt, zinc trifluorosulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) facilitates a broad class of aqueous electrolytes, however, the stability issue of Zn anode remains crucial. The great challenge lies in the lack of Zn anode protection by the pristinely formed surface structure in aqueous Zn(OTf)2 electrolytes. Accordingly, an electrochemical route was developed to grow a uniform zinc trifluorosulfonate hydroxide (ZTH) layer on Zn anode as an artificial SEI, via regulation on metal dissolution and strong coordination ability of zinc ions. Co&#8208;precipitation was proposed to be the formation mechanism for the artificial SEI, where the reduction stability of OTf&#8254; anion and the low&#8208;symmetry layer structure of ZTH was unmasked. This artificial SEI favors interfacial kinetics, depresses side reactions, and well maintains its integrity during cycling, leading to a prolonged lifespan of Zn stripping/plating with a high DOD of ~85%, and an improved cycling stability of ~92% retention rate for V2O5/Zn cell at 1 A g&#8208;1. The unveiled role of anion on Zn anode drives the contemplation on the surface chemistry for the blooming aqueous rechargeable battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Selective Recovery of Gold from E&#8208;Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The existing electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) and leaching solutions generated by industries accumulate significant amounts of gold (Au), even in excess of those in natural minerals. Therefore, the recycling of Au is extremely significant for the potential sustainability of chemical industry. By designing ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs), here we synthesize a series of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;X (X=Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, AcO&#8208;, and SO42&#8208;) by anion regulation strategy. All these ionic COFs exhibit ultrahigh gold adsorption efficiency and excellent regeneration. Moreover, anion regulation could indeed affect the Au capture performance. In particular, when Cl&#8208; ions serve as counter ions, the Au capacity of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl could reach 1270.8 mg g&#8208;1. Moreover, in the actual CPU leaching solution test, the selectivity of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl towards Au3+ ion hits 39000 and 4600 times higher than that of Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions, respectively, suggesting that the Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl is a promising material for highly selective recovering gold from actual e&#8208;waste. DFT calculations further reveal that counter ions can regulate the adsorption affinity of ionic COF framework toward Au. In short, this work provides a useful anion regulation strategy to design ionic COFs as a promising platform for gold selective recovery from actual e&#8208;waste.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study puts forth a novel&#160;terminal group&#160;design to&#160;develop&#160;medium&#8208;bandgap Y&#8208;series acceptors beyond conventional side&#8208;chain engineering.&#160;We focused on&#160;the strategical integration of an electron&#8208;donating methoxy group and an electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen atom&#160;at&#160;benzene&#8208;fused&#160;terminal groups.

         <title>High Mass Transfer Rate in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Achieved with Efficient Quasi&#8208;Gas Phase System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adhesion of H2 bubbles on the electrode surface is one of the main factors limiting the performance of H2 evolution of electrolytic water, especially at high current density. To overcome this problem, here a "quasi&#8208;gas phase" electrolytic water reaction system based on capillary effect is proposed for the first time to improve the mass transfer efficiency of H2. The typical feature of this reaction system is that the main site of H2 evolution reaction is transferred from the bulk aqueous solution to the gas phase environment above the bulk aqueous solution, thus effectively inhibiting the aggregation of H2 bubbles and reducing the resistance of their diffusion away. Electrochemical test results show that the proposed quasi&#8208;gas phase system can significantly reduce the potential required in H2 evolution reaction process at high current density compared with the conventional electrolytic reaction system. Specifically, the overpotential potential is reduced by 0.31 V when the H2 evolution current density of 250 mA cm&#8208;2 is achieved.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The adhesion of H2 bubbles on the electrode surface is one of the main factors limiting the performance of H2 evolution of electrolytic water, especially at high current density. To overcome this problem, here a "quasi-gas phase" electrolytic water reaction system based on capillary effect is proposed for the first time to improve the mass transfer efficiency of H2. The typical feature of this reaction system is that the main site of H2 evolution reaction is transferred from the bulk aqueous solution to the gas phase environment above the bulk aqueous solution, thus effectively inhibiting the aggregation of H2 bubbles and reducing the resistance of their diffusion away. Electrochemical test results show that the proposed quasi-gas phase system can significantly reduce the potential required in H2 evolution reaction process at high current density compared with the conventional electrolytic reaction system. Specifically, the overpotential potential is reduced by 0.31 V when the H2 evolution current density of 250 mA cm-2 is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Main&#8208;group element&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H activation remains experimentally challenging, and the development of clear concepts and design principles have been limited by the increased reactivity of relevant complexes, especially for the heavier elements. Herein, we report that the stibenium ion [(pyCDC)Sb][NTf2]3&#160;(1) (pyCDC = bis&#8208;pyridyl carbodicarbene; NTf2&#160;= bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) reacts with acetonitrile in the presence of the base 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#173;&#8208;butylpyridine to enable C(sp3)&#8211;H bond breaking to generate the stiba&#8208;methylene nitrile complex [(pyCDC)Sb(CH2CN)][NTf2]2&#160;(2). Kinetic analyses were performed to elucidate the rate dependence for all the substrates involved in the reaction. Computational studies suggest that C&#8211;H activation proceeds via a mechanism in which acetonitrile first coordinates to the Sb center through the nitrogen atom in a&#160;&#954;1&#160;fashion, thereby weakening the C&#8211;H bond which can then be deprotonated by base in solution. Further, we show that&#160;1&#160;reacts with terminal alkynes in the presence of 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#173;&#8208;butylpyridine to enable C(sp)&#8211;H bond breaking to form stiba&#8208;alkynyl adducts of the type [(pyCDC)Sb(CCR)][NTf2]2&#160;(3a&#8208;f). Compound&#160;1&#160;shows excellent specificity for the activation of the terminal C(sp)&#8211;H bond even across alkynes with diverse functionality. The resulting stiba&#8208;methylene nitrile and stiba&#8208;alkynyl adducts react with elemental iodine (I2) to produce iodoacetonitrile and iodoalkynes, while regenerating an Sb trication.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Luminophore Molecular Engineering for Rapidly Phototunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Smart materials enabling emission intensity or wavelength tuning by light stimulus attract attention in numerous cutting&#8208;edge fields. However, due to the generally dense molecular stacking against photoresponsivity in solid states, especially in crystals, developing rapidly phototunable solid&#8208;state luminescent systems remains challenging. Herein, we propose a new luminophore that serves as both a photoresponsive unit and a luminescent group, while possessing enhanced conformational freedom to provide a solution. Namely, photoexcitation&#8208;induced molecular conformational change of an ionized persulfurated arene based on weak intermolecular aliphatic C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction was employed. On these basis, rapidly enhanced phosphorescence upon irradiation can be observed in a series of phase states, like solution state, crystal, and amorphous state, especially with a high photoresponsive rate of 0.033 s&#8208;1 in crystal state that is superior to the relevant reported cases. Moreover, a rapidly phototunable afterglow effect is achieved by extending this molecule into some polymer&#8208;based doping systems, endowing the system with unique dynamic imaging and fast photopatterning capabilities. Such a single&#8208;luminophore molecular engineering and the underlying mechanism have implications for building different condensed functional materials, principally for those with stimuli responses in solid states.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Phosphorus on Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis for Ruthenium Phosphides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaline HOR performance of ruthenium&#8208;based phosphides were explored to investigate the catalytic role of phosphorus. P&#8208;species induced orbital overlap and d&#8208;band structure regulation would optimally enhance the hydroxyl binding energy under moderate P&#8208;content, which increase the proportion of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water with improved connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond network and subsequently boost the HOR kinetics.







Abstract
Transition metal/p&#8208;block compounds are regarded as the most essential materials for electrochemical energy converting systems involving various electrocatalysis. Understanding the role of p&#8208;block element on the interaction of key intermediates and interfacial water molecule orientation at the polarized catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface during the electrocatalysis is important for rational designing advanced p&#8208;block modified metal electrocatalysts. Herein, taking a sequence of ruthenium phosphides (including Ru2P, RuP and RuP2) as model catalysts, we establish a volcanic&#8208;relation between P&#8208;proportion and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity. The dominant role of P for regulating hydroxyl binding energy is validated by active sites poisoning experiments, pH&#8208;dependent infection&#8208;point behavior, in situ surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, in which P could tailor the d&#8208;band structure of Ru, optimize the hydroxyl adsorption sites across the Ru&#8722;P moieties, thereby leading to improved proportion of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water and facilitated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process, which are responsible for the enhanced alkaline HOR performance.

         <title>Integrating Multipolar Structures and Carboxyl Groups in sp2&#8208;Carbon Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fully conjugated sp2&#8208;c covalent organic framework integrated with multipolar structures and enrichment sites have been prepared for overall photosynthesis of H2O2. Benefiting from optimal multipolar structures and functional sites, TACOF&#8208;1&#8208;COOH facilitated charge transfer and mass movement during the photocatalysis process, leading to highly efficient ORR performance with a H2O2 production rate of 3542&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The direct production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through photocatalytic reaction via H2O and O2 is considered as an ideal approach. However, the efficiency of H2O2 generation is generally limited by insufficient charge and mass transfer. Covalent organic framework (COFs) offer a promising platform as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for H2O2 production due to their potential for rational design at the molecular level. Herein, we integrated the multipolar structures and carboxyl groups into COFs to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production in pure water without any sacrificial agents. The introduction of octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with an increase of molecular planarity, created efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites. Meanwhile, carboxyl groups could not only boost O2 and H2O2 movement via enhancement of pore hydrophilicity, but also promote proton conduction, enabling the conversion to H2O2 from &#8901;O2&#8722;, which is the crucial intermediate product in H2O2 photocatalysis. Overall, we demonstrate that TACOF&#8208;1&#8208;COOH, consisting of optimal octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with enrichment sites (carboxyl groups), exhibited a H2O2 yield rate of 3542&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722; 1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (SCC) efficiency of 0.55&#8201;%. This work provides valuable insights for designing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for efficient H2O2 production.

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substituting the A&#8208;site ions of two&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, we prepared two perovskites with different dielectric constants. Compared with (PEA)2PbBr4, (EOA)2PbBr4 has a larger dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]4&#8722; layers, exhibiting a small excitonic binding energy than (PEA)2PbBr4, which promotes the charge transfer and separation.

Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non&#8208;overlapping, which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03&#8197;meV) of (C2H7NO)2PbBr4 ((EOA)2PbBr4) than (C8H11N)2PbBr4 ((PEA)2PbBr4 (156.07&#8197;meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)2PbBr4 are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)2PbBr4 favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)2PbBr4 and (EOA)2PbBr4 in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Enhancing Anion&#8208;Selective Catalysis for Stable Lithium Metal Pouch Cells through Charge Separated COF Interlayer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective catalysis anionic decomposition strategy for Li metal anode is reported by charge&#8208;separated TP&#8208;COF. The strong adsorption between TP&#8208;COF and FSI&#8722; lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of FSI&#8722;, accelerating the decomposition of FSI&#8722; and generating a stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries were achieved under realistic conditions.







Abstract
Regulating the composition of solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (SEI) is the key to construct high&#8208;energy density lithium metal batteries. Here we report a selective catalysis anionic decomposition strategy to achieve a lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich SEI for stable lithium metal batteries. To accomplish this, the tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl) amine&#8208;pyromeletic dianhydride covalent organic frameworks (TP&#8208;COF) was adopted as an interlayer on lithium metal anode. The strong donor&#8208;acceptor unit structure of TP&#8208;COF induces local charge separation, resulting in electron depletion and thus boosting its affinity to FSI&#8722;. The strong interaction between TP&#8208;COF and FSI&#8722; lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of FSI&#8722;, accelerating the decomposition of FSI&#8722; and generating a stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI. This feature facilitates rapid Li+ transfer and suppresses dendritic Li growth. Notably, we demonstrate a 6.5&#8197;Ah LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2|TP&#8208;COF@Li pouch cell with high energy density (473.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability (97.4&#8201;%, 95&#8197;cycles) under lean electrolyte 1.39&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, high areal capacity 5.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and high current density 2.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our selective catalysis strategy opens a promising avenue toward the practical applications of high energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating delayed fluorescence from heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under ambient conditions is arduous. Here, we show triplet harvesting via delayed fluorescence in air using a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy forming a rigid host&#8211;guest structure in solution.







Abstract
Harvesting triplet excitons of heavy atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under aerated conditions is challenging due to the quenching of long&#8208;lived triplet states by molecular oxygen and vibrational dissipation. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach of triplet harvesting via mitigating quenching pathways of a triplet harvester. Specifically, we used a host&#8211;guest system based on 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;derived cyclophane (NBICy) and carbazole derivative (EtCz). Complexation studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis showed the formation of a rigid host&#8211;guest complex (K&#8776;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CCl4), resulting in triplet&#8208;exciton stabilization under aerated conditions via mitigating vibrational interference and oxygen quenching. Photophysical studies elucidate the delayed fluorescence emission from the charge&#8208;transfer state (1CT) with a quantum yield (QY) of 6&#8211;8&#8201;% under ambient conditions which increased up to 36&#8201;% in an inert atmosphere.

         <title>Enabling Efficient Anchoring&#8208;Conversion Interface by Fabricating Double&#8208;Layer Functionalized Separator for Suppressing Shuttle Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel double&#8208;layer strategy to functionalize separators is proposed, where Co/CoN4 layer serves as adsorption&#8208;catalytic centers for high&#8208;order and low&#8208;order LiPSs, combined with 2D MXene layer that acts as the second barrier for additional leaked LiPSs, and thus a circulation interface of adsorption&#8208;conversion&#8208;reactivation of S species has been realized, effectively alleviating the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur/selenium batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LiSBs) with high energy density still face challenges on sluggish conversion kinetics, severe shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and low blocking feature of ordinary separators to LiPSs. To tackle these, a novel double&#8208;layer strategy to functionalize separators is proposed, which consists of Co with atomically dispersed CoN4 decorated on Ketjen black (Co/CoN4@KB) layer and an ultrathin 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene layer. The theoretical calculations and experimental results jointly demonstrate metallic Co sites provide efficient adsorption and catalytic capability for long&#8208;chain LiPSs, while CoN4 active sites facilitate the absorption of short&#8208;chain LiPSs and promote the conversion to Li2S. The stacking MXene layer serves as a microscopic barrier to further physically block and chemically anchor the leaked LiPSs from the pores and gaps of the Co/CoN4@KB layer, thus preserving LiPSs within efficient anchoring&#8208;conversion reaction interfaces to balance the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8197;S&#8221; and Li2S. Consequently, with an ultralight loading of Co/CoN4@KB&#8208;MXene, the LiSBs exhibit amazing electrochemical performance even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte, and the outperforming performance for lithium&#8208;selenium batteries (LiSeBs) can also be achieved. This work exploits a universal and effective strategy of a double&#8208;layer functionalized separator to regulate the equilibrium adsorption&#8208;catalytic interface, enabling high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycle LiSBs/LiSeBs.

Abstract
2&#8208;Bromo&#8208;1&#8208;(3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one (RRx&#8208;001) is a hypoxic cell chemotherapeutics with already demonstrated synergism in combined chemo&#8208;radiation therapy. The interaction of the compound with secondary low&#8208;energy electrons formed in large amounts during the physico&#8208;chemical phase of the irradiation may lead to these synergistic effects. The present study focuses on the first step of RRx&#8208;001 interaction with low&#8208;energy electrons in which a transient anion is formed and fragmented. Combination of two experiments allows us to disentangle the decay of the RRx&#8208;001 anion on different timescales. Sole presence of the electron initiates rapid dissociation of NO2 and HNO2 neutrals while NO2&#8722; and Br&#8722; anions are produced both directly and via intermediate complexes. Based on our quantum chemical calculations, we propose that bidirectional state switching between &#960;*(NO2) and &#963;*(C&#8722;Br) states explains the experimental spectra. The fast dynamics monitored will impact the condensed phase chemistry of the anion as well.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Axial Biaryls by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Using Engineered Imine Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) was developed. This DKR approach features a transient aza&#8208;acetal bridge&#8208;promoted racemization followed by an engineered imine reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reduction to generate the axial chirality, providing various biaryls in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er).







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl compounds are ubiquitous scaffolds in natural products, bioactive molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts, but biocatalytic methods for their asymmetric synthesis are limited. Herein, we report a highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). This DKR approach features a transient six&#8208;membered aza&#8208;acetal&#8208;bridge&#8208;promoted racemization followed by an imine reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reduction to construct the axial chirality under ambient conditions. Directed evolution of an IRED from Streptomyces sp. GF3546 provided a variant (S&#8208;IRED&#8208;Ss&#8208;M11) capable of catalyzing the DKR process to access a variety of biaryl aminoalcohols in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio). Molecular dynamics simulation studies on the S&#8208;IRED&#8208;Ss&#8208;M11 variant revealed the origin of its improved activity and atroposelectivity. By exploiting the substrate promiscuity of IREDs and the power of directed evolution, our work further extends the biocatalysts&#8217; toolbox to construct challenging axially chiral molecules.

         <title>Insulator&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Degradation of Pyrochlore Ruthenates in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution and Stabilization through Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulator&#8208;transition companied with lattice contraction induces the degradation of pyrochlore ruthenates (Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. With Ir substitution, the adjustment of electron configuration in newly formed [RuO6]&#8208;[IrO6] suppresses the interior and surface reconstruction of pyrochlores, thus endowing Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; with superior stability during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;based pyrochlores (e.g., Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) are promised to replace IrO2 in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. It is significant to reveal the cliff attenuation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these pyrochlores. In this work, we monitor the structure changes and electrochemical behavior of Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; over the OER process, and it is found that the reason of decisive OER inactivation is derived from an insulator transition occurred within Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; due to its inner &#8220;perfecting&#8221; lattice induced by continuous atom rearrangement. Therefore, a stabilization strategy of the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; is proposed to alleviate this undesirable behavior. The double&#8208;exchange interaction between Ru and Ir in [RuO6] and [IrO6] octahedra leads the charge redistribution with simultaneous spin configuration adjustment. The electronic state in newly formed octahedrons centered with Ru 4d3 (with the state of eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8593;a1g&#8593; eg0) and Ir 5d6 (eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8595;&#8593;&#8595;a1g&#8593;&#8595; eg0) relieves the uneven electron distributions in [RuO6] orbital. The attenuated Jahn&#8211;Teller effect alleviates atom rearrangement, represented as the mitigation of insulator transition, surface reconstruction, and metal dissolution. As results, the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; presents the greatly improved OER stability and PEM durability. This study unveils the OER degradation mechanism and stabilization strategy for material design of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts for electrochemical applications.

         <title>Modulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States of Multiple Resonance Emitters via Intramolecular Covalent Bond Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular Scholl reaction of two adjacent 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in an oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole forms a multiple resonance (MR) emitter m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz with a [1,4]&#8208;diazocine&#8208;embedded core. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer excited state of the MR emitter is modulated by intramolecular covalent bond locking, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of the organic electroluminescent material.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high efficiency and color purity have emerged as a research focus in the development of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we disclose an approach to modulate the charge&#8208;transfer excited states of MR emitters via intramolecular covalent bond locking. This strategy can promote the evolution of strong intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) states into weak ICT states, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of emitters. To modulate the ICT intensity, two octagonal rings are introduced to yield molecule m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz. Compounds m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit bright light&#8208;green and green fluorescence in toluene, with emission maxima of 504 and 513&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of 28 and 34&#8197;nm, respectively. Sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing emitters m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit green emission with peaks of 508 and 520&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.12, 0.65) and (0.19, 0.69), and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.2&#8201;% and 32.6&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Driven Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction to C2H4 on Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Copper Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suface plasmon&#8208;driven highly selective CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 has been realized on ionic liquid&#8208;mediated Cu nanowires. The addition of ionic liquid modulates the local electronic structure of Cu, which brings about electron&#8208;rich surface sites that stabilize the *CO intermediate and significantly reduce the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process, thereby leading to C2H4 product with high selectivity.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction to value&#8208;added multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) feedstocks, such as C2H4, holds great promise in direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion for a carbon&#8208;neutral future. Nevertheless, the performance is largely inhibited by the high energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process, thereby leading to C2+ products with low selectivity. Here we report that through facile surface immobilization of a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM&#8208;BF4) ionic liquid, plasmonic Cu nanowires could enable highly selective CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 product. At an optimal condition, the resultant plasmonic photocatalyst exhibits C2H4 production with selectivity up to 96.7&#8201;% under 450&#8197;nm monochromatic light irradiation, greatly surpassing its pristine Cu counterpart. Combined in situ spectroscopies and computational calculations unravel that the addition of EMIM&#8208;BF4 ionic liquid modulates the local electronic structure of Cu, resulting in its enhanced adsorption strength of *CO intermediate and significantly reduced energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process. This work paves new path for Cu surface plasmons in selective artificial photosynthesis to targeted products.

         <title>Rapid Aminations of Functionalized Aryl Fluorosulfates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminations of aryl fluorosulfates, an alternative non&#8208;PFAS pseudohalide, using a novel Pd oxidative addition complex, has been demonstrated. This complex substitutes PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, operates efficiently under aqueous micellar conditions, and is compatible with diverse coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, under mild and environmentally benign conditions.







Abstract
Aryl fluorosulfates of varying complexities have been used in amination reactions in water using a new Pd oxidative addition complex (OAC&#8208;1) developed specifically to match the needs of the fine chemicals industry, not only in terms of functional group tolerance, but also reflecting time considerations associated with these important C&#8722;N couplings. Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X&#8208;ray structure of the crystals with &#960;&#8208;complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X&#8208;ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and t&#8208;butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.

         <title>Benign and Selective Amination of Lignins towards Aromatic Biobased Building Blocks with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research article presents two new benign methodologies to access reactive and soluble lignin&#8208;based polyamines. The aminated lignin products have potential as renewable building blocks in aromatic polymeric materials or as potential chelating, antibacterial agents, for instance.







Abstract
Lignin is a widely available second&#8208;generation biopolymer and the main potential source of renewable aromatic building blocks. Lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential in applications based on chemical and materials sciences. However, common aminations techniques for lignin usually involve toxic chemicals and generate hindered and low reactivity amines.
In this study, we developed two new, simple, and benign 2&#8208;step methodologies for the elaboration of lignin&#8208;based polyamines from different technical lignins (kraft, soda and organosolv) with a selectivity towards reactive primary amines. These methods involve grafting amide groups onto lignin followed by a hydrolysis step. Non&#8208;toxic heterocyclic compounds N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline were used as amidation agents. Hydrolysis was performed in acetone&#8208;water mixtures. Reactions were studied on model compounds and optimized on lignins. Aminated lignins were fully characterized and primary amines were quantified using quantitative 19F&#8197;NMR.
Our methods generated aminated lignins with low apparent molar masses and high solubility in water and solvents. Nitrogen contents of the products ranged between 2.0 and 3.5&#8197;mmol/g with reactive primary amines counts up to 1.7&#8197;mmol/g. These soluble and reactive lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential as a replacement for fossil&#8208;based polyamines in e.g., the synthesis of aromatic polymer materials or as potential chelating, antibacterial agents.

         <title>Formate&#8208;Mediated Electroenzymatic Synthesis via Biological Cofactor NADH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroenzyme&#8208;coupled system has been constructed for continuous biosynthesis of valuable chemicals with high production rates and turnover frequencies. In the system, formate is obtained from electroreduction of CO2 with good faradic efficiency at high current density and utilized for NADH regeneration with high selectivity. As a temporary energy carrier, formate ensures efficient energy transfer from electricity to chemical production.







Abstract
Synthetic biohybrid systems by coupling artificial system with nature's machinery may offer a disruptive solution to address the global energy crisis. We developed a versatile electroenzymatic pathway for the continuous synthesis of valuable chemicals, facilitated by formate&#8208;driven NADH regeneration. Utilizing a bismuth electrocatalyst, we achieved stable CO2 reduction to formate with approximately 90&#8201;% Faraday efficiency at a current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The generated formate acts as a mediator to regenerate NADH, which is then coupled with immobilized redox enzymes&#8212;alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), L&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and L&#8208;glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)&#8212;to produce targeted chemicals at significant rates and exceptionally high turnover numbers (1.8&#215;106 to 3.1&#215;106). These achievements not only underscore the efficiency of the system but also its practical applicability in industrial settings. By leveraging in situ generated formate, this innovative approach demonstrates the potential of integrating electrocatalysis with enzymatic reactions for sustainable and efficient chemical production on a practical scale.

         <title>Chelator&#8208;Assisted Precipitation&#8208;Based Separation of the Rare Earth Elements Neodymium and Dysprosium from Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Using a novel chelator, G&#8208;macropa, a highly efficient and environmentally friendly precipitation&#8208;based rare earth element separation approach is achieved. @JWilsonLab







Abstract
The rare earth elements (REEs) are critical resources for many clean energy technologies, but are difficult to obtain in their elementally pure forms because of their nearly identical chemical properties. Here, an analogue of macropa, G&#8208;macropa, was synthesized and employed for an aqueous precipitation&#8208;based separation of Nd3+ and Dy3+. G&#8208;macropa maintains the same thermodynamic preference for the large REEs as macropa, but shows smaller thermodynamic stability constants. Molecular dynamics studies demonstrate that the binding affinity differences of these chelators for Nd3+ and Dy3+ is a consequence of the presence or absence of an inner&#8208;sphere water molecule, which alters the donor strength of the macrocyclic ethers. Leveraging the small REE affinity of G&#8208;macropa, we demonstrate that within aqueous solutions of Nd3+, Dy3+, and G&#8208;macropa, the addition of HCO3&#8722; selectively precipitates Dy2(CO3)3, leaving the Nd3+&#8722;G&#8208;macropa complex in solution. With this method, remarkably high separation factors of 841 and 741 are achieved for 50&#8201;:&#8201;50 and 75&#8201;:&#8201;25 mixtures. Further studies involving Nd3+:Dy3+ ratios of 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 in authentic magnet waste also afford an efficient separation as well. Lastly, G&#8208;macropa is recovered via crystallization with HCl and used for subsequent extractions, demonstrating its good recyclability.

Leveraging the small REE affinity of G-macropa, we demonstrate that within aqueous solutions of Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and G-macropa, the addition of HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; selectively precipitates Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, leaving the Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;G-macropa complex in solution. With this method, remarkably high separation factors of 841 and 741 are achieved for 50&#8201;:&#8201;50 and 75&#8201;:&#8201;25 mixtures. Further studies involving Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;:Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ratios of 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 in authentic magnet waste also afford an efficient separation as well. Lastly, G-macropa is recovered via crystallization with HCl and used for subsequent extractions, demonstrating its good recyclability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Tough Slide&#8208;Crosslinked Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) was meticulously designed and prepared for lithium metal batteries. The incorporation of the slide&#8208;ring structure endows SCGPE with excellent toughness and superior electrochemical properties. This structure provides fast Li+ ion transport pathways while restricting the mobility of TFSI&#8722; anions, thereby promoting uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) hold great promise for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. However, conventional GPEs hardly resists lithium dendrites growth and maintains long&#8208;term cycling stability of the battery due to its poor mechanical performance. Inspired by the slide&#8208;ring structure of polyrotaxanes (PRs), herein we developed a dynamic slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) with extraordinary stretchability of 970.93&#8201;% and mechanical strength of 1.15&#8197;MPa, which is helpful to buffer the volume change of electrodes and maintain mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling. Notably, the PRs structures can provide fast ion transport channels to obtain high ionic conductivity of 1.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the strong polar groups in SCGPE restrict the free movement of anions to achieve high lithium&#8208;ion transference number of 0.71, which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Benefiting from these features, the constructed Li|SCGPE&#8208;3|LFP cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long and stable cycle life over 1000 cycles and high&#8208;capacity retention (89.6&#8201;% after 1000 cycles). Even at a high rate of 16&#8197;C, the cells deliver a high capacity of 79.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The slide&#8208;crosslinking strategy in this work provides a new perspective on the design of advanced GPEs for LMBs.

         <title>Covalent Triazine Based Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Structures for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;component covalent triazine framework denoted as 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF) with fine&#8208;tuned donor&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor interaction is demonstrated to establish a rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport channel and induce uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The appearance of disordered lithium dendrites and fragile solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) significantly hinder the serviceability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, guided by theoretical predictions, a multi&#8208;component covalent triazine framework with partially electronegative channels (4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF) is incorporated as a protective layer to modulate the interface stability of the lithium metal batteries. Notably, the 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF with optimized electronic structure at the molecular level by fine&#8208;tuning the local acceptor&#8208;donor functionalities not only enhances the intermolecular interaction thereby providing larger dipole moment and improved crystallinity and mechanical stress, but also facilitates the beneficial effect of lithiophilic sites (C&#8722;F bonds, triazine cores, C=N linkages and aromatic rings) to further regulate the migration of Li+ and achieve a uniform lithium deposition behavior as determined by various in&#8208;depth in/ex situ characterizations. Due to the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;component organic functionalities, the 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF modified full cells perform significantly better than the common two/three&#8208;component 2C&#8208;TA&#8208;CTF and 3C&#8208;TF&#8208;CTF electrodes, delivering an excellent capacity of 116.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (capacity retention ratio: 86.8&#8201;%) after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C and improved rate capability. This work lays a platform for the prospective molecular design of improved organic framework relative artificial SEI for highly stable lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Styrenes Installing a Terminal NH2 Group Alongside Unprotected Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes is described that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles at the internal position, including primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and an ammonia surrogate. Two complementary set of conditions allow embedding both electronically activated and deactivated styrenes bearing diverse functional groups.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Diamination of alkenes represents an attractive way to generate differentiated vicinal diamines, which are prevalent motifs in biologically active compounds and catalysts. However, existing methods are usually limited in scope and produce diamines where one or both nitrogens are protected, adding synthetic steps for deprotection and further N&#8208;functionalization to reach a desired target. Furthermore, the range of amino groups that can be introduced at the internal position is fairly limited. Here we describe a 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles (primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and ammonia surrogate) at the internal position. Two complementary sets of conditions encompass electronically activated and deactivated styrenes with diverse substitution patterns and functional groups. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to the 1,2&#8208;aminothiolation of styrenes.

Fluorescent probe for discovering the critical roles of CYP2D6 in natural systems: A fluorescent probe for CYP2D6 is designed using a tailored molecular strategy. The probe quantitatively detects and images CYP2D6 activity in various living systems, thereby providing a robust tool for exploration of the biological functions of CYP2D6 in the pathogenesis of diseases and detailed investigation of CYP2D6&#8208;induced MBI.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme that mediates the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous substances in humans. However, its biological role in drug&#8208;drug interactions especially mechanism&#8208;based inactivation (MBI), and various diseases remains poorly understood, owing to the lack of molecular tools suitable for selectively monitoring CYP2D6 in complex biological systems. Herein, using a tailored molecular strategy, we developed a fluorescent probe BDPM for CYP2D6. BDPM exhibits excellent specificity and imaging capability for CYP2D6, making it suitable for the real&#8208;time monitoring of endogenous CYP2D6 activity in living bio&#8208;samples. Therefore, our tailored strategy proved useful for constructing the highly selective and enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes. BDPM as a molecular tool to explore the critical roles of CYP2D6 in the pathogenesis of diseases, high&#8208;throughput screening of inhibitors and intensive investigation of CYP2D6&#8208;induced MBI in natural systems.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks&#8208;based Electrolytes with Controllable Hydrogen Bonding Networks for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A HOF&#8208;based novel solid&#8208;state electrolyte was constructed by taking advantage of the abundant multisite hydrogen bonding and stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in HOF&#8208;DAT. Benefiting from the abundant C=O groups in the HOF backbone as ion hopping sites and the flexible hydrogen bonding skeleton of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs, a fast Li+ ion conductivity (2.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a high Li+ transference number (0.88), and a wide electrochemical window of 5.05&#8197;V were achieved.







Abstract
The lack of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high&#8208;ionic conductivity and the rational design of electrode/electrolyte interfaces remains challenging for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here, for the first time, a high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) battery is developed based on the Li&#8208;ion&#8208;conducted hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (LHOF) electrolyte and the HOF&#8208;DAT@CNT composite cathode. Benefiting from the abundant dynamic hydrogen bonding network in the backbone of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs, fast Li+ ion transport (2.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a high Li+ transference number (0.88), and a wide electrochemical window of 5.05&#8197;V are achieved. Symmetric batteries constructed with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs exhibit a stably cycled duration of over 1400&#8197;h with uniform deposition, which mainly stems from the jumping sites that promote a uniformly high rate of Li+ flux and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network structure that can relieve the structural changes during Li+ transport. LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs&#8208;based Li&#8722;O2 batteries exhibit high specific capacity (10335&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and stable cycling life up to 150 cycles. Moreover, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs endow good rate capability (129.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (210 cycles). The design of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs opens an avenue for the development of novel SSEs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Vaporchromic Domino Transformation and Polarized Photonic Heterojunctions of Organoplatinum Microrods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex has been assembled into crystalline microrods by strong intermolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction. CH2Cl2&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered domino transformation or patterned&#8208;mask&#8208;assisted vapor treatment transforms these microrods into multiblock polarized photonic heterojunctions with alternate yellow/red phosphorescence and orthogonal polarization directions, as a result of the vaporchromic switching of crystal packing and excited&#8208;state properties.







Abstract
Photonic heterostructures with codable properties have shown great values as versatile information carriers at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale. These heterostructures are typically prepared by a step&#8208;by&#8208;step growth or post&#8208;functionalization method to achieve varied emission colors with different building blocks. In order to realize high&#8208;throughput and multivariate information loading, we report here a strategy to integrate polarization signals into photonic heterojunctions. A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex has been assembled into highly polarized yellow&#8208;phosphorescent crystalline microrods (Y&#8208;rod) by strong intermolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction. Upon end&#8208;initiated desorption of the incorporated CH2Cl2 solvents, the Y&#8208;rod is transformed in a domino fashion into tri&#8208;block polarized photonic heterojunctions (PPHs) with alternate red&#8208;yellow&#8208;red emissions or red&#8208;phosphorescent microrods (R&#8208;rods). The red emissions of these structures are also highly polarized; however, their polarization directions are just orthogonal to those of the yellow phosphorescence of the Y&#8208;rod. With the aid of a patterned mask, the R&#8208;rod can be further programmed into multi&#8208;block PPHs with precisely controlled block sizes by side&#8208;allowed adsorption of CH2Cl2 vapor. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that the solvent&#8208;regulated modulation of the crystal packing and excited&#8208;state property is critical for the construction of these PPHs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Chemical Self&#8208;Rechargeable Zinc Ion Batteries with High Charging and Discharging Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;charging zinc ion battery system for the first time, the photo&#8208;assisted process during chemical self&#8208;charging promotes the transfer of electrons from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction, and enables it to exhibit excellent performance, providing a new strategy for zinc ion battery in energy storage.







Abstract
Chemical self&#8208;recharging zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), which are capable of auto&#8208;recharging in ambient air, are promising in self&#8208;powered battery systems. Nevertheless, the exclusive reliance on chemical energy from oxygen for ZIBs charging often would bring some obstacles in charging efficiency. Herein, we develop photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging aqueous ZIBs with a heterojunction of MoS2/SnO2 cathode, which are favorable to enhancing both the charging and discharging efficiency as well as the chemical self&#8208;charging capabilities under illumination. The photo&#8208;assisted process promotes the electron transfer from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction during chemical self&#8208;charging. Furthermore, the electrons within the MoS2/SnO2 cathode exhibit a low transfer impedance under illumination, which is beneficial to reducing the migration barrier of Zn2+ within the cathode and thereby facilitating the uniform inserting of Zn2+ into MoS2/SnO2 cathode during discharging. This photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging mechanism enables ZIBs to attain a maximum self&#8208;charging potential of 0.95&#8197;V within 3&#8197;hours, a considerable self&#8208;charging capacity of 202.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling performance in a self&#8208;charging mode. This work not only provides a route for optimizing chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage, but also broadens the potential application of aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Enantiodivergent Construction of P(V)&#8208;Stereogenic Molecules via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Prochiral N&#8208;Aryl Phosphonamides with Aromatic Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for enantiodivergent accessing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules via palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis was established. The enantioselectivity of this protocol was tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing both enantiomers of the P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules using a single chiral norbornene catalyst.







Abstract
In this work, we describe an efficient and modular method for enantiodivergent accessing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules by utilizing the catalytic atroposelective Catellani&#8208;type C&#8722;H arylation/desymmetric intramolecular N&#8208;arylation cascade reaction. The enantioselectivity of this protocol was proved to be tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing a wide range of both chiral P(V)&#8208;stereogenic enantiomers in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantiomeric excesses. Noteworthy is that the strategy developed herein represents an unprecedented example of solvent&#8208;dictated inversion of the enantioselectivity of P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks for Robust Light Harvesting and Efficient Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes afforded covalently waved 2D lattices and crystalline &#960; layers. The helicene frameworks are highly red emissive, enable intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;state energy transfer, and facilitate intermolecular triplet state energy transfer to convert molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species, thereby offering a method for the design of helicene materials for light&#8208;harvesting and photoenergy applications.







Abstract
Helicenes represent a class of fascinating &#960; compounds with fused yet folded backbones. Despite their broad structural diversity, harnessing helicenes to develop well&#8208;defined materials is still a formidable challenge. Here we report the synthesis of crystalline porous helicene materials by exploring helicenes to synthesize covalent 2D lattices and layered &#960; frameworks. Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene&#8208;porphyrin alignment along the x and y directions at a 1.5&#8208;nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti&#8208;AA stack along the z direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields. The [6]helicene frameworks trigger effieicnt intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet state energy transfer from [6]helicene to porphyrin and facilitate intermolecular triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state energy transfer from frameworks to molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, harvesting a wide range of photons from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions for light emitting and photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. This study introduces a new family of extended frameworks, laying the groundwork for exploring well&#8208;defined helicene materials with unprecedented structures and functions.

The helicene frameworks are highly red emissive, enable intra-framework singlet-state energy transfer, and facilitate intermolecular triplet state energy transfer to convert molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species, thereby offering a method for the design of helicene materials for light-harvesting and photoenergy applications.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Cu Penetration Electrode Boosts Asymmetric C&#8722;C Coupling for Ampere&#8208;Level CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ Reduction in Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
Tensile&#8208;strained copper hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (Cu HPE) enhances the asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of multicarbon (C2+) products. A faradaic efficiency of 84.5&#8201;% and a partial current density as high as 3.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products, alongside a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 81.5&#8201;% and stable electrolysis for 240&#8197;h were demonstrated in a strong acidic electrolyte (pH=1).







Abstract
The synthesis of multicarbon (C2+) products remains a substantial challenge in sustainable CO2 electroreduction owing to the need for sufficient current density and faradaic efficiency alongside carbon efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate ampere&#8208;level high&#8208;efficiency CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products in both neutral and strongly acidic (pH=1) electrolytes using a hierarchical Cu hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE). High concentration of K+ could concurrently suppress hydrogen evolution reaction and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling, thereby promoting C2+ production in strong acid. By optimizing the K+ and H+ concentration and CO2 flow rate, a faradaic efficiency of 84.5&#8201;% and a partial current density as high as 3.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products, alongside a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 81.5&#8201;% and stable electrolysis for 240&#8197;h were demonstrated in a strong acidic solution of H2SO4 and KCl (pH=1). Experimental measurements and density functional theory simulations suggested that tensile&#8208;strained Cu HPE enhances the asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of C2+ products.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Rechargeable LiFePO4/Graphite Batteries from &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C</title>

All&#8208;climate batteries from &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C: A wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film&#8208;forming ability is proposed. The proposed electrolyte significantly alleviates the Li plating and interfacial degradation of LiFePO4 (LFP)/graphite cells at ultralow temperatures. The LFP/graphite cells exhibit an ultra&#8208;wide operating&#8208;temperature range of &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C and outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability.







Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/graphite batteries have long dominated the energy storage battery market and are anticipated to become the dominant technology in the global power battery market. However, the poor fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance of LFP/graphite batteries seriously hinder their further spread. These limitations are strongly associated with the interfacial lithium (Li)&#8208;ion transport. Here we report a wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range ester&#8208;based electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film&#8208;forming ability by regulating the anion chemistry of Li salt. The interfacial barrier of the battery is quantitatively unraveled by employing three&#8208;electrode system and distribution of relaxation time technique. The superior role of the proposed electrolyte in preventing Li0 plating and sustaining homogeneous and stable interphases are also systematically investigated. The LFP/graphite cells exhibit rechargeability in an ultrawide temperature range of &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C and outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability without compromising lifespan. Specially, the practical LFP/graphite pouch cells achieve 80.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 1200&#8197;cycles (2&#8197;C) and 10&#8208;min charge to 89&#8201;% (5&#8197;C) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and provide reliable power even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Steam&#8208;Assisted Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol over Ru&#8722;In Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/In2O3&#8208;ZrO2 was found to be active for ethanol production from CO2 hydrogenation, but ethanol productivity decreased substantially after several hours of reaction due to the excessive reduction of In species. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8722;In2O3 interface sites were stabilized, and ethanol could be produced with superior overall selectivity (70&#8201;%, rest CO).







Abstract
Multicomponent catalysts can be designed to synergistically combine reaction intermediates at interfacial active sites, but restructuring makes systematic control and understanding of such dynamics challenging. We here unveil how reducibility and mobility of indium oxide species in Ru&#8208;based catalysts crucially control the direct, selective conversion of CO2 to ethanol. When uncontrolled, reduced indium oxide species occupy the Ru surface, leading to deactivation. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8722;In2O3 interface sites are stabilized, and ethanol can be produced with superior overall selectivity (70&#8201;%, rest CO). Our work highlights how engineering of bifunctional active ensembles enables cooperativity and synergy at tailored interfaces, which unlocks unprecedented performance in heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Unlocking Reactivity of Fragments for Fast Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating photochemistry within kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) techniques, we significantly accelerated the identification of enzyme inhibitors, demonstrating the potential of KTGS for rapid discovery of bioactive ligands in medicinal chemistry. The chiral linkage gives rise to the formation of enantiomers, which were assessed via a highly stereocontrolled synthesis of both templated ligand enantiomers.







Abstract
We showcase the successful combination of photochemistry and kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) for rapidly pinpointing enzyme inhibitors. KTGS is a fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) methodology in which the biological target (BT) orchestrates the construction of its own ligand from fragments featuring complementary reactive functionalities. Notably, fragments interacting with the protein binding sites leverage their spatial proximity, facilitating a preferential reaction. Consequently, the resulting bivalent ligand exhibits heightened affinity. Within the realm of KTGS strategies, in situ click chemistry stands out as the most widely used to identify potent protein binders. This approach requires significant protein contributions, such as binding interactions and appropriate orientations of fragments, to overcome high activation barriers. This leads to prolonged incubation times and the potential for generating false negatives, thereby limiting this strategy to proteins that are stable enough in buffer. We herein unveil the possibility to integrate photochemistry into the realm of KTGS, accelerating the ligation reaction between fragments to a time scale of minutes. This approach should significantly expand the narrow reactivity window of traditional KTGS reactions, paving the way for the exploration and development of novel photo&#8208;KTGS reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We showcase the successful combination of photochemistry and kinetic target-guided synthesis (KTGS) for rapidly pinpointing enzyme inhibitors. KTGS is a fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) methodology in which the biological target (BT) orchestrates the construction of its own ligand from fragments featuring complementary reactive functionalities. Notably, fragments interacting with the protein binding sites leverage their spatial proximity, facilitating a preferential reaction. Consequently, the resulting bivalent ligand exhibits heightened affinity. Within the realm of KTGS strategies, in situ click chemistry stands out as the most widely used to identify potent protein binders. This approach requires significant protein contributions, such as binding interactions and appropriate orientations of fragments, to overcome high activation barriers. This leads to prolonged incubation times and the potential for generating false negatives, thereby limiting this strategy to proteins that are stable enough in buffer. We herein unveil the possibility to integrate photochemistry into the realm of KTGS, accelerating the ligation reaction between fragments to a time scale of minutes. This approach should significantly expand the narrow reactivity window of traditional KTGS reactions, paving the way for the exploration and development of novel photo-KTGS reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks Consisting of Tetraborate Nodes and Flexible Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraborate node has been shown to facilitate the formation of 3D ionic covalent organic frameworks with flexible linkers. Irreversible deprotonation acts as a kinetic control to achieve high polymerization, while the dynamic B&#8722;O bond aids error correction. This approach has been investigated with three organic monomers and two metal counterions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials with many applications, such as carbon capture, molecular separation, catalysis, and energy storage. Traditionally, flexible building blocks have been avoided due to their potential to disrupt ordered structures. Recent studies have demonstrated the intriguing properties and enhanced structural diversity achievable with flexible components by judicious selection of building blocks. This study presents a novel series of ionic COFs (ICOFs) consisting of tetraborate nodes and flexible linkers. These ICOFs use borohydrides to irreversibly deprotonate the alcohol monomers to achieve a high degree of polymerization. Structural analysis confirms the dia topologies. Reticulation is explored using various monomers and metal counterions. Also, these frameworks exhibit excellent stability in alcohols and coordinating solvents. The materials have been tested as single&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;state electrolytes. ICOF&#8208;203&#8208;Li displays one of the lowest activation energies reported for ion conduction. This tetraborate chemistry is anticipated to facilitate further structural diversity and functionality in crystalline polymers.

         <title>Interception and Synthetic Application of Diradical and Diene Forms of Dual&#8208;Nature Azabicyclic o&#8208;Quinodimethanes Generated by 6&#960;&#8208;Azaelectrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Alkenylarylimines have been shown to undergo 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization thermally to generate azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes. These o&#8208;quinodimethanes show dual nature as a cyclic diene and a benzylic diradical. The interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;quinodimethanes by H&#8208;atom transfer enabled the synthesis of five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids. The cyclic dienes were intercepted by [4+2] cycloaddition to generate bridgehead azabicycles.







Abstract
We demonstrate that 2&#8208;alkenylarylaldimines and ketimines undergo thermal 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization to generate a wide range of azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs). These o&#8208;QDMs exist as a hybrid of a diene and a benzylic diradical. The diradical nature was confirmed by their ability to undergo dimerization and react with H&#8208;atom donor, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and O2. In addition, the interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;QDMs by H&#8208;atom transfer was used to synthesize five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids and related bioactive molecules. The diene form can undergo [4+2] cycloaddition reactions with different dienophiles to generate bridged azabicycles in high endo:exo selectivity. The azabicyclic o&#8208;QDMs can be generated for [4+2] cycloaddition from a wide range of electronically and sterically varied 2&#8208;alkenylarylimines, including mono, di, tri and tetrasubstituted alkenes, and imines derived from arylamine, alkylamine (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;), benzylamine, benzylsulfonamide and Boc&#8208;amine.

         <title>Photocatalytic Multisite Functionalization of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes by Merging Polar Cycloaddition and Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is established by merging dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. This transformation was triggered by XAT followed by a cascade of 1,5&#8208;HAT and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer. With this method, a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.







Abstract
Although highly appealing for rapid access of molecular complexity, multi&#8208;functionalization of alkenes that allows incorporation of more than two functional groups remains a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy that merges dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, thus enabling a smooth 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes. A highly regioselective [3+2] cycloaddition anchors a reaction trigger onto alkene substrates. The subsequent halogen atom transfer (XAT) selectively initiates ring&#8208;opening process, which is followed by a series of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8208;HAT) and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer (FAT) events. With this method, site&#8208;selective introduction of three different functional groups is accomplished and a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.

         <title>Strong Enhancement in Cobalt(II)&#8208;TPMA Aqueous Hydrogen Photosynthesis through Intramolecular Proton Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of proton relays close to the catalytic metal center boosts hydrogen photosynthesis with cobalt(II) TPMA complexes leading to a 4&#8208;fold increase in quantum efficiency and up to a 22&#8208;fold gain in turnover number.







Abstract
Photosynthetic hydrogen generation by cobalt(II) tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) complexes is mainly limited by protonation kinetics and decomposition routes involving demetallation. In the present work we have explored the effects of both proton shuttles and improved rigidity on the catalytic ability of cobalt(II) TPMA complexes. Remarkably, we demonstrate that, while a small enhancement in the catalytic performance is attained in a rigid cage structure, the introduction of ammonium groups as proton transfer relays in close proximity to the cobalt center allows to reach a 4&#8208;fold increase in the quantum efficiency of H2 formation, and a surprising 22&#8208;fold gain in the maximum turnover number, at low catalyst concentration. The beneficial role of the ammonium relays in promoting faster intramolecular proton transfer to the reduced cobalt center is documented by transient absorption spectroscopy, showcasing the great relevance of tuning the catalyst periphery to achieve efficient catalysis of solar fuel formation.

         <title>Optimizing the Microenvironment in Solid Polymer Electrolytes by Anion Vacancy Coupled with Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D flower&#8208;like SnS2 composite with abundant sulfur vacancies is synthesized under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots, and it is employed as filler to optimize the microenvironment in solid polymer electrolytes. As a result, the constructed composite electrolyte not only exhibits high room temperature ionic conductivity and Li+ transference number but also demonstrates significantly improved mechanical properties, providing solid state lithium metal batteries with excellent cycling stability and extended cycle life.







Abstract
The practical application of solid polymer electrolyte is hindered by the small transference number of Li+, low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial stability, which are seriously determined by the microenvironment in polymer electrolyte. The introduction of functional fillers is an effective solution to these problems. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is demonstrated that the anion vacancy of filler can anchor anions of lithium salt, thereby significantly increasing the transference number of Li+ in the electrolyte. Therefore, flower&#8208;like SnS2&#8208;based filler with abundant sulfur vacancies is prepared under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots (CDs). It is worth mentioning that the CDs dotted on the surface of SnS2 have rich organic functional groups, which can serve as the bridging agent to enhance the compatibility of filler and polymer, leading to superior mechanical performance and fast ion transport pathway. Additionally, the in situ formed Li2S/Li3N at the interface of Li metal and electrolyte facilitate the fast Li+ diffusion and uniform Li deposition, effectively mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, the assembled lithium metal batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, reflecting the superiority of the carbon dots derived vacancy&#8208;rich inorganic filler modification strategy.

&lt;p&gt;3D flower-like SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composite with abundant sulfur vacancies is synthesized under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots, and it is employed as filler to optimize the microenvironment in solid polymer electrolytes. As a result, the constructed composite electrolyte not only exhibits high room temperature ionic conductivity and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number but also demonstrates significantly improved mechanical properties, providing solid state lithium metal batteries with excellent cycling stability and extended cycle life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical application of solid polymer electrolyte is hindered by the small transference number of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial stability, which are seriously determined by the microenvironment in polymer electrolyte. The introduction of functional fillers is an effective solution to these problems. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is demonstrated that the anion vacancy of filler can anchor anions of lithium salt, thereby significantly increasing the transference number of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the electrolyte. Therefore, flower-like SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based filler with abundant sulfur vacancies is prepared under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots (CDs). It is worth mentioning that the CDs dotted on the surface of SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have rich organic functional groups, which can serve as the bridging agent to enhance the compatibility of filler and polymer, leading to superior mechanical performance and fast ion transport pathway. Additionally, the in situ formed Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N at the interface of Li metal and electrolyte facilitate the fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and uniform Li deposition, effectively mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, the assembled lithium metal batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, reflecting the superiority of the carbon dots derived vacancy-rich inorganic filler modification strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning Algorithm Guides Catalyst Choices for Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carefully curated dataset of reactions catalyzed by magnesium&#8208;based catalysts underlies a Machine&#8208;Learning model guiding the choices of catalysts &#8220;optimal&#8221; for reactions unseen during training. When this model is tested by experiment, it suggests catalysts that yield higher ee values, replace rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal catalysts, or improve the efficiency of stereoselective transformations relevant to drug discovery.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;chemical literature encompasses large numbers of catalysts and reactions they can effect. Many of these examples are published merely to document the catalysts&#8217; scope but do not necessarily guarantee that a given catalyst is &#8220;optimal&#8221;&#8212;in terms of yield or enantiomeric excess&#8212;for a particular reaction. This paper describes a Machine Learning model that aims to improve such catalyst&#8208;reaction assignments based on the carefully curated literature data. As we show here for the case of asymmetric magnesium catalysis, this model achieves relatively high accuracy and offers out of&#8208;the&#8208;box predictions successfully validated by experiment, e.g., in synthetically demanding asymmetric reductions or Michael additions.

         <title>CdS Quantum Dot Gels as a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalyst for C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdS quantum dot gels are potent direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalysts for C&#8722;H bond activation, in which photoexcited CdS directly attracts a hydrogen atom from a C&#8722;H substrate to generate a neutral radical.







Abstract
Here, we report CdS quantum dot (QD) gels, a three&#8208;dimensional network of interconnected CdS QDs, as a new type of direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalyst for C&#8722;H activation. We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;&#8208;amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds. Its C&#8722;H activation ability imparts a broad substrate and reaction scope. The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8722;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d&#8208;HAT mechanism. This d&#8208;HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8722;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &#945;=0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Inducing Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death through Oxygen&#8208;Economized Photodynamic Therapy with Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two NO&#8208;releasing phthalocyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers have been prepared which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration through the NO released upon the interaction with the intracellular glutathione, sparing more oxygen for the photodynamic action. This oxygen&#8208;economized photodynamic therapy can also elicit the release of various damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, effectively triggering immunogenic cell death.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) for eradication of cancer cells. Its effectiveness is governed by the oxygen content, which is scarce in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We report herein two zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing moieties, namely ZnPc&#8208;2NO and ZnPc&#8208;4NO, which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration, thereby sparing more intracellular oxygen for PDT. Using HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and A549 human lung carcinoma cells, we have demonstrated that both conjugates release NO upon interaction with the intracellular glutathione, which can reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate and adenosine triphosphate generation and alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. They can also relieve the hypoxic status of cancer cells and decrease the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor protein HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Upon light irradiation, both conjugates can generate ROS and induce cytotoxicity even under a hypoxic condition, overcoming the oxygen&#8208;dependent nature of PDT. Interestingly, the photodynamic action of ZnPc&#8208;2NO elicits the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, inducing the maturation of dendritic cells and triggering an antitumor immune response. The immunogenic cell death caused by this oxygen&#8208;economized PDT has been demonstrated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Spinel Octahedral Sites via a &#960;&#8211;&#960; Type Orbital Coupling to Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in Co3O4 can be fine&#8208;regulated by a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling involving the CoOh t2g, O 2p, and Ce t2u orbital. Mechanism investigations reveal that&#160;a &#960;&#8208;donation interaction between the bridging O 2p and Ce fyz2 orbital effectively bolsters the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. The obtained electrocatalyst with the eg occupancy optimized to 1.094 presents an excellent water oxidation performance.







Abstract
Spin state is often regarded as the crucial valve to release the reactivity of energy&#8208;related catalysts, yet it is also challenging to precisely manipulate, especially for the active center ions occupied at the specific geometric sites. Herein, a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling of 3d (Co)&#8208;2p (O)&#8208;4f (Ce) was employed to regulate the spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in the composite of Co3O4/CeO2. More specifically, the equivalent high&#8208;spin ratio of CoOh can reach to 54.7&#8201;% via tuning the CeO2 content, thereby triggering the average eg filling (1.094) close to the theoretical optimum value. The corresponding catalyst exhibits a superior water oxidation performance with an overpotential of 251&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, rivaling most cobalt&#8208;based oxides state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; type coupling corroborated by the matched energy levels between Ce t1u/t2u&#8208;O and CoOh t2g&#8208;O &#960; type bond in the calculated crystal orbital Hamilton population and partial density of states profiles, stimulates a &#960;&#8208;donation between O 2p and &#960;&#8208;symmetric Ce 4fyz2 orbital, consequently facilitating the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. This work offers an in&#8208;depth insight into understanding the 4f and 3d orbital coupling for spin state optimization in composite oxides.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital, consequently facilitating the electrons hopping from t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; to e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbital of Co&lt;sub&gt;Oh&lt;/sub&gt;. This work offers an in-depth insight into understanding the 4f and 3d orbital coupling for spin state optimization in composite oxides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Fragment&#8208;Based Competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR Platform For Hotspot&#8208;Directed Ligand Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fragment screening identified three ligand binding hotspots across the active site of 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from Mycobacterium abscessus. Fragment sized fluorinated reporters were developed for each hotspot and used in competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR experiments to quantify hotspot&#8208;specific ligand binding affinities across three orders of magnitude, from low mM to low &#956;M.







Abstract
Ligand binding hotspots are regions of protein surfaces that form particularly favourable interactions with small molecule pharmacophores. Targeting interactions with these hotspots maximises the efficiency of ligand binding. Existing methods are capable of identifying hotspots but often lack assays to quantify ligand binding and direct elaboration at these sites. Herein, we describe a fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F Ligand Based&#8197;NMR (LB&#8208;NMR) screening platform that enables routine, quantitative ligand profiling focused at ligand&#8208;binding hotspots. As a proof of concept, the method was applied to 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) from Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs). X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterisation of the hits from a 960&#8208;member fragment screen identified three ligand&#8208;binding hotspots across the PPAT active site. From the fragment hits a collection of 19F reporter candidates were designed and synthesised. By rigorous prioritisation and use of optimisation workflows, a single 19F reporter molecule was generated for each hotspot. Profiling the binding of a set of structurally characterised ligands by competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR with this suite of 19F reporters recapitulated the binding affinity and site ID assignments made by ITC and X&#8208;ray crystallography. This quantitative mapping of ligand binding events at hotspot level resolution establishes the utility of the fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR screening platform for hotspot&#8208;directed ligand profiling

         <title>The Dependence of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Crystal Facet of Current Collector in Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of Cu facets on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Li deposition behavior are demonstrated using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The strong adsorption of Cu(100) facet to anions guides more anions to participate in the inner Helmholtz plane and promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foil with a single [100] orientation display outstanding performance.







Abstract
The continuous electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have largely hindered the development of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the facet of current collector can regulate the composition of SEI and the subsequent Li deposition behavior using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the (100) facet of Cu possesses strong adsorption to anions, guiding more anions to participate preferentially in the inner Helmholtz plane and further promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foils with a single [100] orientation (s&#8208;Cu(100)) achieve the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition with enhanced Li plating/stripping reversibility. Moreover, the Li anode deposited on s&#8208;Cu(100) can stabilize the operation of an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (350&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with a low negative/positive capacity ratio (~2) and lean electrolyte (2.4&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1) for 150&#8197;cycles. Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of electrolytes employed different anions. This work provides new insights into the correlation between the SEI and current collector, opening a universal avenue towards high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

         <title>Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Autoantibodies in the Sera of Pancreatic Cancer Patients Using Engineered MUC1 Glycopeptide Nanoparticle Probes</title>

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. We describe the development of a diagnostic assay based on the detection of tumor&#8208;associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) in the sera using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. The best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers.







Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic approaches to identify the disease as early as possible. We have developed a diagnostic assay for pancreatic cancer based on the detection of naturally occurring tumor associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. We used a structure&#8208;guided approach to develop unnatural glycopeptides as model antigens for tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. We designed a collection of 13 glycopeptides to bind either SM3 or 5E5, two monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes known to recognize tumor associated MUC1. Glycopeptide binding to SM3 or 5E5 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These model antigens were conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in a dot&#8208;blot assay to detect autoantibodies in serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Nanoparticle probes with glycopeptides displaying the SM3 epitope did not have diagnostic potential. Instead, nanoparticle probes displaying glycopeptides with high affinity for 5E5 could discriminate between cancer patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19&#8208;9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

         <title>Electron Transfer Enhanced by a Minimal Energetic Driving Force at the Organic&#8208;Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transfer from the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state to the first triplet excited state (T1) are investigated in upconversion organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with 45 different material combinations. According to our analysis based on the semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory, CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV) and is expressed by a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV.







Abstract
The energetic driving force for electron transfer must be minimized to realize efficient optoelectronic devices including organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Exploring the dynamics of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state at an interface leads to a comprehension of the relationship between energetics, electron&#8208;transfer efficiency, and device performance. Here, we investigate the electron transfer from the CT state to the triplet excited state (T1) in upconversion OLEDs with 45 material combinations. By analyzing the CT emission and the singlet excited&#8208;state emission from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation via the dark T1, their energetics and electron&#8208;transfer efficiencies are extracted. We demonstrate that the CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by the stronger CT interaction and a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV), which is explained using the Marcus theory with a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV. Through our analysis, a novel donor&#8211;acceptor combination for the OLED is developed and shows an efficient blue emission with an extremely low turn&#8208;on voltage of 1.57&#8197;V. This work provides a solution to control interfacial CT states for efficient optoelectronic devices without energy loss.

By analyzing the CT emission and the singlet excited-state emission from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation via the dark T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, their energetics and electron-transfer efficiencies are extracted. We demonstrate that the CT&#8594;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; electron transfer is enhanced by the stronger CT interaction and a minimal energetic driving force (&amp;lt;0.1&#8197;eV), which is explained using the Marcus theory with a small reorganization energy of &amp;lt;0.1&#8197;eV. Through our analysis, a novel donor&#8211;acceptor combination for the OLED is developed and shows an efficient blue emission with an extremely low turn-on voltage of 1.57&#8197;V. This work provides a solution to control interfacial CT states for efficient optoelectronic devices without energy loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Fluorinated Nanospace in Porous Organic Salts with High Water Stability/Capability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully constructed uniform highly fluorinated nanospaces without impurities such as metals. This highly hydrophobic nanospace exhibits high water stability, and is the first all&#8208;organic hydrophobic nanospace where water molecules can enter. Furthermore, this nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity of 1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH.







Abstract
Water in hydrophobic nanospaces shows specific dynamic properties different from bulk water. The investigation of these properties is important in various research fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology. The elucidation of the correlation between properties of water and hydrophobic nanospaces requires nanospaces covered only with simple hydrophobic group (e.g., fluorine) without impurities such as metals. This work successfully fabricated all&#8208;organic diamondoid porous organic salts (d&#8208;POSs) with highly fluorinated nanospaces, wherein hydrophobic fluorine atoms are densely exposed on the void surfaces, by combining fluorine substituted triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) derivatives with tetrahedral tetrasulfonic acid. This d&#8208;POSs with a highly fluorinated nanospace significantly improved their water stability, retaining their crystal structure even when immersed in water over one week. Moreover, this highly hydrophobic and fluorinated nanospace adsorbs 160&#8197;mL(STP)/g of water vapor at Pe/P0=0.90; this is the first hydrophobic nanospace, which water molecules can enter, in an all&#8208;organic porous material. Furthermore, this highly fluorinated nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm) at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH. POSs with tailorable nanospaces may significantly advance the elucidation of the properties of specific &#8220;water&#8221; in pure hydrophobic environments.

         <title>Fabrication of Azacrown Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cathode Performance in Aqueous Ni&#8722;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical linker derived from azacrown ether, utilized in COF synthesis via reticular synthesis. The embedded crown ether moieties and imine linkages faciltate Ni2+ ions immobilization via post&#8208;modification. The resulting composite COF materials exhibit high nickel loading capacity, maintaining porosity and crystallinity, demonstrate promise as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries, offering high discharge capacity and exceptional cycling stability.







Abstract
Crown ethers (CEs), known for their exceptional host&#8211;guest complexation, offer potential as linkers in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for enhanced performance in catalysis and host&#8211;guest binding. However, their highly flexible conformation and low symmetry limit the diversity of CE&#8208;derived COFs. Here, we introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown&#8208;6 (TPy18C6), for COF fabrication (ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni2+ ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni2+&#8208;doped COFs (Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 8&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and exceptional cycling stability (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic&#8208;synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Local Electric Field Induced by Dual Heteroatoms on Copper Boosts Efficient CO2 Reduction Over Ultrawide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver and tin heteroatoms are injected into the nano&#8208;porous copper to construct an asymmetric local electric field, thereby realizing excellent selectivity up to a nearly 100&#8201;% Faraday efficiency for CO over ultrawide potential window, a superior CO local current density of 340&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and high energy efficiency of 90&#8201;% for CO production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity provides an elegant route for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and feedstocks, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. Herein, Ag and Sn heteroatoms were simultaneously introduced into nanoporous Cu (np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu) mainly in the form of an asymmetric local electric field for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. The designed np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90&#8201;% energy efficiency and a 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (&#916;E=1.4&#8197;V), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Au and Ag&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO2 molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR.

         <title>Pendant Proton&#8208;Relays Systematically Tune the Rate and Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Ammonia Generation in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Installation of secondary sphere proton relaying functionalities within an iron&#8208;porphyrin based MOF, enables systematic adjustment of heterogeneous electrocatalytic nitrite reduction performance in aqueous solution. Thus, high rates of NH3 production at more than 90&#8201;% faradaic efficiency were obtained.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction (eNO2RR) is a promising alternative route to produce ammonia (NH3). Until now, several molecular catalysts have shown capability to homogeneously reduce nitrite to NH3, while taking advantage of added secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities to direct catalytic performance. Yet, realizing such control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that heterogenization of a Fe&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst within a 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), allows efficient eNO2RR to NH3. On top of that, installation of pendant proton relaying moieties proximal to the catalytic site, resulted in significant improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity. Notably, systematic manipulation of NH3 faradaic efficiency (up to 90&#8201;%) and partial current (5&#8208;fold increase) was achieved by varying the proton relay&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst molar ratio. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis show that the proton relays simultaneously aid in generating and stabilizing of reactive Fe&#8208;bound NO intermediate. Thus, this concept offers new molecular tools to tune heterogeneous electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Selective Cleavage of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 Bond for Lignin Depolymerization via Paired&#8208;Electrolysis in an Undivided Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the lignin (models) depolymerization and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in a selective and energy&#8208;effective manner.







Abstract
The cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds is one of the most promising strategies for lignin&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, current catalytic system capable of selectively breaking C&#8722;O bonds in lignin often requires a precious metal catalyst and/or harsh conditions such as high&#8208;pressure H2 and elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a novel protocol of paired electrolysis to effectively cleave the C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 bond of lignin model compounds and real lignin at room temperature and ambient pressure. For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in an energy&#8208;effective manner. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, remarkable yield with excellent chemoselectivity, and feasibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that indirect H* (chemical absorbed hydrogen) reduction instead of direct electron transfer might be the pathway for the cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Stability of Mg Metal Anodes: High&#8208;Exposure (002) Facets and Nanosheet Arrays for Superior Mg Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mg foil, featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and nanosheet arrays architecture, is fabricated via a selective etching strategy. The facet property encourages smooth nucleation and dense deposition, while the distinctive morphology ensures uniform electric field and Mg ion flux distributions. As a result, an improved Mg plating/stripping reversibility and extended cycle stability is achieved.







Abstract
Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs), recognized as promising contenders for post&#8208;lithium battery technologies, face challenges such as uneven magnesium (Mg) plating and stripping behaviors, leading to uncontrollable dendrite growth and irreversible structural damage. Herein, we have developed a Mg foil featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and an architecture of nanosheet arrays (termed (002)&#8208;Mg), created through a one&#8208;step acid etching method. Specifically, the prominent exposure of Mg (002) facets, known for their inherently low surface and adsorption energies with Mg atoms, not only facilitates smooth nucleation and dense deposition but also significantly mitigates side reactions on the Mg anode. Moreover, the nanosheet arrays on the surface evenly distribute the electric field and Mg ion flux, enhancing Mg ion transfer kinetics. As a result, the fabricated (002)&#8208;Mg electrodes exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;cycle performance, lasting over 6000&#8197;h (&gt;8 months) at a current density of 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for a capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells equipped with various electrolytes and cathodes demonstrate remarkable capacity and cycling stability, highlighting the superior electrochemical compatibility of the (002)&#8208;Mg electrode. This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.

         <title>Modularization of Immobilized Multienzyme Cascades for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;enzyme cascade has been developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective C&#8722;H amination of aromatic alkanes by constructing two immobilized bienzymatic modules and integrating them in tandem packed&#8208;bed reactors. The resulting flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multienzyme cascades (MECs) have gained much attention in synthetic chemistry but remain far from being a reliable synthetic tool. Here we report a four&#8208;enzyme cascade comprising a cofactor&#8208;independent and a cofactor self&#8208;sustaining bienzymatic modules for the enantioselective benzylic C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes, a challenging transformation from bulk chemicals to high value&#8208;added chiral amines. The two modules were subsequently optimized by enzyme co&#8208;immobilization with microenvironmental tuning, and finally integrated in a gas&#8208;liquid segmented flow system, resulting in simultaneous improvements in enzyme performance, mass transfer, system compatibility, and productivity. The flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is a 90&#8208;fold increase over the highest value previously reported.

         <title>Development of Iron&#8208;Based Single Atom Materials for General and Efficient Synthesis of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;based single atoms (Fe&#8208;SACs) as reductive amination catalysts have been prepared by the pyrolysis of Fe&#8208;nitrogen complexes on SiO2 and subsequent removal of silica. Applying these Fe&#8208;SACs, all kinds of amines including N&#8208;methylated products, amino acid esters, amino acid amides and selected drug molecules are synthesized starting from inexpensive and easily accessible carbonyl compounds and ammonia or amines in presence of molecular hydrogen.







Abstract
Earth abundant metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with highly active and at the same time stable isolated metal sites constitute a key factor for the advancement of sustainable and cost&#8208;effective chemical synthesis. In particular, the development of more practical, and durable iron&#8208;based materials is of central interest for organic synthesis, especially for the preparation of chemical products related to life science applications. Here, we report the preparation of Fe&#8208;single atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) entrapped in N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon support with unprecedented potential in the preparation of different kinds of amines, which represent privileged class of organic compounds and find increasing application in daily life. The optimal Fe&#8208;SACs allow for the reductive amination of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with ammonia and amines to produce diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amines including N&#8208;methylated products as well as drugs, agrochemicals, and other biomolecules (amino acid esters and amides) utilizing green hydrogen.

         <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Li7P3S7.5O3.5 with Low Density and Excellent Anode Compatibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte showing the combination of strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density, and anode compatibility is indispensable for the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries, but none of the previously reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets this requirement. Here, a solid electrolyte, Li7P3S7.5O3.5, is discovered, and it displays all these three characteristics simultaneously.







Abstract
The commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs) demands solid electrolytes with strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density (for enabling satisfactory energy densities), and decent anode compatibility (the need for cathode compatibility can be circumvented by the cathode coating techniques that are widely applied in sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs). However, none of the reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets these requirements simultaneously. Here, we design a Li7P3S7.5O3.5 (LPSO) solid electrolyte, which shows a combination of all the aforementioned characteristics. The synthesis of this material does not need the expensive Li2S, so the raw materials cost is only $14.42/kg, which, unlike most solid electrolytes, lies below the $50/kg threshold for commercialization. The density of LPSO is 1.70&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3, considerably lower than those of the oxide (typically above 5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and chloride (around 2.5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) solid electrolytes. Besides, LPSO also shows excellent anode compatibility. The Li|LPSO|Li cell cycles stably with a potential of ~50&#8197;mV under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 4200&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell with the Si anode shows a capacity retention of 89.29&#8201;% after 200 cycles under 88.6&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Nonaqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>

A tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as high voltage, high energy density, and stable catholyte for nonaqueous redox flow battery.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with high energy densities are essential for efficient and sustainable long&#8208;term energy storage on a grid scale. To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as a high energy density catholyte was developed. A synergistic approach to the molecular design of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was applied, with the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, which enhance its solubility in organic carbonate electrolytes, and a perfluoro (PerF) group to increase its redox potential. When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two&#8208;electron&#8208;active (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56&#8197;V for the first redox process and 3.92&#8197;V for the second redox process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|(PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF batteries, with concentrations of 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94&#8201;% (99.87&#8201;% per cycle, 97.52&#8201;% per day) and 90&#8201;% (99.93&#8201;% per cycle, 99.16&#8201;% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38&#8201;% and 98.35&#8201;%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129&#8197;mW/cm2. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/L (100&#8197;Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75&#8197;M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96&#8197;Wh/L (150&#8197;Wh/L theoretical).

         <title>Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a &#8220;Radical Amino Ester&#8221; chiral auxiliary, we achieve asymmetric acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangements. This approach efficiently constructs &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides via a HAT strategy.







Abstract
The radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non&#8208;expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom&#8211;transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C&#8722;H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7&#8201;:&#8201;1 to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step.

A variety of chiral allylic alcohols can be synthesized through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction between alkenyl (pseudo)halides and aldehydes. This innovative technique facilitates both oxidative addition and insertion solely using nickel, representing a significant departure from the traditional NHK reaction pathway that requires both nickel and chromium salts.







Abstract
Chiral allylic alcohols are highly prized in synthetic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity stemming from both alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. While the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of allylic alcohols, it suffers from drawbacks such as the use of toxic chromium salts, high amounts of metal reductants, and poor enantiocontrol. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach involving a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric NHK reaction for the production of chiral allylic alcohols. This method marries alkenyl (pseudo)halides with aldehydes, leveraging a synergistic blend of a chiral nickel catalyst and a photocatalyst. This innovative technique enables both oxidative addition and insertion just using nickel, diverging significantly from the conventional NHK reaction pathway mediated by nickel and chromium salts. The adoption of this methodology holds immense promise for crafting a spectrum of intricate compounds, particularly those of significance in pharmaceuticals. Detailed experimental investigations have shed light on the metallaphotoredox process, further enhancing our understanding and enabling further advancements.

         <title>Chemically&#8208;Driven Autonomous Janus Electromagnets as Magnetotactic Swimmers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;polarization of solenoidal Janus devices into magnetic dipoles is made possible by the efficient coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous and kinetically favored redox reactions taking place at each extremity of the object. This is a straightforward strategy for the design of non&#8208;ferromagnetic, chemically&#8208;driven electromagnets.







Abstract
An electromagnet is a particular device that takes advantage of electrical currents to produce concentrated magnetic fields. The most well&#8208;known example is a conventional solenoid, having the form of an elongated coil and creating a strong magnetic field through its center when it is connected to a current source. Spontaneous redox reactions located at opposite ends of an anisotropic Janus swimmer can effectively mimic a standard power source, due to their ability to wirelessly generate a local electric current. Herein, we propose the coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous redox reactions occurring at the extremities of a hybrid Mg/Pt Janus swimmer with a solenoidal geometry to generate significant magnetic fields. These chemically driven electromagnets spontaneously transform the redox&#8208;induced electric current into a magnetic field with a strength in the range of &#956;T upon contact with an acidic medium. Such on&#8208;board magnetization allows them to perform compass&#8208;like rotational motion and magnetotactic displacement in the presence of external magnetic field gradients, without the need of using ferromagnetic materials for the swimmer design. The torque force experienced by the swimmer is proportional to the internal redox current, and by varying the composition of the solution, it is possible to fine&#8208;tune its angular velocity.

         <title>Inducing and Switching the Handedness of Polyacetylenes with Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane Pendants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral [2]catenanes as pendants, the precise regulations of chirality induction from the pendants to poly(phenylacetylenes) main chains lead to the successful construction of novel poly[2]catenanes with multistate switchable handedness, providing not only a new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.







Abstract
To explore the chirality induction and switching of topological chirality, poly[2]catenanes composed of helical poly(phenylacetylenes) (PPAs) main chain and topologically chiral [2]catenane pendants are described for the first time. These poly[2]catenanes with optically active [2]catenanes on side chains were synthesized by polymerization of enantiomerically pure topologically chiral [2]catenanes with ethynyl polymerization site and/or point chiral moiety. The chirality information of [2]catenane pendants was successfully transferred to the main chain of polyene backbones, leading to preferred&#8208;handed helical conformations, while the introduction of point chiral units has negligible effect on the overall helices. More interestingly, attributed to unique dynamic feature of the [2]catenane pendants, these polymers revealed dynamic response behaviors to solvents, temperature, and sodium ions, resulting in the fully reversible switching on/off of the chirality induction. This work provides not only new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Anion Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Protected PtAu12 Superatoms: Charging Energy in Vacuum vs Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charging energy of PtAu24(SCnH2n+1)18 in vacuum was evaluated by gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy. Permittivity of the ligand layer, estimated based on the concentric&#8208;capacitor model, decreased with n. The n&#8208;dependent charging behavior is explained by inhomogeneous monolayers due to the formation of bundles of the longer alkyl chains.







Abstract
The charging behavior of molecular Au clusters protected by alkanethiolate (SCnH2n+1=SCn) is, under electrochemical conditions, significantly affected by the penetration of solvents and electrolytes into the SCn layer. In this study, we estimated the charging energy EC(n) associated with [PtAu24(SCn)18]&#8722;+e&#8722;&#8594;[PtAu24(SCn)18]2&#8722; (n=4, 8, 12, and 16) in vacuum using mass&#8208;selected gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy of [PtAu24(SCn)18]z (z=&#8722;1 and &#8722;2). The EC(n) values of PtAu24(SCn)18 in vacuum are significantly larger than those in solution and decrease with n in contrast to the behavior reported for Au25(SCn)18 in solution. The effective relative permittivity (&#1013;m*) of the SCn layer in vacuum is estimated to be 2.3&#8211;2.0 based on the double&#8208;concentric&#8208;capacitor model. Much smaller &#1013;m* values in vacuum than those in solution are explained by the absence of solvent/electrolyte penetration into the monolayer. The gradual decrease of &#1013;m* with n is ascribed to the appearance of an exposed surface region due to the bundle formation of long alkyl chains.

         <title>Understanding Ligand Effects on Bielectronic Transitions: Chemo&#8208; and Electroreduction of Rhodium Bis(Diphosphine) Complexes to Low Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;electron reduction to low&#8208;valent rhodium &#8722;I is underpinned by structural rearrangements that defines whether the redox transitions are stepwise or in a bielectronic fashion. Study of a parametrized series of Rh bis(diphosphine) complexes identifies how ligand parameters influence this behaviour, whereas an expedient computed electronic parameter allows correlating electronics and geometrics with redox potentials.







Abstract
Rhodium complexes in the &#8722;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood. Herein, we investigate the two&#8208;electron reduction of a parameterized series of bis(diphosphine) Rh complexes [Rh(dxpy)2]NTf2 (x=P&#8208;substituent, y=alkanediyl bridging P atoms). Through (electro)reductions from the RhI parents, Rh&#8722;I d10&#8208;complexes were obtained and characterized spectroscopically, including 103Rh NMR data. The reductive steps convolute with structural rearrangements from square planar to tetrahedral coordination. We found that the extent of these reorganisations defines whether the first E0(RhI/0) and second E0(Rh0/&#8722;I) reduction potentials are normally ordered, leading to monoelectronic stepwise transitions, or inverted, giving bielectronic events. Reductionist approaches based on Hammett parameters or the P&#8722;Rh&#8208;P bite angles provide only partial correlations with the redox potentials. However, we identified the C&#8722;O stretch of analogue diphosphine complexes as an expedient computational parameter that enables these correlations through both electronic and geometric features, even in a predictive manner. Gaining control over two&#8208;electron reduction behaviors through rationalized ligand effects has potential impact beyond Rh complexes, for molecular and enzymatic metal sites commonly exhibiting bielectronic transitions.

         <title>Value&#8208;Added Upcycling of PET to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexanedimethanol by a Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistage relay process has been developed that directly transforms PET into high&#8208;value&#8208;added 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimetha&#8208;nol (CHDM). The process utilizes polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) as a crucial intermediate, enabling the efficient and trans&#8208;selective production of CHDM. By implementing a temperature&#8208;programmed, three&#8208;stage relay approach, we successfully achieved an isolated CHDM yield of up to 87&#8201;%, with a significantly enhanced trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1.







Abstract
We present an innovative process for directly transforming poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a polymer extensively used in food and beverage packaging, into trans&#8208;isomer&#8208;enriched 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM), a key ingredient in advanced specialty polymers. Our approach leverages a dual&#8208;catalyst system featuring palladium on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/r&#8208;GO) and oxalate&#8208;gel&#8208;derived copper&#8208;zinc oxide (og&#8208;CuZn), utilizing hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis relay catalysis. This method efficiently transforms PET into polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD), which is then converted into CHDM with an impressive overall yield of 95&#8201;% in a two&#8208;stage process. Our process effectively handles various post&#8208;consumer PET plastics, converting them into CHDM with yields between 78&#8201;% and 89&#8201;% across different substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of this approach through a temperature&#8208;programmed three&#8208;stage relay process on a 10&#8208;gram scale, which results in purified CHDM with an isolated yield of 87&#8201;% and a notably higher trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1, far exceeding that of commercially available CHDM. This research not only provides a viable route for repurposing PET waste but also enhances the control of selectivity patterns in multistage relay catalysis.

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Tailored F/N Hybrid Polymers by Using Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;controlled radical copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and N&#8208;vinylamides has been developed with fluorinated thiocarbamate and organocatalyst under mild conditions. This work enables on&#8208;demand synthesis of F/N hybrid polymers as versatile and functional structures that could be readily transformed via chain&#8208;extensions and post&#8208;modifications, facilitating the in situ formation of polymeric interphase layers on Li metal anodes.







Abstract
Controlled radical copolymerizations present attractive avenues to obtain polymers with complicated compositions and sequences. In this work, we report the development of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed controlled copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and acyclic N&#8208;vinylamides for the first time. The approach enables the on&#8208;demand synthesis of a broad scope of amide&#8208;functionalized main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers via novel fluorinated thiocarbamates, facilitating regulations over chemical compositions and alternating fractions by rationally selecting comonomer pairs and ratios. This method allows temporally controlled chain&#8208;growth by external light, and maintains high chain&#8208;end fidelity that promotes facile preparation of block sequences. Notably, the obtained F/N hybrid polymers, upon hydrolysis, afford free amino&#8208;substituted fluoropolymers versatile for post modifications toward various functionalities (e.g., amide, sulfonamide, carbamide, thiocarbamide). We further demonstrate the in situ formation of polymer networks with desirable properties as protective layers on lithium metal anodes, presenting a promising avenue for advancing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Common Biosynthesis of Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Terpenes through a Fragmentation&#8208;Recombination Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of six bacterial non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers was investigated through a combination of isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results showed that five of these compounds are formed by an unusual fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism. In addition, for anaximandrene a dancing mechanism was discovered, explaining the distribution of labeling over several carbon positions.







Abstract
The biosynthesis of six recently reported non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers, archimedene, aristotelene, eratosthenene, pythagorene, &#945;&#8208;democritene and anaximandrene, was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and isotopic labeling experiments. The results revealed for all compounds except archimedene a unique fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism as previously demonstrated for sodorifen biosynthesis, in addition to a remarkable &#8220;dancing&#8221; mechanism for anaximandrene biosynthesis.

         <title>Molecule Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Wide&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes via the Intelligentized Screening Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte design is presented. Based on an explainable method, the halogenoid property of the cyanide group is demonstrated similar to fluorine in molecular properties. 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the LiCoO2/Li cell operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Operating a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) in a wide temperature range is essential for ensuring a stable electricity supply amidst fluctuating temperatures caused by climate or terrain changes. Electrolyte plays a pivotal role in determining the temperature durability of batteries. However, specialized electrolytes designed for either low or high temperatures typically possess distinct features. Therefore, wide&#8208;temperature electrolytes (WTEs) are necessary as they encompass a combination of diverse properties, which complicates the clear instruction of WTE design. Here we represent an artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of WTE design through stepwise parameterizations and calculations. Linear mono&#8208;nitriles are identified as ideal wide&#8208;liquidus&#8208;range solvents that can &#8220;softly&#8221; solvate lithium ions by weak interactions. In addition, the explainable modules revealed the halogenoid similarity of cyanide as fluorine on the electrolyte properties (e.g. boiling point and dielectric constant). With the further introduction of an ether bond, 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been eventually determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the battery operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C. Particularly, a LiCoO2/Li cell using the proposed WTE can realize stable cycling with capacity retention reaching 72.3&#8201;% after 50 cycles under a high temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Membrane Enthalpy and Entropy Barriers towards Superior Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>

A porous TpPa COF interlayer is introduced to regulate the architecture and charge properties of the CAPEI selective layer, culminating in a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. Consequently, M&#8208;TpPaCAPEI exhibits superior separation performance to that of M&#8208;CAPEI and other advanced monovalent ion selective membranes for Li+/Mg2+ separation.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#916;H) and entropy barrier (&#916;S) for designing next&#8208;generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule&#8208;absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. This recorded performance with a Li+/Mg2+ perm&#8208;selectivity of 25.50 and a Li+ flux of 1.86&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li+/Mg2+ separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S&#8208;ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A porous TpPa COF interlayer is introduced to regulate the architecture and charge properties of the CAPEI selective layer, culminating in a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, greater &#916;H for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and lower &#916;H for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. Consequently, M-TpPaCAPEI exhibits superior separation performance to that of M-CAPEI and other advanced monovalent ion selective membranes for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#916;H) and entropy barrier (&#916;S) for designing next-generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule-absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, greater &#916;H for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and lower &#916;H for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. This recorded performance with a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; perm-selectivity of 25.50 and a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux of 1.86&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S-ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two RNA Folds from One Sequence: A Ribozyme with Versatile Substrate Processing Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme can adopt a hammerhead fold, allowing them to process various substrates by utilizing their inherent activity and comprehensive conformational flexibility to support RNA cleavage and ligation.







Abstract
We report the design of a single RNA sequence capable of adopting one of two ribozyme folds and catalyzing the cleavage and/or ligation of the respective substrates. The RNA is able to change its conformation in response to its environment, hence it is called chameleon ribozyme (CHR). Efficient RNA cleavage of two different substrates as well as RNA ligation by CHR is demonstrated in separate experiments and in a one pot reaction. Our study shows that sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme intersect with the hammerhead ribozyme and that rather short RNA molecules can have comprehensive conformational flexibility, which is an important feature for the emergence of new functional folds in early evolution.

         <title>Unraveling the Intertwining Factors Underlying the Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two closely related yet distinctly different heterometallic 3d&#8211;4f clusters, featuring respectively a 96&#8208;metal (Dy52Ni44) and a 188&#8208;metal (Dy112Ni76) core built of multi&#8208;shells of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained by the controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+. Comparative experiments under systematically altered conditions were performed to unravel the intertwining factors, including the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base, the reaction temperature, and the reaction duration.







Abstract
Two closely related yet distinctly different cationic clusters, [Dy52Ni44(HEIDA)36(OH)138(OAc)24(H2O)30]10+ (1) and [Dy112Ni76(HEIDA)44(EIDA)24(IDA)4(OH)268(OAc)48(H2O)44]4+ (2) (HEIDA=N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetate), each featuring a multi&#8208;shell core of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained. Depending on the specific conditions used for the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+, the product can be crystallized out as one particular type of cluster or as a mixture of 1 and 2. How the reaction process was affected by the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base and/or by the reaction temperature and duration was investigated. It has been found that a reaction at a high temperature and/or for an extended period favors the formation of the compact and thermodynamically more stable 1, while a brief reaction with a large amount of the base is good for the kinetic product 2. By tuning these intertwining conditions, the reaction can be regulated toward a particular product.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Tetra&#8208;substituted Morpholinone and Benzoxazinone Lactols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. DFT studies identify an N&#8208;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction as key to producing products in highly enantioenriched form.







Abstract
The development of methods to allow the selective acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of tetra&#8208;substituted lactols is a recognised synthetic challenge. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields (up to 89&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er) observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating substitution at N(4) and C(2), di&#8208; and spirocyclic substitution at C(5) and C(6), as well as benzannulation (&gt;35&#8197;examples in total). The DKR process is amenable to scale&#8208;up on a 1&#8197;g laboratory scale. The factors leading to high selectivity in this DKR process have been probed through computation, with an N&#8722;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction identified as key to producing ester products in highly enantioenriched form.

Abstract
A general and highly enantioselective method for the preparation of tetra&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide esters via isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is reported. Using (2S,3R)&#8208;HyperBTM (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the catalyst, the scope and limitations of this methodology have been extensively probed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields observed (&gt;40&#8197;examples, up to 99&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er). Substitution of the aromatic core within the 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide skeleton, as well as aliphatic and aromatic substitution at C(3), is readily tolerated. A diverse range of anhydrides, including those from bioactive and pharmaceutically relevant acids, can also be used. The high enantioselectivity observed in this DKR process has been probed computationally, with a key substrate heteroatom donor O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;acyl&#8208;isothiouronium interaction identified through DFT analysis as necessary for enantiodiscrimination.

Using (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-HyperBTM (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the catalyst, the scope and limitations of this methodology have been extensively probed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields observed (&amp;gt;40&#8197;examples, up to 99&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er). Substitution of the aromatic core within the 3-hydroxyphthalide skeleton, as well as aliphatic and aromatic substitution at C(3), is readily tolerated. A diverse range of anhydrides, including those from bioactive and pharmaceutically relevant acids, can also be used. The high enantioselectivity observed in this DKR process has been probed computationally, with a key substrate heteroatom donor O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;acyl-isothiouronium interaction identified through DFT analysis as necessary for enantiodiscrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trilayer Polymer Electrolytes Enable Carbon&#8208;Efficient CO2 to Multicarbon Product Conversion in Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trilayer polymer electrolyte was devised to enable the coexistence of high local pH at the cathode surface and acidic interfaces within the membrane, thus concurrently favoring C2H4 formation and addressing the CO2 loss issue. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of ~46&#8201;% and a single&#8208;pass conversion of ~32&#8201;% were achieved for C2H4 at industrially relevant current densities.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO2 electrolyzers exhibit high CO2RR activity, low full&#8208;cell voltages, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the issue of CO2 loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO2RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H+ flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO2 reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a result, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46&#8201;% for C2H4, corresponding to a C2+ FE of 64&#8201;% at 260&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 single&#8208;pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32&#8201;% at 140&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8212;nearly 1.3&#8197;times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM&#8208;MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO2 reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE&#8208;MEA electrolyzer reduces the full&#8208;cell voltage to 2.3&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without compromising the C2H4 FE.

         <title>Selenophene&#8208;fused Perylene Diimide&#8208;Based Cathode Interlayer Enables 19&#8201;% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells via Stimulative Charge Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A D&#8211;A type selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide derivative (SePDI3) is developed as CIM for OSCs. SePDI3 shows simultaneous superior charge transport and extraction capacity. Finally, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displayed a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy in the development of high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.







Abstract
The cathode interlayer is crucial for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), but the research on simple and efficient interlayer materials is lagging behind. Here, a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) typed selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) derivative (SePDI3) is developed as cathode interlayer material (CIM) for OSCs, and a non&#8208;fused PDI derivative (PDI3) is used as the control CIM for comparison. Compared to PDI3, SePDI3 shows a stronger self&#8208;doping effect and better crystallinity, resulting in better charge transport ability. Furthermore, the interaction between SePDI3 and L8&#8208;BO can form an efficient extraction channel, leading to superior charge extraction behavior. Finally, benefitting from significantly enhanced charge transport and extraction capacity, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displays a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO active layer, which is one of the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs based novel CIMs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy to develop high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.

         <title>A NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated and Lysosomal&#8208;Targeted Pt(II) Metallacycle for Highly Potent Evoking of Immunogenic Cell Death that Potentiates Cancer Immunotherapy of Deep&#8208;Seated Tumors</title>

A platinum (Pt) metallacycle (1) is designed as the first example of a supramolecular near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer. 1 generates boosted reactive oxygen species excited by NIR light and induces lysosomal dysfunction thus synergistically augments immunomodulatory response with the effective dose of about a sixtieth compared with oxaliplatin and efficiently reduces adverse effects.







Abstract
Though platinum (Pt)&#8208;based complexes have been recently exploited as immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers for activating immunotherapy, the effective activation of sufficient immune responses with minimal side effects in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose the first example of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated and lysosomal targeted Pt(II) metallacycle (1) as a supramolecular ICD inducer. 1 synergistically potentiates immunomodulatory response in deep&#8208;seated tumors via multiple&#8208;regulated approaches, involving NIR light excitation, boosted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good selectivity between normal and tumor cells, and enhanced tumor penetration/retention capabilities. Specifically, 1 has excellent depth&#8208;activated ROS production (~7&#8197;mm), accompanied by strong anti&#8208;diffusion and anti&#8208;ROS quenching ability. In vitro experiments demonstrate that 1 exhibits significant cellular uptake and ROS generation in tumor cells as well as respective multicellular tumor spheroids. Based on these advantages, 1 induces a more efficient ICD in an ultralow dose (i.e., 5&#8197;&#956;M) compared with the clinical ICD inducer&#8208;oxaliplatin (300&#8197;&#956;M). In vivo, vaccination experiments further demonstrate that 1 serves as a potent ICD inducer through eliciting CD8+/CD4+ T&#8197;cell response and Foxp3+ T&#8197;cell depletion with negligible adverse effects. This study pioneers a promising avenue for safe and effective metal&#8208;based ICD agents in immunotherapy.

         <title>Direct Microenvironment Modulation of CO2 Electroreduction: Negatively Charged Ag Sites Going beyond Catalytic Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported &#8220;nc&#8208;Ag&#8221; active sites featuring both the high intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. The sites could exert long&#8208;range electrostatic forces to regulate interfacial H2O and CO2 in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This work opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating the intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active sites may also boost catalytic performance. Here we designed &#8220;negatively charged Ag (nc&#8208;Ag)&#8221; active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only mediate the surface processes by bonding with the intermediates), the nc&#8208;Ag sites could also manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with a CO faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

     alt="Direct Microenvironment Modulation of CO2 Electroreduction: Negatively Charged Ag Sites Going beyond Catalytic Surface Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reported &#8220;nc-Ag&#8221; active sites featuring both the high intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. The sites could exert long-range electrostatic forces to regulate interfacial H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction. This work opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating the intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active sites may also boost catalytic performance. Here we designed &#8220;negatively charged Ag (nc-Ag)&#8221; active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only mediate the surface processes by bonding with the intermediates), the nc-Ag sites could also manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but also regulate interfacial H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with a CO faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Methylated Sulfone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Back&#8208;Reaction Inhibited Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise methylation of O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen&#8208;intermediate desorption, which obstructs the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics and inhibits the backward reaction of O2 reduction reaction in photocatalytic overall water splitting. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution, which cooperatively contributes to efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with favored proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS&#8208;COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70&#8201;% of the backward reaction and a three&#8208;fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest reported for organic&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

Droplets dancing to non&#8208;classical tunes. Nishant Singh and co&#8208;workers (e202406220) show in their Communication how phase&#8208;separated amino acid droplets can non&#8208;classically evolve into poly&#8208;crystals and fibrous hydrogels. Several complex and direct pathways are explored to achieve transient or stable soft materials, single&#8208; or poly&#8208;crystals by provoking disordered droplets.

Radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. In their Research Article (e202406551) Eduard Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. show the utility of an active&#8208;feedback wireless NMR masing detector with the quality factor enhancement up to 1,000,000 to create a RASER at 300 MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional passive NMR detectors. This active&#8208;feedback&#8208;circuit approach potentially enables RASER sensing in a wide range of in vivo applications.

In their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202406551"&gt;(e202406551)&lt;/a&gt; Eduard Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. show the utility of an active-feedback wireless NMR masing detector with the quality factor enhancement up to 1,000,000 to create a RASER at 300 MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional passive NMR detectors. This active-feedback-circuit approach potentially enables RASER sensing in a wide range of in vivo applications.

Two structurally intricate heterometallic clusters with cores featuring multiple Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra were synthesized by ligand&#8208;controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ni2+ and Dy3+ ions, as reported by Zhiping Zheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409109). Adjusting the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;promoting base and the reaction temperature and duration afforded selectively the kinetic and thermodynamic species, respectively with a Dy112Ni76 and a Dy52Ni44 core.

         <title>Photorefinery of Biomass and Plastics to Renewable Chemicals using Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysts harness sunlight to convert biomass and plastic waste into value&#8208;added chemicals. These feedstocks utilize photogenerated electrons and/or holes to undergo reduction and/or oxidation transformations, enabling catalytic upgrading in a low&#8208;carbon, renewable energy&#8208;driven, and environmentally friendly manner.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of biomass and plastic waste provides opportunities for sustainable fuel and chemical production. Heterogeneous photocatalysts, typically composed of semiconductors with distinctive redox properties in their conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), facilitate both the oxidative and reductive valorization of organic feedstocks. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the photorefinery of biomass and plastics from the perspective of the redox properties of photocatalysts. We explore the roles of the VB and CB in enhancing the value&#8208;added conversion of biomass and plastics via various pathways. Our aim is to bridge the gap between photocatalytic mechanisms and renewable carbon feedstock valorization, inspiring further development in photocatalytic refinery of biomass and plastics.

         <title>Evolution of Surface Chemistry in Two&#8208;Dimensional MXenes: From Mixed to Tunable Uniform Terminations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently modifiable surface terminations distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials and define their intrinsic properties. This minireview highlights recent advances in MXenes with uniform inorganic or organic surface terminations and provides perspectives on future opportunities and challenges in this field.







Abstract
Surface chemistry of MXenes is of great interest as the terminations can define the intrinsic properties of this family of materials. The diverse and tunable terminations also distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials. Conventional fluoride&#8208;containing reagents etching approaches resulted in MXenes with mixed fluoro&#8208;, oxo&#8208;, and hydroxyl surface groups. The relatively strong chemical bonding of MXenes&#8217; surface metal atoms with oxygen and fluorine makes post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications of such MXenes unfavorable. In this minireview, we focus on the recent advances in MXenes with uniform surface terminations. Unconventional methods, including Lewis acidic molten salt etching (LAMS) and bottom&#8208;up direct synthesis, have been proven successful in producing halide&#8208;terminated MXenes. These synthetic strategies have opened new possibilities for MXenes because weaker surface chemical bonds in halide&#8208;terminated MXenes facilitate post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications. Both computational and experimental results on surface termination&#8208;dependent properties are summarized and discussed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting research field.

     alt="Evolution of Surface Chemistry in Two-Dimensional MXenes: From Mixed to Tunable Uniform Terminations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalently modifiable surface terminations distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials and define their intrinsic properties. This minireview highlights recent advances in MXenes with uniform inorganic or organic surface terminations and provides perspectives on future opportunities and challenges in this field.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface chemistry of MXenes is of great interest as the terminations can define the intrinsic properties of this family of materials. The diverse and tunable terminations also distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials. Conventional fluoride-containing reagents etching approaches resulted in MXenes with mixed fluoro-, oxo-, and hydroxyl surface groups. The relatively strong chemical bonding of MXenes&#8217; surface metal atoms with oxygen and fluorine makes post-synthetic covalent surface modifications of such MXenes unfavorable. In this minireview, we focus on the recent advances in MXenes with uniform surface terminations. Unconventional methods, including Lewis acidic molten salt etching (LAMS) and bottom-up direct synthesis, have been proven successful in producing halide-terminated MXenes. These synthetic strategies have opened new possibilities for MXenes because weaker surface chemical bonds in halide-terminated MXenes facilitate post-synthetic covalent surface modifications. Both computational and experimental results on surface termination-dependent properties are summarized and discussed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting research field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platelet&#8208;Drug Conjugates Engineered via One&#8208;step Fusion Approach for Metastatic and Postoperative Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platelet&#8208;drug conjugates could be prepared via one&#8208;step fusion with multiple&#8208;drug loaded liposomes. Platelets loaded with chemotherapy agent doxorubicin and cytokine IL&#8208;15 triggered anti&#8208;tumor immune response and inhibited melanoma recurrence in metastatic and postoperative tumor models.







Abstract
The exploration of cell&#8208;based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy has gained growing attention. Approaches to engineering therapeutic cells with multidrug loading in an effective, safe, and precise manner while preserving their inherent biological properties remain of great interest. Here, we report a strategy to simultaneously load multiple drugs in platelets in a one&#8208;step fusion process. We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin&#8208;15 (IL&#8208;15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70&#8201;% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Network of Multicatalytic Reactions using a Single Palladium/Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a metabolism&#8208;inspired artificial system designed to respond to multiple stimuli, operating within an integrated network of mechanistically distinct reactions. Our approach enables the efficient performance of multi&#8208;stage processes using three simple starting materials, controlled by specific triggers, and catalysed by a multifunctional PdII/PtII complex, leading to the preferential synthesis of ten products.







Abstract
Given her unrivalled proficiency in the synthesis of all molecules of life, nature has been an endless source of inspiration for developing new strategies in organic chemistry and catalysis. However, one feature that remains thus far beyond chemists&#8217; grasp is her unique ability to adapt the productivity of metabolic processes in response to triggers that indicate the temporary need for specific metabolites. To demonstrate the remarkable potential of such stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, we present a metabolism&#8208;inspired network of multicatalytic processes capable of selectively synthesising a range of products from simple starting materials. Specifically, the network is built of four classes of distinct catalytic reactions&#8212;cross&#8208;couplings, substitutions, additions, and reductions, involving three organic starting materials&#8212;terminal alkyne, aryl iodide, and hydrosilane. All starting materials are either introduced sequentially or added to the system at the same time, with no continuous influx of reagents or efflux of products. All processes in the system are catalysed by a multifunctional heteronuclear PdII/PtII complex, whose performance can be controlled by specific additives and external stimuli. The reaction network exhibits a substantial degree of orthogonality between different pathways, enabling the controllable synthesis of ten distinct products with high efficiency and selectivity through simultaneous triggering and suppression mechanisms.

         <title>Hirocidins, Cytotoxic Metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis, Induce Mitochondrion&#8208;Mediated Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hirocidins A&#8722;C, secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with novel architectures and promising inhibitory activity against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. The total synthesis of hirocidin A and mechanistic investigations, which reveal mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis via caspase&#8208;9, provide opportunities to better understand and chemically enhance hirocidin's antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
Recent advances in whole genome sequencing have revealed an immense microbial potential for the production of therapeutic small molecules, even from well&#8208;known producers. To access this potential, we subjected prominent antimicrobial producers to alternative antiproliferative assays using persistent cancer cell lines. Described herein is our discovery of hirocidins, novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with antiproliferative activities against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. Hirocidin A is an unusual nine&#8208;membered carbocyclic maleimide and hirocidins B and C are relatives with an unprecedented, bridged azamacrocyclic backbone. Mode of action studies show that hirocidins trigger mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis by inducing expression of the key apoptotic effector caspase&#8208;9. The discovery of new cytotoxins contributes to scaffold diversification in anticancer drug discovery and the reported modes of action and concise total synthetic route for variant A set the stage for unraveling specific targets and biochemical interactions of the hirocidins.

         <title>Stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII ions can be constructed using p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (H4TBC[4]) under solvothermal reaction conditions. The topological arrangement of the metal ions leads to significant spin frustration arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at 10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3 T.







Abstract
The solvothermal reaction of FeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O and H4TBC[4] in a basic dmf/EtOH solution affords an [FeIII18] Keplerate conforming to a stellated cuboctahedron. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements reveal spin frustration effects arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at ~10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3&#8197;T.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Weakly Coordinating Anions: Molecular Design, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a systematic, computational evaluation of the potential of differently substituted methanide and propenide anions to serve as as weakly coordinating anion, the mixed 3,5&#8208;bistrifluoromethylphenyl (ArF) and triflyl (Tf) substituted propenide was prepared in gram&#8208;scale and shown to balance proton affinity and coordination ability. The applicability of this weakly coordinating carbanion was demonstrated by the stabilization of p&#8208;block cations.







Abstract
Although carbanions, which are usually regarded as reactive species and powerful metalation reagents, can be stabilized through choice of the substitution pattern, they have rarely been considered for the design of weakly coordinating anions (WCA). Here, we report on an evaluation of the potential of a series of differently substituted carbanions to serve as WCA by computational methods. This led us to the synthesis of the water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable allyl anion 1 with triflyl and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (ArF) moieties, which can be isolated in high yields even on a gram&#8208;scale. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR studies confirmed the weak coordination ability of the anion by showing negligible or only weak interactions with different cations. This property enabled the application of 1 in the stabilization of reactive group&#8197;14 and 15 cations. In addition to the crystallization of a phosphenium cation, the first all&#8208;carbon salt with a non&#8208;aromatic carbanion is reported, which revealed to be a convenient reagent for hydride abstraction such as from silanes. Overall, this work demonstrates the so far untapped potential of carbanions as WCA, that are accessible with a variety of different cations for various applications.

&lt;p&gt;Based on a systematic, computational evaluation of the potential of differently substituted methanide and propenide anions to serve as as weakly coordinating anion, the mixed 3,5-bistrifluoromethylphenyl (Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;) and triflyl (Tf) substituted propenide was prepared in gram-scale and shown to balance proton affinity and coordination ability. The applicability of this weakly coordinating carbanion was demonstrated by the stabilization of p-block cations.

         <title>Complex Pathways Drive Pluripotent Fmoc&#8208;Leucine Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of hierarchical assemblies of Fmoc&#8208;Leu are accessed using non&#8208;classical and classical nucleation following complex pathways. Chemical and thermal inputs lead to phase separated sub&#8208;micron liquid and solid droplets which can transform to fibrous stable hydrogel, transient metastable hydrogels, and milli&#8208;metric polycrystal spherulites or single crystals.







Abstract
Nature uses complex self&#8208;assembly pathways to access distinct functional non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assemblies. This remarkable ability to steer same set of biomolecules into different self&#8208;assembly states is done by avoiding thermodynamic pit. In synthetic systems, on demand control over &#8216;Pathway Complexity&#8217; to access self&#8208;assemblies different from equilibrium structures remains challenging. Here we show versatile non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies of the same monomer via alternate assembly pathways. The assemblies nucleate using non&#8208;classical or classical nucleation routes into distinct metastable (transient hydrogels), kinetic (stable hydrogels) and thermodynamic structures [(poly)&#8208;crystals and 2D sheets]. Initial chemical and thermal inputs force the monomers to follow different assembly pathways and form soft&#8208;materials with distinct molecular arrangements than at equilibrium. In many cases, equilibrium structures act as thermodynamic sink which consume monomers from metastable structures giving transiently formed materials. This dynamics can be tuned chemically or thermally to slow down the dissolution of transient hydrogel, or skip the intermediate hydrogel altogether to reach final equilibrium assemblies. If required this metastable state can be kinetically trapped to give strong hydrogel stable over days. This method to control different self&#8208;assembly states can find potential use in similar biomimetic systems to access new materials for various applications.

         <title>Function Switch of a Fungal Sesterterpene Synthase through Molecular Dynamics Simulation Assisted Alteration of an Aromatic Residue Cluster in the Active Pocket of PfNS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined strategy involving molecular dynamics simulations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to manipulate the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of PfNS protein resulted in the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions, such as the conversion between bicyclic and tricyclic structures and the transition from Type&#8197;B to Type&#8197;A function, thus resulting in the production of new sesterterpenes.







Abstract
Terpene synthases (TPSs) play pivotal roles in generating diverse terpenoids through complex cyclization pathways. Protein engineering of TPSs offers a crucial approach to expanding terpene diversity. However, significant potential remains untapped due to limited understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationships of TPSs. In this investigation, using a joint approach of molecular dynamics simulations&#8208;assisted engineering and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we manipulated the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of a bifunctional terpene synthase (BFTPS), Pestalotiopsis fici nigtetraene synthase (PfNS). This led to the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions yielding different cyclization patterns of sesterterpenes. Specifically, a quadruple variant (F89A/Y113F/W193L/T194W) completely altered PfNS&#8242;s function, converting it from producing the bicyclic sesterterpene nigtetraene to the tricyclic ophiobolin F. Additionally, analysis of catalytic profiles by double, triple, and quadruple variants demonstrated that the ARC functions as a switch, unprecedently redirecting the production of 5/11 bicyclic (Type&#8197;B) sesterterpenes to 5/15 bicyclic (Type&#8197;A) ones. Molecular dynamics simulations and theozyme calculations further elucidated that, in addition to cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions also play a key role in the cyclization patterns. This study offers a feasible strategy in protein engineering of TPSs for various industrial applications.

MnBr&#8208;253 particles were synthesized as three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on MOF&#8208;253 and MnBr(CO)3(bpy) complexes, designed as off&#8208;grid colloidal systems aimed at decoupling light harvesting and high&#8208;energy electron storage. Achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion/storage quantum yield and charging rate, the framework was applied for temporally decoupled dark H2 evolution.







Abstract
Designing multifunctional materials that mimic the light&#8208;dark decoupling of natural photosynthesis is a key challenge in the field of energy conversion. Herein, we introduce MnBr&#8208;253, a precious metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) built on Al nodes, bipyridine linkers and MnBr(CO)3(bipyridine) complexes. Upon irradiation, MnBr&#8208;253 colloids demonstrate an electron photocharging capacity of ~42&#8197;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1MOF, with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocharging rate (1.28&#8197;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1MOF) and incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion efficiency of ~9.4&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm. Spectroscopic and computational studies support effective electron accumulation at the Mn complex while high porosity and Mn loading account for the notable electron storage performance. The charged MnBr&#8208;253 powders were successfully applied for hydrogen evolution under dark conditions thus emulating the light&#8208;decoupled reactivity of photosynthesis.

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Quality&#8208;Factor Wireless Masing Magnetic Resonance Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. RASER is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive NMR detectors. We show wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced from 75 up to 1,000,000 via parametric pumping via active&#8208;feedback technique for RASER applications at 300&#8197;MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional MR detector.







Abstract
It has recently been shown that a bolus of hyperpolarized nuclear spins can yield stimulated emission signals similar in nature to maser signals, potentially enabling new ways of sensing hyperpolarized contrast media, including most notably [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate that is under evaluation in over 50&#8197;clinical trials for metabolic imaging of cancer. The stimulated NMR signal emissions lasting for minutes do not require radio&#8208;frequency excitation, offering unprecedented advantages compared to conventional MR sensing. However, creating nuclear spin maser emission is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive MR detectors. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced 22&#8208;fold (to 1,670) via parametric pumping. This active&#8208;feedback technique breaks the intrinsic fundamental limit of NMR detector circuit quality factor. We show the use of parametric pumping to reduce the threshold requirement for inducing nuclear spin masing at 300&#8197;MHz resonance frequency in a preclinical MRI scanner. Indeed, stimulated emission from hyperpolarized protons was obtained under highly unfavorable conditions of low magnetic field homogeneity (T2* of 3&#8197;ms). Greater gains of the quality factor of the MR detector (up to 1&#8197;million) were also demonstrated.

We show wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced from 75 up to 1,000,000 via parametric pumping via active-feedback technique for RASER applications at 300&#8197;MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional MR detector.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has recently been shown that a bolus of hyperpolarized nuclear spins can yield stimulated emission signals similar in nature to maser signals, potentially enabling new ways of sensing hyperpolarized contrast media, including most notably [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]pyruvate that is under evaluation in over 50&#8197;clinical trials for metabolic imaging of cancer. The stimulated NMR signal emissions lasting for minutes do not require radio-frequency excitation, offering unprecedented advantages compared to conventional MR sensing. However, creating nuclear spin maser emission is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive MR detectors. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced 22-fold (to 1,670) via parametric pumping. This active-feedback technique breaks the intrinsic fundamental limit of NMR detector circuit quality factor. We show the use of parametric pumping to reduce the threshold requirement for inducing nuclear spin masing at 300&#8197;MHz resonance frequency in a preclinical MRI scanner. Indeed, stimulated emission from hyperpolarized protons was obtained under highly unfavorable conditions of low magnetic field homogeneity (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* of 3&#8197;ms). Greater gains of the quality factor of the MR detector (up to 1&#8197;million) were also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts: High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Element Combinations in Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an innovative method for accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in Pt&#8208;based quinary high&#8208;entropy alloys, utilizing large&#8208;scale language model, microscale printing, pulsed high&#8208;temperature synthesis, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy, and density functional theory calculations. This offers a new avenue for the discovery of multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.







Abstract
The vast number of element combinations and the explosive growth of composition space pose significant challenges to the development of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Here, we propose a procedural research method aimed at accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on Pt&#8208;based quinary HEAs. The method begins with an element library provided by a large language model (LLM), combined with microscale precursor printing and pulse high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques to prepare multi&#8208;element combination HEA array in one step. Through high&#8208;throughput measurement using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), precise identification of highly active HEA element combinations and exploration of composition space for a specific combination are achieved. Advantageous element combinations are further validated in practical electrocatalytic evaluations. The contributions of individual element sites and the synergistic effects among elements of such HEAs in enhancing reaction activity are elucidated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This method integrates high&#8208;throughput experiments, practical catalyst validation, and DFT calculations, providing a new pathway for accelerating the discovery of efficient multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.

         <title>Constructing Microporous Ion Exchange Membranes via Simple Hypercrosslinking for pH&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economically feasible strategy, simple hypercrosslinking, is proposed to construct ion exchange membranes with microporosity. The presented membranes balance well with high ion conductivity and high ion selectivity and show superiority in process simplicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and anti&#8208;swelling, thus enabling high&#8208;efficiency and stable cycling of pH&#8208;neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries.







Abstract
Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) play a critical role in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). Traditional IEMs that feature microphase&#8208;separated microstructures are well&#8208;developed and easily available but suffer from the conductivity/selectivity tradeoff. The emerging charged microporous polymer membranes show the potential to overcome this tradeoff, yet their commercialization is still hindered by tedious syntheses and demanding conditions. We herein combine the advantages of these two types of membrane materials via simple in situ hypercrosslinking of conventional IEMs into microporous ones. Such a concept is exemplified by the very cheap commercial quaternized polyphenylene oxide membrane. The hypercrosslinking treatment turns poor&#8208;performance membranes into high&#8208;performance ones, as demonstrated by the above 10&#8208;fold selectivity enhancement and much&#8208;improved conductivities that more than doubled. This turn is also confirmed by the effective and stable pH&#8208;neutral AORFB with decreased membrane resistance and at least an order of magnitude lower capacity loss rate. This battery shows advantages over other reported AORFBs in terms of a low capacity loss rate (0.0017&#8201;% per cycle) at high current density. This work provides an economically feasible method for designing AORFB&#8208;oriented membranes with microporosity.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Glutathione Assembly Supported on ZIF&#8208;8 as Robust and Efficient Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu(I)&#8208;glutathione polymer supported on ZIF&#8208;8 is a robust catalyst for the efficient carboxylation of terminal alkynes and the cyclization of propargylamine with CO2 under atmospheric pressure and mild conditions with a wide range of substrates, converting them into high value&#8208;added chemicals, with strong positive synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst is reused at least 10&#8197;times without significant reduction in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;glutathione (GSH) redox system, essential in biology, is designed here as a supramacromolecular assembly in which the tetrahedral 18e Cu(I) center loses a thiol ligand upon adsorption onto ZIF&#8208;8, as shown by EXAFS and DFT calculation, to generate a very robust 16e planar trigonal single&#8208;atom Cu(I) catalyst. Synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8, revealed by catalytic experiments and DFT calculation, affords CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals with a wide scope of substrates by reaction with terminal alkynes or propargyl amines in excellent yields under mild conditions and reuse at least 10&#8197;times without significant decrease in catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Thioesters from Aryl Halides and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical method for synthesizing thioesters from readily available aryl halides and carboxylic acids is here disclosed. This thiol&#8208;free protocol hinges on the direct excitation of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylthiourea and its multifaceted ability to act as the sulfur source, generate aryl radicals upon SET activation of halides, and trap them to in situ produce reactive isothiouronium ions.







Abstract
Thioesters are important in synthesis, materials science, and biology, and their preparation traditionally relies on the use of disagreeable thiols. Here, we report a thiol&#8208;free protocol that stitches together widespread carboxylic acids and aryl halides, producing a diverse array of thioesters. Crucial to this strategy is the discovery that tetramethylthiourea can serve as both a sulfur source and, upon direct excitation by purple light, as a strong reductant, suitable for activating aryl halides via single&#8208;electron transfer. Coupling of the resulting aryl radicals provides an isothiouronium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by carboxylic acids via a polar pathway, affording the thioester products under mild conditions.

Molecules bearing carboxylic acid, amide, and hydroxyl groups are ubiquitous in crystal engineering, where robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded synthons centred on these functionalities enable reliable crystal structure design. We now show that halogen bonding to the carbon &#960;&#8208;system of such molecules, traditionally ignored in crystal engineering, permits the recognition and directional assembly of the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded structural subunits, leaving the archetypal hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring, ladder, and chain homosynthons intact, but repositioned in space. When applied to heteromolecular synthons, this enables rearranging more complex hydrogen&#8208;bonded motifs and the evolution of binary cocrystals into ternary ones through &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon&#8208;based recognition sites, demonstrating a rational approach to build higher&#8208;order solid&#8208;state supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Wittig Reaction by Phosphorus PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the atroposelective Wittig reaction enabled by PIII/PV=O redox catalysis. An endogenous base release compatible with Lewis acid co&#8208;catalysis thereby generates the ylide intermediates. The mild, chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction allows the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomers with enantioselectivities of up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is renowned as exceptionally versatile method for converting a diversity of aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. Recently, strategies for chiral phosphine catalysis under PIII/PV=O redox cycling emerged to render this venerable transformation stereoselective. Herein, we describe that phosphine redox catalysis enables the enantioselective synthesis of pertinent biaryl atropisomers by means of a stereocontrolled arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction. Key to the process is the release of an endogenous base from readily accessible tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonylated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts triggered by catalyst intramolecularization, permitting mild phosphine redox catalysis for atroposelective Wittig reactions. By this strategy, a broad diversity of biaryl atropisomers is obtained with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 enantioselectivity.

         <title>exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;Substituted Pentabenzocorannulene: Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene, a new buckybowl bearing an internal sp3 carbon atom in the backbone, unexpectedly exhibits wide absorption and emission bands. The methyl group is exclusively located at the convex surface, bolstering the bowl geometry. All molecules form unidirectional bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking to generate polar crystals.







Abstract
exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene (exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me) was synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,2,3&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene. Its bowl&#8208;shaped geometry with an sp3 carbon atom in the backbone and a methyl group located at the convex (exo) face was verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. According to DFT calculations, the observed conformer is energetically more favorable than the endo one by 39.9&#8197;kcal/mol. Compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped analogs with intact &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones (see the main text), exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me displayed a deeper bowl depth (avg. 1.93&#8197;&#197;), redshifted and broader absorption (250&#8211;620&#8197;nm) and emission (from 585 to more than 850&#8197;nm) bands and a smaller optical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (2.01&#8197;eV). exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me formed polar crystals where all bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking with close &#960;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; contacts is arranged unidirectionally, providing the potential for applications as organic semiconductors and pyroelectric materials. This unusual structural feature, molecular packing, and properties are most likely associated with the assistance of the methyl group and the sp3 carbon atom in the backbone.

         <title>Synthesis of Secondary Boronates via Deaminative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Nitroso Carbamates and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the coupling of N&#8208;nitroso carbamates with organo boronic acids is presented. The method allows for the formal deaminative coupling of widely available amines. In particular, the coupling of lysine is presented, which allows for the synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids.







Abstract
A strategy for transition metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl nitroso&#8208;carbamates and boronic acids is reported. The N&#8208;nitroso carbamates are easily prepared from the corresponding amine in two simple steps. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide variety of secondary boronates, benzylic boronates and formal Csp3&#8722;Csp2 cross&#8208;coupling products under operationally simple conditions. Functional group tolerance is also demonstrated and applied in the modification of lysine to make non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

         <dc:description>
In this communication, we report two novel intrinsically liquid crystalline metal halide perovskite&#8208;like materials by utilizing fluorinated ionic liquid crystalline (FILC) mesogens based on polyfluorinated alkylimidazolium cations. Manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions were found to be essential for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of the perovskite&#8208;like structures. This study may pave the way towards a new class of perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.







Abstract
Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskites (HOIHPs) represent an emerging class of semiconducting materials, widely employed in a variety of optoelectronic applications. Despite their skyrocket growth in the last decade, a detailed understanding on their structure&#8211;property relationships is still missing. In this communication, we report two unprecedented perovskite&#8208;like materials based on polyfluorinated imidazolium cations. The two materials show thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior resulting in the emergence of stable mesophases. The manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions are shown to be meaningful for the stabilization of both the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of these perovskite&#8208;like materials. Moreover, the structure of the incorporated imidazolium cation was found to tune the properties of the liquid crystalline phase. Collectively, these results may pave the way for the design of a new class of halide perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.

         <title>Adaptive Helical Chirality in Supramolecular Microcrystals for Circularly Polarized Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral supramolecular interaction strategy is proposed to synthesize organic microcrystals with adaptive helical chirality for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission.







Abstract
Chiral organic molecules offer a promising platform for exploring circularly polarized lasing, which, however, faces a great challenge that the spatial separation of molecular chiral and luminescent centers limits chiroptical activity. Here we develop a helically chiral supramolecular system with completely overlapped chiral and luminescent units for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. Adaptive helical chirality is obtained by incorporating chiral agents into organic microcrystals. Benefiting from the efficient coupling of stimulated emission with the adaptive helical chirality, the supramolecular microcrystals enable high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission with dissymmetry factors up to ~0.7. This work opens up the way to rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Approach to Promoting Photocatalysis Based on Consecutive Photo&#8208;Induced Electron&#8208;Transfer Processes via Efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the host&#8211;guest approach to promoting photoactivation of aryl halides based on the conPET process via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from host to encapsulated rhodamine 6G (Rh&#8208;6G). Highly efficient FRET makes the supramolecular system an efficient catalyst for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides under mild conditions within a short time (1&#8211;4&#8197;h), even in an air atmosphere.







Abstract
Supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8211;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal&#8208;organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8211;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8211;guest complex renders the cage&#8208;based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.

         <title>Enhancement of Low Temperature Superionic Conductivity by Suppression of Li Site Ordering in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isovalent substitution of Ge4+ for Si4+ in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I is observed for x&#8804;1.2. Control of unit cell volume via this substitution enhances Li+ site disorder beyond Li7Si2S7I. This extensive disorder is stabilised to 30&#8197;K with very low activation energies observed by 7Li NMR, yielding low temperature Li+ transport in highly substituted (x=1 &amp; 1.2) materials that is comparable to best&#8208;in&#8208;class solid&#8208;state electrolytes.







Abstract
Ge4+ substitution into the recently discovered superionic conductor Li7Si2S7I is demonstrated by synthesis of Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I, where x&#8804;1.2. The anion packing and tetrahedral silicon location of Li7Si2S7I are retained upon substitution. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that substitution of larger Ge4+ for Si4+ expands the unit cell volume and further increases Li+ site disorder, such that Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I has one Li+ site more (sixteen in total) than Li7Si2S7I. The ionic conductivity of Li7Si0.8Ge1.2S7I (x=1.2) at 303&#8197;K is 1.02(3)&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with low activation energies for Li+ transport demonstrated over a wide temperature range by AC impedance and 7Li NMR spectroscopy. All sixteen Li+ sites remain occupied to temperatures as low as 30&#8197;K in Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I as a result of the structural expansion. This differs from Li7Si2S7I, where the partial Li+ site ordering observed below room temperature reduces the ionic conductivity. The suppression of Li+ site depopulation by Ge4+ substitution retains the high mobility to temperatures as low as 200&#8197;K, yielding low temperature performance comparable with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li+ ion conducting materials.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8722;N Axially Chiral Aminophosphines via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral P,N ligands were synthesized through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ATH of in situ generated iminophosphines. The transient interaction between iminium and phosphine groups as a Lewis acid&#8208;base pair causes the labilization of the stereogenic axis, enabling the scenario for a DKR. The reaction proceeds with good to high yields and reaching up to 99&#8201;% ee across a range of substrates, including both dicyclohexyl&#8208; and diphenylphosphino derivatives.







Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination via asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) has been used to perform an efficient dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of N&#8208;aryl 2&#8208;formyl pyrroles decorated with a phosphine moiety positioned at the ortho&#8217; position. The strategy relies on the labilization of the stereogenic axis in the substrate facilitated by a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the carbonyl carbon and the phosphorus center. The reaction features broad substrate scope of aliphatic amines and N&#8208;aryl pyrrole scaffolds, and proceeds under very mild conditions to afford P,N atropisomers in good to high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) for both diphenyl and dicyclohexylphosphino derivatives.

         <title>Enantioselective Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Sulfilimines Enabled by Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8211;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl diazonium salt to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters was developed. This strategy offers a general, modular and divergent platform for rapid synthesis of chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups have garnered considerable attention due to their common occurrence in ligands, pharmaceuticals, and insecticides. Nevertheless, enantioselective synthesis of sulfilimines, particularly diaryl sulfilimines remains a challenging and persistent goal. Herein we report a highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8211;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl diazonium salt to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters by Pd catalysis. Bisphosphine ligands bearing sulfinamide groups play a crucial role in achieving high reactivity and selectivity. This approach provides a general, modular and divergent framework for quickly synthesizing chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise challenging to access. In addition, the origins of the high chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity were extensively investigated using density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen in Photocatalytic Gas&#8211;Solid Reactions: Participator vs. Dominator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a dual&#8208;pathway reaction mechanism of lattice oxygen (OL) participation and molecular oxygen oxidation, Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst exhibits efficient complete oxidation of ppm&#8208;level methane and OL plays a dominant role in this reaction. Single&#8208;atom Ru accelerates the O2 activation to &#8901;O2&#8722; and the regeneration of consumed OL during reaction.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen activation has emerged as a popular strategy for optimizing the performance and selectivity of oxide&#8208;based thermocatalysis and electrolysis. However, the significance of lattice oxygen in oxide photocatalysts has been ignored, particularly in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Here, using methane oxidation over a Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst as the prototypical reaction and via 18O isotope labelling techniques, we found that lattice oxygen can directly participate in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Lattice oxygen played a dominant role in the photocatalytic reaction, as determined by estimating the kinetic constants in the initial stage. Furthermore, we discovered that dynamic diffusion between O2 and lattice oxygen proceeded even in the absence of targeted reactants. Finally, single&#8208;atom Ru can facilitate the activation of adsorbed O2 and the subsequent regeneration of consumed lattice oxygen, thus ensuring high catalyst activity and stability. The results provide guidance for next&#8208;generation oxide photocatalysts with improved activities and selectivities.

         <title>Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Reprograms Cellular Metabolism to Enhance Photodynamic Therapy and Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer was anchored with the metabolic reprogramming agent 3&#8208;bromopyruvate to enhance photodynamic therapy and antitumor immunity by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to elicit antitumor immunity, reject tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevent lung metastasis.







Abstract
Abnormal cancer metabolism causes hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which limits the antitumor efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we report a photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with anchored 3&#8208;bromopyruvate (BrP), BrP@MOL, as a metabolic reprogramming agent to enhance PDT and antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation during PDT and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to enhance antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL&#8208;mediated PDT inhibited tumor growth by &gt;90&#8201;% with 40&#8201;% of mice being tumor&#8208;free, rejected tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevented lung metastasis. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade potently regressed the tumors with &gt;98&#8201;% tumor inhibition and 80&#8201;% of mice being tumor&#8208;free.

         <title>Depolymerization of Native Lignin over Thiol Capped Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Microbelts Mediated by Photogenerated Thiyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depolymerization of native lignin for the production of functionalized aromatics was realized over irradiated colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 microbelts. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible colloidization&#8208;aggregation for both efficient reaction and facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for the generation of RS&#8901; for selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin.







Abstract
The valorization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic compounds under visible light is appealing yet challenging. In this communication, colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) microbelts was successfully fabricated, which was used as a superior catalyst for depolymerization of native lignin in birch woodmeal under visible light, with an optimum yield of 28.8&#8197;wt&#8201;% to functionalized aromatic monomers achieved in 8&#8197;h. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible interchange of ZIS between the colloidal state for efficient reaction and the aggregated state for facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for light initiated generation of reactive thiyl radical for highly selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bond in native lignin. This work provides a green and efficient strategy for the depolymerization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic monomers under mild conditions, which involves a new mechanism for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin. The capability of cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin by photogenerated thiyl radicals also demonstrates the great potential of using photogenerated thiyl radicals in organics transformations.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis of Vinyl Copolymer Carrying Boron Directly Connected to Backbone: Catalytic Esterification through Cooperation of Boron with Neighboring Carboxylic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester and maleic anhydride was found to work as a catalyst for direct esterification of alcohol and carboxylic acid. The key to the unprecedented catalytic activity was the activation of carboxylic anhydride by adjacent boron, and the catalytic function through the cooperation of side chains would collect attention as the simple mimic of enzyme.







Abstract
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin) and maleic anhydride (MAH) was found to catalyze direct dehydrative esterification of carboxylic acid and alcohol. The key to the catalytic function is the activation of the MAH unit by the neighboring Lewis acidic boron directly connected to the backbone through the formation of five&#8208;membered ring. The effects of the side&#8208;chain cooperation were clarified through comparisons with the polymers having similar structures and a conventional titanium catalyst as well as the analyses of reactions with carboxylic acid or alcohol. The catalytic activity was enhanced as the molecular weight was higher, which is owing to the structural feature that boron is directly attached to the backbone. The cooperative catalysis is of interest because of its conceptual similarity with enzyme.

         <title>Chirality Interplay between the Interior and Exterior of Metal&#8211;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple stereogenic elements have been embedded into M2L4 metal&#8211;organic cages to control the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages, i.e. within and beyond the first coordination sphere.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic cages featuring two stereogenic elements, in terms of the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges, were exploited. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages. The chirality information induced by a chiral guest inside the cage cavity can pass through the cage framework and influence the orientation of the diazaanthracene segments on the periphery of the cage. In turn, the chirality of a stereogenic center within the diazaanthracene segments can transfer back into the cavity, enabling discrimination of enantiomeric guests.

         <title>Bilateral Unsymmetrical Disulfurating Reagent Design for Polysulfide Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stable and odorless bilateral disulfurating reagents with two divergent mask groups has been established. Diverse arylboronic acids and carbon/nitrogen/sulfur nucleophiles can be sequentially assembled on both sides of a S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Polysulfides are significant compounds in life science, pharmaceutical science, and materials science. Therefore, polysulfide construction is in great demand. The controllable sequential installation of groups on both ends of a S&#8722;S motif faces an enormous challenge owing to the reversible nature of the covalent S&#8722;S bond. A library was established with two divergent mask groups for bilateral unsymmetrical disulfurating reagents (R1O&#8722;SS&#8722;SO2R2). Sequential coupling with preferential activation of the S&#8722;SO2 bond (37.6&#8197;kcal/mol) and controllable activation of the S&#8722;O bond (54.8&#8197;kcal/mol) in the presence of the S&#8722;S bond (62.0&#8197;kcal/mol) enabled successive reactions at each end of the S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides and trisulfides, even for the cross&#8208;linkage of natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides, and a protein (bovine serum albumin).

         <title>Structural Modulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have adeptly optimized the ORR process through strategic engineering of COFs, effectively transitioning the reaction from a four&#8208;electron pathway to a two&#8208;electron pathway. Significantly, when implemented within a flow cell apparatus, the COF augmented with ionic salt (JUC&#8208;660) demonstrated consistent productivity, maintaining a H2O2 yield rate in excess of 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an extended operational period more than 85&#8197;hours. This performance solidifies its status as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed catalysts reported to date.







Abstract
The electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using metal&#8208;free catalysts has emerged as a viable and sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, the precise architectural design of these electrocatalysts poses a significant challenge, requiring intricate structural engineering to optimize electron transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we introduce a novel design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that effectively shift the ORR from a four&#8208;electron to a more advantageous two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, the JUC&#8208;660 COF, with strategically charge&#8208;modified benzyl moieties, achieved a continuous high H2O2 yield of over 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an impressive duration of over 85&#8197;hours in a flow cell setting, marking it as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed H2O2 electrocatalysts reported to date. Theoretical computations alongside in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that JUC&#8208;660 markedly diminishes the adsorption of the OOH* intermediate, thereby steering the ORR towards the desired pathway. Furthermore, the versatility of JUC&#8208;660 was demonstrated through its application in the electro&#8208;Fenton reaction, where it efficiently and rapidly removed aqueous contaminants. This work delineates a pioneering approach to altering the ORR pathway, ultimately paving the way for the development of highly effective metal&#8208;free H2O2 electrocatalysts.
