         <title>Continuous Modulation of Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Activities of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts through p&#8211;n Junction Rectification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fine&#8208;tuning single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to surpass their activity limit remains challenging at such an atomic scale. Herein, we exploit p&#8208;type semiconducting character of the SACs having metal center coordinated to nitrogen donors (MeN x ) and rectify their local charge density by an n&#8208;type semiconductor support. With iron phthalocyanine (FePc) as model SAC, introducing an n&#8208;type gallium monosulfide that features low work function generates a space&#8208;charged region across the junction interface, and causes distortion of the FeN4 moiety and spin state transition in the Fe(II) center. This catalyst shows an over two&#8208;fold higher specific oxygen&#8208;reduction activity than that of pristine FePc. We further employ other three n&#8208;type metal chalcogenides of varying work function as support, and discover a linear correlation between the activities of the supported FeN4 and the rectification degrees, which clearly indicates that SACs can be continuously tuned by this rectification strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of Csp3&#8211;Csp3 Bonds Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters by Synergistic Palladium and Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic catalysis has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for stereodivergent formation of Csp3&#8211;Csp3 bonds bearing vicinal stereocenters. Despite the many successes that have been achieved in this field, stereodivergent Csp3&#8211;Csp3 coupling reactions involving stabilized nucleophiles remain challenging because of the competing single&#8208;catalysis pathway. Herein, we report a synergistic palladium/phase&#8208;transfer catalyst system that enables diastereodivergent Csp3&#8211;Csp3 coupling reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes with stabilized nucleophile oxindoles. Both the syn and anti coupling products, bearing quaternary and tertiary vicinal stereocenters, could be selectively produced in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Non&#8208;covalent activation of the stabilized nucleophile via chiral ion pair in a biphasic system is a crucial success factor in achieving diastereodivergence.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Structure and Dynamics Landscape of Proteins in Mammalian Cells Revealed by In&#8208;Cell NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Governing function, half life and subcellular localization, the 3D structure and dynamics of proteins are in nature constantly changing in a tightly regulated manner to fulfill the physiological and adaptive requirements of the cells. To find evidence for this hypothesis, we applied in&#8208;cell NMR to three folded model proteins and propose that the splitting of cross peaks constitutes an atomic fingerprint of distinct structural states that arise from multiple target binding co&#8208;existing inside mammalian cells. These structural states change upon protein loss of function or subcellular localisation into distinct cell compartments. In addition to peak splitting, we observed NMR signal intensity attenuations indicative of transient interactions with other molecules and dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Electrolyte Design for Rechargeable Batteries: From Lithium to Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental physical and electrochemical properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are scrutinized with particular attention paid to the similarity and difference between Mg&#8208;ion and the popular Li&#8208;ion based electrolytes. The Review was written with the intension of accelerating the development of sustainable and high&#8208;performance battery technologies.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as one of the most viable battery chemistries amongst the &#8220;post&#8221; lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technologies owing to their high volumetric capacity and the natural abundance of their key elements. The fundamental properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are of essence to regulate the overall performance of RMBs. In this Review, the basic electrochemistry of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes batteries is discussed and compared to that of the Li&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes, and a comprehensive overview of the development of different Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is provided. In addition, the remaining challenges and possible solutions for future research are intensively discussed. The present work is expected to give an impetus to inspire the discovery of key electrolytes and thereby improve the electrochemical performances of RMBs and other related emerging battery technologies.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tight Host&#8208;Guest Binding with Exceptionally Strong Positive Cooperativity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complexation of DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests with a rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle exhibits remarkably high binding affinities with positive cooperativity that is among the strongest for synthetic host&#8211;guest systems. The ultra&#8208;tight binding and extraordinary positive cooperativity are driven by size/shape host&#8211;guest matching, guest&#8208;activated stacking of macrocycles, and multiple charge&#8208;dipole and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions.







Abstract
Cooperativity plays a critical role in self&#8208;assembly and molecular recognition. A rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle with a cyclodirectional backbone binds with DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio in high affinities (Ktotal &#8776;1013&#8197;M&#8722;2) in the highly polar DMF. The host&#8211;guest binding also exhibits exceptionally strong positive cooperativity quantified by interaction factors &#945; that are among the largest for synthetic host&#8211;guest systems. The unusually strong positive cooperativity, revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fully corroborated by mass spectrometry, NMR and computational studies, is driven by guest&#8208;induced stacking of the macrocycles and stabilization from the alkyl end chains of the guests, interactions that appear upon binding the second macrocycle. With its tight binding driven by extraordinary positive cooperativity, this host&#8211;guest system provides a tunable platform for studying molecular interactions and for constructing stable supramolecular assemblies.

A photochemically induced selective and divergent cyanation reaction of alkynes, enabled by phosphorus radicals, is described.

         <title>Porous Liquids Responsive to Light
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type&#8197;II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) with permanent cavities is formed by dissolving Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) in bulky ionic liquid .The MOP carries azobenzene moieties as pendant groups which undergo trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;isomerization under visible and UV light irradiation and thus, a controlled CO2 uptake and release is realized.







Abstract
A porous liquid is a unique liquid medium that combines the cavity of porous solids with the fluidity of liquids. This special characteristic offers potential in various applications. Here we report a type&#8197;II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) from dissolving a photoresponsive metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (PMOP, constructed from dicopper and azobenzene&#8208;containing carboxylate) in a polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;functionalized bulky ionic liquid (IL). Owing to favorable ion interactions, bulky IL molecules encircle outside PMOP, and the inter cavities are maintained. The azobenzene moieties can be isomerized freely in the PPILs to expose and shelter active sites upon visible and UV light irradiation. Hence, the adsorption capacity of PPILs is controllable by light irradiation, and the change in CO2 uptake is up to 30&#8201;% compared to neat IL. This study may inspire the development of new adsorption process regulated by light instead of pressure and temperature swing adsorption.

         <title>Facet&#8208;specific Active Surface Regulation of BixMOy (M=Mo, V, W) Nanosheets for Boosted Photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports (010) specific surface&#8208;regulated Bi2MoO6 nanosheets. The modified surface exhibits boosted CO2 photoreduction because of increased activation/adsorption of CO2 molecules. A combination of advanced characterizations and theoretical simulation confirmed performance and mechanism.







Abstract
Photocatalytic performance can be optimized via introduction of reactive sites. However, it is practically difficult to engineer these on specific photocatalyst surfaces, because of limited understanding of atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity. Here we report a facile sonication&#8208;assisted chemical reduction for specific facets regulation via oxygen deprivation on Bi&#8208;based photocatalysts. The modified Bi2MoO6 nanosheets exhibit 61.5 and 12.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO and CH4 production respectively, &#8776;3 times greater than for pristine catalyst, together with excellent stability/reproducibility of &#8776;20&#8197;h. By combining advanced characterizations and simulation, we confirm the reaction mechanism on surface&#8208;regulated photocatalysts, namely, induced defects on highly&#8208;active surface accelerate charge separation/transfer and lower the energy barrier for surface CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction. Promisingly, this method appears generalizable to a wider range of materials.

         <title>Correlation between Electrolyte Chemistry and Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Reversible Ca Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unravel the unique electrolyte chemistry in Ca metal anodes to tailor the solid electrolyte interphases characteristics, leading to the design of several promising electrolyte formulations for the reversible Ca deposition/stripping under a commercially available salt calcium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. In particular, 1&#8208;methylimidazole (MeIm)&#8208; and dimethylacetamide (DMAc)&#8208; based electrolytes allow stable cycling with low overpotentials.







Abstract
The development of rechargeable Ca metal batteries (RCMBs) is hindered by the Ca2+ passivating solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). The cation solvation structure dictated by electrolyte chemistry plays a critical role in the SEIs properties. While a relatively weak cation&#8208;solvent binding is preferred in Li metal anodes to promote anion&#8208;derived SEIs, we demonstrate an enhanced Ca deposition/stripping reversibility under a strong cation&#8208;solvent interaction, which is materialized in strongly&#8208;solvating solvent and highly&#8208;dissociated salt combinations. Such electrolyte formulations benefit the formation of solvent&#8208;occupied solvation structure and minimize the anion reduction, resulting in organic&#8208;rich/CaF2&#8208;poor SEIs for reversible Ca metal anodes. Furthermore, RCMBs paired with an organic cathode using the optimized electrolytes are demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Our work reveals the paradigm shift in SEIs design for Ca metal anodes, opening up new opportunities for emerging RCMBs.

         <title>Coordination Switch Drives Selective C&#8722;S Bond Formation by the Non&#8208;Heme Sulfoxide Synthases
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calculations suggest that a coordination switch of the sulfoxide intermediate is involved in the catalysis of ergothioneine synthase (EgtB). This coordination switch from S to O is driven by the S/&#960; nonbonding electrostatic interactions, which efficiently promotes the observed stereoselective C&#8722;S bond formation while bypassing cysteine dioxygenation.







Abstract
The non&#8208;heme iron ergothioneine synthase (EgtB) is a sulfoxide synthase that catalyzes oxidative C&#8722;S bond formation in the synthesis of ergothioneine, which plays roles against oxidative stress in cells. Despite extensive experimental and computational studies of the catalytic mechanisms of EgtB, the root causes for the selective C&#8722;S bond formation remain elusive. Using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, we show herein that a coordination switch of the sulfoxide intermediate is involved in the catalysis of the non&#8208;heme iron EgtB. This coordination switch from the S to the O atom is driven by the S/&#960; electrostatic interactions, which efficiently promotes the observed stereoselective C&#8722;S bond formation while bypassing cysteine dioxygenation. The present mechanism is in agreement with all available experimental data, including regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and KIE results. This match underscores the critical role of coordination switching in the catalysis of non&#8208;heme enzymes.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Kinetic States of a [2]Rotaxane&#8208;Based Molecular Shuttle Controlled by Acid Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;based molecular shuttle with an acid&#8208;responsive asymmetric macrocycle on a symmetric dumbbell axle has been synthesized. The shuttling kinetics can be controlled by the acid concentration and the kinetic intermediate can even be captured at a high concentration of acid. This was explained by invoking different protonation states of the rotaxane at different concentrations of acid.







Abstract
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;based molecular shuttle with an acid&#8208;responsive asymmetric macrocycle on a symmetric dumbbell axle is reported. Upon adding TFA, the macrocycle, namely the amine naphthotube, is protonated and translocates from the di(quaternary ammonium) station to the triazole stations because of electrostatic repulsion and weakened binding. The shuttling kinetics are slow due to the steric hindrance caused by the ethyl group on the quaternary ammonium center and can be followed by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, it was found that the shuttling kinetics depends on the concentration of TFA. A kinetic intermediate was detected and can even be captured in the presence of a high concentration of TFA. Extensive control experiments revealed that the shuttling kinetics and the capture of the kinetic intermediate are related to the different protonation states of the rotaxanes.

         <title>(Salen)Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogen Atom Transfer for Epoxides Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic and asymmetric hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction is achieved through a sequential (salen)TiIII&#8208;initiated radical generation and (salen)TiIV&#8208;induced enantioselective HAT process. It enables an enantioconvergent approach from readily accessible racemic glycidic esters and amides to synthetically valuable enantioenriched formal formaldehyde aldol products with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.Asymmetric hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) represents arguably one of the most straightforward access to the significant chiral tertiary carbon centers, however, remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, the first example of catalytic coordination&#8208;induced asymmetric HAT reaction has been developed relying on a sequential (salen)TiIII&#8208;initiated radical generation and (salen)TiIV&#8208;controlled enantioselective HAT process. The reaction transforms easily accessible glycidic esters, thioesters and amides to synthetically valuable formal formaldehyde aldol adducts in an enantioconvergent manner, along with broad scope and highly regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Programmed Separation of Hexane Isomers by a Porous Calcium Chloranilate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel calcium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework shows temperature&#8208; and adsorbate&#8208;dependent adsorption of hexane isomers with different branching, leading to temperature&#8208;programmed separation of the isomers as a function of different degrees of branching.







Abstract
The full separation of alkane isomers as a function of different degrees of branching remains a daunting challenge due to its stringent requirement with respect to pore dimensions of the adsorbents. In this work, we report a novel microporous coordination network built on calcium (II) and chloranilate. The compound has a flexible framework and exhibits temperature&#8208;dependent adsorption behavior toward hexane isomers. At 30&#8201;&#176;C, it accommodates substantial amounts of linear and monobranched hexanes but fully excludes their dibranched isomer, and at elevated temperatures such as 150&#8201;&#176;C, it acts as a splitter for linear and branched alkanes. Its capability of efficient discrimination of hexane isomers as a function of branching is verified by experimental breakthrough measurements. Ab initio calculations have uncovered the underlying selective size&#8208;exclusion separation mechanism.

         <title>Nanoporous Single&#8208;Crystalline Oxide Catalysts for Preferential Oxidation of CO in H2 with an Ultra&#8208;wide Temperature Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we fabricate porous single&#8208;crystalline oxide monoliths with deposited Pt clusters to create interfacial system for efficient and durable preferential oxidation of CO in H2 with ultra&#8208;wide temperature window.







Abstract
Preferential oxidation of CO in H2 (PROX) reaction is a promising solution to the on&#8208;board purification of CO&#8208;contaminated H2 fuel for use in next&#8208;generation proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). However, achieving high CO selectivity, activity and structural stability across the wide temperature window remains a great challenge. Herein, we fabricate centimeter scale interfacial PROX catalysts grown from nanoporous single&#8208;crystalline Pr2O3 and Nd2O3 monoliths with lattice surface&#8208;deposited Pt clusters at nanoscale. We demonstrate complete and selective removal of CO in H2 over an unprecedented wide temperature window (253&#8211;403&#8197;K). The monoliths are integrated with an operational PEMFC to purify the H2 fuel contaminated with CO (30&#8197;ppm) and enable stable power output for &gt;400&#8197;h; over two thousand times longer than without. This work demonstrates that the nanoporous single&#8208;crystalline oxide monoliths can simultaneously achieve the stability and overall performance required to realize practically useful PEMFCs.

         <title>Zirconium Carbide Mediates Coke&#8208;Resistant Methane Dry Reforming on Nickel&#8208;Zirconium Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
Zr&#8208;Carbide promoted Methane Dry Reforming on NixZry: Graphitic deposits anti&#8208;segregate into Ni0 nanoparticles to provide restored CH4 adsorption sites and near&#8208;surface/dissolved C atoms, which migrate toward the Ni0/ZrO2 interface and induce local ZrxCy formation. The resulting oxygen&#8208;deficient carbidic phase boundary sites assist in kinetically enhanced CO2 activation toward CO(g).







Abstract
Graphitic deposits anti&#8208;segregate into Ni0 nanoparticles to provide restored CH4 adsorption sites and near&#8208;surface/dissolved C atoms, which migrate to the Ni0/ZrO2 interface and induce local ZrxCy formation. The resulting oxygen&#8208;deficient carbidic phase boundary sites assist in the kinetically enhanced CO2 activation toward CO(g). This interface carbide mechanism allows for enhanced spillover of carbon to the ZrO2 support, and represents an alternative catalyst regeneration pathway with respect to the reverse oxygen spillover on Ni&#8208;CeZrxOy catalysts. It is therefore rather likely on supports with limited oxygen storage/exchange kinetics but significant carbothermal reducibility.

         <title>Overcoming Electrostatic Interaction via Strong Complexation for Highly Selective Reduction of CN&#8722; into N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interaction could severely inhibit the selective conversion of ions. This work proposes a strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via strong complexation, realizing the preferential hydrogenation of cyanide at the cathode, and then oxidizing the reduction products into nitrogen at the anode. The controlled mass transfer of ions provides more possibilities for their selective conversion in the electrocatalytic system.







Abstract
Limited by the electrostatic interaction, the oxidation reaction of cations at the anode and the reduction reaction of anions at the cathode in the electrocatalytic system nearly cannot be achieved. This study proposes a novel strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via strong complexation, realizing the electrocatalytic reduction of cyanide (CN&#8722;) at the cathode and then converting the generated reduction products into nitrogen (N2) at the anode. Theoretical calculations and experimental results confirm that the polarization of the transition metal oxide cathodes under the electric field causes the strong chemisorption between CN&#8722; and cathode, inducing the preferential enrichment of CN&#8722; to the cathode. CN&#8722; is hydrogenated by atomic hydrogen at the cathode to methylamine/ammonia, which are further oxidized into N2 by free chlorine derived from the anode. This paper provides a new idea for realizing the unconventional and unrealizable reactions in the electrocatalytic system.

         <title>Catalytic Reversible (De)hydrogenation To Rotate a Chemically Fueled Molecular Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most chemically fueled molecular switches suffer from the problem of waste accumulation inhibiting the system. Herein, we present a 180&#176; rotating molecular switch based on reversible (de)hydrogenation avoiding waste accumulation. Catalyzed by an iridium complex, switching from a pressure of argon to a pressure of hydrogen triggers a reversible change in the system from alcohol to ketone, promoting the rotation around an alkyne axis.

We report here the development of a rotating molecular switch based on metal&#8208;catalyzed reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation. Under an argon atmosphere, acceptorless dehydrogenation induces a switch from an alcohol to a ketone, while reversing to a hydrogen pressure switches back the system to the alcohol. Based on a tolane scaffold, such reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation enables 180&#176; rotation. The absence of waste accumulation in a switch relying on chemical stimuli is of great significance and could potentially be applied to the design of efficient complex molecular machines.

&lt;p&gt;Most chemically fueled molecular switches suffer from the problem of waste accumulation inhibiting the system. Herein, we present a 180&#176; rotating molecular switch based on reversible (de)hydrogenation avoiding waste accumulation. Catalyzed by an iridium complex, switching from a pressure of argon to a pressure of hydrogen triggers a reversible change in the system from alcohol to ketone, promoting the rotation around an alkyne axis.

&lt;p&gt;We report here the development of a rotating molecular switch based on metal-catalyzed reversible (de)-hydrogenation. Under an argon atmosphere, acceptorless dehydrogenation induces a switch from an alcohol to a ketone, while reversing to a hydrogen pressure switches back the system to the alcohol. Based on a tolane scaffold, such reversible (de)-hydrogenation enables 180&#176; rotation. The absence of waste accumulation in a switch relying on chemical stimuli is of great significance and could potentially be applied to the design of efficient complex molecular machines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Subporphyrin Free Bases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subporphyrin free bases, with bowl&#8208;like bent structures and distinct 14&#960;&#8208;aromaticity, have been synthesized by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies have revealed that the excited&#8208;state behaviors of the subporphyrin free bases are comparable to those of the corresponding BIII subporphyrins.







Abstract
BIII subporphyrins are the legitimate ring&#8208;contracted porphyrins consisting of three pyrroles and three meso&#8208;carbons and their chemistry has been extensively developed since the first synthesis in 2006. However, subporphyrin free bases have never been synthesized, despite tremendous attempts to remove the BIII ion. Here we report that Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diborylated tripyrrane 1 and tetrabromide 5 gave subporphyrin free bases 6, 6&#8201;A, and free base dimer 7 in 6&#8201;%, 4&#8201;%, and 2&#8201;% yields as the first examples. Subporphyrin free bases exhibit curved bowl&#8208;like structures and distinct 14&#960;&#8208;aromaticity. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy revealed that the excited&#8208;state behaviors of the subporphyrin free bases are comparable with those of the corresponding BIII subporphyrins. Rotational relaxation processes in the excited states have been revealed, which enhance the electronic interactions with the meso&#8208;aryl substituents and between the two subporphyrins.

         <title>Sonochemically&#8208;Induced Reduction of Alkenes to Alkanes with Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonia is used as a hydrogen source for the reduction of alkenes to alkanes. The originality stems from the use of cavitation bubbles that act as &#8220;microreactors&#8221; to break the N&#8722;H bond of NH3. As a result, this protocol does not involve any catalyst and it releases nitrogen (and partly hydrogen) as a sole co&#8208;product.







Abstract
With the progressive defossilization of our industry, hydrogen (H2) has been identified as a central molecule to store renewable electricity. In this context, ammonia (NH3) is now rapidly emerging as a promising hydrogen carrier for the future. This game change indirectly impacts the field of fine chemistry where hydrogenation reactions are widely deployed. In particular, the possibility of performing hydrogenation reactions using ammonia directly instead of hydrogen has become highly desirable but it remains a very difficult scientific task, which we address in this communication. Here we show that the N&#8722;H bond of NH3 can be cleaved within cavitation bubbles, generated by ultrasonic irradiation at a high frequency, leading to the in situ formation of a diimide, which then induces the hydrogenation of alkenes. Advantageously, this work does not involve any transition metal and releases N2 as a sole co&#8208;product.

         <title>Bioactive Ion&#8208;Based Switchable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the highly efficient information transmission of biologically active compounds in nerve systems, a well&#8208;controllable capture/release of biologically active ions is achieved by a switchable supercapacitor.







Abstract
Switchable supercapacitors (SCs) enable a reversible electrically&#8208;driven uptake/release of bioactive ions by polarizing porous carbon electrodes. Herein we demonstrate the first example of a bioactive ion&#8208;based switchable supercapacitor. Based on choline chloride and porous carbons we unravel the mechanism of physisorption vs. electrosorption by nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman, and impedance spectroscopy. Weak physisorption facilitates electrically&#8208;driven electrolyte depletion enabling the controllable uptake/release of electrolyte ions. A new 4&#8208;terminal device is proposed, with a main capacitor and a detective capacitor for monitoring bioactive ion adsorption in situ. Ion&#8208;concentration control in printed choline&#8208;based switchable SCs realizes switching down to 8.3&#8201;% residual capacitance. The exploration of adsorption mechanisms in printable microdevices will open an avenue of manipulating bioactive ions for the application of drug delivery, neuromodulation, or neuromorphic devices.

         <title>A Facile Structural Isomerization&#8208;Induced 3D Spatial D&#8208;A Interlocked Network for Achieving NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) were constructed based on a facile strategy of structural isomerization&#8208;induced 3D spatial donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) interlocked network packing. Outstanding NIR&#8208;II tiny capillary vasculature/tumor imaging ability and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic anti&#8208;cancer effect in vivo were achieved with 6MNVDPP NPs.







Abstract
The performances of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) depend on both molecular structure and molecular packing when used as nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we proposed a facile structural isomerization&#8208;induced 3D spatial donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) interlocked network for achieving NIR&#8208;II OPTAs. Two isomers, 4MNVDPP and 6MNVDPP were synthesized and formulated into NPs. 6MNVDPP, which has a larger electrostatic potential difference, exhibits a compact 3D spatial D&#8208;A interlocked network in the crystal form, while 4MNVDPP forms 2D D&#8208;D type J&#8208;aggregates. Thus, 6MNVDPP NPs show red&#8208;shifted NIR absorption and larger molar extinction coefficient than 4MNVDPP NPs. Thanks to the typical NIR&#8208;II emission, superior photothermal&#8208;stability, high photothermal conversion efficiency (89&#8201;%) and reactive oxygen species production capacity, 6MNVDPP NPs exhibit outstanding NIR&#8208;II tiny capillary vasculature/tumor imaging ability and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic anti&#8208;cancer effect in vivo.

         <title>Orthogonally Integrating Programmable Structural Color and Photo&#8208;Rewritable Fluorescence in Hydrazone Photoswitch&#8208;bonded Cholesteric Liquid Crystalline Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work realized construction of distinct visible and fluorescent patterns in a single freestanding photonic film by integrating water&#8208;swellable helical polymer matrix and fluorescence switchable molecular switch. The orthogonally dual responsiveness of the novel optical materials enabled fabrication of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption devices with superior safety and capacity.







Abstract
Design and fabrication of advanced security label showing superior performance in data encryption has attracted tremendous scientific interests. Especially, multifunctional optical labels capable of storing distinct information in different modes are highly demanded. Here, a fluorescent cholesteric liquid crystalline network (CLCN) film with programmable visible patterns and photo&#8208;rewritable fluorescent patterns was designed and prepared. The visible patterns were fixed by helical network and the colors of visible patterns were tunable by changing relative humidity (RH). The fluorescent patterns originated from dynamic isomerization of fluorescent hydrazones, exhibiting highly thermal stability and switching&#8208;ability controlled by light. The orthogonal construction of visible and fluorescent pattern enabled the novel CLCN to encrypt distinct information in reflective mode and in emissive mode, indicating its potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryptions.

&lt;p&gt;Design and fabrication of advanced security label showing superior performance in data encryption has attracted tremendous scientific interests. Especially, multifunctional optical labels capable of storing distinct information in different modes are highly demanded. Here, a fluorescent cholesteric liquid crystalline network (CLCN) film with programmable visible patterns and photo-rewritable fluorescent patterns was designed and prepared. The visible patterns were fixed by helical network and the colors of visible patterns were tunable by changing relative humidity (RH). The fluorescent patterns originated from dynamic isomerization of fluorescent hydrazones, exhibiting highly thermal stability and switching-ability controlled by light. The orthogonal construction of visible and fluorescent pattern enabled the novel CLCN to encrypt distinct information in reflective mode and in emissive mode, indicating its potential in anti-counterfeiting and information encryptions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Carbon Nitride Photoelectrodes with High Activity Toward Organic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;based photoelectrodes were produced by co&#8208;deposition of a blend of cyanamide&#8208;functionalized carbon nitride (NCNCNx) and indium tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles on top of thin, alumina&#8208;coated conducting FTO&#8208;glass. The composite photoanodes display benchmark photocurrents with a range of different alcohol substrates, a low onset potential, and an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) up to 60&#8201;% at 350&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Carbon nitride (CNx) is a light&#8208;absorber with excellent performance in photocatalytic suspension systems, but the activity of CNx photoelectrodes has remained low. Here, cyanamide&#8208;functionalized CNx (NCNCNx) was co&#8208;deposited with ITO nanoparticles on a 1.8&#8197;&#197; thick alumina&#8208;coated FTO electrode. Transient absorption spectroscopy and impedance measurements support that ITO acts as a conductive binder and improves electron extraction from the NCNCNx, whilst the alumina underlayer reduces recombination losses between the ITO and the FTO glass. The Al2O3|ITO&#8201;:&#8201;NCNCNx film displays a benchmark performance for CNx&#8208;based photoanodes with an onset of &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and 1.4&#177;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs RHE during AM1.5G irradiation for the selective oxidation of 4&#8208;methylbenzyl alcohol. This assembly strategy will improve the exploration of CNx in fundamental and applied photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies.

         <title>What X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Can Tell Us About the Active State of Earth&#8208;Abundant Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
</title>

         <dc:description>
Electrochemical methods and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy are powerful tools to understand electrocatalysis on an atomistic level, yet the combination of these methods still holds untapped potential.







Abstract
Implementation of chemical energy storage for a sustainable energy supply requires the rational improvement of electrocatalyst materials, for which their nature under reaction conditions needs to be revealed. For a better understanding of earth&#8208;abundant metal oxides as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the combination of electrochemical (EC) methods and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is very insightful, yet still holds untapped potential. Herein, we concisely introduce EC and XAS, providing the necessary framework to discuss changes that electrocatalytic materials undergo during preparation and storage, during immersion in an electrolyte, as well as during application of potentials, showing Mn oxides as examples. We conclude with a summary of how EC and XAS are currently combined to elucidate active states, as well as an outlook on opportunities to understand the mechanisms of electrocatalysis using combined operando EC&#8211;XAS experiments.

         <title>Unusual Scaffold Rearrangement in Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons Driven by Concerted Action of Single Gold Atoms on a Gold Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface synthesis of a polyaromatic hydrocarbon molecule is described. Mechanistically, the synthesis involves an unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage catalyzed by Au adatoms with a molecular scaffold rearrangement. This rearrangement in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular scaffold is possible because of the concerted action of two Au adatoms that catalyze the reaction on the gold surface.







Abstract
Chemical transformation of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules following different reaction strategies has always been the focus of organic synthesis. In this work, we report the synthesis of a PAH molecule, formation of which consists of an unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage accompanied by a complex &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular scaffold rearrangement. We demonstrate that the complex chemical transformation is steered by concerted motion of individual Au0 gold atoms on a supporting Au(111) surface. This observation underpins the importance of single&#8208;atom catalysis mediated by adatoms in on&#8208;surface synthesis as well as catalytic activity of single Au0 atoms facilitating cleavage of covalent carbon bonds.

         <dc:description>In many metalloenzymes sulfur&#8208;containing ligands participate in catalytic processes, mainly via the involvement in electron transfer reactions. In a biomimetic approach, we now demonstrate the implication of S&#8722;ligation in cobalt mediated Oxygen Reduction Reactions (ORR). A comparative study between the catalytic ORR capabilities of the four&#8208;nitrogen bound [Co(cyclam)]2+ (cyclam = 1,5,8,11&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) (1) and the S&#8722;containing analog [Co(S2N2&#8208;cyclam)]2+ (S2N2&#8208;cyclam = 1,8&#8208;dithia&#8208;5,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane, (2) reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the intermediates formed upon dioxygen activation at the Co(II) centers in 1 and 2 point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic ORR capabilities of 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflylpyridinium Enables Rapid and Scalable Controlled Reduction of Carboxylic Acids to Aldehydes using Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Building up new and efficient method for the controlled conversion of carboxylic acids to aldehydes is important. Herein, we report a rapid, modular and scalable method for the conversion of carboxylic acids to aldehydes using pinacolborane at ambient temperature, in which a triflylpyridinium reagent is used. The conversion of carboxylic acid to intermediate acylpyridinium by triflylpyridinium is new. A binary pyridine&#8208;coordinated boronium complex is generated after reduction. The unprecedented reduction of the acylpyridinium by HBpin opens up a practically direct synthesis of aldehydes from carboxylic acids. Theoretical studies indicate that the reduction of acylpyridinium requires a lower activation free energy than that of the product aldehyde. The synthetic advantage of this protocol is further highlighted by the scalable synthesis of aldehyde via continuous flow process.&#160;Configuration retention for chiral acids are presented in those syntheses.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Enabling dynamically tunable emissive systems offers opportunities for constructing smart materials. Clusteroluminescence, as unconventional luminescence, has attracted increasing attention in both fundamental and applied sciences. Herein, we report a supramolecular poly(disulfides) network with tunable clusteroluminescence. The reticular H&#8208;bonds synergize the rigidity and mobility of dynamic networks, and endow the resulting materials with mechanical adaptivity and robustness, simultaneously enabling efficient clusteroluminescence and phosphorescence at 77 K. Orthogonally tunable luminescence are achieved in two manners, i.e., slow backbone disulfide exchange and fast side&#8208;chain metal coordination. Further exploration of the reprocessability and chemical closed&#8208;loop recycling of intrinsic dynamic networks for sustainable materials is feasible. We foresee that the synergistic strategy of dynamic chemistry offers a novel pathway and potential opportunities for smart emissive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Compatible Phototrophic Community for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 sequestration engineering is promising for carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis, and the artificial communities can solve more complex problems than monocultures. However, obtaining an ideal photosynthetic community is still a great challenging. Here, we developed a highly&#8208;compatible photosynthetic community (HCPC) by integrating a sucrose&#8208;producing CO2 sequestration module and a super&#8208;coupled module. The cyanobacteria CO2 sequestration module was obtained using stepwise metabolic engineering and then coupled with the efficient sucrose utilization module, Vibrio natriegens. Integrated omics analysis indicated enhanced photosynthetic electron transport and extracellular vesicles promote intercellular communication. Additionally, the HCPC was used to channel CO2 into valuable chemicals, enabling an overall release of &#8722;22.27 to &#8722;606.59 kgCO2e/kg in the end products. This novel light&#8208;driven community could facilitate circular economic implementation in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming Chiral Quaternary Stereocenters via Remote H&#8208;Bonding Stereoinduction in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;opening transformations of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes enable the rapid assembly of complex molecules. However, the enantioselective formation of chiral quaternary stereocenters using substrates bearing two different acceptors remains a challenge. Herein, we describe the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (3+2) cycloaddition of vinyl cyclopropanes bearing two different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, a subset of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. The key to the success of this reaction is the remote stereoinduction through hydrogen bond from chiral ligands, which thereby addressed the aforementioned challenge. A variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocycles were produced in good yields and with high stereoselectivity (up to 99% yields, 99:1 er and &gt;19:1 dr). In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and theoretical calculations, revealed the origin of the stereoselectivity and the importance of H&#8208;bonding in stereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR and DFT Studies with a Doubly Labelled 15N/6Li S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Sulfoximine Reveal Why a Directed ortho&#8208;Lithiation Requires an Excess of n&#8208;BuLi.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work shows why it is imperious to use an excess of butyllithium for a directed ortho&#8208;lithiation of a trifluoromethyl sulfoximine. The analysis of mixtures of n&#8208;BuLi and sulfoximine 1 in THF&#8208;d8 using {1H, 6Li, 13C, 15N, 19F} NMR experiments at low temperatures reveal that a first deprotonation occurs that leads to dimeric and tetrameric N&#8208;lithiated sulfoximine (93:7). Using an excess n&#8208;BuLi (5 equivalents), the second deprotonation on the ortho&#8208;position of the aromatic occurs. Six species were observed and characterized on the way. It includes three aggregates involving a sulfoximine: i) a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)] dimer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg2, 39%); ii) a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)3] tetramer solvated by six molecules of THF (Agg3, 39%); iii) a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuOLi)3] tetramer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg1, 22%). A DFT study afforded optimized solvated structures for all these aggregates, fully consistent with the NMR data.</dc:description>

         <title>An Infectious Virus&#8208;like Particle Built on a Programmable Icosahedral DNA Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viral genomes can be compressed into a near&#8208;spherical nanochamber to form infectious particles. In order to mimic the virus morphology and packaging behavior, we invented a programmable icosahedral DNA nanoframe with enhanced rigidity and encapsulated the phiX174 bacteriophage genome. The packaging efficiency could be modulated through specific anchoring strands adjustment, and the trapped phage genome remained the accessibility for enzymatic operations. Moreover, the packed complex could infect Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells through bacterial uptake then produce plaques. This rigid icosahedral DNA architecture demonstrated a versatile platform to develop virus mimetic particles for convenient functional nucleic acid entrapment, manipulation and delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Phonon Energies in Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Potassium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Enhanced Nonlinearity and Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical applications of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles require materials with low phonon energies to minimize nonradiative relaxation and promote nonlinear processes like upconversion. Heavy halide hosts offer low phonon energies but are challenging to synthesize as nanocrystals. Here, we demonstrate the size&#8208;controlled synthesis of low&#8208;phonon&#8208;energy KPb2X5 (X = Cl, Br) nanoparticles and the ability to tune nanocrystal phonon energies as low as 128 cm&#8208;1. KPb2Cl5 nanoparticles are moisture resistant and can be efficiently doped with lighter lanthanides. The low phonon energies of KPb2X5 nanoparticles promote upconversion luminescence from higher lanthanide excited states and enable highly nonlinear, avalanche&#8208;like emission from KPb2Cl5:Nd3+ nanoparticles. The realization of nanoparticles with tunable, ultra&#8208;low phonon energies facilitates the discovery of nanomaterials with phonon&#8208;dependent properties, precisely engineered for applications in nanoscale imaging, sensing, luminescence thermometry and energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Pore&#8208;Structure Engineering by Ligand Conformational Control of Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Based Semiconducting Porous Coordination Polymers for Efficient Chemiresistive Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with tunable structure and conductivity is attractive but remains challenging. Herein, fine pore structure engineering by ligand conformation control of naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;based semiconducting PCPs with &#960; stacking&#8208;dependent conductivity tunability was achieved. The &#960; stacking distances and ligand conformation in these isoreticular PCPs were modulated by altering the metal center with different coordination geometry. As a result, three conjugated PCPs (Co&#8208;pyNDI, Ni&#8208;pyNDI, and Zn&#8208;pyNDI) with varying pore structure and conductivity were obtained, whose crystal structures were determined by the three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction technique. The through&#8208;space charge transfer and tunable pore structure in these PCPs endow modulated selectivity and sensitivity in gas sensing. Remarkably, Zn&#8208;pyNDI can serve as a room&#8208;temperature operable chemiresitive sensor selective to acetone.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Thermodynamic Resolution Strategy for the Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Streptonigrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that axially chiral biaryl boronic esters can be generated with control of atropselectivity by a Binol&#8208;mediated dynamic thermodynamic resolution process. These intermediates can be progressed to enantioenriched products via stereoretentive functionalization of the carbon&#8208;boron bond. Finally, we have exploited this method in the first highly stereoselective total synthesis of  P  streptonigrin.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Luminescent One&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid&#160;Double&#8208;Perovskite&#8208;Inspired Materials for Single&#8208;Component Warm White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double perovskites (DPs) are one of the most promising candidates for developing white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) owing to their intrinsic broadband emission from self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). Translation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DPs to one&#8208;dimensional (1D) analogues, which could break the octahedral tolerance factor limit, is so far remaining unexplored. Herein, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a series of highly luminescent 1D DP&#8208;inspired materials, (DFPD)2MIInBr6 (DFPD = 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium, MI = K+ and Rb+). Highly efficient warm&#8208;white photoluminescence quantum yield of 92 % is achieved by doping 0.3% Sb3+ in (DFPD)2KInBr6. Furthermore, single&#8208;component warm&#8208;WLEDs fabricated with (DFPD)2KInBr6:Sb&#160;yield a luminance of 300 cd/m2, which is one of the best&#8208;performing lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halides WLEDs reported so far. Our study expands the scope of In&#8208;based metal&#8208;halides from 3D to 1D, which exhibit superior optical performances and broad application prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>A Shuttle&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Cu&#8211;Li Battery based on a Sandwich&#8208;Structured Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;Li batteries leveraging the two&#8208;electron redox property of Cu can offer high energy density and low cost. However, Cu&#8208;Li batteries are plagued by limited solubility and a shuttle effect of Cu ions in traditional electrolytes, which leads to low energy density and poor cycling stability. In this work, we rationally design a solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte for solid&#8208;state Cu&#8208;Li batteries, in which a deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent gel with high Cu&#8208;ion solubility is devised as a Cu&#8208;ion reservoir while a ceramic Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 interlayer is used to block Cu&#8208;ion crossover. Because of the high ionic conductivity (0.55 mS.cm&#8208;1 at 25 oC), wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.5 V vs. Li+/Li), and high Cu ion solubility of solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte, a solid&#8208;state Cu&#8208;Li battery demonstrates a high energy density of 1,485 Wh kgCu&#8208;1and long&#8208;term cyclability with 97% capacity retention over 120 cycles. The present study lays the groundwork for future research into low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state Cu&#8208;Li batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Precise Antitumoral Photodynamic Therapy Using a Dual Receptor&#8208;Mediated Bioorthogonal Activation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted delivery and specific activation of photosensitizers can greatly improve the treatment outcome of photodynamic therapy. To this end, we report herein a novel dual receptor&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal activation approach to enhance the tumor specificity of the photodynamic action. It involves the targeted delivery of a biotinylated boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizer, which is quenched in the native form by the attached 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine unit, and an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide conjugated with a bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne moiety. Only for cancer cells that overexpress both the biotin receptor and EGFR, the two components can be internalized preferentially where they undergo an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, leading to restoration of the photodynamic activity of the BODIPY core. By using a range of cell lines with different expression levels of these two receptors, we have demonstrated that this stepwise &#8220;deliver&#8208;and&#8208;click&#8221; approach can confine the photodynamic action on a specific type of cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Economical Access to Diverse Enantiopure Tetrahydropyridines and Piperidines Enabled by Catalytic Borrowing Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a catalytic borrowing hydrogen method that enables an unprecedented, economical one&#8208;pot access to enantiopure tetrahydropyridines with minimal reagent use or waste formation. This method couples a few classes of readily available substrates with commercially available 1,3&#8208;amino alcohols, and delivers the valuable tetrahydropyridines of different substitution patterns free of  N  &#8208;protection. Such transformations are highly challenging to achieve, as multiple redox steps need to be realized in a cascade and numerous side reactions including a facile aromatization have to be overcome. Highly diastereoselective functionalizations of tetrahydropyridines also result in a general access to enantiopure di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted piperidines, which ranks the topmost frequent  N  &#8208;heterocycle in commercial drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Laser Emission from Homochiral Superstructures based on Achiral Molecules with Conformal Flexibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Without external chiral intervention, it is a challenge to form homochirality from achiral molecules with conformational flexibility. We here report on a rational strategy that uses multivalent noncovalent interactions to clamp the molecular conformational of achiral D&#8208;A molecules. These interactions overcome the otherwise dominant dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and thus disfavor their symmetric antiparallel stacking. It in turn facilitates parallel packing, leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking during crystallization and thus the formation of homochiral conglomerates. When this emergent homochirality is coupled with optical gain characteristics of the molecules, the homochiral crystals are explored as excellent circularly polarized micro&#8208;lasers with low lasing threshold (16.4 &#956;J/cm2) and high dissymmetry factor glum (0.9). This study therefore provides a facile design strategy for supramolecular chiral materials and active laser ones without the necessity of intrinsic chiral element.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Asymmetric 1,5&#8208;Conjugate Addition via Palladium Hydride&#160;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronically matched nucleophilic 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition has been well studied and widely applied in synthetic areas. In contrast, nucleophilic 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition represents an electronically forbidden process and is considered unfeasible. Here, we describe modular protocols for 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition reactions via palladium hydride catalysis. Both palladium and synergistic Pd/organocatalyst systems are developed to catalyze 1,5&#8208;conjugate reaction, followed by inter&#8208; or intramolecular [3+2] cyclization. A migratory 1,5&#8208;addition protocol is established to corroborate the feasibility of this umpolung concept. The 1,5&#8208;addition products are conveniently transformed into a series of privileged enantioenriched motifs, including polysubstituted tetrahydrofuran, dihydrofuran, cyclopropane, cyclobutane, azetidine, oxetane, thietane, spirocycle and bridged rings. Preliminary mechanistic studies corroborate the involvement of palladium hydride catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enriching Surface&#8208;Accessible CO2 in the Zero&#8208;Gap Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Based CO2 Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;gap anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;based CO2 electrolysis is a promising technology for CO production, however, their performance at elevated current densities still suffers from the low local CO2 concentration due to heavy CO2 neutralization. Herein, via modulating the CO2 feed mode and quantitative analyzing CO2 utilization with the aid of mass transport modeling, we develop a descriptor denoted as the surface&#8208;accessible CO2 concentration ([CO2]SA), which enables us to indicate the transient state of the local [CO2]/[OH&#175;] ratio and helps define the limits of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. To enrich the [CO2]SA, we developed three general strategies: (1) increasing catalyst layer thickness, (2) elevating CO2 pressure, and (3) applying a pulsed electrochemical (PE) method. Notably, an optimized PE method allows to keep the [CO2]SA at a high level by utilizing the dynamic balance period of CO2 neutralization. A maximum jCO of 368 &#177; 28 mA cmgeo&#8208;2 was achieved for the commercial silver catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Matrix Membrane with Penetrating Subnanochannels: A Versatile Nanofluidic Platform for Selective Metal Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological ion channels penetrated through cell membrane form unique transport pathways for selective ionic conductance. Replicating the success of ion selectivity with mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) will enable new separation technologies but remains challenging. Herein, we report a soft substrate&#8208;assisted solution casting method to develop MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels for selective metal ion conduction. The MMMs are composed of penetrating Prussian white (PW) microcubes with subnanochannels in dense polyimide (PI) matrices, achieving selective monovalent metal ion conduction. The ion selectivity of K+/Mg2+ is up to 14.0, and the ion conductance of K+ can reach 45.5 &#181;S with the testing diameter of 5 mm, which can be further improved by increasing the testing area. Given the diversity of nanoporous materials and polymer matrices, we expect that the MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels could be developed into a versatile nanofluidic platform for various emerging applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Block Poly(carbonate&#8208;ester) Ionomers as High&#8208;Performance and Recyclable Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;esters) were designed that undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization in the polycarbonate rubbery mid&#8208;segment and are reinforced by reversible ionic interactions in the outer semi&#8208;aromatic polyester blocks. The thermoplastic elastomers show impressive tensile strength, high elastic recovery and are degradable in aqueous alkali media or chemically recyclable to monomer.







Abstract
Thermoplastic elastomers based on polyesters/carbonates have the potential to maximize recyclability, degradability and renewable resource use. However, they often underperform and suffer from the familiar trade&#8208;off between strength and extensibility. Herein, we report well&#8208;defined reprocessable poly(ester&#8208;b&#8208;carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;ester) elastomers with impressive tensile strengths (60&#8197;MPa), elasticity (&gt;800&#8201;%) and recovery (95&#8201;%). Plus, the ester/carbonate linkages are fully degradable and enable chemical recycling. The superior performances are attributed to three features: (1)&#8197;Highly entangled soft segments; (2)&#8197;Fully reversible strain&#8208;induced crystallization and (3)&#8197;Precisely placed ZnII&#8208;carboxylates dynamically crosslinking the hard domains. The one&#8208;pot synthesis couples controlled cyclic monomer ring&#8208;opening polymerization and alternating epoxide/anhydride ring&#8208;opening copolymerization. Efficient convresion to ionomers is achieved by reacting vinyl&#8208;epoxides to install ZnII&#8208;carboxylates.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Cleavage of C&#8722;P Bond: Enantioselective Construction of Atropisomers Containing a P&#8208;Stereogenic Center</title>

         <dc:description>
Here we report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of a C&#8722;P bond for the construction of atropisomers bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center. The products are isolated in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and up to 98&#8201;% ee). One of the isolated products is shown to catalyze the [3+2] cycloaddition of allenoates to imines, thus demonstrating the utility of the present methodology.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;P bond cleavage has emerged as a powerful tool for the formation of both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;P bond. However, the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8722;P bond is still undeveloped. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8722;P bond for the construction of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines and stereogenic axis. This protocol enables the quick synthesis of atropisomers bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center in high yields, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;% ee, &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr. The product is able to serve as chiral catalyst in phosphine catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of allenoates to imines, showing the great potential of the present methodology.

         <title>Approach to Chemically Durable Nickel and Cobalt Lanthanum&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Based Catalysts for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the rare&#8208;earth nitride complexes enable highly efficient ammonia synthesis, they suffer from chemical sensitivity to air and moisture. Using Al&#8208;doped LaN as the model material, we show the impact of La&#8722;Al metallic bond formation on improving the catalysts&#8217; durability under air and moisture without affecting original functionalities.







Abstract
Metal nitride complexes have recently been proposed as an efficient noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst for ammonia synthesis utilizing a dual active site concept. However, their high sensitivity to air and moisture has restricted potential applications. We report that their chemical sensitivity can be improved by introducing Al into the LaN lattice, thereby forming La&#8722;Al metallic bonds (La&#8722;Al&#8722;N). The catalytic activity and mechanism of the resulting TM/La&#8722;Al&#8722;N (TM=Ni, Co) are comparable to the previously reported TM/LaN catalyst. Notably, the catalytic activity did not degrade after exposure to air and moisture. Kinetic analysis and isotopic experiment showed that La&#8722;Al&#8722;N is responsible for N2 absorption and activation despite substantial Al being introduced into its lattice because the local coordination of the lattice N remained largely unchanged. These findings show the effectiveness of metallic bond formation, which can support the chemical stability of rare&#8208;earth nitrides with retention of catalytic functionality.

         <title>Design of Co&#8208;Cu Diatomic Site Catalysts for High&#8208;efficiency Synergistic CO2 Electroreduction at Industrial&#8208;level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diatomic site catalyst consisting of Co&#8208;Cu hetero&#8208;diatomic pairs is designed via a general and facile method. Industrial&#8208;level current density can be easily achieved in a flow cell system with the maximum CO partial current density up to 483&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The CO selectivity can be maintained above 95&#8201;% over a wide current density range from 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely studied in the field of CO2 electroreduction, but industrial&#8208;level current density and near&#8208;unity product selectivity are still difficult to achieve. Herein, a diatomic site catalysts (DASCs) consisting of Co&#8208;Cu hetero&#8208;diatomic pairs is synthesized. The CoCu DASC exhibits excellent selectivity with the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.1&#8201;%. The CO selectivity can maintain above 95&#8201;% over a wide current density range from 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The maximum CO partial current density can reach to 483&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell, far exceed industrial&#8208;level current density requirements (&gt;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Theoretical calculation reveals that the synergistic catalysis of the Co&#8208;Cu bimetallic sites reduce the activation energy and promote the formation of intermediate *COOH. This work shows that the introduction of another metal atom into SACs can significantly affect the electronic structure and then enhance the catalytic activity of SACs.

         <dc:description>
A rhodium/Malphos catalytic recipe has been developed for the dynamic kinetic intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of allene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes. The desired cis&#8208;fused [4.3.0]bicyclic products were obtained with decent yields and excellent stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Its dynamic kinetic nature has been confirmed by careful mechanistic studies.







Abstract
Rh&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes afforded cis&#8208;fused [4.3.0]bicyclic products with an excellent chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantio&#8208;selectivity. Many synthetically useful functional groups are tolerated. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated. Based on the careful experimental studies, a mechanism involving the rapid racemization of the allene moiety in the starting materials has been proposed.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Quadruple Borylation of Terminal Alkynes to Access sp3&#8208;Tetra&#8208;Organometallic Reagents</title>

         <dc:description>
A chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed quadruple borylation of terminal alkynes is developed to prepare synthetically versatile 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraborylalkanes with a catalyst generated from CuI and dcpe (1,2&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane). Mechanistic studies reveal that this quadruple borylation reaction proceeds through sequential 1,2&#8208;diborylation of alkynes and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkene intermediates.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed regioselective quadruple borylation of terminal alkynes has been developed employing a copper catalyst generated from CuI and dcpe (1,2&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane). A wide range of terminal alkynes undergo this multi&#8208;borylation reaction to afford the corresponding 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraborylalkanes in high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that this quadruple borylation reaction proceeds through copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential double 1,2&#8208;diborylation of alkynes and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkene intermediates. This protocol represents the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approach to prepare sp3&#8208;tetra&#8208;organometallic reagents from readily accessible alkynes with commercially available copper catalysts.

         <title>A LRET Nanoplatform Consisting of Lanthanide and Amorphous Manganese Oxide for NIR&#8208;II Luminescence Lifetime Imaging of Tumor Redox Status</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime regulation strategy was developed based on the energy transfer from lanthanide to amorphous manganese oxide. The redox status of cells and tumors was quantitatively visualized through NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime imaging.







Abstract
Designing luminescence lifetime sensors in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window is a great challenge due to the difficult structural construction. Here, we report a tumor redox responsive and easily synthesized material, amorphous manganese oxide (MnOx) with indirect band gap of 1.02&#8197;eV, as an energy acceptor to build a luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) toolbox for universally regulating NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetimes of lanthanide nanoparticles, in which energy transfer is based on matched energy gap instead of conventional overlapped spectra. We further utilize ytterbium (Yb3+)&#8208;doped YbNP@MnOx as an NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime sensor to realize in vitro quantitative redox visualization with relative errors under 5&#8201;% in samples covered with mouse skin. Furthermore, HepG2 cells and tumors with high redox state have been accurately distinguished by NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime imaging. The quantified intracellular and intratumor glutathione (GSH) levels are highly consistent with the commercial kit results, illustrating the reliable redox visualization ability in biological tissue.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharides having a Domain Structure
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined heparan sulfate mimetics having a domain structure were synthesized by copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition of HS oligosaccharide having a terminal alkyne or azide moiety. Competition binding experiments demonstrated that the length of NA domains modulates the binding of the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) has a domain structure in which regions that are modified by epimerization and sulfonation (NS domains) are interspersed by unmodified fragments (NA domains). There is data to support that domain organization of HS can regulate binding of proteins, however, such model has been difficult to probe. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide HS oligosaccharides composed of two or more NS domains separated by NA domains of different length. It is based on the chemical synthesis of a HS oligosaccharide that enzymatically was extended by various GlcA&#8208;GlcNAc units and terminated in GlcNAc having an azido moiety at C&#8208;6 position. HS oligosaccharides having an azide and alkyne moiety could be assembled by copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition to give compounds having various NS domains separated by unsulfonated regions. Competition binding studies showed that the length of an NA domain modulates the binding of the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8.

         <title>Regulating Exposed Facets of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;rate Alkaline Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>

Crystal&#8208;facet engineering is proposed for the design of MOF&#8208;based electrodes with higher capacity and faster electrochemical kinetics. The dominating exposed facets of PFC&#8208;8 can be regulated by a thermally&#8208;modified strategy, which delivers stronger OH&#8722; adsorption behaviors and optimized electronic structures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn growing attention as promising electrode candidates for rechargeable batteries. However, most studies focus on the direct use of MOF electrodes without any modification. Post&#8208;synthetic modification, a judicious tool to modify targeted properties of MOFs, has been long&#8208;neglected in the field of batteries. Herein, crystal&#8208;facet engineering is proposed to design MOF&#8208;based electrodes with high capacity and fast electrochemical kinetics. We found that a thermally&#8208;modified strategy can regulate the dominant exposed facet of Ni&#8208;based MOF (PFC&#8208;8). With the optimally exposed facets, the battery exhibited admirable rate capability (139.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 110.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term stability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that stronger OH&#8722; adsorption behaviors and optimized electronic structures induced by the regulated exposed facets boost the electrochemical performance.

         <title>Localized Lattice Expansion of FAPbBr3 to Design a 3D Hybrid Perovskite for Sensitive Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>

A mixed&#8208;cation 3D lead bromide hybrid perovskite (NMDAP)2FAPb4Br13 is tailored through the localized lattice expansion of 3D FAPbBr3. The resulting perovskite shows a high two&#8208;photon absorption coefficient of 60.8&#8197;cm&#8201;MW&#8722;1 and exhibits a sensitive near&#8208;infrared photoresponse with large on/off ratio (&#8776;104) and favorable stability.







Abstract
A mixed&#8208;cation 3D lead bromide hybrid perovskite (NMDAP)2FAPb4Br13 (1, NMDAP2+ = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diaminopropanium, FA+ = formamidinium) is tailored by incorporating the large NMDAP2+ cation with the small FA+ ion into 3D FAPbBr3. Structurally, the small FA+ ions occupy the prototypical cavities formed by distorted corner&#8208;sharing PbBr6 octahedra as in FAPbBr3, while the bulky NMDAP2+ ions are confined to the expanded lattice which is defined by a new structural motif composed of eight corner&#8208;sharing PbBr6 octahedra and four edge&#8208;sharing octahedra. This localized lattice expansion from FAPbBr3 creates a new branch of the intriguing 3D hybrid perovskite family, breaking the limits of the conventional Goldschmidt tolerance factor rule. Moreover, a high two&#8208;photon absorption (2AP) coefficient of 60.8&#8197;cm&#8201;MW&#8722;1 was demonstrated to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) 800&#8197;nm illumination, enabling sensitive NIR photoresponses with large on/off ratio (&#8776;104) as well as favorable stability.

Both aryne 1,4&#8208;disubstitution and 1,2,4&#8208;trifunctionalization were accomplished from tertiary amines bearing a penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety. A remote diastereoselective [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement process was observed in aryne 1,2,4&#8208;trifunctionalization.







Abstract
Both aryne 1,4&#8208;disubstitution and 1,2,4&#8208;trifunctionalization were accomplished from tertiary amines bearing a penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety. These transformations could directly incorporate a C&#8722;N and a C&#8722;C bond para to each other on an aryne intermediate via a sequential nucleophilic addition and [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. When arynes bearing 3&#8208;tethered electrophiles were employed, a cascade regioselective nucleophilic addition, intramolecular cyclization, and remote diastereoselective [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement process was observed. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between two C&#8722;H hydrogens on the penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl chain and the oxygen anion generated upon N&#8208;nucleophilic annulation reaction in the [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement step is responsible for the remote diastereoselective control in this reaction system.

The mutual redox&#8208;isomerisation of a cationic nido&#8208;germapyramidane into a planar aromatic germole&#8208;diide is reported. The mechanism was elucidated using electrochemical and theoretical studies.







Abstract
Reaction of the imidazolium&#8208;substituted iphosphate&#8208;diide, (Ipr)2C2P2 (IDP), with GeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dioxane and KBArF24 [(BarF24)&#8722;=tetrakis[(3,5&#8208;trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate)] afforded the dicationic spherical&#8208;aromatic nido&#8208;cluster [Ge(&#951;4&#8208;IDP)]2+ ([1]2+) (Ipr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). This complex is a rare heavy analogue of the elusive pyramidane [C(&#951;4&#8208;C4H4)]. [1]2+ undergoes two reversible one&#8208;electron reductions, which yield the radical cation [2]&#8901;+ and the neutral GeII species 3. Both [2]&#8901;+ and 3 rearrange in solution forming the 2D aromatic and planar imidazolium&#8208;substituted digermolide [4]2+ and germole&#8208;diide 5, respectively. Both planar species can be oxidized back to [1]2+ using AgSbF6. These redox&#8208;isomerizations correspond to the fundamental transformation of a 3D aromatic cluster into a 2D aromatic ring compound upon reduction and vice versa. The mechanism of these reactions was elucidated using DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry experiments.

         <title>A Reactivity&#8208;Tunable Self&#8208;Immolative Design Enables Histone Deacetylase&#8208;Targeted Imaging and Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a reactivity&#8208;tunable self&#8208;immolative design that enables activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and HDAC&#8208;responsive prodrug release in vivo. Our design highlights the potential for HDAC&#8208;targeted cancer diagnosis and drug development.







Abstract
Histone deacetylase (HDAC)&#8208;targeted probes and prodrugs are crucial for cancer theranostics. We developed a self&#8208;immolative design that enables in vivo activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and prodrug release in response to HDAC. This design comprises a phenyl ester linker with tunable reactivity, facilitating efficient release of caged fluorophores/drugs upon deacetylation. We engineered a new fluorophore using a spirocyclic xanthene scaffold with ring&#8208;open property, affording NIRF/PA detection with high contrast. We showed that a nitro&#8208;substituted self&#8208;immolative linker allows sensitive NIRF/PA in vivo imaging of HDAC with minimal interference. A highly efficient prodrug system was further developed for targeted therapy in HDAC&#8208;overexpressed triple negative breast tumors in mice. Our study provides a valuable paradigm for HDAC&#8208;targeted NIRF/PA imaging and prodrug release in vivo, highlighting its potential for bioimaging and drug development.

         <title>Anion Donicity of Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium Carbon Fluoride Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium salt with a moderate donor number facilitates the electrochemical dissociation to the slightly ionic C&#8722;F bonds via a push&#8208;pull effect&#8212;moderate solvating power toward slightly positive&#8208;charged carbon atoms (push) and simultaneously ease in de&#8208;solvation for Li+&#8208;ions (pull). This effectively promotes the formation of graphitic carbon and crystalline LiF as discharge products, thereby boosting the specific capacity during discharge process.







Abstract
The increasing demand for high&#8208;energy powers have greatly incentivized the development of lithium carbon fluoride (Li||CFx) cells. Five kinds of non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes with various kinds of lithium salts (LiX, X=PF6&#8722;, TFSI&#8722;, BF4&#8722;, ClO4&#8722;, and CF3SO3&#8722;) were comparatively studied. Intriguingly, the LiBF4&#8208;based electrolyte show relatively moderate ionic conductivities; yet, the corresponding Li||CFx cells deliver the highest discharge capacities among them. A combination of morphological and compositional analyses of the discharge CFx cathode suggest that the moderate donicity of BF4&#8722; anion is accountable for favoring the breakdown of C&#8722;F bonds, and subsequently forming crystalline lithium fluoride as the main discharge products. This work brings not only fresh understanding on the role of salt anions for Li||CFx cells, but also inspire the electrolyte design for other conversion&#8208;type (sulfur and/or organosulfur) cathode materials desired for high&#8208;energy applications.

         <title>Cationic Additive with a Rigid Solvation Shell for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In aqueous zinc ion batteries, Sc3+ with low water exchange rate constant (kex) has a dynamically rigid solvation shell, holding onto its spatial occupation and thus preventing zinc ions from concentrating near tips on the zinc metal surface towards indiscriminate dendrite growth. The rigidity of solvation shells of redox&#8208;inactive cations is proposed as a descriptor in determining the tip&#8208;blocking effect.







Abstract
Despite substantial progresses, in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), developing zinc metal anodes with long&#8208;term reliable cycling capabilities is nontrivial because of dendritic growth and related parasitic reactions on the zinc surface. Here, we exploit the tip&#8208;blocking effect of a scandium (Sc3+) additive in the electrolyte to induce uniform zinc deposition. Additional to the tri&#8208;valency of Sc3+, the rigidity of its hydration shell effectively prevents zinc ions from concentrating at the surface tips, enabling highly stable cycling under challenging conditions. The shell rigidity, quantified by the rate constant of the exchange reaction (kex), is established as a key descriptor for evaluating the tip&#8208;blocking effect of redox&#8208;inactive cations, explaining inconsistent results when only the valence state is considered. Moreover, the tip&#8208;blocking effect of Sc3+ is maintained in blends with organic solvents, allowing the zinc anode to cycle reliably even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C without corrosion.

Achieving Dipeptidyl Peptidase 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) selectivity is a current challenge in chemical biology. Supported by activity&#8208;based protein profiling and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we disclose 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors with different binding modes for DPP8/9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; subsite in DPP8 and the best selectivity index reported to date.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) have gathered interest as drug targets due to their important roles in biological processes like immunity and tumorigenesis. Elucidation of their distinct individual functions remains an ongoing task and could benefit from the availability of novel, chemically diverse and selective chemical tools. Here, we report the activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP)&#8208;mediated discovery of 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic structures revealed different ligand binding modes for DPP8 and DPP9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; (eS2&#8242;) subsite in DPP8. Biological assays confirmed inhibition at both target and cellular levels. Altogether, our integrated chemical proteomics and structure&#8208;guided small molecule design approach led to novel DPP8/9 inhibitors with alternative molecular inhibition mechanisms, delivering the highest selectivity index reported to date.

The appropriate amount of water adsorbed on the surface of Co&#8722;Mo co&#8208;embedded carbon nanofibers facilitated the formation of N&#8722;H bonds and promoted the protonation step of nitrogen reduction via proton source transfer from the water dissociation, which was confirmed by the results of in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy experiments and isotopic labeling experiments using D2O and 15N2.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has attracted considerable scientific and engineering interest as a green alternative route for NH3 production. Molybdenum is a promising candidate as an electrocatalyst for NRR as it has a suitable binding strength with N species. However, the design of an efficient Mo&#8208;based catalyst remains elusive. To enhance the selectivity of NRR toward NH3, we have developed a carbon nanofiber catalyst embedded with molybdenum and cobalt (Co&#8722;Mo&#8722;CNF). Co with a strong ability to dissociate water enhances local proton source near Mo, where the hydrogenation step of the NRR occurs. A NH3 formation rate of 72.72&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 34.5&#8201;% were obtained at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE. We also attempted to provide a mechanistic understanding of the NRR via in situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotopic labeling experiments using 15N2 and D2O.

         <title>Anchoring LiCl in the Nanopores of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Ultra&#8208;High Uptake and Selective Separation of Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance hybrid sorbents are developed by anchoring LiCl in the nanopores of the metal&#8211;organic framework MIL&#8208;53&#8208;(OH)2, which show a record high capture capacity of 33.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 NH3 at 1.0&#8197;bar and 25&#8201;&#176;C as well as excellent selective separation performance of NH3 from NH3/N2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, NH3/CO2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and NH3/H2O at 50&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is an important chemical raw material and a unique carbon&#8208;free fuel with high hydrogen energy density. Thus, NH3 capture, storage, and desorption are of significant importance. However, high capacity capture, low energy desorption, and selective separation of NH3 are still challengs so far. Here, we report high&#8208;performance hybrid sorbents by anchoring LiCl in the nanopores of MIL&#8208;53&#8208;(OH)2 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). It is found that the optimal composite shows a capture capacity of 33.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 NH3 at 1.0&#8197;bar and 25&#8201;&#176;C, which far exceeds the current record among the reported porous materials. Notably, the excellent capture capacity at low pressure and high temperature makes it possible to selectively capture NH3 from NH3/N2, NH3/CO2, and NH3/H2O. It is revealed that synergistic action of NH3 coordination to the highly dispersed Li+ in the MOF nanopores and hydrogen bonding of NH3 with Cl&#8722; account for such an excellent capture and selectivity performance.

         <title>Fluorinated Rocksalt Cathode with Ultra&#8208;high Active Li Content for Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;capacity cathodes are restricted by the conflicts between the capacity and the structural instability. We report a new type of ultra&#8208;high Li compounds: Li4+xMoO5Fx (1&#8804;x&#8804;3) with the reversible shuttling of 3.8&#8197;Li+ ions per formula, showing the possibility of stabilizing the highly delithiated structure through the &#8220;reductive effect&#8221; of fluorination. This discovery opens up new opportunities to extend the cathode materials into the ultra&#8208;high Li domain.







Abstract
The key to increasing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries is to incorporate high contents of extractable Li into the cathode. Unfortunately, this triggers formidable challenges including structural instability and irreversible chemistry under operation. Here, we report a new kind of ultra&#8208;high Li compound: Li4+xMoO5Fx (1&#8804;x&#8804;3) for cathode with an unprecedented level of electrochemically active Li (&gt;3&#8197;Li+ per formula), delivering a reversible capacity up to 438&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Unlike other reported Li&#8208;rich cathodes, Li4+xMoO5Fx presents distinguished structure stability to immunize against irreversible behaviors. Through spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, we find an anionic redox&#8208;dominated charge compensation with negligible oxygen release and voltage decay. Our theoretical analysis reveals a &#8220;reductive effect&#8221; of high&#8208;level fluorination stabilizes the anionic redox by reducing the oxygen ions in pure&#8208;Li conditions, enabling a facile, reversible, and high Li&#8208;portion cycling.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction by Phase Engineering and Phosphorus Doping on Ru/P&#8208;TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium cluster anchored on a lightly P&#8208;doped defective TiO2 catalyst was designed for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte. The surface oxygen vacancies enhanced water dissociation and P&#8208;doping facilitated the H2 generation by enabling hydrogen spillover from the Ru site to the surface P site, synergistically enhancing the HER activity.







Abstract
Synergistic optimization of the elementary steps of water dissociation and hydrogen desorption for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is a challenge. Herein, the Ru cluster anchored on a trace P&#8208;doped defective TiO2 substrate (Ru/P&#8208;TiO2) was synthesized as an electrocatalyst for the HER; it exhibited a commercial Pt/C&#8208;like geometric activity and an excellent mass activity of 9984.3&#8197;mA&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.05&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is 34.3 and 18.7 times higher than that of Pt/C and Ru/TiO2, respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies indicated that using a rutile&#8208;TiO2&#8208;crystal&#8208;phase substrate enhanced the HER activity more than the anatase phase. Rich surface oxygen vacancies on rutile&#8208;TiO2 facilitated the adsorption and dissociation of water, while the partial substitution of Ti4+ with P5+ enhanced H2 generation by facilitating hydrogen spillover from the Ru site to the surface P site, synergistically enhancing the HER activity.

         <title>Ruthenium(II)/Imidazolidine Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation for Central and Axial Double Enantio&#8208;Induction</title>

Ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylations were realized with novel C2&#8208;symmetric chiral imidazolidine carboxylic acids, with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The C&#8722;H alkylation took place with simultaneous construction of central and axial chirality, reaching branched/linear ratios of &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er.







Abstract
Enantioselective C&#8722;H activation has surfaced as a transformative toolbox for the efficient assembly of chiral molecules. However, despite of major advances in rhodium and palladium catalysis, ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation has thus far largely proven elusive. In contrast, we herein report on a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylation. The key to success was represented by the identification of novel C2&#8208;symmetric chiral imidazolidine carboxylic acids (CICAs), which are easily accessible in a one&#8208;pot fashion, as highly effective chiral ligands. This ruthenium/CICA system enabled the efficient installation of central and axial chirality, and featured excellent branched to linear ratios with generally &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr and up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er. Mechanistic studies by experiment and computation were carried out to understand the catalyst mode of action.

         <title>Gradient Heating Epitaxial Growth Gives Well Lattice&#8208;Matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N Heterointerfaces that Boost Both Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N was formed by a gradient heating epitaxial growth method. The unique heterointerface promotes hydrogen evolution kinetics in both acid and alkaline media by generating near&#8208;zero hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy and facilitating water dissociation. As a result, electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance in pH&#8208;universal media is achieved that is comparable to commercial Pt/C.







Abstract
An optimized approach to producing lattice&#8208;matched heterointerfaces for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution has not yet been reported. Herein, we present the synthesis of lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N heterostructures using a gradient heating epitaxial growth method. The well lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface of Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N generates near&#8208;zero hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy and facilitates water dissociation in acid and alkaline media. The lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N heterostructures have low overpotentials of 73&#8197;mV and 80&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively, comparable to commercial Pt/C. A novel photothermal&#8208;electrocatalytic water vapor splitting device using the lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N heterostructure as a hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst displays a competitive cell voltage for electrocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Developing Isoxazole as a Native Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linker for Photoaffinity Labeling and Chemoproteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoxazole is an essential pharmacophore in drug discovery. In this study, we investigated the photochemistry of isoxazole with biomolecules and developed it as a natively embedded photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker for chemoproteomics and drug discovery. With this strategy, two isoxazole&#8208;containing drugs were successfully applied to chemoproteomic platforms to uncover their cellular targets and interactions.







Abstract
Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful technique to interrogate drug&#8208;protein interactions in native cellular environments. Photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers are instrumental for this technique. However, the introduction of unnatural photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers may significantly reduce the bioactivity of the drug, thus impairing the chemoproteomic outcomes. Herein, we developed a common pharmacophore, isoxazole, into a natively embedded photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker for chemoproteomics, which minimally perturbs the drug structure. The photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking reactions of the isoxazole were thoroughly investigated for the first time. Functionalized isoxazoles were then designed and applied to protein labeling, demonstrating the superior photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking efficiency. Subsequently, two isoxazole&#8208;based drugs, Danazol and Luminespib, were employed in chemoproteomic studies, revealing their potential cellular targets. These results provide valuable strategies for future chemoproteomic study and drug development.

         <title>Aryl Fluorosulfate Based Inhibitors That Covalently Target the SIRT5 Lysine Deacylase
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SuFEx warheads installed into a previously developed inhibitor scaffold that targets the sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) deacylase, furnish covalently labeling inhibitors that pull down the enzyme from cells and tissue. With further optimization of the compound's potencies, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study may provide the foundation for development of highly efficient covalent chemical probes and/or drug lead compounds targeting SIRT5.







Abstract
The sirtuin enzymes are a family of lysine deacylases that regulate gene transcription and metabolism. Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) hydrolyzes malonyl, succinyl, and glutaryl &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyacyllysine posttranslational modifications and has recently emerged as a vulnerability in certain cancers. However, chemical probes to illuminate its potential as a pharmacological target have been lacking. Here we report the harnessing of aryl fluorosulfate&#8208;based electrophiles as an avenue to furnish covalent inhibitors that target SIRT5. Alkyne&#8208;tagged affinity&#8208;labeling agents recognize and capture overexpressed SIRT5 in cultured HEK293T cells and can label SIRT5 in the hearts of mice upon intravenous injection of the compound. This work demonstrates the utility of aryl fluorosulfate electrophiles for targeting of SIRT5 and suggests this as a means for the development of potential covalent drug candidates. It is our hope that these results will serve as inspiration for future studies investigating SIRT5 and general sirtuin biology in the mitochondria.

         <title>Facet Engineering of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Support Modulates the Microenvironment of Palladium Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd nanoparticles supported on a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) ZIF&#8208;8 with engineered crystal facets were coated with a ZIF&#8208;8 layer, to yield a series of MOF composites. ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8, featuring electron&#8208;deficient Pd with a unique microenvironment created by the exposed (100) crystal facet of the ZIF&#8208;8 support, favors adsorption of &#8722;NO2 over &#8722;Cl, and thus, high activity and selectivity in halonitrobenzene hydrogenation to haloaniline.







Abstract
The exposed facets of supported catalysts play a crucial role in catalysis; however, they are usually ignored and related studies remain rare. Herein, we have fabricated a series of sandwich&#8208;structured metal&#8211;organic framework composites, denoted ZIF&#8208;8X@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 (x represents the morphology of ZIF&#8208;8 core, i.e., ZIF&#8208;8C exposing (100) facet, ZIF&#8208;8RD exposing (110) facet, and ZIF&#8208;8TRD exposing mixed (100) and (110) facets), featuring Pd nanoparticles deposited on the specific crystal facets of ZIF&#8208;8 core, for hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. The Pd electronic state is tailored by the ZIF&#8208;8 core, where more electron&#8208;deficient Pd is found in ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 than that in ZIF&#8208;8RD@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8, leading to discriminative adsorption of the &#8722;NO2 and &#8722;Cl groups of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. Consequently, ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits excellent activity (97.6&#8201;%) and selectivity (98.1&#8201;%) to p&#8208;chloroaniline.

&lt;p&gt;Pd nanoparticles supported on a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) ZIF-8 with engineered crystal facets were coated with a ZIF-8 layer, to yield a series of MOF composites. ZIF-8&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;@Pd@ZIF-8, featuring electron-deficient Pd with a unique microenvironment created by the exposed (100) crystal facet of the ZIF-8 support, favors adsorption of &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over &#8722;Cl, and thus, high activity and selectivity in halonitrobenzene hydrogenation to haloaniline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exposed facets of supported catalysts play a crucial role in catalysis; however, they are usually ignored and related studies remain rare. Herein, we have fabricated a series of sandwich-structured metal&#8211;organic framework composites, denoted ZIF-8&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;@Pd@ZIF-8 (x represents the morphology of ZIF-8 core, i.e., ZIF-8&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; exposing (100) facet, ZIF-8&lt;sub&gt;RD&lt;/sub&gt; exposing (110) facet, and ZIF-8&lt;sub&gt;TRD&lt;/sub&gt; exposing mixed (100) and (110) facets), featuring Pd nanoparticles deposited on the specific crystal facets of ZIF-8 core, for hydrogenation of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloronitrobenzene. The Pd electronic state is tailored by the ZIF-8 core, where more electron-deficient Pd is found in ZIF-8&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;@Pd@ZIF-8 than that in ZIF-8&lt;sub&gt;RD&lt;/sub&gt;@Pd@ZIF-8, leading to discriminative adsorption of the &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &#8722;Cl groups of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloronitrobenzene. Consequently, ZIF-8&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;@Pd@ZIF-8 exhibits excellent activity (97.6&#8201;%) and selectivity (98.1&#8201;%) to &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloroaniline. This work highlights crystal facet engineering of supports to modulate the microenvironment and electronic state of supported metal nanoparticles, offering a promising avenue to enhanced catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8211;Uptake Relationship Study of DABCYL Derivatives Linked to Cyclic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides for Live&#8208;Cell Delivery of Synthetic Proteins</title>

Modifying cyclic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides with DABCYL derivatives can enhance the formation of nucleation zones for small fluorescent cargoes. Structure variations of the DABCYL moiety significantly increased the cellular uptake efficiency of ubiquitin, resulting in efficient cytosolic transport at nanomolar concentrations.







Abstract
Modifying cyclic cell&#8208;penetrating deca&#8208;arginine (cR10) peptides with 4&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) improves the uptake efficiency of synthetic ubiquitin (Ub) cargoes into living cells. To probe the role of the DABCYL moiety, we performed time&#8208;lapse microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of fluorescent DABCYL&#8208;R10 to evaluate the impact on cell entry by the formation of nucleation zones. Furthermore, we performed a structure&#8211;uptake relationship study with 13 DABCYL derivatives coupled to CPP to examine their effect on the cell&#8208;uptake efficiency when conjugated to mono&#8208;Ub through disulfide linkages. Our results show that through structure variations of the DABCYL moiety alone we could reach, at nanomolar concentration, an additional threefold increase in the cytosolic delivery of Ub, which will enable studies on various intracellular processes related to Ub signaling.

         <title>Realizing All&#8208;Climate Li&#8208;S Batteries by Using a Porous Sub&#8208;Nano Aromatic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sub&#8208;nano aromatic framework (SAF) was constructed as a bifunctional separator coating for Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the merits of the narrow band gap and fully conjugated porous structure, the modified batteries can operate under temperatures ranging from &#8722;40 to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries with high energy density are currently receiving enormous attention. However, their redox kinetics at low temperature is extremely tardy, and polysulfides shuttling is serious at high temperature, which severely hinders the implementation of wide&#8208;temperature Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we propose an all&#8208;climate Li&#8208;S battery based on an ether&#8208;based electrolyte by using a porous sub&#8208;nano aromatic framework (SAF) modified separator. It's demonstrated that the fully conjugated SAF&#8208;3 with a small pore size (0.97&#8197;nm) and narrow band gap (1.72&#8197;eV) could efficiently block the polysulfides shuttling at elevated temperature and boost the polysulfides conversion at low temperature. Consequently, the SAF&#8208;3 modified cells work well in a wide temperature ranging from &#8722;40 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, when operated at room temperature, the modified cell exhibits 90&#8201;% capacity retention over 100 cycles under high&#8208;sulfur loading (5.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and lean electrolyte (5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1).

Reported is a general and highly enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive homocoupling of ortho&#8208;chlorinated aldehydes enabled by a SBpy&#8208;type chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand. This mild and step&#8208;economical approach allowed the synthesis of various axially chiral biaryl dials, and also provided versatile intermediates for diverse axially chiral catalysts, ligands, and natural products.







Abstract
The first nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective reductive Ullmann coupling of ortho&#8208;chlorinated aryl aldehyde was achieved under mild reaction conditions with a chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand (+)&#8208;DTB&#8208;SBpy, thus providing axially chiral biphenyl or binaphthyl dials with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99.5:0.5 er. The versatility of the products as common synthetic intermediates for diverse axially chiral ligands, catalysts, and functional molecules was demonstrated by short&#8208;step transformations. This protocol also allowed the concise and highly enantioselective formal total synthesis of biologically active natural products (+)&#8208;kotanin, (&#8722;)&#8208;isoschizandrin and (+)&#8208;gossypol.

A multicomponent Cu&#8722;Zn alloy interlayer possessing high binding energy with Zn atoms and effective inhibition effect on lattice distortion is constructed on Zn anode (Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn). The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode not only restricts the aggregation of Zn atoms, but also suppresses the side reactions such as pernicious hydrogen evolution and corrosion, leading to homogeneous Zn deposition and outstanding electrochemical performances.







Abstract
Constructing stable surface modification layer is an effective strategy to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions of Zinc (Zn) metal anode in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. Herein, a multicomponent Cu&#8722;Zn alloy interlayer with superior Zn affinity, high toughness and effective inhibition effect on lattice distortion is constructed on Zn foil (Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn) to fabricate ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anode. Owning to the advantages of high binding energy of Cu&#8722;Zn alloy layer with Zn atoms and less contact area between metallic Zn and electrolyte, the as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode not only restricts the aggregation of Zn atoms, but also suppresses the pernicious hydrogen evolution and corrosion, leading to homogeneous Zn deposition and outstanding electrochemical performances. Accordingly, the symmetric battery with Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode exhibits an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 5496&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn//V2O5 pouch cell demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 88&#8201;% after 600 cycles.

         <title>The Elusive Mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] Cluster in Three Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the synthesis and characterization of a three&#8208;member redox series (n=0, 1, 2) of mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] clusters that model proposed intermediates in biological NO sensing. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational analysis indicates a local {Fe&#8722;NO}7 configuration regardless of the charge state, with a high&#8208;spin Fe3+ antiferromagnetically coupled to 3[NO]&#8722;.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are well&#8208;established targets in biological nitric oxide (NO) chemistry, but the key intermediate in these processes&#8212;a mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] cluster&#8212;has not been fully characterized in a protein or a synthetic model thereof. Here, we report the synthesis of a three&#8208;member redox series of isostructural mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] clusters. Mononitrosylation was achieved by binding NO to a 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 site&#8208;differentiated [Fe4S4]+ cluster; subsequent oxidation and reduction afforded the other members of the series. All three clusters feature a local high&#8208;spin Fe3+ center antiferromagnetically coupled to 3[NO]&#8722;. The observation of an anionic NO ligand suggests that NO binding is accompanied by formal electron transfer from the cluster to NO. Preliminary reactivity studies with the monocationic cluster demonstrate that exposure to excess NO degrades the cluster, supporting the intermediacy of mononitrosylated intermediates in NO sensing/signaling.

         <title>Dissecting Critical Factors for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Atomically Precise Au Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key factors in nanocluster (NCs)&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) are studied by comparing Au NCs with different sizes as well as Au38 isomer. Overall, the smaller size enables a higher activity due to the higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, while the isomerism of the same&#8208;sized NCs can lead to significant changes in both activity and selectivity due to the difference in average formation energy of the key *COOH intermediate.







Abstract
This work investigates the critical factors impacting electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) using atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) as electrocatalysts. First, the influence of size on CO2RR is studied by precisely controlling NC size in the 1&#8211;2.5&#8197;nm regime. We find that the electrocatalytic CO partial current density increases for smaller NCs, but the CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) is not directly associated with the NC size. This indicates that the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, i.e. the population of active sites, is the dominant factor for determining the catalytic activity, but the selectivity is not directly impacted by size. Second, we compare the CO2RR performance of Au38 isomers (Au38Q and Au38T) to reveal that structural rearrangement of identical size NCs can lead to significant changes in both CO2RR activity and selectivity. Au38Q shows higher activity and selectivity towards CO than Au38T, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the average formation energy of the key *COOH intermediate on the proposed active sites is significantly lower on Au38Q than Au38T. These results demonstrate how the structural isomerism can impact stabilization of reaction intermediates as well as the overall CO2RR performance of identical size Au NCs. Overall, this work provides important structure&#8211;property relationships for tailoring the NCs for CO2RR.

         <title>Double&#8208;pronged Antimicrobial Agents based on a Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Type Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type photosensitizer featuring aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE&#8208;PS) for curing infections caused by multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria. This AIE&#8208;PS achieved a high photodynamic killing efficacy towards both extracellular and intracellular pathogens in vitro and in vivo by inducing ROS accumulation, disrupting the bacterial membrane integrity and potentiating the lysosomal bioactivities of macrophages.







Abstract
Novel antibacterial agents are urgently needed to control the infections induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. Herein, we rationally designed and facilely synthesized a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type luminogen with strong red/near&#8208;infrared fluorescence emission, great aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features, and excellent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The newly developed molecule TTTh killed the methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by triggering the ROS accumulation in bacteria and interrupting the membrane integrity. Moreover, TTTh specifically targeted the lysosomes and potentiated their maturation to accelerate the clearance of intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reduced bacterial burden and improved healing were observed in TTTh&#8208;treated wounds with negligible side effects. Our study expands the biological design and application of AIE luminogens (AIEgens), and provides new insights into discovering novel antibacterial targets and agents.

Total syntheses of (+)&#8208;cinereain and (&#8722;)&#8208;janoxepin, two fungal cyclotripeptides featuring a complex heterocyclic core and interesting phytotoxic and antimalarial activities, have been achieved in a highly convergent manner.

This intermediate underwent a spontaneous retro&#8208;Claisen rearrangement that was rationalized by DFT calculations. The cascade directly afforded a 2,5&#8208;dihydrooxepin&#8208;fused heterotricyclic product, and the challenging oxepin ring was finally forged by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of an allylic fluoride intermediate.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence from Phosphine&#8208;Stabilized Au3 Triangles and Au3Ag Pyramids</title>

Deep&#8208;blue cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes were realized by using phosphine&#8208;stabilized Au3 triangles and Au3Ag pyramids, featuring electroluminescence (EL) at 436&#8197;nm and the chromatic coordinates with y &lt;0.1.These results demonstrated the number of metal nuclei and the contributions of ligands to excited states are crucial for breaking the bottleneck of EL clusters in blue region.







Abstract
The optoelectronic applications of clusters emerged rapidly. Cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes (CLED) as representative hold promise as a new generation of displays and lightings. However, as one of the main challenges in electroluminescence (EL) field, until present, no deep&#8208;blue CLEDs were reported, due to the strict requirements on excited&#8208;state characteristics of clusters. Herein, two phosphine&#8208;stabilized Au3 triangle and Au3Ag pyramid named [O(Audppy)3]BF4 and [O(Audppy)3Ag](BF4)2 were chosen to demonstrate efficient deep&#8208;blue CLEDs. The ligand&#8208;incorporated charge transfer transitions of the clusters contribute to both singlet and triplet excited states of the clusters, giving rise to phosphorescence at 460&#8197;nm and EL emissions at 436&#8197;nm. Based on device engineering, the maximum luminescence beyond 8000&#8197;nits and the chromatic coordinates with y &lt;0.1 in deep&#8208;blue region verify the competence of CLEDs for high&#8208;resolution displays.

         <title>Thermoreversible Polymorph Transitions in Supramolecular Polymers of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Squaramides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squaramide supramolecular polymers exhibit uncommon thermoreversible polymorph transitions between fiber&#8208; and particle&#8208;like nanostructures driven by the molecular rearrangement of the squaramide units from slipped to head&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrogen bonds. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies reveal the concentration dependent nature and the on&#8208;pathway mechanism of the polymorph transitions which are of interest as stimuli&#8208;responsive systems.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded squaramide (SQ) supramolecular polymers exhibit uncommon thermoreversible polymorph transitions between particle&#8208; and fiber&#8208;like nanostructures. SQs 1&#8211;3, with different steric bulk, self&#8208;assemble in solution into particles (AggI) upon cooling to 298&#8197;K, and SQs 1 and 2, with only one dendronic group, show a reversible transformation into fibers (AggII) by further decreasing the temperature to 288&#8197;K. Nano&#8208;DSC and UV/Vis studies on SQ 1 reveal a concentration&#8208;dependent transition temperature and &#916;H for the AggI&#8208;to&#8208;AggII conversion, while the kinetic studies on SQ 2 indicate the on&#8208;pathway nature of the polymorph transition. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that these transitions are triggered by the molecular reorganization of the SQ units changing from slipped to head&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrogen bonding patterns. This work unveils the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of reversible polymorph transitions that are of interest to develop stimuli&#8208;responsive systems.

         <title>A Highly Twisted Carbazole&#8208;Fused DABNA Derivative as an Orange&#8208;Red TADF Emitter for OLEDs with Nearly 40&#8201;% EQE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach is reported by fusing carbazoles to a MR framework DABNA to significantly redshift emission while maintaining the MR&#8208;dominated features. The carbazole&#8208;fused molecule TCZ&#8208;F&#8208;DABNA can deliver a high PLQY of 99&#8201;%. Its OLEDs reached a record&#8208;high EQE of 39.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material is currently a research hotspot in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high color purity and high exciton utilization. However, there are only a handful of MR&#8208;TADF emitters with emissions beyond the blue&#8208;to&#8208;green region. The very limited emission colors for MR&#8208;TADF emitters are mainly caused by the fact that so far molecular modifications of MR&#8208;TADF do not offer much change in the emission colors. Here, we report a new approach to modifying a prototypical MR core of DABNA by fusing carbazoles to the MR framework. The carbazole&#8208;fused molecule (TCZ&#8208;F&#8208;DABNA) basically maintains the MR&#8208;dominated features of DABNA while red&#8208;shifting the emission. Its OLED achieves an external quantum efficiency of 39.2&#8201;% with a peak at 588&#8197;nm, which is a record&#8208;high efficiency for OLEDs with peaks beyond 560&#8197;nm. This work provides a new approach for significantly tunning emission colors of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>From Inert to Catalytically Active Milling Media: Galvanostatic Coating for Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The galvanostatic coating of milling balls and vessels advances commonly inert materials into catalytically active milling media. The coating sequence, the support material, and the layer thickness are crucial for achieving high activities in the Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction for multiple cycles. The interplay between the mechanical impact of the ball and the catalytically available surface is elucidated.







Abstract
The inert milling balls, commonly utilized in mechanochemical reactions, were coated with a layer of Pd and utilized as catalyst in the direct mechanocatalytic Suzuki reaction. With high yields (&gt;80&#8201;%), the milling balls can be recycled multiple times in the absence of any solvents, ligands, catalyst&#8208;molecules and &#8208;powders, while utilizing as little as 0.8&#8197;mg of Pd per coated milling ball. The coating sequence, the support material, and the layer thickness were examined towards archiving high catalyst retention, low abrasion and high conversion. The approach was transferred to the coating of milling vessels revealing the interplay between catalytically available surface area and the mechanical energy impact in direct mechanocatalysis.

         <title>4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;Labeling Constitutes a Sensitive 19F NMR Probe for Characterization of Interactions in the Minor Groove of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thymidine modified with a 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3 group exhibits a rather flexible orientation in the minor groove of DNA duplexes and is accommodated well by different higher order DNA structures. The high structural adaptability and high 19F NMR sensitivity of 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;thymidine make it an excellent probe for quantitatively distinguishing various DNA structures and for monitoring the dynamics of DNA&#8208;protein interactions in the minor groove by means of 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Fluorinated nucleotides are invaluable for 19F NMR studies of nucleic acid structure and function. Here, we synthesized 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;thymidine (T
) and incorporated it into DNA by means of solid&#8208;phase DNA synthesis. NMR studies showed that the 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3 group exhibited a flexible orientation in the minor groove of DNA duplexes and was well accommodated by various higher order DNA structures. The three magnetically equivalent fluorine atoms in 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;DNA constitute an isolated spin system, offering high 19F NMR sensitivity and excellent resolution of the positioning of T
 within various secondary and tertiary DNA structures. The high structural adaptability and high sensitivity of T
 make it a valuable 19F NMR probe for quantitatively distinguishing diverse DNA structures with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution and for monitoring the dynamics of interactions in the minor groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA.

NMR studies showed that the 4&#8242;-SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group exhibited a flexible orientation in the minor groove of DNA duplexes and was well accommodated by various higher order DNA structures. The three magnetically equivalent fluorine atoms in 4&#8242;-SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-DNA constitute an isolated spin system, offering high &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR sensitivity and excellent resolution of the positioning of T
 within various secondary and tertiary DNA structures. The high structural adaptability and high sensitivity of T
 make it a valuable &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR probe for quantitatively distinguishing diverse DNA structures with single-nucleotide resolution and for monitoring the dynamics of interactions in the minor groove of double-stranded DNA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Assembly of a Micro&#8208; and Macroporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Tailored Single&#8208;Crystal Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a crystal of a porous organic material based on a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with hierarchical micro and macroporosity is reported. During the skeletal growth, the crystal size can be easily tailored from micro to centimetre scale while preserving the hierarchical porosity. We used the hierarchical porosity for the sequential co&#8208;recognition of microparticles and molecular species.







Abstract
Porous organic molecular materials represent an emergent field of research in Chemistry and Materials Science due to their unique combination of properties. To enhance their performance and expand the number of applications, the incorporation of hierarchical porosity is required, as exclusive microporosity entails several limitations. However, the integration of macropores in porous organic molecular materials is still an outstanding challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (MM&#8208;TPY) with hierarchical skeletal morphology, containing stable micro&#8208; and macroporosity. The crystal size, from micro to centimetre scale, can be controlled in a single step without using additives or templates. The mechanism of assembly during the crystal formation is compatible with a skeletal crystal growth. As proof of concept, we employed the hierarchical porosity as a platform for the dual, sequential and selective co&#8208;recognition of molecular species and microparticles.

         <title>Back Cover: Targeted Singlet Oxygen Delivery: A Bioorthogonal Metabolic Shunt Linking Hypoxia to Fast Singlet Oxygen Release (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular bioorthogonal metabolic shunt has been shown to successfully link reduced oxygen concentration to singlet oxygen generation with an intermediate fluoride releasing step. As reported by Lei Wang, Engin&#8197;U. Akkaya et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202210249), this approach not only broadens the spectrum of intracellular bioorthogonal reactions, but at the same time highlights a new pathway to follow towards smart and selective therapeutic agents, with precise spatio&#8208;temporal targeting of singlet oxygen.

         <title>Inside Cover: Thermoreversible Polymorph Transitions in Supramolecular Polymers of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Squaramides (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoreversible polymorph transitions &#160;in supramolecular polymers&#160;are reported in the Communication (e202213345) by Juan Arag&#243;, Bartolome Soberats et&#8197;al. This behavior was observed in a new family of squaramides that self&#8208;assemble into particles at room temperature and undergo a reversible morphological transformation into fibers when the sample is cooled. This transformation is triggered by a molecular rearrangement of the aggregated system implying a change in the squaramide hydrogen bonding pattern.

The energy&#8208;efficient separation of alkane isomers for gasoline upgrading using Bi&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks with auxetic reentrant pore structures is reported by Dan Zhao et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202211808). The honeycomb&#8208;like pore cavities connected by narrow pore windows of the pore structure lead to a complete rejection of di&#8208;branched alkanes and to high capacities for other isomers.

A lone 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam molecule moves towards the catalytic site of an illuminated dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8) in a vast universe of chemical space. Achieving DPP8/9 selectivity has remained a challenge in chemical biology. The 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams, identified by a chemoproteomics platform as DPP8/9 inhibitors, may hold the key to the highly sought DPP8/9 selectivity via an unprecedented DPP8&#8208;specific mechanism, as demonstrated through X&#8208;ray diffraction by Markus Kaiser, Rui Moreira et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202210498).

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes by Photosensitized Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the recent seminal findings on the possibility to use photoexcited nitroarenes as modular and easily dosable reagents which can mimic the reactivity of ozonolysis for the oxidative conversion of alkenyl bonds into carbonyl groups in a highly selective fashion.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of alkenes into carbonyl molecules mainly relies on either ozonolysis or Lemieux&#8208;Johnson oxidation involving high valent transition metal oxides. Safety, technical concerns and highly oxidizing conditions of both these procedures limited their adoption in streamlined synthesis. Like ozone, photosensitized nitroarenes can deliver similar types of [3+2] cycloaddition products with alkenes through biradical formation and the resulting &#8220;N&#8208;doped&#8221; ozonides can safely be converted to the corresponding carbonyl compounds through hydrolysis. The high prevalence of nitroarenes with diverse electronic and steric profiles combined with the mild oxidizing power allow to modulate site&#8208;selectivity and tolerate highly sensitive functional groups ideal for application in complex molecular setup.

         <title>Biomolecule&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials: Construction, Progress, and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, the generation, induction and amplification of CPL&#8208;active materials based on biomolecules, as well as their emerging applications due to sensitive CPL signals, are reviewed and prospects for future development considered. New insights are also provided towards the design of chiral functional biomaterials and their potential applications.







Abstract
Chiral materials related to circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) make up a rapidly developing new field that has broad application prospects in optoelectronic devices, selective recognition, biomedicine, and other fields. Biofunctional chiral materials are also attracting increasing attention because of their unique biocompatibility, chiral recognition, and coding. However, there has been little discussion on biomolecule&#8208;based CPL till now. In this Review, the latest progress in CPL materials related with biomolecules are reviewed, including the chiral construction from molecular level to giant microstructure, as well as their emerging applications. In addition, we discuss the challenges and prospects of bio&#8208;based CPL materials, hoping this work will provide new perspectives and insights for more related research.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Photocatalysts for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs have made tremendous development as heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic reactions. Nevertheless, comprehensive reviews on the mechanisms of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations are lacking. This Review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations and focuses on the photocatalytic mechanisms subdivided according to the type of reactions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging category of organic polymers with highly porous crystalline structures. In the last decade, reports on the use of COFs as heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations have shown significant progress. Still, comprehensive reviews on the mechanisms of the photocatalytic organic transformations using COFs are lacking. This Review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations. Firstly, we discuss the photophysical properties and the characterization methods of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Then, the general photocatalytic mechanism, the advantages, and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts are summarized. After that, advanced examples of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations are analyzed with regard to the underlying mechanisms. The Review ends with a critical perspective on the challenges and prospects.

         <title>Challenges Arising from Continuous&#8208;Flow Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview aims to provide a survey of the symbiotic developments of flow chemistry and olefin metathesis. Looking at the current state of the art, key challenges have been retrospectively identified in terms of both catalyst and flow reactor design and development, which together paint an intriguing outlook for the future development at this interface.







Abstract
The versatility of olefin metathesis is evident from its successful applications ranging from natural product synthesis to the valorization of renewable feedstocks. On the other side, flow chemistry has recently gained particular interest among the synthetic community, offering valuable alternatives to classic batch chemistry and paving the way to the development of new transformations. The application of continuous&#8208;flow methods to olefin metathesis represents one of the most promising evolutions in the field at the interface of industrially relevant synthesis and reactor engineering, significantly improving some of the typical problems such as undesired self&#8208;reactions and ethylene&#8208;mediated catalyst deactivation. This Minireview aims to provide a brief survey covering the major aspects of those techniques which we hope may be of interest for the chemical community as well as those interested in catalysis, continuous processing, enabling technologies and reactor design.

         <title>Counter Electrode Reactions&#8212;Important Stumbling Blocks on the Way to a Working Electro&#8208;organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every electrochemical synthesis is paired with conversion at the counter electrode. In electro&#8208;organic synthesis, often only the desired half reaction is described well, although good control over the counter reaction is essential. In this Review, the impact of the counter electrode reaction in electro&#8208;organic synthesis is highlighted through a collection of common and unusual counter reactions.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, electro&#8208;organic synthesis has gained significant interest, both in technical and academic research as well as in terms of applications. The omission of stoichiometric oxidizers or reducing agents enables a more sustainable route for redox reactions in organic chemistry. Even if it is well&#8208;known that every electrochemical oxidation is only viable with an associated reduction reaction and vice versa, the relevance of the counter reaction is often less addressed. In this Review, the importance of the corresponding counter reaction in electro&#8208;organic synthesis is highlighted and how it can affect the performance and selectivity of the electrolytic conversion. A selection of common strategies and unique concepts to tackle this issue are surveyed to provide a guide to select appropriate counter reactions for electro&#8208;organic synthesis.

         <title>Stimuli Responsive Silylene: Electromerism Induced Reversible Switching Between Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed valent silicon compound is synthesized in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The mixed valency of the compound allowed reversible electromerism under the influence of Lewis&#8208;acid/base acting as external stimuli. A mono&#8208;silylene ligand could be transformed to bis&#8208;silylene by adding CuI salts. Upon removal of CuI salts, the bis&#8208;silylene motif reverts back to mono&#8208;silylene.







Abstract
Electromerism is a very well&#8208;known phenomenon in transition metal chemistry. In main group chemistry, this concept has only started getting attention recently. We report stimuli responsive low&#8208;valent silicon compounds exhibiting electromerism. A mixed&#8208;valent silaiminyl&#8208;silylene 1, [LSi&#8722;Si(NDipp)L] (L=PhC(NtBu)2), was synthesized in a single step from amidinate&#8208;chlorosilylene. Compound 1 has two interconnected Si atoms in formally +I and +III oxidation states. Upon treatment with Lewis acidic CuIX (X=mesityl, Cl, Br, I), electron redistribution occurs resulting in the formation of [{LSi(NDipp)Si(L)}&#8722;CuX], in which both silicon atoms are in the +II formal oxidation state. Removal of the copper center from [{LSi(NDipp)Si(L)}&#8722;CuX] by using a Lewis basic carbene led to reformation of the precursor [LSi&#8722;Si(NDipp)L]. Thus, the process is fully reversible. This showcases the first example of Lewis acid/base&#8208;induced reversible electromerism in silicon chemistry.

         <title>Mesoporous N&#8208;rich Carbon with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms as a Multifunctional Sulfur Host for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly mesoporous N&#8208;rich carbon with single&#8208;Ni sites (Ni&#8208;NC(p)) is synthesized by a novel and facile strategy and employed as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li&#8208;S batteries. The unique architecture, N dopant, and single&#8208;Ni atoms enable the effective confinement and fast redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides towards efficient Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
Physicochemical confinement and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are crucial to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance the redox kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, a NH4Cl&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy is developed to fabricate highly mesoporous N&#8208;rich carbon (designed as NC(p)) featuring thin outer shells and porous inner networks, on which single&#8208;Ni atoms are anchored to form an excellent sulfur host (designed as Ni&#8208;NC(p)) for Li&#8208;S batteries. During pyrolysis, the pyrolytic HCl from confined NH4Cl within ZIF&#8208;8 will in situ etch ZIF&#8208;8 to produce rich mesoporous in the carbonized product NC(p). The mesoporous Ni&#8208;NC(p) enables favorable electron/ion transfer, high sulfur loading, and effective confinement of LiPSs, while the catalytic effect of single&#8208;Ni species enhances the redox kinetics of LiPSs. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on the Ni&#8208;NC(p) host delivers obviously improved Li&#8208;S battery performance with high specific capacity, good rate capability, and cycling stability.

         <title>Linear Axially Chiral Conjugated Polymers Exhibiting Ultralong Low&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Intense Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of linear axially chiral conjugated polymers were constructed in a facile manner. These polymers showed an ultralong low&#8208;temperature afterglow of up to 33&#8197;s and also exhibited intense circularly polarized luminescence with an absolute glum value of up to 0.01.







Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), as two important branches in the field of organic optical functional materials have broad prospects. In this work, a pair of novel conjugated polymers with low&#8208;temperature UOP and intense CPL properties are constructed by incorporating rigid axially chiral chromophores into a polymeric backbone. The twisted and rigid biphenyl skeleton not only effectively reduces the energy gap between the S1 and T to greatly facilitate the intersystem crossing process, but also suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay from T1 to S0. As a result, a strong and ultralong afterglow of up to 33&#8197;s is achieved in 2&#8208;MeTHF at 77&#8197;K. Moreover, the repeating rigid biphenyl skeleton with its helix&#8208;like form also promotes the chiroptical activity of the polymers, and intense signals are shown in the low&#8208;temperature CPL spectra with absolute glum values of 9.7&#215;10&#8722;3 and 5.8&#215;10&#8722;3 at the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission peaks, respectively. This work represents the first low&#8208;temperature materials with UOP and CPL properties, which provides a new guideline and perspective for the development of persistent luminescence materials.

         <title>PNP Ligands in Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Activation and Functionalization of White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
White phosphorus (P4) can be activated in the coordination sphere of cobalt complexes bearing PNP ligands. The use of N,N bis(diphenylphosphino)amine as a ligand gives a P4 transformation into a zig&#8208;zag chain which can readily be functionalized by Ph2P groups to form a complex containing a unique P9&#8208;ligand. The presence of an organic substituent at the nitrogen atom in the PNP ligand gives complexes with an &#951;1&#8208;coordinated P4 molecule.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal mediated white phosphorus activation is of high interest as an ecological alternative to P4 chlorination pathway to the practically useful phosphorus products. Herein, we report a facile approach for P4 activation, transformation and subsequent functionalization using cobalt complexes bearing PNP ligands. The use of N,N&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)amine as a ligand allows one to transform P4 tetrahedron into a zig&#8208;zag chain with the formation of complex [Co(Ph2PNHP(Ph2)PPPPP(Ph2)NHPPh2)]BF4 (4). The presence of organic substituent at nitrogen atom in PNP ligand enables one to obtain complexes with &#951;1&#8208;coordinated P4 molecule, which indicates a crucial role of N&#8722;H bond in transformation of white phosphorus tetrahedron. Additionally, complex 4 can readily be functionalized by means of the reaction with Ph2PCl leading to the formation of a new complex bearing unique P9&#8208;ligand. The obtained results provide opportunities for facile construction of new polyphosphorus ligands in the coordination sphere of transition metal complexes.

The unprecedented OBO&#8208;doped [4]triangulene exhibits long&#8208;range ordered 2D nanoarchitectures on metal surfaces, with a substrate&#8208;dependent character that is superior to previous nanographene&#8208;based 2D assemblies and thus holds potential for future nanotechnological applications.







Abstract
Triangulenes have attracted enormous interest in organic chemistry and materials science, but suffer from their high instability towards oxygen. Embedding heteroatoms into triangulenes provides a new class of ambient stable materials for various applications. However, [3]heterotriangulenes have dominated the chemistry of heteroatom&#8208;doped triangulenes, while their higher homologues have been rarely explored. In this work, we synthesize a new [4]heterotriangulene with three oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;oxygen (OBO) segments incorporated into the zigzag edges. The planar geometry of the OBO&#8208;doped [4]triangulene is demonstrated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Self&#8208;assembly on metal surfaces reveals substrate&#8208;dependent nanostructures, leading to different long&#8208;range ordered 2D patterns on Ag and Cu substrates with negligible defects.

         <title>A Photoelectrochemical Nanoreactor for Single&#8208;Cell Sampling and Near Zero&#8208;Background Faradaic Detection of Intracellular microRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical nanoreactor was devised for single&#8208;cell sampling and near zero&#8208;background faradic detection of intracellular microRNA. This platform provided a new perspective for exploring light&#8208;biomatter interplay toward single&#8208;cell studies.







Abstract
Rational utilization of the rich light&#8208;bio&#8208;matter interplay taking place in single&#8208;cell analysis represents a new technological direction in the field. The light&#8208;fueled operation is expected to achieve advanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) single&#8208;cell analysis with unknown possibilities. Here, a PEC nanoreactor capable of single&#8208;cell sampling and near zero&#8208;background Faradaic detection of intracellular microRNA (miR) is devised by the construction of a small reaction chamber accommodating the target&#8208;triggered hybridization chain reaction for binding the metallointercalator of [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+ as the signal reporter. Light stimulation of the dsDNA/metallointercalator adduct will induce the generation of photocurrents, underpinning a zero&#8208;biased and near zero&#8208;background PEC method toward Faradaic detection of non&#8208;electrogenic miR at the single&#8208;cell level. Using this nanotool, lower miR concentration in the near&#8208;nucleus region than that in the main cytosol was revealed.

         <title>A General Strategy for the Asymmetric Preparation of &#945;&#8208;Stereogenic Allyl Silanes, Germanes, and Boronate Esters via Dual Copper Hydride&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for the enantioselective preparation of &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids (M=B, Si, Ge) with broad functional group compatibility has been developed. This protocol employs dual CuH&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalysis to access a variety of allyl metalloid species from readily accessible vinyl metalloids and enol triflates.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Stereogenic allyl metalloids are versatile synthetic intermediates which can undergo various stereocontrolled transformations. Most existing methods to prepare &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids involve multi&#8208;step sequences that curtail the number of compatible substrates and are limited to the synthesis of boronates. Here, we report a general method for the enantioselective preparation of &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids utilizing dual CuH&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalysis. This approach leverages a stereoretentive Cu&#8208;to&#8208;Pd transmetalation of an in situ generated alkyl copper species to allow access to enantioenriched allyl silanes, germanes, and boronate esters with broad functional group compatibility.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed PIDA&#8208;Mediated &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Acetoxylation of Amino Acid Derivatives: Overriding Competitive Intramolecular Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acetoxylation of amino acid derivatives has been achieved by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) as terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The N&#8208;SO2Py protecting/directing group plays a key role in enabling control of chemoselectivity (intermolecular C&#8722;O over intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation) and regioselectivity (favoring &#948;&#8208;CH3 over &#947;&#8208;CH2 activation).







Abstract
The selective &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acetoxylation of N&#8208;(SO2Py)&#8208;protected amino acid derivatives has been accomplished by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) as both terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The distinct structural and electronic features of the SO2Py compared to more traditional carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups is essential to override the otherwise more favourable competitive intramolecular C&#8722;H amination. The &#948;&#8208;site selectivity predominates over traditionally more favorable 5&#8208;membered cyclopalladation at competitive &#947;&#8208;CH2. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies provide important insights about the mechanism and the underlying factors controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

         <title>Endohedrally Functionalized Heteroleptic Coordination Cages for Phosphate Ester Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroleptic [Pd2A2B2] coordination cages was prepared by shape&#8208;complementary assembly (SCA) from a modular set of ligands and screened for binding phosphate guests. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that an endohedral hydrogen bond donor site is the decisive but not exclusive factor for binding phosphate diesters inside the cavity in a competitive solvent.







Abstract
Metallosupramolecular hosts of nanoscopic dimensions, which are able to serve as selective receptors and catalysts, are usually composed of only one type of organic ligand, restricting diversity in terms of cavity shape and functional group decoration. We report a series of heteroleptic [Pd2A2B2] coordination cages that self&#8208;assemble from a library of shape complementary bis&#8208;monodentate ligands in a non&#8208;statistical fashion. Ligands A feature an inward pointing NH function, able to engage in hydrogen bonding and amenable to being functionalized with amide and alkyl substituents. Ligands B comprise tricyclic aromatic backbones of different shape and electronic situation. The obtained heteroleptic coordination cages were investigated for their ability to bind phosphate diesters as guests. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent were conducted to understand the mechanistic relationships behind the experimentally determined guest affinities.

         <title>Reversible Copper Cathode for Nonaqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports that copper metal can work as a cathode of dual&#8208;ion batteries in non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte. The reversible conversion between commercial bulk copper metal and copper salt Cu(TFSI)2 demonstrates high capacity, relatively high voltage, and relatively stable cycle life in lithium dual&#8208;ion batteries. This finding may offer a promising direction for enhancing the energy density of dual&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Most reported cathodes of nonaqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) host anions via insertion reactions. It is necessary to explore new cathode chemistry to increase the battery energy density. To date, transition metals have yet to be investigated for nonaqueous DIBs, albeit they may offer high capacity in anodic conversion reactions. Here, we report that bulk copper powder exhibits a high reversible capacity of 762&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3.2&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li and relatively stable cycling in common organic electrolytes. The operation of the copper electrode is coupled with the transfer of anion charge carriers. An anion exchange membrane separator is employed to prevent Cu2+ from crossing from the catholyte to the anode side. We designed an unbalanced electrolyte with a more concentrated anolyte than a catholyte. This addresses the concentration overpotential ensued during charge and facilitates the high specific capacity and enhanced reversibility. This finding provides a promising direction for high&#8208;energy DIBs.

         <title>Improved Charge Separation in Poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) Imides with Semi&#8208;coherent Interfaces for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) imides with a semi&#8208;coherent interface largely promote the separation and transfer of charge carriers owing to the built&#8208;in electric field and thereby enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency.







Abstract
The construction of heterojunctions is a promising manner to accelerate the separation and transfer of the charge carriers at the interface. Herein, a binary poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) imides (PHI/PTI) with semi&#8208;coherent interfaces was fabricated via a facile two&#8208;step salt&#8208;melt synthetic process. The built&#8208;in electric fields at the semi&#8208;coherent interface endow prompt exciton splitting and charge carrier separation. Hence, the optimized PHI/PTI&#8208;based copolymer presents a high apparent quantum yield (AQY=64&#8201;%) for visible&#8208;light driven hydrogen production, by the aids of K2HPO4 as charge transfer mediator. This study provides physical insights for the rational promotion of the photocatalytic performance from the viewpoint of interfacial engineering of photocatalytic junctions on crystalline carbon nitride based semiconductors.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Alcohols via Nickel Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyzed synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alcohols B is presented that exploits the condensation of iodoarenes and the redox active ether A via cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. A mechanistic study was conducted using a comprehensive computational investigation that was also supported by ad hoc control experiments and showed that the key 1,2&#8208;HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) event results in the formation of a C&#8208;centered radical C&#8242; that mimics the reactivity of trifluoroacetaldehyde.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between the redox&#8208;active N&#8208;trifluoroethoxyphthalimide and iodoarenes is documented. The protocol reproduces a formal arylation of trifluoroacetaldehyde under mild conditions in high yields (up to 88&#8201;%) and with large functional group tolerance (30 examples). A combined computational and experimental investigation revealed a pivotal solvent assisted 1,2&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) process to generate a nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl C&#8208;centered radical for the Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bond forming process.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Targeted Polypeptide Nanoantidotes Improve Chemotherapy Tolerance of Cisplatin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the presence of disulfide bonds, nanoantidotes capture cisplatin (CDDP) through highly stable Pt&#8722;S bonds to form a series of non&#8208;toxic mononuclear/dinuclear complexes centered on Pt atoms. The pre&#8208;enriched nanoantidotes accelerate the metabolism of CDDP from normal organs, reduce the side effects of chemotherapy, and improve the therapeutic window of the free drug.







Abstract
The toxicity of drugs causes various adverse effects in patients. While antidotes that neutralize drug toxicity help reduce systemic damage during clinical therapy, these antidotes are generally accompanied by the loss of drug efficacy. Herein, the spatiotemporally targeted polycystine&#8208;based nanoantidotes were designed as a neutralizer of cisplatin (CDDP) to decrease its toxicity without affecting its anticancer efficacy. The nanoantidotes administered before CDDP selectively accumulated in the liver and kidney and then firmly bound to CDDP through the highly stable Pt&#8722;S bond during subsequent chemotherapy. This two&#8208;step administration strategy reduced the level of Pt in normal organs, shortened the half&#8208;life of CDDP in plasma, and increased the tolerance to CDDP. More importantly, the nanoantidotes maintained the anticancer efficacy of CDDP after reducing systemic toxicity, indicating its great potential in expanding the clinical application of CDDP.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Anilines with Aromatic Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of anilines with non&#8208;activated aryl halides has been achieved by a metalla&#8208;tautomerism approach. The reactivity of an aniline towards a palladium catalyst was relayed from the NH group into the aromatic ring. Out of four possible positions, the catalytic arylation was directed exclusively into the para&#8208;C&#8722;H position by a bulky ligand at the palladium in combination with a temporarily installed shielding group.







Abstract
Controlling regioselectivity in C&#8722;H functionalizations is a key challenge in chemical method development. In arenes, functionalizations are most difficult to direct towards the C&#8722;H group furthest away from a substituent, in its para position. We herein demonstrate how the para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of anilines with non&#8208;activated aryl halides, elusive to date, is achieved by a base&#8208;assisted &#8220;metalla&#8208;tautomerism&#8221; approach. A proton is abstracted from the aniline substrate and replaced by an arylpalladium species, generated from the aryl halide coupling partner. In this step, the palladium is directed away from the N&#8208; to the tautomeric para&#8208;C&#8722;H position by a large phosphine ligand combined with a triphenylmethyl shielding group. The triphenylmethyl group is easily installed and removed, and can be recycled.

         <title>Targeted Singlet Oxygen Delivery: A Bioorthogonal Metabolic Shunt Linking Hypoxia to Fast Singlet Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodular endoperoxide with a hypoxia sensitive functionality and fluoride&#8208;reactive stopper for the cycloreversion was synthesized. Under reductive conditions of the hypoxic cancer cells, a bioorthogonal shunt which releases cytotoxic singlet oxygen via the intermediacy of a fluoride signal becomes operative. The result is a very precise spatio&#8208;temporal targeting of singlet oxygen, which opens a new path toward potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen can be generated by thermal cycloreversion of aromatic endoperoxides. However, for any practical potential of chemically generated singlet oxygen within a therapeutic context, the time and place of the release of this cytotoxic species must be tightly regulated. We now show that using a bimodular design with a hypoxia responsive unit and fluoride&#8208;triggered endoperoxide unit, a bioorthogonal metabolic shunt can be established, where an enzymatically generated submicromolar fluoride signal plays a crucial role. Thus, cellular nitroreductase is repurposed in a bioorthogonal enzymatic activity, where it releases fluoride ions upon the reduction of a targeted compound. The fluoride ions released in the initial reaction remove the silyl stopper, yielding a highly accelerated release of singlet oxygen. The result is a remarkable difference in cytotoxicity between hypoxic and normoxic conditions as evidenced by microscopy, viability assays and the use of control compounds.

         <dc:description>
A sequential phosphine&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation and oxidative central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer strategy has been developed, allowing for rapid access to a range of axially chiral CF3&#8208;containing 2&#8208;arylpyrroles with high enantiomeric excess. The practicality of the method is also illustrated in the atroposelective synthesis of esaxerenone.







Abstract
A sequential phosphine&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation of aldimines with allenoates and oxidative central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer strategy has been developed. This approach is operationally simple, allowing for rapid access to a range of axially chiral CF3&#8208;containing 2&#8208;arylpyrroles with high enantiomeric excess. Furthermore, an atroposelective synthesis of esaxerenone is presented, illustrating the practical potential of the reported method.

         <title>A Missing Link in Multisubstituted Pyrrolidines: Remote Stereocontrol Forged by Rhodium&#8208;Alkyl Nitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the importance of pyrrolidines in drug discovery together with the dearth of methods for synthesizing multisubstituted heterocycles with nonadjacent stereocenters, we report the stereoselective synthesis of remotely decorated, trisubstituted &#946;&#8208;prolines via Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amination. The present protocol addresses the prevalent limitations associated with substituted pyrrolidines.







Abstract
Pyrrolidines are significant N&#8208;heterocycles in medicinal chemistry and are among the top ten ring systems found in drug molecules. While simple derivatives are commercially available, densely decorated derivatives with precise stereochemical arrangements remain difficult to obtain. Methods for synthesizing multisubstituted pyrrolidines with nonadjacent stereocenters are particularly scarce. To bridge this gap, we report the stereoselective synthesis of remotely decorated, trisubstituted &#946;&#8208;prolines via Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amination. The transformation proceeds well in the presence of various functionalities with exclusive anti&#8208;selectivity. Carboxylic acids in the products serve as gateways for diverse downstream transformations. Furthermore, the combined experimental and computational study sheds lights on the origin of high diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Amorphous Calcium Carbonate Cluster Nanospheres in Water&#8208;Deficient Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous calcium carbonate(ACC) nanoparticles are synthesized in water&#8208;deficient ethanol solution. The nanoparticles consist of tiny clusters as revealed by cryo&#8208;TEM. ACC can aggregate on templates such as graphene oxide nanosheets. These findings provide a theoretical basis for controlled synthesis of ACC and a strategy to fabricate ultrathin mineral coatings on different substrates.







Abstract
As the key intermediate phase of crystalline calcium carbonate biominerals, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) remains mysterious in its structures because of its long&#8208;range disorder and instability. We herein report the synthesis of ACC nanospheres in a water&#8208;deficient organic solvent system. The obtained ACC nanospheres are very stable under dry conditions. Cryo&#8208;TEM reveals that each nanospheres consists of smaller nanosized clusters. We further demonstrate that these clusters can precipitate on other substrates to form an ultrathin ACC coating, which should be an ACC cluster monolayer. The results demonstrate that the presence of small ACC clusters as the subunits of larger aggregates is inherent to ACC synthesized in water&#8208;alcohol system but not induced by polymer additives.

         <title>Unexpected Persistent Production of Reactive Oxygen Species during the Degradation of Black Phosphorous in the Darkness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation mechanism of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FLBP) is not well understood. It is now shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is involved in the FLBP degradation process even in the dark. This ROS generation is persistent and proceeds in a three&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FLBP) is easily degraded under ambient conditions which is problem that hinders the application of FLBP, but its degradation mechanism is not yet well understood. In this work, we surprisingly found that persistent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was involved in FLBP degradation even in the dark. The ROS generation patterns and mechanism were revealed by chemiluminescence (CL) and density functional theory (DFT). Meanwhile, rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) can also be removed by FLBP under dark conditions, which further shows the ROS generation during FLBP self&#8208;degradation. This work provides new insights into the FLBP self&#8208;degradation mechanism and opens opportunities to practically implement FLBP for green catalytic application.

         <title>Efficient Splitting of Alkane Isomers by a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Auxetic Reentrant Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient gasoline upgrading with a research octane number (RON) higher than 96 was achieved in a reentrant auxetic honeycomb&#8208;like bismuth&#8208;based MOF with a combined fitting of pore window and chemistry. It enables the unprecedented exclusion of di&#8208;branched isomers and molecular discrimination of linear and mono&#8208;branched alkanes.







Abstract
The isolation of di&#8208;branched alkanes from their isomers is vital in gasoline upgrading to achieve high octane numbers but is significantly challenging and energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report the highly efficient separation of hexane isomers by combing molecular recognition and size&#8208;sieving in a bismuth&#8208;based MOF, UU&#8208;200. The unique auxetic structure with reentrant honeycomb&#8208;like pore cavities connected by narrow pore windows endows UU&#8208;200 with a complete rejection of di&#8208;branched alkanes and high capacities for linear and mono&#8208;branched isomers. The molecular sieving effect, unprecedented separation selectivities, and excellent efficiencies are proved via adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments with high research octane numbers obtained (&gt;96), indicating a benchmark for alkane separation under ambient conditions. The molecular recognition mechanism was unveiled by theoretical simulation and in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Carboxylation of Aryl Thianthrenium Salts with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of aryl thianthrenium salts with carbon dioxide at room temperature has been developed. In combination with C&#8722;H thianthrenation, this work provides an efficient site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation method, which may be used in the late&#8208;stage carboxylation modification of drug molecules.







Abstract
Carboxyl group is one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Herein, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of aryl thianthrenium salts with carbon dioxide (CO2) at room temperature has been developed. The reaction employs low loading of cuprous chloride catalyst under 1&#8197;atm CO2 and exhibits good functional group tolerance. In combination with C&#8722;H thianthrenation of aromatic hydrocarbons, this work provides an efficient method for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of aromatic hydrocarbons. It may serve as a significant late&#8208;stage carboxylation tool for the modification of drug molecules in the future.

         <title>Highly Controllable Nanoassemblies of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles with Abnormal Disassembly&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement for In Vivo Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An abnormal disassembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (&gt;6 fold, with quantum yields (QYs) as high as 12&#8201;%) is observed from the water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with highly redshifted emission at &#8776;1070&#8197;nm and QYs of 1.8&#8201;%. The nanoassemblies are fabricated through a facile and feasible method using a unique Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si crosslinking strategy in solution.







Abstract
Assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement has been widely observed for luminophors but it causes emission decrease after disassembly. The construction of unique nanoassemblies with disassembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (DIEE) is demanded. Herein, by taking advantages of alterable siloxane bridge crosslinking states, we report a facile strategy to fabricate water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with abnormal DIEE. The fabricated AuNP nanoassemblies with dominant interparticle crosslinking showed a redshifted emission at &#8776;1070&#8197;nm with quantum yields (QYs) of 1.8&#8201;%. After disassembly, the nanoassemblies with increased intraparticle crosslinking exhibited a unique DIEE (&gt;6 folds, QYs, 12&#8201;%) due to the enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition. Besides, the disassembly facilitated renal clearance of AuNPs to reduce nonspecific retention in the body, opening new possibilities for designing highly emissive renal&#8208;clearable nanostructures toward more bioapplications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework@Metal Oxide Heterostructures Induced by Electron&#8208;Beam Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF synthesis is achieved by high&#8208;energy electron&#8208;beam irradiation from a commercially available electron&#8208;accelerator. For ZIF&#8208;8, this synthesis can be accomplished within minutes under ambient conditions, with an energy consumption about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solvothermal route. By changing the dose of the electron beam a hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8@ZnO heterostructure can be formed.







Abstract
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a distinct family of crystalline porous materials finding extensive applications. Their synthesis often requires elevated temperature and relatively long reaction time. We report here the first case of MOF synthesis activated by high&#8208;energy (1.5&#8197;MeV) electron beam radiation from a commercially available electron&#8208;accelerator. Using ZIF&#8208;8 as a representative for demonstration, this type of synthesis can be accomplished under ambient conditions within minutes, leading to energy consumption about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solvothermal condition. Interestingly, by controlling the absorbed dose in the synthesis, the electron beam not only activates the formation reaction of ZIF&#8208;8, but also partially etches the material during the synthesis affording a hierarchical pore architecture and highly crystalline ZnO nanoparticles on the surface of ZIF&#8208;8. This gives rise to a new strategy to obtain MOF@metal oxide heterostructures, finding utilities in photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes.

         <title>Meerwein&#8208;type Bromoarylation with Arylthianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite more than 80&#8197;years of research, Meerwein haloarylation with complex small molecules has not been possible because the required aryldiazonium salts are often not readily accessible from complex structures. We report the first late stage Meerwein&#8208;type bromoarylation of alkenes with stable arylthianthrenium salts, which provides the opportunity to generate complexity quickly.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalyzed Meerwein&#8208;type bromoarylation of alkenes with stable arylthianthrenium salts, formed by site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H thianthrenation. This protocol can be applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of a variety of biomolecules that are difficult to access by other aryl coupling reagents. Halogen introduction allows for a variety of follow&#8208;up transformations, affording numerous biologically active skeletons.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>

Bare Fe3O4 nanoaggregates efficiently adsorb to a variety of common microplastics via hydrogen bonding, allowing full magnetic removal at 1&#8201;% of plastic weight, and complete microplastic degradation due to its nanozyme activity at high temperatures.







Abstract
Removal and degradation of microplastics are often carried out separately. In this work, hydrophilic bare Fe3O4 nanoaggregates allowed efficient removal of the most common microplastics including high&#8208;density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate. Full extraction was achieved using Fe3O4 at 1&#8201;% of the mass of microplastics. Hydrogen bonding is the main force for the adsorption of Fe3O4. Unlike the more commonly used hydrophobically modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the bare Fe3O4 benefitted from the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of its exposed surface, enabling further catalytic degradation of microplastics with nearly 100&#8201;% efficiency and easy recovery of the Fe3O4.

         <title>Programming Non&#8208;Nucleic Acid Molecules into Computational Nucleic Acid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acid (NA) computation has been widely developed in the past years to solve kinds of logic and mathematic issues in both information technologies and biomedical analysis. However, the difficulty to integrate non&#8208;NA molecules limits its power as a universal platform for molecular computation. Here, we report a versatile prototype of hybridized computation integrated with both nucleic acids and non&#8208;NA molecules. Employing the conformationally controlled ligand converters, we demonstrate that non&#8208;NA molecules, including both small molecules and proteins, can be computed as nucleic acid strands to construct the circuitry with increased complexity and scalability, and can be even programmed to solve arithmetical calculations within the computational nucleic acid system. This study opens a new door for molecular computation in which all&#8208;NA circuits can be expanded with integration of various ligands, and meanwhile, ligands can be precisely programmed by the nuclei acid computation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode in a Dilute Aqueous Electrolyte Enabled by a pH Buffer Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries have drawn increasing attention due to the intrinsic safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness and high energy density. However, parasitic reactions and non&#8208;uniform dendrite growth on the Zn anode side impede their application. Herein, a multifunctional additive, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NHP), is introduced to regulate uniform zinc deposition and to suppress side reactions. The results show that the NH4+  tends to be preferably absorbed on the Zn surface to form a &#8220;shielding effect&#8221; and blocks the direct contact of water with Zn. Moreover, NH4+  and (H2PO4)&#8208;  jointly maintain pH values of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the NHP additive enables highly reversible Zn plating/stripping behaviors in Zn//Zn and Zn//Cu cells. Furthermore, the electrochemical performances of Zn//MnO2  full cells and Zn//active carbon (AC) capacitors are improved. This work provides an efficient and general strategy for modifying Zn plating/stripping behaviors and suppressing side reactions in mild aqueous electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeleton&#8208;Reorganizing Coupling Reactions of Cycloheptatriene and Cycloalkenones with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The skeletal reorganization reactions have emerged as an intriguing tool for converting readily available compounds into complicated molecules inaccessible by traditional methods. Herein, we report a unique skeletally reorganized coupling reaction of cycloheptatriene and cycloalkenone with amines. In the presence of Rh/acid catalysis, cycloheptatriene can selectively couple with anilines to deliver fused 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline products. Mechanistic studies indicate that the retro&#8208;Mannich type ring&#8208;opening and subsequent intramolecular Povarov reaction account for the ring&#8208;reorganization. Our mechanistic studies also revealed that skeletally reorganized amination between anilines and cycloalkenones could be obtained by acid. The synthetic utilization of this skeleton&#8208;reorganizing coupling reaction features a gram&#8208;scale protocol, synthetic derivations, and the late&#8208;stage modification of commercial drugs.</dc:description>

In this work, a random polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide) (PMMA&#8208;AM), was synthesized to serve as an interfacial passivation layer for synergistically passivating the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ and anchor the I of the [PbI6]4&#8208; octahedron. Additionally, the interfacial PMMA&#8208;AM passivation layer can not be destroyed during the hole transport layer deposition because of its low solubility in chlorobenzene. This passivation leads to an enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12 to 1.22 V and improved stability in solar cell devices, with the device maintaining 95% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1000 h of maximum power point tracking. Additionally, a large&#8208;area solar cell module was fabricated using this approach, achieving a PCE of 20.64%.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Photo&#8208;Crosslinking and Photo&#8208;Sensitizing Properties for Synthetic Fluorescent Protein Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores have been reported for their singlet state fluorescence properties and applications in bioimaging, but rarely for the triplet state chemistries. Herein, we enabled their photo&#8208;sensitizing and photo&#8208;crosslinking properties through rational modulations. Extension of molecular conjugation and introduction of heavy atoms promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species. Unique from other photosensitizers, these chromophores selectively photo&#8208;crosslinked aggregated proteins and uncovered the interactome profiles. We also exemplified their general applications in chromophore&#8208;assisted light inactivation, photodynamic therapy and photo induced polymerization. Theoretical calculation, pathway analysis and transient absorption spectra provided mechanistic insights for this triplet state chemistry. Overall, this work expands the function and application of synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores by enabling their triplet excited state properties.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Empowering Zn Electrode Current Capability Along Interfacial Stability by Optimizing Intrinsic Safe Organic Electrolytes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic Zn is one of the most promising anodes, but its practical application has been hindered by dendritic growth and serious interfacial reactions in conventional electrolytes. Herein, ionic liquids are adopted to prepare intrinsically safe electrolytes via combining with TEP or TMP solvents. With this synergy effect, the blends of TEP/TMP with an IL fraction of ~25 wt% are found to be promising electrolytes, with ionic conductivities comparable to those of standard phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes while electrochemical stabilities are considerably improved; over 1000 h at 2.0 mA cm&#8208;2 and ~350 h at 5.0 mA cm&#8208;2 with a large areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8208;2. The use of functionalized IL turns out to be a key factor in enhancing the Zn2+ transport due to the interaction of Zn2+ ions with IL&#8208;zincophilic sites resulting in reduced interfacial resistance between the electrodes and electrolyte upon cycling leading to spongy&#8208;like highly porous, homogenous, and dendrite&#8208;free zinc as an anode material.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Degradation of Vinyl Polymers with Evenly&#160;Distributed Thioacetal Bonds in Main Chains: Cationic DT Copolymerization of Vinyl Ethers and Cyclic Thioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel method to synthesize degradable poly(vinyl ether)s with cleavable thioacetal bonds periodically arranged in the main chains using controlled cationic copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal (7&#8208;CTA) via degenerative chain transfer (DT) to the internal thioacetal bonds. The thioacetal bonds, which are introduced into the main chain by cationic ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of 7&#8208;CTA with vinyl ethers, serve as in&#8208;chain dormant species to allow homogeneous propagation of vinyl ethers for all internal segments to afford copolymers with controlled overall and segmental molecular weights. The obtained polymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions via hydrolysis. Various vinyl ethers with hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and functional pendants are available. Finally, one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers are also achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Water as an Initial Proton Source for the Electrochemical CO Reduction Reaction on Copper Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we used in situ electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu single&#8208;crystal surfaces under various conditions. Coadsorbed and structure&#8208;/potential&#8208;dependent surface species, including *CO, Cu&#8208;Oad, and Cu&#8208;OHad, were identified using electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope labeling. The relative abundance of *OH follows a &#8216;volcano&#8217; trend with applied potentials in aqueous solutions, which is yet absent in absolute alcoholic solutions.&#160;Combined with DFT calculations, we propose that the surface H2O can serve as a strong proton donor for the first protonation step in both the C1 and C2 pathways of CORR at various applied potentials in alkaline electrolytes, leaving adsorbed *OH on the surface. This work provides fresh insights into the initial protonation steps and identity of key interfacial intermediates formed during CORR on Cu surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Presodiation with Sodium Diphenyl Ketone towards Ultra&#8208;stable Hard Carbon Anodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, yet still suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) is applied to realize dual&#8208;function presodiation for HC anodes. It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven&#8208;membered rings for quasi&#8208;metallic sodium in HC. The as&#8208;formed sodium induces robust NaF&#8208;rich SEI on HC in 1.0 M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of ~100% and capacity retention of 82.4% after 6800 cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of ~100% after 700 cycles. This work provides in&#8208;depth understanding of chemical presodiation and a new strategy for highly stable sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>l&#8208;threonine aldolase (LTA) catalyses C&#8208;C bond synthesis with moderate diastereoselectivity. Here, with LTA from Cellulosilyticum sp (CpLTA) as an object, a mutability landscape was first constructed by performing saturation mutagenesis at substrate access tunnel amino acids. CAST/ISM strategy was then performed to tune diastereoselectivity. As a result, diastereoselectivity of mutant H305L/Y8H/V143R was improved from 37.2% syn  to 99.4% syn . Besides, diastereoselectivity of mutant H305Y/Y8I/W307E was inverted to 97.2% anti . Based on insights provided by the molecular dynamics simulations and coevolution analysis, the Prelog rule was employed to illustrate diastereoselectivity regulation mechanism of LTA, holding that the asymmetric formation of C&#8208;C bond was caused by electrons attacking the carbonyl carbon atoms of substrate aldehyde from re or si faces. The study would be useful to expand LTA applications and guide engineering of other C&#8208;C bond formation enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Organosulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Hosts Enabled by C@Fe3N Sponge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;organosulfur (Li&#8208;OS) batteries, despite possessing high theoretical specific capacity, encounter a few practical challenges, including unsatisfactory lifespan and low active material utilization under realistic conditions. Here, diisoropyl xanthogen polysulfide (DIXPS) has been selected as a model organosulfur compound to investigate the practical feasibility of Li&#8208;OS batteries under realistic conditions. A well&#8208;designed freestanding carbon sponge decorated with Fe3N nanoparticles (C@Fe3N) is introduced into the Li&#8208;OS cells as a scaffold for both Li and DIXPS. The lithiophilic property of the C@Fe3N host guides uniform lithium deposition at the anode, and the catalysis of the DIXPS conversion reaction promotes the kinetics at the cathode. Impressively, the synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1,000 cycles in a Li&#8208;OS full cell under realistic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Retarding the Shuttling Ions in the Electrochromic TiO2 with Extensive Crystallographic Imperfections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To understand the role of structure imperfections on the performance of electrochromic transition metal oxide (ETMO) is a fascinating topic yet challenging to design efficient smart windows. Here, we investigate the performance evolution with tunable crystallographic imperfections for rutile TiO  2  nanowire film (TNF). Structure imperfections, originating mainly from the copious oxygen deficiency, are apt to cumulatively retard the shuttling ions, resulting in the response rate for raw TNF less than the half for TNF annealed at 500 &#176;C. We describe ion accommodation sites as a convolution of normal site and abnormal site, in which the normal site performs reversible coloration but the abnormal site contributes only to charge storage, to give a rationale for the non&#8208;linear coloration and rate capability loss. These findings render a clear picture for the ion shuttling process, hence insightful to enhance the electrochromic performance via structure reprogramming.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Activity and Stability in Spinel Cobalt Oxides through Geometrical Sites Occupation towards Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are vitally important to various energy conversion devices. Herein, we introduce elements Ni and Mn into (Co)tet(Co2)octO4 nanosheets (NSs) at fixed geometrical sites, including &#160;Mnoct, Nioct, and Nitet, to optimize the initial geometrical structure and modulate the CoCo2O4 surface from oxygen&#8208;excess to oxygen&#8208;deficiency. The pristine (Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs shows excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 281.6 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, without damaging their initial activity, the activated (Act)&#8208;(Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs after surface reconstruction exhibit long&#8208;term stability of 100 h under 10 mA cm&#8208;2, 50 mA cm&#8208;2, or even 100 mA cm&#8208;2. The optimal balance between electroactivity and stability leads to remarkable OER performances, providing a pivotal guideline for designing ideal electrocatalysts and inspiring more works to focus on the dynamic change of each occupation site component.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Effect&#8208;Modulated Enhancements of Proton Conductivity in Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We proposed a new strategy to maximize the density of acidic groups by modulating the electronic effects of the substituents for high&#8208;performance proton conductors. The conductivity of the sulfonated  1&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  with methyl group corresponds to 2.25 &#215; 10  &#8208;1  S cm  &#8208;1  at 80  o  C and 90% relative humidity, remarkably an 18600&#8208;fold enhancement over the nonsulfonated  1&#8208;MeL40. 1&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  maintains long&#8208;term conductivity for one month. We confirm that this synthetic method is generalized to the extended version POPs,  2&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  and  3&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  . In particular, the conductivities of the POPs compete with those of top&#8208;level porous organic conductors. Moreover, the activation energy of the POPs is lower than that of the top&#8208;performing materials. This study demonstrates that systematic alteration of the electronic effects of substituents is a useful route to improve the conductivity and long&#8208;term durability of proton&#8208;conducting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoporous Films with Oriented Arrays of Molecular Motors for Light&#8208;Controlled Adsorption and Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motors are fascinating nanomachines. However, constructing smart materials from such functional molecules presents a sever challenge in material science. Here, we present a bottom&#8208;up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of oriented overcrowded&#8208;alkene molecular motors forming a crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework thin film. While all stator parts of the overcrowded&#8208;alkene motors are oriented perpendicular to the substrate, the rotors point into the pores, which are large enough allowing for the light&#8208;induced molecular rotation. Taking advantage of the thin film&#8217; transparency, the motor rotation and its activation energy are determined by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. By gravimetric uptake experiments, molecular motors in crystalline porous materials are used, for the first time, to control the adsorption and diffusion properties of guest molecules in the pores, here, by switching with light between the (meta&#8208;)stable states. The work demonstrates the potential of designed materials with molecular motors and indicates a path for the future development of smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbon Nanotube Binding BODIPY&#8208;C60 Nano Tweezer: Charge Stabilization through Sequential Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy has been developed to generate long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states in single&#8208;wall nanocarbon&#8208;derived multimodular donor&#8211;acceptor hybrids having different diameters. The occurrence of photoexcited electron transfer was demonstrated by employing a variety of physicochemical and transient absorption spectral studies that cover a wide spatial and temporal range.







Abstract
Electron donor&#8211;acceptor (DA) hybrids comprised of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising functional materials for light energy conversion. However, the DA hybrids built on SWCNTs have failed to reveal the much&#8208;sought long&#8208;lived charge separation (CS) due to the close proximity of the DA entities facilitating charge recombination. Here, we address this issue and report an elegant strategy to build multi&#8208;modular DA hybrids capable of producing long&#8208;lived CS states. For this, a nano tweezer featuring V&#8208;shape configured BODIPY was synthesized to host SWCNTs of different diameters via &#960;&#8208;stacking. Supported by spectral, electrochemical, and computational studies, the established energy scheme revealed the possibility of sequential electron transfer. Systematic pump&#8208;probe studies covering wide spatial and temporal scales provided evidence of CS from the initial 1BODIPY* ultimately resulting in C60&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;SWCNT&#8901;+ CS states of lifetimes in the 20&#8208;microsecond range.

Here, we address this issue and report an elegant strategy to build multi-modular DA hybrids capable of producing long-lived CS states. For this, a nano tweezer featuring V-shape configured BODIPY was synthesized to host SWCNTs of different diameters via &#960;-stacking.

         <title>Halide Chemistry in Tin Perovskite Optoelectronics: Bottlenecks and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin halide perovskites (Sn HaPs) are the top lead&#8208;free choice for perovskite optoelectronics, but the oxidation of perovskite Sn2+ to Sn4+ remains a key challenge. However, the role of inconspicuous chemical processes remains underexplored. Specifically, the halide component in Sn HaPs (typically iodide) has been shown to play a key role in dictating device performance and stability due to its high reactivity. Here we describe the impact of native halide chemistry on Sn HaPs. Specifically, molecular halogen formation in Sn HaPs and its role on degradation is reviewed, emphasising the benefits of iodide substitution on improving stability. Next, the ecological impact of halide products of Sn HaP degradation and its mitigation are considered. The development of visible Sn HaP emitters via halide tuning is also summarised.

However, the role of inconspicuous chemical processes remains underexplored. Specifically, the halide component in Sn HaPs (typically iodide) has been shown to play a key role in dictating device performance and stability due to its high reactivity. Here we describe the impact of native halide chemistry on Sn HaPs. Specifically, molecular halogen formation in Sn HaPs and its role on degradation is reviewed, emphasising the benefits of iodide substitution on improving stability. Next, the ecological impact of halide products of Sn HaP degradation and its mitigation are considered. The development of visible Sn HaP emitters via halide tuning is also summarised. Lastly, halide defect management and interfacial engineering for Sn HaP devices are discussed. These insights will inspire efficient and robust Sn HaP optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assessing the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Mice Using a Fluorescence Nanosensor for the Simultaneous Detection and Imaging of pH and Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inflammatory microenvironment involves changes in pH and protein phosphorylation has closely related to the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis (AS). Herein, we constructed a dual&#8208;detection fluorescence nanosensor PCN&#8208;NP&#8208;HPZ based on post modification of MOFs, which realized the simultaneous detection and imaging of pH and phosphorylation through the pH sensitive group piperazine and the Zr(IV) node of MOFs. The sensors were used to track changes in blood pH and phosphate levels at different time stages during atherosclerotic plaque formation. Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging was also performed in vascular endothelium. Blood tests combined with two&#8208;photon fluorescence images indicated that in the early stage of AS, blood and tissue pH levels were lower than that of the normal mice, while phosphate and tissue phosphorylation levels were higher than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a new analysis method for the assessment of early atherosclerotic disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Chiral Molecular Carbon Imides Featuring 12&#8208;Fold [5]helicenes Around Four Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great progress in research on molecular carbons containing multiple helicenes around one core, realizing the stereoselectivity of carbons containing multiple helicenes around more cores is still a great challenge. Herein, molecular carbon C204 featuring 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes around four cores was successfully constructed by using nine perylene diimide (PDI) units, which exhibits good solubility and stability. Despite 256 possible stereoisomers caused by the 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes, we only obtained one pair of enantiomers with D3 symmetry. There are four possible pairs of enantiomers with D3 symmetry, namely 7A, 7B, 7C and 7D. Theoretical and experimental results verify that the obtained structure belongs to 7C which has the lowest energy. The enantiomers are also separated by chiral HPLC. These results suggest that choosing PDIs as building blocks can not only improve the solubility and stability but also realize the stereoselectivity and chirality of molecular carbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophoresis&#8208;Assisted Multilayer Assembly of Nanoparticles for Sensitive Lateral Flow Immunoassay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a rapid, simple, and inexpensive point&#8208;of&#8208;need method. A major limitation of LFIA is a high limit of detection (LOD), which impacts its diagnostic sensitivity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a signal&#8208;enhancement procedure that is performed after completing LFIA and involves controllably moving biotin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles by electrophoresis. The nanoparticles link to immunocomplexes forming multilayer aggregates on the test strip, thus, enhancing the signal. Here, we demonstrate lowering the LOD of hepatitis B surface antigen from approximately 8 to 0.12 ng/mL, making it clinically acceptable. Testing 118 clinical samples for hepatitis B showed that signal enhancement increased the diagnostic sensitivity of LFIA from 73% to 98% while not affecting its 95% specificity. Electrophoresis&#8208;driven enhancement of LFIA is universal (antigen&#8208;independent), takes two minutes, and can be performed by an untrained person.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams with organoboronate esters could provide the synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#946;&#8208;lactams. The challenge arises mainly from the construction of sterically congested quaternary stereocenters between the tertiary alkyl radicals and chiral copper(II) species. Herein, we describe our success in achieving such transformations through the utilization of a copper/hemilabile N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst to forge the sterically congested chiral C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bond via a single&#8208;electron reduction/transmetalation/bond formation catalytic cycle. The synthetic potential of this approach is shown in the straightforward conversion of the corresponding products into many valuable building blocks.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though [60]fullerene is an achiral molecular nanocarbon with Ih symmetry, it could attain an inherent chirality depending upon a functionalization pattern. The conventional chiral induction of C60 relies mainly upon a multiple addition affording a mixture of achiral and chiral isomers while their chiral function would be largely offset by the existence of pseudo&#8208;mirror plane(s). These are major obstacles to proceed further study on fullerene chirality and yet leave its understanding elusive. Herein, we showcase a carbene&#8208;mediated synthesis of C1&#8208;symmetric chiral open&#8208;[60]fullerenes showing an intense far&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared absorption. The large dissymmetry factor of |gabs| = 0.12 was achieved at &#955; = 820 nm for circular dichroism in benzonitrile. This is, in general, unachievable by other small chiral organic molecules, demonstrating the potential usage of open&#8208;[60]fullerenes as novel types of chiral chromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated Electron&#8208;Rich Ruthenium Atoms in Intermetallic Compounds for Boosting Electrochemical Nitric Oxide Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct electrochemical nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) is an attractive technique for converting NO into NH3 with low power consumption under ambient conditions. Optimizing the electronic structure of the active sites can greatly improve the performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, we prepare body&#8208;centered cubic RuGa intermetallic compounds (i.e., bcc RuGa IMCs) via a substrate&#8208;anchored thermal annealing method.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The direct electrochemical nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) is an attractive technique for converting NO into NH3 with low power consumption under ambient conditions. Optimizing the electronic structure of the active sites can greatly improve the performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, we prepare body-centered cubic RuGa intermetallic compounds (i.e., bcc RuGa IMCs) via a substrate-anchored thermal annealing method. The electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable NH4+ yield rate of 320.6 &#956;mol h-1 mg-1Ru with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 72.3% at very low potential of -0.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in neutral media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electron-rich Ru atoms in bcc RuGa IMCs facilitate the adsorption and activation of *HNO intermediate. Hence, the energy barrier of the potential-determining step in NORR could be greatly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Assisted Coupling Manipulation for Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For emerging perovskite quantum dots (QDs), understanding the surface features and their impact on the materials and devices is becoming increasingly urgent. In this family, hybrid FAPbI3 QDs (FA: formamidium), exhibit advantages like higher ambient stability, near&#8208;infrared absorption and sufficient carrier lifetime. However, hybrid QDs suffer from difficulty in modulating surface ligand, which is essential for constructing conductive QD arrays for photovoltaics. Herein, assisted by an ionic liquid formamidine thiocyanate, we report a facile surface reconfiguration methodology to modulate surface and manipulate electronic coupling of FAPbI3 QDs, which is exploited to enhance charge transport for fabricating high&#8208;quality QD arrays and photovoltaic devices. Finally, a record&#8208;high efficiency approaching 15% is achieved for FAPbI3 QD solar cells, and they retain over 80% of the initial efficiency after aging in ambient environment (20&#8208;30% humidity, 25 oC) for over 600 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8211;Air Batteries: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using light to drive slow cathode kinetics has been explored as a promising solution to unlock the high theoretical specific energy of metal&#8211;air batteries. This Review summarizes the current understanding of light&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries, discusses the significant influence of light on battery systems, and identifies existing gaps and future priorities.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;air batteries are considered one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices owing to their ultrahigh theoretical specific energy. However, sluggish cathode kinetics (O2 and CO2 reduction/evolution) result in large overpotentials and low round&#8208;trip efficiencies which seriously hinder their practical applications. Utilizing light to drive slow cathode processes has increasingly becoming a promising solution to this issue. Considering the rapid development and emerging issues of this field, this Review summarizes the current understanding of light&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries in terms of configurations and mechanisms, provides general design strategies and specific examples of photocathodes, systematically discusses the influence of light on batteries, and finally identifies existing gaps and future priorities for the development of practical light&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Deaminative Amino&#8208; and Alkoxycarbonylation of Aryl Trialkylammonium Salts Promoted by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation of aniline&#8208;derived trialkylammonium salts promoted by visible light via a challenging C(sp2)&#8722;N cleavage. The reaction is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization and is amenable to telescoped carbonylations directly from anilines. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations support a novel mechanism involving a key visible light&#8208;induced carbonyl photodissociation and SNAr&#8208;type oxidative addition.







Abstract
Catalytic carbonylations of aryl electrophiles via C(sp2)&#8722;N cleavage remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an aminocarbonylation of aniline&#8208;derived trialkylammonium salts promoted by visible light with a simple cobalt catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization and is amenable to telescoped carbonylations directly from anilines. A range of alkylamines are successful partners, and alkoxycarbonylation is also demonstrated. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations support a novel mechanism for catalytic carbonylations of aryl electrophiles involving a key visible light&#8208;induced carbonyl photodissociation.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Homologation of Carbonyl Compounds for Iterative Syntheses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced B&#252;chner&#8208;Curtius&#8208;Schlotterbeck type reaction for carbonyl homologation is described. The protocol allows the use of carbonyl compounds as safe and readily available diazo precursors through direct photoexcitation of corresponding N&#8208;tosylhydrazone anion. Functionalized aliphatic aldehydes and ketones are prepared in a practical and iterative manner.







Abstract
We describe a photo&#8208;induced reaction for the in situ generation of highly reactive alkyl diazo species from carbonyl precursors via photo&#8208;excitation of N&#8208;tosylhydrazone anions. The diazo intermediates undergo efficient C&#8722;H insertion of aldehydes, leading to the productive synthesis of aldehydes and ketones. The method is applicable to the iterative synthesis of densely functionalized carbonyl compounds through sequential trapping of the diazo species with various aldehydes. The reaction proceeds without the need of any catalyst by light irradiation and features high functional group tolerance. More than 70 examples, some performed on a gram&#8208;scale, demonstrate the broad applicability of this reaction sequence in synthesis.

         <title>NaCdSb: An Orthorhombic Zintl Phase with Exceptional Intrinsic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;performance Zintl phase thermoelectric material NaCdSb has a peak figure of merit zT=1.3 at 673&#8197;K without any doping optimization or structural modification. This compound exhibits intrinsic semiconductor behavior, and the hole concentration approaches optimal as the temperature rises, leading to high power factors. The ultralow thermal conductivity is achieved through the structural anharmonicity of Cd&#8722;Sb bonds.







Abstract
Many Zintl phases are promising thermoelectric materials owning to their features like narrow band gaps, multiband behaviors, ideal charge transport tunnels, and loosely bound cations. Herein we show a new Zintl phase NaCdSb with exceptional intrinsic thermoelectric performance. Pristine NaCdSb exhibits semiconductor behaviors with an experimental hole concentration of 2.9&#215;1018&#8197;cm&#8722;3 and a calculated band gap of 0.5&#8197;eV. As the temperature increases, the hole concentration rises gradually and approaches its optimal one, leading to a high power factor of 11.56&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 673&#8197;K. The ultralow thermal conductivity is derived from the small phonon group velocity and short phonon lifetime, ascribed to the structural anharmonicity of Cd&#8722;Sb bonds. As a consequence, a maximum zT of 1.3 at 673&#8197;K has been achieved without any doping optimization or structural modification, demonstrating that NaCdSb is a remarkable thermoelectric compound with great potential for performance improvement.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Catalytic Mechanism of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatty acid photodecarboxylase converts a carboxylic acid into a hydrocarbon and a carbon dioxide molecule through decarboxylation. Two critical carbonyloxy and alkyl radical intermediates in the catalytic reactions were captured by deep UV detection, and their dynamics were determined with actual reaction timescales, revealing the molecular mechanism of the enzymatic reaction and mapping out the catalytic photocycle of this efficient photoenzyme.







Abstract
Fatty acid photodecarboxylase is a newly discovered flavin photoenzyme that converts a carboxylic acid into a hydrocarbon and a carbon dioxide molecule through decarboxylation. The enzymatic reactions are poorly understood. In this study, we carefully characterized its dynamic evolution with femtosecond spectroscopy. We observed initial electron transfer from the substrate to the flavin cofactor in 347&#8197;ps with a stretched dynamic behavior and subsequently captured the critical carbonyloxy radical. The dominant process following this step was decarboxylation in 5.8&#8197;ns to form an alkyl radical and a carbon dioxide molecule. We further identified the absorption bands of two carbonyloxy and alkyl radical intermediates. The overall enzymatic quantum efficiency determined by our obtained timescales is 0.81, consistent with the steady&#8208;state value. The results are essential to the elucidation of the enzyme mechanism and catalytic photocycle, providing a molecular basis for potential design of flavin&#8208;based artificial photoenzymes.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Controlled Substrate Engineering Strategy for Site&#8208;Specific Enzymatic Fucosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A galactose oxidase&#8208;mediated redox system was coupled with enzymatic modular assembly strategy to control the site&#8208;selectivity of &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation. This redox&#8208;controlled site&#8208;specific fucosylation strategy provides a general and operational simple approach for the precisely enzymatic synthesis of various complex fucosylated oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (oligo&#8208;LacNAc) containing O&#8208; and N&#8208;glycans with defined fucosylation patterns.







Abstract
Fucosylation is one of the most common modifications of oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (oligo&#8208;LacNAc) glycans. However, none of known fucosyltransferases (FucTs) could install the &#945;1,3&#8208;linked fucose to the oligo&#8208;LacNAc substrates in a site&#8208;specific manner. Here, we report a facile and general redox&#8208;controlled substrate engineering strategy for the site&#8208;specific &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation of complex glycans containing multiple LacNAc units. This strategy takes advantage of an operationally simple oxidation enzyme module by using galactose oxidase (GOase) to convert the LacNAc unit into oxidized C6&#8242;&#8208;aldehyde LacNAc sequence, which is not a good substrate for recombinant &#945;1,3&#8208;FucT from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 (Hp&#945;1,3FucT), enabling the site&#8208;specific &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation at intact LacNAc sites. The general applicability and robustness of this strategy were demonstrated by the synthesis of a variety of structurally well&#8208;defined fucosides of linear and branched O&#8208; and N&#8208;linked glycans.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation has been developed. This protocol is characterized by its mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity, thus unlocking a complementary technique to conventional C(sp3)&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions for accessing amine architectures from simple building blocks.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective intermolecular amidation of saturated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is reported. This mild protocol exhibits a predictable reactivity pattern to incorporate amide functions at C(sp3)&#8722;H sites adjacent to nitrogen and oxygen atoms in either cyclic or acyclic frameworks, thus offering a complementary reactivity profile to existing oxidative&#8208;type processes or metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions operating via two&#8208;electron manifolds.

         <title>A Vitamin B2&#8208;Photocatalysed Approach to Methionine Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their emerging role in medicinal and biological chemistry, synthetic methods to access non&#8208;natural methionine analogues remain underdeveloped. Using vitamin B2&#8208;photocatalysis, simple sulfides undergo radical &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization with unsaturated amino acid partners to deliver an array of new methionine derivatives. The approach also facilitates the chemoselective modification of peptide side&#8208;chains.







Abstract
Access to new non&#8208;canonical amino acid residues is crucial for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. Analogues of the amino acid methionine have been far less explored&#8212;despite their use in biochemistry, pharmacology and peptide bioconjugation. This is largely due to limited synthetic access. Herein, we exploit a new disconnection to access non&#8208;natural methionines through the development of a photochemical method for the radical &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfides with alkenes, in water, using inexpensive and commercially&#8208;available riboflavin (vitamin B2) as a photocatalyst. Our photochemical conditions allow the two&#8208;step synthesis of novel methionine analogues&#8212;by radical addition to unsaturated amino acid derivatives&#8212;and the chemoselective modification of peptide side&#8208;chains to yield non&#8208;natural methionine residues within small peptides. The mechanism of the bio&#8208;inspired flavin photocatalysis has been probed by experimental, DFT and TDDFT studies.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] Alkaloids: A Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Spirocyclization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct spirocyclization approach was adopted for the concise chemical synthesis of a class of spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] alkaloids. Stereochemically complementary spirocyclic systems could be generated by manipulation of the spirocyclization pathway to favor the kinetic or thermodynamic product.







Abstract
A direct spirocyclization approach for the chemical synthesis of spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] alkaloids is reported. The absolute stereochemistry was introduced by a desymmetrizing Dieckmann condensation, and the relative stereochemistry was controlled by the manipulation of the kinetic and thermodynamic pathways of the spirocyclization. By contrast to the biogenetic proposal involving the diester&#8208;type alkaloid as the precursor, we demonstrate that chemically a common lactone&#8208;type intermediate could bridge the chemical synthesis of this class of natural products.

         <title>Deciphering Ligand Controlled Structural Evolution of Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Electrochemical Activation during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evolution of the Prussian blue analogue precatalysts has been attained by replacing a &#8722;CN group with strong &#960;&#8208;acidic &#8722;NO. This in turn tunes the electronic and atomic structures and electrochemical properties of the active catalyst and a significant improvement in the alkaline water oxidation activity has been observed.







Abstract
Herein, we have demonstrated the control over the structure of precatalysts to tune the properties of the active catalysts and their water oxidation activity. The reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] and Na2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] with Co(OH)2@CC produced precatalysts PC&#8208;1 and PC&#8208;2, respectively, with distinct structural and electronic features. The replacement of the &#8722;CN group with strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor &#8722;NO modulates the electronic and atomic structure of PC&#8208;2. As a result, a facile electrochemical transformation of PC&#8208;2 into active catalyst Fe&#8722;Co(OH)2&#8208;Co(O)OH (AC&#8208;2) has been attained only in 15&#8197;CV cycles while 600&#8197;CV cycles are required for the electrochemical activation of PC&#8208;1 into AC&#8208;1. The X&#8208;ray absorption studies reveal the contraction of the Co&#8722;O and Fe&#8722;O bond in AC&#8208;2 because of the presence of a higher amount of Co3+ and Fe3+ than in AC&#8208;1. The high valent Co3+ and Fe3+ modulates the electronic properties of AC&#8208;2 and assists in the O&#8722;O bond formation, leading to the improved water oxidation activity.

&lt;p&gt;Structural evolution of the Prussian blue analogue precatalysts has been attained by replacing a &#8722;CN group with strong &#960;-acidic &#8722;NO. This in turn tunes the electronic and atomic structures and electrochemical properties of the active catalyst and a significant improvement in the alkaline water oxidation activity has been observed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we have demonstrated the control over the structure of precatalysts to tune the properties of the active catalysts and their water oxidation activity. The reaction of K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(NO)] with Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@CC produced precatalysts PC-1 and PC-2, respectively, with distinct structural and electronic features. The replacement of the &#8722;CN group with strong &#960;-acceptor &#8722;NO modulates the electronic and atomic structure of PC-2. As a result, a facile electrochemical transformation of PC-2 into active catalyst Fe&#8722;Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Co(O)OH (AC-2) has been attained only in 15&#8197;CV cycles while 600&#8197;CV cycles are required for the electrochemical activation of PC-1 into AC-1. The X-ray absorption studies reveal the contraction of the Co&#8722;O and Fe&#8722;O bond in AC-2 because of the presence of a higher amount of Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; than in AC-1. The high valent Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; modulates the electronic properties of AC-2 and assists in the O&#8722;O bond formation, leading to the improved water oxidation activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;18 Labeling of Difluoromethyl and Trifluoromethyl Groups via Monoselective C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general method for the labeling of both CF3 and CF2H groups using frustrated Lewis pair mediated selective C&#8722;F activation to formally substitute fluorine&#8208;19 with fluorine&#8208;18. The method utilizes the target compound as the starting material simplifying the radiosynthetic protocol for labeling pharmaceuticals and radiotracers that already contain CF3 or CF2H groups.







Abstract
We report a general method for the labeling of both CF3 and CF2H groups in a broad range of chemical settings (aryl, oxide, sulfide). The method utilizes frustrated Lewis pair mediated selective C&#8722;F activation to formally substitute fluorine&#8208;19 with fluorine&#8208;18 in a two&#8208;step defluorination/radiofluorination process, and as such can utilize the target compounds as starting materials. The radiotracer precursors can be isolated as stable salts prior to radiofluorination. The method delivers good radiochemical yields and molar activities (up to 35.2&#177;6.5&#8201;% non&#8208;decay corrected isolated activity yields and 12.0&#177;1.7&#8197;GBq&#8201;&#956;mol&#8722;1 molar activities) and is shown to be applicable to biologically relevant compounds. The ability to utilize the target compound as the starting material and the synthetic simplicity of the method coupled with the ever&#8208;increasing use of CF3 and CF2H groups in pharmaceuticals makes this method attractive for drug and radiotracer development.

         <title>Progress in Hydrogen Production Coupled with Electrochemical Oxidation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reactions of small molecules are widely implemented to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to achieve the highly efficient production of hydrogen. This Minireview systematically surveys the current progress in electro&#8208;oxidation reactions involving diverse molecules, different electrolytes, and novel mechanisms. The challenges and research directions of this area are highlighted.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxidation of small molecules to generate value&#8208;added products has gained enormous interest in recent years because of the advantages of benign operation conditions, high conversion efficiency and selectivity, the absence of external oxidizing agents, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Coupling the electrochemical oxidation of small molecules to replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode in an electrolyzer would simultaneously realize the generation of high&#8208;value chemicals or pollutant degradation and the highly efficient production of hydrogen. This Minireview presents an introduction on small&#8208;molecule choice and design strategies of electrocatalysts as well as recent breakthroughs achieved in the highly efficient production of hydrogen. Finally, challenges and future orientations are highlighted.

         <title>Wide Band&#8208;Gap Polymer Donors Functionalized with Unconventional Carbamate Side Chains for Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique conformation lock is formed in a polymer donor using an unconventional carbamate side chain. It gives wide band&#8208;gap polymer donors for application in organic solar cells. Devices incorporating these donors yield power conversion efficiencies up to18.76&#8201;%.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering with heteroatoms is not only effective in tuning frontier molecular orbitals, but also possible for forming secondary bonds which can be utilized to planarize the molecular backbone, hence, improving the photon absorption as well as charge&#8208;transport abilities of polymer solar&#8208;cell (PSC) materials. Herein, two types of unconventional side chains, namely carboxylate and carbamate, containing various heteroatoms are introduced to the thiophene bridges in high performance benzodithiophene (BDT) based donor polymers to from the novel polymers PTzTz&#8208;C and PTzTz&#8208;N, respectively. In these polymers, non&#8208;covalent O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S and N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions induce a high tendency to aggregation. In a ternary&#8208;blend PSC with PTzTz&#8208;N added to the high&#8208;performance D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, complimentary absorption and improved thin&#8208;film morphology were observed with a top power conversion efficiency of 18.76&#8201;%, which is an improvement of almost 5&#8201;% over the D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 binary blends.

         <title>Accelerated and Concerted Aza&#8208;Michael Addition and SuFEx Reaction in Microdroplets in Unitary and High&#8208;Throughput Formats</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated, catalyst&#8208;free, coupled Aza&#8208;Michael addition and SuFEx reactions between amines and ethenesulfonyl fluoride under ambient conditions in microdroplets are analyzed by electrosonic spray mass spectrometry (ESSI&#8208;MS) while high&#8208;throughput desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI&#8208;MS) is used to follow reaction scope.







Abstract
The sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction is significant in drug discovery, materials science, and chemical biology. Conventionally, it involves installation of SO2F followed by fluoride exchange by a catalyst. We report catalyst&#8208;free Aza&#8208;Michael addition to install SO2F and then SuFEx reaction with amines, both occurring in concert, in microdroplets under ambient conditions. The microdroplet reaction is accelerated by a factor of &#8764;104 relative to the corresponding bulk reaction. We suggest that the superacidic microdroplet surface assists SuFEx reaction by protonating fluorine to create a good leaving group. The reaction scope was established by performing individual reactions in microdroplets of 18 amines in four solvents and confirmed using high&#8208;throughput desorption electrospray ionization experiments. The study demonstrates the value of microdroplet&#8208;assisted accelerated reactions in combination with high&#8208;throughput experimentation for characterization of reaction scope.

         <title>Evaluation of the Specific Activity of M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs and the Intrinsic Activity of Tetrapyrrolic FeN4 Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein used the equivalence of an active site extraction to the poisoning of active sites to develop a new method for the determination of site density, utilization factor and TOF. The method is reminiscent of stripping techniques but since there are no probe molecules involved it can be applied to different classes of M&#8722;N&#8722;C directly at the relevant pH.







Abstract
M&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalysts are considered pivotal to replace expensive precious group metal&#8208;based materials in electrocatalytic conversions. However, their development is hampered by the limited availability of methods for the evaluation of the intrinsic activity of different active sites, like pyrrolic FeN4 sites within Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs. Currently, new synthetic procedures based on active&#8208;site imprinting followed by an ion exchange reaction, e.g. Zn&#8208;to&#8208;Fe, are producing single&#8208;site M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs with outstanding activity. Based on the same replacement principle, we employed a conservative iron extraction to partially remove the Fe ions from the N4 cavities in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs. Having catalysts with the same morphological properties and Fe ligation that differ solely in Fe content allows for the facile determination of the decrease in density of active sites and their turn&#8208;over frequency. In this way, insight into the specific activity of M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs is obtained and for single&#8208;site catalysts the intrinsic activity of the site is accessible.

     alt="Evaluation of the Specific Activity of M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs and the Intrinsic Activity of Tetrapyrrolic FeN4 Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We herein used the equivalence of an active site extraction to the poisoning of active sites to develop a new method for the determination of site density, utilization factor and TOF. The method is reminiscent of stripping techniques but since there are no probe molecules involved it can be applied to different classes of M&#8722;N&#8722;C directly at the relevant pH.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalysts are considered pivotal to replace expensive precious group metal-based materials in electrocatalytic conversions. However, their development is hampered by the limited availability of methods for the evaluation of the intrinsic activity of different active sites, like pyrrolic FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites within Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs. Currently, new synthetic procedures based on active-site imprinting followed by an ion exchange reaction, e.g. Zn-to-Fe, are producing single-site M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs with outstanding activity. Based on the same replacement principle, we employed a conservative iron extraction to partially remove the Fe ions from the N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cavities in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs. Having catalysts with the same morphological properties and Fe ligation that differ solely in Fe content allows for the facile determination of the decrease in density of active sites and their turn-over frequency. In this way, insight into the specific activity of M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs is obtained and for single-site catalysts the intrinsic activity of the site is accessible. This new approach surpasses limitations of methods that rely on probe molecules and, together with those techniques, offers a novel tool to unfold the complexity of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst and M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs in general.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Redistribution between Hydrosilanes and Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed silane cross&#8208;redistribution reaction was developed for the synthesis of bis&#8208;silanes. The reaction is driven by enthalpy but not entropy, and the reaction is atom economical, without formation of gaseous silane side product. The reaction has broad substrate scope. This combined computational and experimental study shows that the reaction proceeds through a Ni0&#8208;NiII&#8208;NiIV catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Silanes are important in chemistry and material science. The self&#8208;redistribution of HSiCl3 is an industrial process to prepare SiH4, which is widely used in electronics and automobile industries. However, selective silane cross&#8208;redistribution to prepare advanced silanes is challenging. We now report an enthalpy&#8208;driven silane cross&#8208;redistribution to access bis&#8208;silanes that contain two different types of Si&#8722;H bonds in the same molecule. Compared with entropy&#8208;driven reactions, the enthalpy&#8208;driven reaction shows high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope (62 examples) and high atom economy. Our combined experimental and computational study indicates that the reaction proceeds through a Ni0&#8208;NiII&#8208;NiIV catalytic cycle.

         <title>Native Top&#8208;Down Mass Spectrometry Reveals a Role for Interfacial Glycans on Therapeutic Cytokine and Hormone Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native top&#8208;down mass spectrometry (MS) reveals subunit composition and glycan heterogeneity of therapeutic glycoprotein assemblies. By comparing the measured oligomer proteoforms with theoretical models, reconstituted from the dissociated subunits, we show that the interfacial glycan influences complex stability.







Abstract
Oligomerization and glycosylation modulate therapeutic glycoprotein stability and efficacy. The interplay between these two critical attributes on therapeutic glycoproteins, is however often hard to define. Here, we present a native top&#8208;down mass spectrometry (MS) approach to assess the glycosylation status of therapeutic cytokine and hormone assemblies and relate interfacial glycan occupancy to complex stability. We found that interfacial O&#8208;glycan stabilizes tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; trimer. On the contrary, interferon&#8208;&#946;1a dimerization is independent of glycosylation. Moreover, we discovered a unique distribution of N&#8208;glycans on the follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone &#945; subunit. We found that the interfacial N&#8208;glycan, at Asn52 of the &#945; subunit, interacts extensively with the &#946; subunit to regulate the dimer assembly. Overall, we have exemplified a method to link glycosylation with assembly status, for cytokines and hormones, critical for informing optimal stability and bioavailability.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immersion of porous phenolic pillar[5]arene crystals in liquid lactones induced ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;valerolactone and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone at room temperature. This is due to catalytic activity of the phenols via the hydrogen bonds and capture of linear polyesters by pillar[5]arene crystals. After the reaction, pillar[5]arene and polyesters formed pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxanes.







Abstract
Confined space provides a reaction platform with altered reaction rate and selectivity compared with a homogeneous solution. In this work, porous phenolic pillar[5]arene crystals were used as a reaction space to promote and perturb equilibrium between lactones and their corresponding polyesters. Immersion of porous pillar[5]arene crystals in liquid lactones induced ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;valerolactone and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone at room temperature because the phenolic hydroxy groups have catalytic activity via hydrogen bonds and the pillar[5]arene cavities prefer linear guests. After the reaction, pillar[5]arene and polyesters formed pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxanes.

         <title>Programmed Iteration Controls the Assembly of the Nonanoic Acid Side Chain of the Antibiotic Mupirocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic in which the polyketide fragment, monic acid, is esterified to a 9&#8208;hydroxynonanoic acid (9HN) side chain, which is essential for biological activity. NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chemical probes and in vitro assays were used to establish how 9HN is assembled through the action of multiple acyl carrier proteins, two ketosynthases and fatty acid &#946;&#8208;keto processing enzymes.







Abstract
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 that is assembled by a complex trans&#8208;AT polyketide synthase. The polyketide fragment, monic acid, is esterified by a 9&#8208;hydroxynonanoic acid (9HN) side chain which is essential for biological activity. The ester side chain assembly is initialised from a 3&#8208;hydroxypropionate (3HP) starter unit attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) MacpD, but the fate of this species is unknown. Herein we report the application of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chemical probes and in vitro assays to establish the remaining steps of 9HN biosynthesis. These investigations reveal a complex interplay between a novel iterative or &#8220;stuttering&#8221; KS&#8208;AT didomain (MmpF), the multidomain module MmpB and multiple ACPs. This work has important implications for understanding the late&#8208;stage biosynthetic steps of mupirocin and will be important for future engineering of related trans&#8208;AT biosynthetic pathways (e.g. thiomarinol).

         <title>Interfacial Designing of MnO2 Half&#8208;Wrapped by Aromatic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid cathode of carbon&#8208;based poly(4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO2 (denoted as C@PODA/MnO2) is fabricated via two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Benefiting from the unique bonding interface of PODA/MnO2 and dual&#8208;energy storage mechanism of Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion, C@PODA/MnO2 cathode exhibits high capacity, superior rate capability, and excellent cycling stability for aqueous Zn batteries.







Abstract
Due to the excellent specific capacity and high working voltage, manganese oxide (MnO2) has attracted considerable attention for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the irreversible structural collapse and sluggish ionic diffusion lead to poor rate capability and inferior lifespan. Herein, we proposed a novel organic/inorganic hybrid cathode of carbon&#8208;based poly(4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO2 (denoted as C@PODA/MnO2) for AZIBs. Various in/ex situ analyses and theoretical calculations prove that PODA chains with C=N groups can provide a more active surface/interface for ion/electron mobility and zinc ion storage in the hybrid cathode.

&lt;p&gt;A novel hybrid cathode of carbon-based poly(4,4&#8242;-oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (denoted as C@PODA/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is fabricated via two-step electrodeposition method. Benefiting from the unique bonding interface of PODA/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and dual-energy storage mechanism of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; co-insertion, C@PODA/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode exhibits high capacity, superior rate capability, and excellent cycling stability for aqueous Zn batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the excellent specific capacity and high working voltage, manganese oxide (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has attracted considerable attention for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the irreversible structural collapse and sluggish ionic diffusion lead to poor rate capability and inferior lifespan. Herein, we proposed a novel organic/inorganic hybrid cathode of carbon-based poly(4,4&#8242;-oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (denoted as C@PODA/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for AZIBs. Various in/ex situ analyses and theoretical calculations prove that PODA chains with C=N groups can provide a more active surface/interface for ion/electron mobility and zinc ion storage in the hybrid cathode. More importantly, newly formed Mn&#8722;N interfacial bonds can effectively promote ion diffusion and prevent Mn atoms dissolution, enhancing redox kinetics and structural integrity of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Accordingly, C@PODA/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode exhibits high capacity (321&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; or 1.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), superior rate performance (88&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and excellent cycling stability over 2000&#8197;cycles. Hence, rational interfacial designs shed light on the development of organic/inorganic cathodes for advanced AZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>o&#8208;Quinodimethane Atropisomers: Enantioselective Synthesis and Stereospecific Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric o&#8208;quinodimethanes and their viability for highly stereoselective transformations are described. o&#8208;Quinodimethane precursors were readily accessible by an intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triyne substrates and the in situ generated o&#8208;quinodimethane atropisomers were converted in highly stereospecific Diels&#8211;Alder reactions at elevated temperature with up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 e.r.







Abstract
o&#8208;Quinodimethanes have remarkable utility as reactive intermediates in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, enabling significantly accelerated routes to complex polycyclic compounds. The discovery of different discrete precursors to thermally generate o&#8208;quinodimethanes thereby greatly augmented their availability and versatility. However, due to the required high temperatures and the immense reactivity of o&#8208;quinodimethanes, stereoselectivity to afford isomerically defined products still constitutes a critical challenge. Herein, we describe the accessibility of atropisomeric o&#8208;quinodimethanes, the enantioselective synthesis of their precursors, their remarkable configurational stability and the stereospecific transformation by the benzannulation of dienophiles. A catalyst&#8208;stereocontrolled [2+2+2] cycloaddition, the generation of o&#8208;quinodimethane atropisomers and ensuing stereospecific Diels&#8211;Alder reactions enabled enantioselectivities through these transient intermediates with of up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 e.r.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonylative Cyclization of Alkenes with Alkyl Bromides via Radical Cascade Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have described a new copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylative cyclization of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;butenes with unactivated alkyl bromides. In this reaction, two carbonyl groups were introduced into the double bond by the insertion of two molecules of carbon monoxide, and four new C&#8722;C bonds could be constructed in one reaction. At the same time, the corresponding skeletons of &#945;&#8208;tetralones as well as 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;one were obtained smoothly, which could also be transformed into three consecutive ring structures via subsequent derivatizations.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a new procedure on 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylative cyclization of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;butenes with alkyl bromides. Using simple copper catalyst, two molecules of carbon monoxide were introduced into the double bond with the formation of four new C&#8722;C bonds and a new ring. Various &#945;&#8208;tetralones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones were formed in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Halosulfonylation of Strain&#8208;Release Reagents
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot halosulfonylation of strained hydrocarbons is described that proceeds under practical, scalable and mild conditions. Sulfonyl halides featuring aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl substituents are generated in situ from sulfinate salts and convenient halogen atom sources. This chemistry enables the synthesis of an array of halogen/sulfonyl&#8208;substituted bioisosteres and cyclobutanes, on up to multidecagram scale. Hal=Halogen.







Abstract
Sulfonylated aromatics are commonplace motifs in drugs and agrochemicals. However, methods for the direct synthesis of sulfonylated non&#8208;classical arene bioisosteres, which could improve the physicochemical properties of drug and agrochemical candidates, are limited. Here we report a solution to this challenge: a one&#8208;pot halosulfonylation of [1.1.1]propellane, [3.1.1]propellane and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes that proceeds under practical, scalable and mild conditions. The sulfonyl halides used in this chemistry feature aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl substituents, and are conveniently generated in situ from readily available sulfinate salts and halogen atom sources. This methodology enables the synthesis of an array of pharmaceutically and agrochemically relevant halogen/sulfonyl&#8208;substituted bioisosteres and cyclobutanes, on up to multidecagram scale.

         <title>Light, Heat and Electricity Integrated Energy Conversion System: Photothermal&#8208;Assisted Co&#8208;Electrolysis of CO2 and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of bifunctional viologen&#8208;containing covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal&#8208;assisted co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and methanol. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF that enhance the photothermal effect to accelerate faster charge&#8208;transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products.







Abstract
Strategy that can design powerful photothermal&#8208;catalysts to achieve photothermal&#8208;effect assisted coupling&#8208;catalysis is much desired for the improvement of energy conversion efficiency and redox product value in CO2 electroreduction system. Herein, a kind of bifunctional viologen&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF) has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal&#8208;assisted co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and methanol. Specifically, the FECO (cathode) and FEHCOOH (anode) for Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF can reach up to &#8776;100&#8201;% at 1.9&#8197;V with &#8776;31.5&#8201;% saved overall electricity&#8208;consumption when the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is replaced by methanol oxidation. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF that enhance the photothermal effect (&#916;T=49.1&#8201;&#176;C) to accelerate faster charge transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products as revealed by DFT calculations and characterizations.

         <title>Intrinsic Phase Stability and Inherent Bandgap of Formamidinium Lead Triiodide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (GBL) solvents inside the void of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 single crystal promote the phase transtion at kitenics (2). By adopting the 2&#8208;methoxyethanol (2&#8208;ME) as solvent, highly stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystals could be accquried due to slow solid to solid phase transition (1). The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with crystal size above 100&#8197;&#956;m owns inherent 1.41&#8197;eV band gap.







Abstract
Understanding the intrinsic phase stability and inherent band gap of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is crucial to further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we explored the &#945;&#8208; to &#948;&#8208;phase transition and band gap of FAPbI3 single crystals grown by an inverse temperature solubility method. We found that the residual &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone solvents in the inner empty space of the FAPbI3 single crystal accelerate the phase transition at kinetics. By adopting 2&#8208;methoxyethanol as the solvent, over 2000&#8197;h of stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystals could be acquired. This proves that although FAPbI3 is regarded as unstable at thermodynamics, it could own excellent kinetic stability without any doping or additives because of the slow solid to solid phase transition instead of the fast phase transition assisted by the solvents. Furthermore, we revealed that the bulk FAPbI3 single crystal with a size above 100&#8197;&#956;m can have an inherent band gap of 1.41&#8197;eV. Thus, our work provides key scientific guidance for high&#8208;performance FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Spatially Directed Biosynthesis of Quantum Dots via Spidroin Templating in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented herein is a novel strategy for spatially confined biosynthesis of quantum dots in bacterium by using biomolecular condensates formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of recombinant spider silk protein. This provides a previously unprecedented access to compartmentalized nanostructure synthesis within living cells with great potential for in situ applications.







Abstract
Spatially directed synthesis of quantum dots (QDs) is intriguing yet challenging in organisms, due to the dispersed feature of templating biomolecules and precursors. Whether this task could be accomplished by biomolecular condensates, an emerging type of membraneless compartments in cells remains unknown. Here we report synthetic protein condensates for templated synthesis of QDs in bacterium Escherichia coli. This was realized by overexpression of spider silk protein to bind precursor ions and recruit other necessary components, which induced the spidroin to form more &#946;&#8208;sheet structures for assembly and maturation of the protein condensates. This in turn enabled formation and co&#8208;localization of the fluorescent QDs to &#8220;light up&#8221; the condensates, and alleviated cytotoxicity of the precursor heavy metal ions and resulting QDs. Thus, our results suggest a new strategy for nanostructure synthesis and deposition in subcellular compartments with great potential for in situ applications.

         <title>Photoexcited Enzymes for Asymmetric Csp3&#8722;Csp3 Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis offers exciting opportunities to induce new reactivities and to create novel enzymes for reactions other than their native ones. Recently, Hyster and co&#8208;workers demonstrated this for a photoenzymatic asymmetric Csp3&#8722;Csp3 cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, a reactivity previously unknown to enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymes have several advantages over conventional catalysts for organic synthesis. Over the last two decades, much effort has been made to further extend the scope of biocatalytic reactions available to synthetic chemists, particularly by expanding the repertoire of enzymes for abiological transformations. In this regard, exciting new developments in the area of photobiocatalysis enable now the introduction of non&#8208;natural reactivity in enzymes to solve long&#8208;standing synthetic challenges. A recently described example from the Hyster group demonstrates in an unprecedented way how the combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis empowers the catalytic asymmetric construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds with high chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

         <title>A Sensitive and Nonoptical CRISPR Detection Mechanism by Sizing Double&#8208;Stranded &#955; DNA Reporter</title>

A DNA sizing&#8208;based biosensor utilizing the trans cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a against &#955; DNA is reported. The concept of target concentration dependent size reduction of &#955; DNA unlocks the possibility of using a variety of double&#8208;stranded DNA as nonoptical CRISPR reporters for developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care and easy&#8208;to&#8208;read nucleic acid detection biosensors.







Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;based biosensors often rely on colorimetric, fluorescent, or electrochemical signaling mechanism, which involves expensive reporters and/or sophisticated equipment. Here, we demonstrated a simple, inexpensive, nonoptical, and sensitive CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based sensing platform to detect ssDNA targets by sizing double&#8208;stranded &#955; DNA as novel report molecules. In this platform, the size reduction of &#955; DNA was quantified by gel electrophoresis analysis. We hypothesize that the massive trans&#8208;nuclease activity of Cas12a toward &#955; DNA is due to the presence of single&#8208;stranded looped structures along the &#955; DNA sequence. In addition, we observed a strong binding affinity between Cas12a and &#955; DNA, which further promotes the trans&#8208;cleavage activity and helps achieve sub&#8208;picomolar detection sensitivity, &#8776;100&#8197;times more sensitive than the fluorescent counterpart. The concept of utilizing the physical size change of &#955; DNA unlocks the possibility of using a variety of dsDNA as CRISPR reporters.

         <title>Low&#8208;Toxicity ZnSe/ZnS Quantum Dots as Potent Photoreductants and Triplet Sensitizers for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots, surface&#8208;functionalized with electron or triplet&#8208;energy relay molecules, function as potent photosensitizers to address challenging organic transformations.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) can photocatalyze diverse organic reactions. However, reported QD&#8208;photocatalysts often contain highly&#8208;toxic elements Cd or Pb, and have not surpassed prototypical transition&#8208;metal complexes in terms of their photoredox power or excited&#8208;state energy. Here we report low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe/ZnS core/shell QDs as potent visible photocatalysts to drive challenging organic transformations. To overcome the limitation of short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the QDs, we functionalize their surfaces with benzophenone ligands which can rapidly extract electrons from photoexcited QDs and sustain long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states. The benzophenone anions function as potent electron relay to drive dehalogenation of aryl chlorides and additive&#8208;free polymerization of acrylates. Alternatively, the QDs are functionalized with biphenyl ligands to store energy in long&#8208;lived, energetic triplets, enabling [2+2] homo&#8208;cycloaddition of styrene and cycloaddition of carbonyls with alkenes.

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction through Spontaneous Charge Separation in End&#8208;Capping Assembly of Heterostructured Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient end&#8208;capping strategy is developed to construct intramolecular heterostructures by incorporating polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to the photoinduced spontaneous charge separation between COFs and PAHs, the heterostructured COFs exhibit outstanding activity and selectivity for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
It is well known that charge separation is crucial for efficient photocatalytic solar conversion. Although some covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit visible&#8208;light harvest, the large exciton binding energies reduce their photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we developed a novel method to post&#8208;treat the olefin&#8208;linked COFs with end&#8208;capping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for spontaneous charge separation. Interestingly, a type&#8208;II heterostructure is constructed in our perylene&#8208;modified COFs which displays drastically enhanced performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with an efficiency of 8&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified COF. A combination of electrochemical, steady&#8208;state, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic measurements indicates that such drastically enhanced performance should be attributed to photoinduced spontaneous charge separation in the heterostructure. These results illustrate the feasibility of engineering the charge&#8208;separation properties of crystalline porous frameworks at a molecular level for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Construction of Catalytic Covalent Organic Frameworks with Redox&#8208;Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with bifunctional roles in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been prepared by integrating redox&#8208;active sites into the cobalt&#8208;porphyrin frameworks. The COFs have high electrochemical surface areas and electron transfer abilities, and have good catalytic activities in oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Construction of catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. In this work, we have first constructed bifunctional COFs towards ORR and OER by integrating diarylamine derivatives into the Co&#8208;porphyrin based frameworks. Both of the new COFs (CoTAPP&#8208;PATA&#8208;COF and CoTAPP&#8208;BDTA&#8208;COF) have good ordered structures, high surface areas, and robust chemical stability. The diarylamine units, as a typical electron donor and redox&#8208;active cores, promote intramolecular electron transport along the frameworks and improve the electrochemically active surface areas. Thus, the COFs showed higher catalytic activities than that of the COF without redox&#8208;active units. CoTAPP&#8208;PATA&#8208;COF had a halfwave potential of 0.80&#8197;V towards ORR, and delieved an overpotential of 420&#8197;mV for OER in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. The theoretical calculation revealed introducing diarylamine unites improved the oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>Efficient Removal of Perfluorinated Chemicals from Contaminated Water Sources Using Magnetic Fluorinated Polymer Sorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic polymer sorbents (polymer@IONPs) were prepared for rapid, selective and efficient removal of multiple per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from real contaminated waters at environmentally relevant concentrations. Fast magnetic recovery of the sorbent within 30&#8197;s was achieved. Regeneration of the sorbent for repeated use was demonstrated over four cycles. The technology is promising for large&#8208;scale implementation of PFAS capture.







Abstract
Efficient removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from contaminated waters is urgently needed to safeguard public and environmental health. In this work, novel magnetic fluorinated polymer sorbents were designed to allow efficient capture of PFAS and fast magnetic recovery of the sorbed material. The new sorbent has superior PFAS removal efficiency compared with the commercially available activated carbon and ion&#8208;exchange resins. The removal of the ammonium salt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) reaches &gt;99&#8201;% within 30&#8197;s, and the estimated sorption capacity was 219&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the Langmuir model. Robust and efficient regeneration of the magnetic polymer sorbent was confirmed by the repeated sorption and desorption of GenX over four cycles. The sorption of multiple PFAS in two real contaminated water matrices at an environmentally relevant concentration (1&#8197;ppb) shows &gt;95&#8201;% removal for the majority of PFAS tested in this study.

Abstract
It remains challenging to control the single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence of metal nanoclusters. In this work, the control over the non&#8208;linear optics of metal nanoclusters as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence has been accomplished via exploiting the solvent effect. An emissive nanocluster, Au9Ag6(SPhtOMe)4(DPPOE)3Cl3, was synthesized and structurally determined. The solvent effect can not only control the fluorescence of this nanocluster, but more significantly, it can also regulate the photoluminescence nature of the cluster as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. We concluded that the increased solution polarity, improved dipole moment, enlarged HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, and reduced solution viscosity of the cluster in solutions endow them with excellent high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence. The results provide an intriguing cluster template that enables us to manipulate the linear and nonlinear optics at the atomic level.

         <title>Discerning the Contributions of Gold Species in Butadiene Hydrogenation: From Single Atoms to Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was developed to unveil the activity contributions of distinct gold species in butadiene hydrogenation. The strategy combines nanostructuring of single&#8208;atom gold catalysts, electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based automatic image analyses of the full metal ensembles, and steady&#8208;state and kinetic studies.







Abstract
Identification of the roles of different active sites is vital for the rational design of catalysts. We present a cutting&#8208;edge strategy to discern the contributions of different single&#8208;atom gold species and nanoparticles in 1,3&#8208;butadiene hydrogenation, through coupling of advanced spectroscopic techniques, electron microscopy&#8208;based automated image analyses, and steady&#8208;state and kinetic studies. While all the carbon&#8208;hosted single gold atoms display negligible initial activity, the in situ&#8208;evolved gold nanoparticles are highly active. Full metal&#8208;species quantification is realized by combining electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based atom recognition statistics and deep&#8208;learning&#8208;driven nanoparticle segmentation algorithm, allowing the structure&#8211;activity correlations for the hybrid catalysts containing different Au architectures to be established. Surface exposure density of Au nanoparticles, as revealed by electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based statistics, is revealed as a new and reliable activity descriptor.

         <title>Isotropic Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity Cooperated with Installed Imidazolium Molecular Motions in a 3D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Phosphate Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystalline 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 salt of imidazole and phosphoric acid exhibits isotropic anhydrous superprotonic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is observed for the first time in organic molecular crystals. Significant 3D molecular motion of imidazolium cations was revealed to accelerate proton conduction via the 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded phosphate network by the depolarization effect.







Abstract
Utilizing molecular motion is essential for the use of anhydrous superprotonic molecular proton conductors (&#963; beyond 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) as electrolytes in hydrogen fuel cells. However, molecular motion contributing to the improvement of intrinsic proton conduction has been limited and little clarified in relation to the proton conduction mechanism, limiting the development of material design guidelines. Here, a salt with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) phosphate network with imidazolium cations installed inside was studied, whose components are known to exhibit molecular motions that contribute to proton conduction. Despite its anisotropic H&#8208;bonded network, the salt exhibits isotropic anhydrous superprotonic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8776;351&#8197;K, which is the first example for organic molecular crystal. Variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray structural analysis and solid&#8208;state 2H&#8197;NMR measurements revealed significant 3D molecular motion of imidazolium cations, which accelerate proton conduction via the 3D H&#8208;bonded phosphate network.

         <title>A Photoinduced, Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction for the Stereoselective Assembly of C&#8208;Linked Glycosides and Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C  &#8208;Alkyl glycosides and glycoproteins exist in natural products, and are prized for their role as carbohydrate mimics in drug design. However, a practical strategy that merges glycosyl donors with readily accessible reagents, derived from abundant carboxylic acid and amine feedstocks, is yet to be conceived. Here, we show that a nickel catalyst promotes C&#8208;C coupling between glycosyl halides and aliphatic acids or primary amines (converted to redox&#8208;active electrophiles in one step), in the presence of Hantzsch ester and LiI (or Et  3  N) under blue LED illumination to deliver  C  &#8208;alkyl glycosides in high diastereoselectivities. Mechanistic studies support the photoinduced formation of alkyl radicals that react with an  in situ  &#8208;generated glycosyl&#8208;nickel species to facilitate cross&#8208;coupling. Through this manifold, innate CO  2  H and NH  2  motifs embedded within amino acids and oligopeptides are selectively capped and functionalized to afford glycopeptide conjugates via late&#8208;stage glycosylation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Discrepant Reactive Intermediates on Ru&#8208;Ru2P Heterostructure for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline media is essential for the commercialization of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC). However, the kinetics of HOR in alkaline media is complicated, resulting in orders of magnitude slower than that in acid, even for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C. Here,&#160;we find that Ru&#8208;Ru2P/C&#160;heterostructure shows HOR performance with a non&#8208;monotonous variation in a whole pH region. Unexpectedly, an inflection point located at pH~7 is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that&#160;HOR activity under alkaline media surpasses acidic media. Combining experimental results and theoretical calculations,&#160;we&#160;propose the roles of discrepant reactive intermediates for pH&#8208;universal HOR, while H* and H2O* adsorption strengths are&#160;responsible for acidic HOR, and OH* adsorption strength is essential for alkaline HOR. This work not only sheds light on fundamentally understanding the mechanism of HOR but also provides new designing principles for pH&#8208;targeted electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Negligible ion migration in Tin&#8208;based and Tin&#8208;doped perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion migration is a notorious phenomena observed in ionic perovskite materials. It causes several severe issues in perovskite optoelectronic devices such as instability, current hysteresis, and phase segregation. Here, we report that, in contrast to lead halide perovskites (LHPs), no ion migration or phase segregation was observed in tin halide perovskites (THPs) under illumination or an electric field. The origin is attributed to a much stronger Sn&#8208;halide bond and higher ion migration activation energy (Ea) in THPs, which remain nearly constant under illumination. We further figured out the threshold Ea for the absence of ion migration to be around 0.65 eV using the CsSnyPb1&#8208;y(I0.6Br0.4)3&#160;system whose Ea varies with Sn ratios. Our work shows that ion migration does not necessarily exist in all perovskites and suggests metallic doping to be a promising way of stopping ion migration and improving the intrinsic stability of perovskites.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal ions play critical roles in facilitating peptide folding and inducing conformational transitions, thereby impacting on the biological activity of many proteins. However, the effect of metal sites on the hierarchical structures of biopolymers is still poorly understood. Herein, inspired by metalloproteins, we report an order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational regulation in synthetic polymers mediated by a variety of metal ions. The copolymers are decorated with clinically available desferrioxamine (DFO) as an exogenous ligand template, which presents a geometric constraint toward peptide backbone via short&#8208;range hydrogen bonding interactions, thus dramatically altering the secondary conformations and self&#8208;assembly behaviors of polypeptides and allowing for a controllable &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix transition modulated by metal&#8208;ligand interactions. These metallopolymers could form ferritin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structures with high stability and membrane activity for efficient brain delivery across the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and long&#8208;lasting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Communication and Cross&#8208;Regulation between Chemically Fueled Sender and Receiver Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature connects multiple fuel&#8208;driven chemical/enzymatic reaction networks (CRNs/ERNs) via cross&#8208;regulation to hierarchically control biofunctions for a tailored adaption in complex sensory landscapes. Herein, we introduce a facile example of communication and cross&#8208;regulation among two fuel&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based ERNs regulated by a concatenated RNA transcription regulator. ERN1 (&#8220;sender&#8221;) is designed for the fuel&#8208;driven promoter formation for T7 RNA polymerase, which activates RNA transcription. The produced RNA can deactivate or activate DNA in ERN2 (&#8220;receiver&#8221;) by toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, leading to a communication between two ERNs. The RNA from ERN1 can repress or promote the fuel&#8208;driven state of ERN2; ERN2 in turn feedbacks to regulate the lifetime of ERN1. Furthermore, the incorporation of RNase H allows for RNA degradation and enables the autonomous recovery of ERN2. We believe that concatenation of multiple CRNs/ERNs provides a basis for the design of more elaborate autonomous regulatory mechanisms in systems chemistry and synthetic biology.</dc:description>

         <title>An antitumor dual&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest supramolecular polymer based on hypoxia&#8208;cleavable azocalix[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploitation of specific guests which can respond to external stimuli is the main approach for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) based on host&#8208;guest interactions. Most functional guests, however, fail to manifest stimuli&#8208;responses. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;responsive dimeric azocalixarene (D&#8208;SAC4A) with outstanding hosting properties was used as the macrocyclic building block for the preparation of host stimuli&#8208;responsive SPs. Since azocalixarenes can also be compatible with stimuli&#8208;responsive guests, an antitumor drug, camptothecin (CPT), was chosen and linked via a disulfide&#8208;containing linker to afford a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive ditropic guest (D&#8208;CPT). A unique dual&#8208;responsive SP was obtained by 1:1 mixing of D&#8208;SAC4A and D&#8208;CPT in water, which further assembled into SP nanoparticles (DSPNs). DSPNs displayed outstanding stability against dilution and biological interferants, as well as precise CPT&#8208;release under GSH and hypoxia conditions. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the good biosafety and tumor&#8208;suppressive effects of DSPNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Integration of Organic Core/Shell Microwires for Advanced Photonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of multiple components or structures into integrated micro/nanostructures for practical application has been pursued for many years. Herein, a series of hierarchical organic microwires with branch, core/shell (C/S), and branch C/S structures are successfully constructed based on organic charge transfer (CT) cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability. By regulating the intermolecular CT interaction, single microwires and branch microstructures can be integrated into the C/S and branch C/S structures, respectively. Significantly, the integrated branch C/S microwires, with multicolor waveguide behavior and branch structure multichannel waveguide output characteristics, can function as an optical logic gate with multiple encoding features. This work provides useful insights for creating completely new types of organic microstructures for integrated optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation Using Inter&#8208;Facet Edge Rich WO3 Arrays for Photoelectrochemical Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water oxidation reaction leaves room to be improved in the development of various solar fuel productions in an aqueous solution, because of not only the kinetically sluggish 4&#8208;electron transfer process of oxygen evolution reaction but also the formation of unadded value product, O  2  . In this work, we realize reactive oxygen species (ROS), H  2  O  2  and OH&#8226;, formations by water oxidation with total Faraday efficiencies of more than 90% by using (200)/(002) inter&#8208;facet edge (IFE) rich WO  3  arrays in an electrolyte containing CO  3  2&#8208;  . Theoretical simulation and in&#8208;situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the IFE favors the adsorption of CO  3  2&#8208;  while reducing the adsorption energy of OH&#8226;, as well as suppresses surface hole accumulation to enable a synergetic direct and indirect charge transfer pathways of 1&#8208;electron and 2&#8208;electron transfer processes. Finally, we present selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in in&#8208;situ using the formed OH&#8226;, which delivers a benzaldehyde production rate of ~768 &#181;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  with near 100% selectivity that exceeds the most reported value. This work offers a promising approach to tune or control the oxidation reaction in an aqueous solar fuel system towards high efficiency and value&#8208;added product  .</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Cyclohexadienyl Hydrides as Intermediates in Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Arene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Treatment of phosphino(imino)pyridine (PIP) molybdenum cyclooctadiene (COD) complexes [(PIP)Mo(COD)] with dihydrogen in the presence of benzene selectively furnished the molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydrides [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)], which are precatalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] arises from a rarely observed insertion of benzene into a molybdenum&#8211;hydride bond, a key step in the molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation of arenes. The reaction with toluene afforded a single isomer of the corresponding molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydride while para&#8208;xylene instead predominantly formed the molybdenum &#951;6&#8208;arene complex with the insertion product being a minor component. Addition of carbon monoxide to a cyclohexane&#8208;d12 solution of [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] liberated cyclohexadiene, providing experimental support for a higher kinetic barrier for the subsequent steps en route to cycloalkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable Electroluminescent Elastomers with Self&#8208;Confinement Effect for Highly Efficient Non&#8208;Blended Stretchable OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;flexible stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are emerging as a basic component of flexible electronics and human&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the brightness and efficiency of stretchable OLEDs remain still far inferior to their rigid counterparts, owing to the scarcity of satisfactory stretchable electroluminescent materials. Herein, we explore a general concept based on the self&#8208;confinement effect to dramatically improve the stretchability of elastomers, without affecting electroluminescent properties. The balanced rigid/flexible chain dynamics under self&#8208;confinement significantly reduces the modulus of the elastomers, resulting in the maximum strain reaching 806%. Ultra&#8208;flexible stretchable OLEDs have been constructed based on the resulting ISEEs, achieving unprecedented high&#8208;performance non&#8208;blended stretchable OLEDs. The results suggest an effective molecular design strategy for highly deformable stretchable displays and flexible electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Decarboxylative Protonation Enabled by Cooperative Earth&#8208;Abundant Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative protonation is a general deletion tactic to replace polar carboxylic acid groups with hydrogen or its isotope. Current methods rely on the pre&#8208;activation of acids, non&#8208;sustainable hydrogen sources, and/or expensive/highly oxidizing photocatalysts, presenting challenges to their wide adoption. Here we show that a cooperative iron/thiol catalyst system can readily achieve this transformation, hydrodecarboxylating a wide range of activated and unactivated carboxylic acids and overcoming scope limitations in previous direct methods. The reaction is readily scaled in batch configuration and can be directly performed in deuterated solvent to afford high yields of d&#8208;incorporated products with excellent isotope incorporation efficiency; characteristics not attainable in previous photocatalyzed approaches. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a radical mechanism and kinetic results of unactivated acids (KIE = 1) are consistent with a light&#8208;limited reaction.</dc:description>

Here we show that a cooperative iron/thiol catalyst system can readily achieve this transformation, hydrodecarboxylating a wide range of activated and unactivated carboxylic acids and overcoming scope limitations in previous direct methods. The reaction is readily scaled in batch configuration and can be directly performed in deuterated solvent to afford high yields of d-incorporated products with excellent isotope incorporation efficiency; characteristics not attainable in previous photocatalyzed approaches. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a radical mechanism and kinetic results of unactivated acids (KIE = 1) are consistent with a light-limited reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Twisted [N]Cycloparaphenylene by Alkene Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mono&#8208;alkene&#8208;inserted [N]cycloparaphenylenes 1 [(ene)&#8208;[N]CPP] with N = 6, 8, and 10, mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;inserted [6]CPP 2, and di&#8208;alkene&#8208;inserted [N]CPP 3 [(ene)2&#8208;[N]CPP] with N = 4, 6, and 8 were synthesized by fusing CPP precursors and alkene or ortho&#8208; phenylene groups via coupling reactions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the strips formed by the &#960;&#8208;surfaces of 1 and 2 exhibited a M&#246;bius topology in the solid state. While the M&#246;bius topology in the parent 1 and 2 in a solution was lost due to the free rotation of the paraphenylene unit even at low temperatures, ene&#8208;[6]CPP 4 with eight 1&#8208;pyrrolyl groups preserved the M&#246;bius topology even in a solution. Despite a twist, 1 has in&#8208;plane conjugation and possesses a unique size dependence of the electronic properties; i.e., the opposite size dependency of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy relative to conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Polycyclic Molecules via Ring Fusion for n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The primary challenge for n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is to improve their electron mobilities and thus the key figure of merit  &#956;C  *. Nevertheless, few reports in OECTs have specially proposed to address this issue. Herein, we report a 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system consisting of the core of naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin dimer and the terminal moieties of rhodamine, which features intramolecular noncovalent interactions, high &#960;&#8208;delocalization and strong electron&#8208;deficient characteristics. We find that this extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using the ring fusion strategy displays improved electron mobilities up to 0.043 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  compared to our previously reported small molecule gNR, and thereby leads to a remarkable  &#956;C  * of 10.3 F cm  &#8722;1  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  in n&#8208;type OECTs, which is the highest value reported to date for small&#8208;molecule OECTs. This work highlights the importance of &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension in polycyclic&#8208;fused molecules for enhancing the performance of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OECTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Iron(II) Oxide Sites Directly Responsible for Preferential Carbon Monoxide Oxidation at Ambient Temperature: An Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy identified that the concentration of Fe2+ species in the working state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;FeOx catalysts quantitatively correlates to their preferential carbon monoxide oxidation steady&#8208;state reaction rate at ambient temperature. Deactivation of such catalysts with time on stream originates from irreversible oxidation of active Fe2+ sites. The active Fe2+ species are presumably Fe+2O&#8208;2 clusters in contact with platinum nanoparticles; they coexist with spectator trivalent oxidic iron (Fe3+) and metallic iron (Fe0) partially alloyed with platinum. The concentration of active sites and, therefore, the catalyst activity strongly depends on the pretreatment conditions. Fe2+ is the resting state of the active sites in the preferential carbon monoxide oxidation cycle.</dc:description>
