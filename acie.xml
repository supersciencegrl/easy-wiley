         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Conversion to Methanol in a Bi&#8208;Functional Zeolite Catalytic Membrane Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of sequestrated CO 2  to methanol can reduce CO 2  emission and establish a sustainable carbon circuit. However, the transformation of CO 2  into methanol is challenging because of the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation and the deactivation of catalysts by water. In the present work, different reactor types have been evaluated for CO 2  catalytic hydrogenation to methanol. Best results have been obtained in a bi&#8208;functional catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) based on a zeolite LTA membrane and a catalytic Cu&#8208;ZnO&#8208;Al 2  O 3  &#8208;ZrO 2  layer on top. Due to the in&#8208;situ and rapid removal of the produced water from the catalytic layer through the hydrophilic zeolite LTA membrane, it is effective to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation, thus significantly increasing the CO 2  conversion (36.1%) and methanol selectivity (100%). Further, the catalyst deactivation by the produced water can be effectively inhibited, thus maintaining a high long&#8208;term activity of the CMR.</dc:description>

         <title>Tricomponent Supramolecular Multiblock Copolymers with

Tunable Composition via Sequential Seeded Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of supramolecular block co&#8208;polymers (BCP) with

small monomers and predictive sequence requires elegant molecular

design and synthetic strategies. Herein we report the unparalleled

synthesis of tri&#8208;component supramolecular BCPs with tunable

microstructure by a kinetically controlled sequential seeded

supramolecular polymerization of fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated

monomers. Core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivatives

with different core substitution and appended with &#946;&#8208;sheet forming

peptide side chains provide perfect monomer design with spectral

complementarity, pathway complexity and minimal structural

mismatch to synthesize and characterize the multi&#8208;component BCPs.

The distinct fluorescent nature of various cNDI monomers aids the

spectroscopic probing of the seeded growth process and the

microscopic visualization of resultant supramolecular BCPs using

Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM). Kinetically controlled

sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization presented here is

reminiscent of the multi&#8208;step synthesis of covalent BCPs via living

chain polymerization. These findings provide a promising platform for

constructing unique functional organic heterostructures for various

optoelectronic and catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Induction in Buckminsterfullerene Using a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral induction is an emerging topic of interest in various areas of chemistry because of its relationship to the elusive mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature. Buckminsterfullerene (C60) with the shape of a highly symmetric truncated icosahedron has rarely been referred for chiral induction due to the difficult symmetry breaking. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) structures can provide a key field for chiral induction. C60  could be incorporated into the chiral nanochannels of the MOF using an in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy. The circular dichroism spectra of the resulting nanocomposites showed an intense chiral signal in the absorption region of C60  . Experimental and theoretical studies showed that this unprecedented chiral induction of C60  was attributed to hybridization of the molecular orbitals through a close association with the pore surface of the MOF. Our method can endow highly symmetric achiral compounds with chirality, paving the new way toward fabrication of novel chiral nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;embedded Hydrocarbon Belts: The Synthesis, Structure and Redox Chemistry of Cyclothianthrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclothianthrenes, a series of sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts proposed a decade ago, were successfully constructed through a stepwise bottom&#8208;up synthesis. The belt [6]cyclothianthrene ([6]CT) is the smallest and most strained member of the family yet reported. Both [6]CT and [8]CT are the first examples of cyclothianthrene characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. An unprecedented chiral belt [7]CT and a M&#246;bius&#8208;shaped [9]CT were also achieved via modular synthesis. Crystallographic and computational studies show that belts [6]CT~[8]CT have prism&#8208;like conformations with well&#8208;defined tubular cavities which have potential for guest molecule inclusion. Cyclic voltammograms further revealed that these belts are redox&#8208;active. The success of constructing sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts, i.e. cyclothianthrenes, greatly enriches the chemistry of heteroatom&#8208;doped molecular belts and tubes.</dc:description>

         <title>Deformylation of 5&#8208;formylcytidine in different cell types</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epigenetic programming of cells requires methylation of deoxycytidines (dC) to 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;dC (mdC) followed by oxidation to 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC) and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). Subsequent transformation of fdC and cadC back to dC by various pathways establishes a chemical intra&#8208;genetic control circle. One of the discussed pathways involves the Tdg&#8208;independent deformylation of fdC directly to dC. Here we report the synthesis of a fluorinated fdC feeding probe (F&#8208;fdC), to study direct deformylation to F&#8208;dC. The synthesis was performed along a novel pathway that circumvents any F&#8208;dC as a reaction intermediate to avoid contamination interference. Feeding of F&#8208;fdC and observation of F&#8208;dC formation in vivo allowed us to gain new insights into the Tdg&#8208;independent removal process. While deformylation was shown to occur in stem cells, we here provide data that prove deformylation also in different somatic cell types. To study how the process is influenced by cell division, we investigated active demethylation in a non&#8208;dividing neurogenin&#8208;inducable system of iPS cells that differentiate into bipolar neurons. Our data together underpin the epigenetic relevance of stable fdC nucleosides in the genome in a variety of cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Record Productivity and Unprecedented Molecular&#8208;Weight for Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerization of Epoxides and Cyclic Anhydrides Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing polyesters with high molecular weight (  M  n  ) through ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides remains a major challenge. Herein, we communicate a metal&#8208;free, highly active, and high thermoresistance system for the ROCOP of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides to prepare polyesters (13 examples). The organoboron catalysts can endure a reaction temperature as high as 180 &#176;C for the ROCOP of cyclohexane oxide (CHO) with phthalic anhydride (PA) without the observation of any side reactions. The average  M  n  of the produced poly(CHO&#8208;  alt  &#8208;PA) climbed to 94.5 kDa with low polydispersity (  &#208;  = 1.19). In addition, an unprecedented turnover number of 9900, equivalent to an efficiency of 7.4 kg of polyester/g of catalyst, was achieved at a feed ratio of CHO/PA/catalyst = 20000:10000:1 at 150 &#176;C. Kinetic studies, crystal structure analysis,  11  B NMR spectra, and DFT calculations provided mechanistic justification for the effectiveness of the catalyst system.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylations of functionalized alkenes assisted by &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a fundamental type of carbonylation reactions, alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylations of unsaturated hydrocarbons constitutes one of the most important industrial applications of homogeneous catalysis. Since the birth of asymmetric catalysis, the enantioselective variant of such transformation has been recognized as a direct and efficient approach for the synthesis of chiral carbonyl compounds. However, owing to the difficulties in controlling multi&#8208;selectivities for asymmetric hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, to date this reaction is typically limited to vinylarenes and analogues. In this work, a highly efficient asymmetric alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylations of &#946;&#8208;carbonyl functionalized alkenes was developed, providing a practical and ready access to various densely functionalized chiral molecules with high optical purity from broadly available alkenes, CO, and nucleophiles (&gt;90 examples, 84&#8208;99% ee). This protocol features mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope, and the products can be readily transformed into a diverse array of chiral heterocycles. Control experiments revealed the key role of the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group in determining the enantioselectivity and promoting the activity, which facilitates chiral induction by coordination to the transition&#8208;metal as rationalized by DFT calculations. The strategy of utilizing an innate functional group as the directing group on the alkene substrate might find further applications in catalytic asymmetric hydrocarbonylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Achieving high&#8208;current&#8208;density and high&#8208;area&#8208;capacity operation of Li metal anodes offers promising opportunities for high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation batteries. However, high&#8208;rate Li deposition suffers from undesired Li&#8208;ion depletion especially at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, which compromises achievable capacity and lifetime. Here, electronegative graphene quantum dots are synthesized and assembled into an ultra&#8208;thin overlayer capable of efficient Li&#8208;ion adsorbing at the nanoscale on Li metal to fully relieve Li&#8208;ion depletion. The protected Li anode achieves long&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 1000 h at both superior current density of 60 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  and areal capacity of 60 mAh&#183;cm  &#8208;2  .&#160;Implementation of the protected anode allows for the construction of Li&#8208;air full battery with both enhanced rate capability and cycling performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Molecular Dipole&#8208;Enabled Defect Passivation and Control of Energy Level Alignment for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to passivate defects and modulate the interface energy&#8208;level alignment (IEA) is key to boost the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a robust route that simultaneously allows defect passivation and reduced energy difference between perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) via the judicious placement of polar chlorine&#8208;terminated silane molecules at the interface. Density functional theory (DFT) points to effective passivation of the halide vacancies on perovskite surface by the silane chlorine atoms. An integrated experimental and DFT study demonstrates that the dipole layer formed by the silane molecules decreases the perovskite work function, imparting an Ohmic character to the perovskite/HTL contact. The corresponding PSCs manifest a nearly 20% increase in power conversion efficiency over pristine devices and a markedly enhanced device stability. As such, the use of polar molecules to passivate defects and tailor the IEA in PSCs presents a promising platform to advance the performance of PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Sponge Method: X&#8208;ray Structure Analysis of Small Molecules via Post&#8208;Orientation within Porous Crystals. Principle and Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review article discusses, along with historical background, the principle and the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies of crystalline sponge (CS) method, a new single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCD) for the analysis of the structures of small molecules without sample crystallization. The method uses single crystalline porous coordination networks, called crystalline sponges, that can absorb small guest molecules into the pores. The absorbed guest molecules are ordered via molecular recognition in the pores and become observable by conventional SCD analysis. [[(ZnI2)3(tpt)2]&#8226;x(solvent)]ncomplex (tpt = tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine) was first proposed as a crystalline sponge and has been most generally used. Crystalline sponges developed later by the other groups are also&#160;discussed&#160;here. The principle of the CS method can be described as &#8220;post&#8208;crystallization&#8221; of the absorbed guest, whose ordering is templated by the pre&#8208;latticed cavities. The method has been widely applied to synthetic chemistry as well as natural product studies, for which proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples will be shown here.</dc:description>

         <title>Au/Pt&#8208;Egg&#8208;in&#8208;Nest Nanomotor for Glucose&#8208;Powered Catalytic Motion and Enhanced Molecular Transport to Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructures converting chemical energy to mechanical work by using benign metabolic fuels, have huge implications in biomedical science. Here, we introduce Au/Pt&#8208;based Janus nanostructures, resembling to &#8216;egg&#8208;in&#8208;nest&#8217; morphology (Au/Pt&#8208;ENs), showing enhanced motion as a result of dual enzyme&#8208;relay&#8208;like catalytic cascade in physiological biomedia, and in turn showing molecular&#8208;laden transport to living cells. We developed dynamic&#8208;casting approach using silica yolk&#8208;shell nanoreactors: first, to install a large Au&#8208;seed fixing the silica&#8208;yolk aside while providing the anisotropically confined concave hollow nanospace to grow curved Pt&#8208;dendritic networks. Owing to the intimately interfaced Au and Pt catalytic sites integrated in a unique anisotropic nest&#8208;like morphology, Au/Pt&#8208;ENs exhibited high diffusion rates and displacements as the result of glucose&#8208;converted oxygen concentration gradient. High diffusiophoresis in cell culture media increased the nanomotor&#8208;membrane interaction events, in turn facilitated the cell internalization. In addition, the porous network of Au/Pt&#8208;ENs facilitated the drug&#8208;molecule cargo loading and delivery to the living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>AgII&#8208;mediated electrocatalytic ambient CH4&#160;functionalization inspired by HSAB theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an efficient chemical transformation pathway of ambient CH  4  &#160;functionalization is an ongoing challenge and the key resides on the discovery of new catalytic systems. The hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base (HSAB) theory suggests that high&#8208;valent transition metals, as soft class (b) Lewis acids based on Pearson&#8217;s classification, are suitable candidates for CH  4  activation due to methyl moiety&#8217;s relatively low value of chemical hardness. While most of class (b) transition metals have been studied, divalent silver (Ag  II  ), possibly due to its reactive nature, is the only class (b) high&#8208;valent transition metal center that is yet reported to exhibit reactivities towards CH  4  &#160;activation. Inspired by such notion, here we report that electrochemically generated Ag  II  &#160;metalloradical readily functionalizes CH  4  &#160;into methyl bisulfate (CH  3  OSO  3  H) at ambient conditions in 98% H  2  SO  4  . Mechanistic investigation experimentally unveils a low activation energy of 13.1 kcal&#8226;mol  &#8722;1  , a high pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order rate constant of CH  4  &#160;activation up to 2800 hr  &#8722;1  &#160;at room temperature and a CH  4  &#160;pressure of 85 psi, and two competing reaction pathways preferable towards CH  4  &#160;activation over solvent oxidation. Reaction kinetic data suggest a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 99% beyond 180 psi CH  4  &#160;at room temperature for potential chemical production from widely distributed natural gas resources with minimal infrastructure reliance</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Historically used in stoichiometric hydroalumination chemistry, recent advances have transformed aluminium hydrides into versatile catalysts for the hydroboration of unsaturated multiple bonds. This catalytic ability is founded on the defining reactivity of aluminium hydrides with alkynes and alkenes: 1,2&#8208;hydroalumination of the unsaturated &#960;&#8208;system. This manuscript reports the aluminium&#8208;hydride catalyzed dehydroborylation of terminal alkynes. A tethered intramolecular amine ligand controls reactivity at the aluminium hydride centre, switching off hydroalumination and instead enabling selective reactions at the alkyne C&#8211;H &#963;&#8208;bond. Chemoselective C&#8210;H borylation was observed across a series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl substituted alkynes (21 examples). On the basis of kinetic and density functional theory studies, a mechanism in which C&#8211;H borylation proceeds by &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between pinacolborane (HBpin) and alkynyl aluminium intermediates is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Light&#8208;controllable Chemical Modulation of m6A RNA Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioactive small molecules with photo&#8208;removable protecting groups have provided spatial and temporal control of corresponding biological effects. Herein we presented the design, synthesis, computational and experimental evaluation of the first photo&#8208;activatable small&#8208;molecule methyltransferase agonist. By blocking the functional N&#8208;H group on MPCH with a photo&#8208;removable  ortho  &#8208;nitrobenzyl moiety, we have developed a promising photo&#8208;caged compound that had completely concealed its biological activity. Short UV light exposure of cells treated with that caged molecule in a few minutes resulted in a considerable hypermethylation of m  6  A modification in transcriptome RNAs, implicating a rapid release of the parent active compound. This study validates for the first time the photo&#8208;activatable small organic molecular concept in the field of RNA epigenetic research, which represents a novel tool in spatiotemporal and cellular modulation approaches.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite much progress has been made in the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation reactions of cyclic ketones, lactones and lactams, the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of acyclic carbonyl compounds lagged much behind due to the in&#8208;situ generated Z/E&#8208;enolate intermediates leading to opposite enantiomers. Especially, the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation of acyclic aldehydes is a long&#8208;standing challenge, because of the highest activity among carbonyl compounds leading to various competitive side reactions. Herein we reported an efficient Pd&#8208;catalysed asymmetric intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes with aryl bromides, which provides a rapid access to chiral aldehydes bearing an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in moderate to good yields with high enantioselectivities. Salient features of this transformation include high reactivity, mild conditions, and general substrate scope. In addition, a pair of enantiomers could be easily prepared with the use of the same ligand through changing the functional groups of aryl bromides with aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Linked Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium(III) Complexes&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C&#8722;H Arylation of Benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;Diazonaphthoquinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands (BOCps) bearing an oxygen linker was developed. The BOCpRh complexes are powerful catalysts in an asymmetric C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones to construct axially chiral heterobiaryls. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that this reaction is likely to proceed via an electrophilic C&#8722;H rhodation and subsequent coupling with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones.







Abstract
Chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium (CpRh) complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization reactions have witnessed a significant progress in organic synthesis. In sharp contrast, the reported chiral Cp ligands are limited to C&#8208;linked Cp and are often synthetically challenging. To address these issues, we have developed a novel class of tunable chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing oxygen linkers, which were efficient catalysts for C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones, affording axially chiral heterobiaryls in excellent yields and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 98.5:1.5 er). Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction is likely to proceed by electrophilic C&#8722;H activation, and followed by coupling of the cyclometalated rhodium(III) complex with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones.

         <title>Single&#8208;Site vs. Cluster Catalysis in High Temperature Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal active sites speciation on Pt&#8208;CHA is discussed for different high&#8208;temperature oxidation reactions, including 16O2/18O2 isotopic exchange experiments, methane combustion, and CO oxidation. Structure&#8211;performance relationships built on subtle changes in the active sites under working conditions are revealed.







Abstract
The behavior of single Pt atoms and small Pt clusters was investigated for high&#8208;temperature oxidations. The high stability of these molecular sites in CHA is a key to intrinsic structure&#8211;performance descriptions of elemental steps such as O2 dissociation, and subsequent oxidation catalysis. Subtle changes in the atomic structure of Pt are responsible for drastic changes in performance driven by specific gas/metal/support interactions. Whereas single Pt atoms and Pt clusters (&gt; ca. 1&#8197;nm) are unable to activate, scramble, and desorb two O2 molecules at moderate T (200&#8201;&#176;C), clusters &lt;1&#8197;nm do so catalytically, but undergo oxidative fragmentation. Oxidation of alkanes at high T is attributed to stable single Pt atoms, and the C&#8208;H cleavage is inferred to be rate&#8208;determining and less sensitive to changes in metal nuclearity compared to its effect on O2 scrambling. In contrast, when combustion involves CO, catalysis is dominated by metal clusters, not single Pt atoms.

         <title>A Green Fluorescent Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Aromatic Belt Containing a [6]Cycloparaphenylene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with a [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton ([6]CPP) was conveniently synthesized from calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt showed an enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and a deep cavity, and also exhibited strong green fluorescence and a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belts with conjugated structures still remain a challenge. Here, we report the first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with a [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton, which is conveniently synthesized from the easily available calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt has a rigid conjugated structure and deep cavity, and it can encapsulate one dichloromethane both in solution and in the solid state. Interestingly, the aromatic belt shows strong green fluorescence with a quantum yield of 0.39 and exhibits a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap of 2.02&#8197;eV. The belt&#8208;shaped conjugated structure composed of three carbazole subunits has specific optoelectronic properties that will promote wide applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science.

         <title>The Hole&#8208;Tunneling Heterojunction of Hematite&#8208;Based Photoanodes Accelerates Photosynthetic Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hole&#8208;tunneling heterojunctions of atomically dispersed RuOx&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;Sn&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanodes were designed rationally to achieve an overall quantum efficiency of 5.7&#8201;% in the all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven APS cells equipped with a Ni&#8208;SNG catalyst cathode for CO2 conversion into syngas with excellent stability for 30&#8197;h under 450&#8197;nm LED irradation.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (SMIS) heterojunctions based on Sn&#8208;doped Fe2O3 nanorods (SF NRs) were designed by combining atomic deposition of an Al2O3 overlayer with chemical grafting of a RuOx hole&#8208;collector for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion. The RuOx&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;SF photoanode with a 3.0&#8197;nm thick Al2O3 overlayer gave a &gt;5&#8208;fold&#8208;enhanced IPCE value of 52.0&#8201;% under 370&#8197;nm light irradiation at 1.2&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, compared to the bare SF NRs. The dielectric field mediated the charge dynamics at the Al2O3/SF NRs interface. Accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes on the surface of the SF NRs photoabsorber aids fast tunneling transfer of hot holes to single&#8208;atom RuOx species, accelerating the O2&#8208;evolving reaction kinetics. The maximal CO&#8208;evolution rate of 265.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved by integration of double SIMS&#8208;3 photoanodes with a single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;doped graphene CO2&#8208;reduction&#8208;catalyst cathode; an overall quantum efficiency of 5.7&#8201;% was recorded under 450&#8197;nm light irradiation.

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward electrochemical synthesis of chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) compounds is presented. The electrolysis proceeds at room temperature in an undivided cell under galvanostatic conditions, giving &#955;3&#8208;bromanes in good yields on the gram scale from bromoarenes. The reactivity of &#955;3&#8208;bromanes can be enhanced by Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid additives as demonstrated in &#955;3&#8208;bromane&#8208;mediated oxidative biaryl formation.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to hypervalent iodine(III) compounds, the isoelectronic bromine(III) counterparts have been little studied to date. This knowledge gap is mainly attributed to the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control reactivity of &#955;3&#8208;bromanes as well as to their challenging preparation from the highly toxic and corrosive BrF3 precursor. In this context, we present a straightforward and scalable approach to chelation&#8208;stabilized &#955;3&#8208;bromanes by anodic oxidation of parent aryl bromides possessing two coordinating hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropanyl substituents. A series of para&#8208;substituted &#955;3&#8208;bromanes with remarkably high redox potentials spanning a range from 1.86&#8197;V to 2.60&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgNO3 was synthesized by the electrochemical method. We demonstrate that the intrinsic reactivity of the bench&#8208;stable bromine(III) species can be unlocked by addition of a Lewis or a Br&#248;nsted acid. The synthetic utility of the &#955;3&#8208;bromane activation is exemplified by oxidative C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bond forming reactions.

A porous molecular crystal assembled by close&#8208;packing of macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate efficiently captures CO2, as reported by Ognjen &#352;. Miljani&#263;, Teng&#8208;Hao Chen, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102813). The square&#8208;shaped 7.1&#215;7.1 &#197; pores enable excellent CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation performance via both kinetic and thermodynamic effects. Moderately strong CO2&#8211;framework interactions allow easy regeneration of the adsorbent and its use in pressure swing adsorption.

         <title>Degradation in Order: Simple and Versatile One&#8208;Pot Combination of Two Macromolecular Concepts to Encode Diverse and Spatially Regulated Degradability Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual polymerization approach creates new possibilities to access polymeric materials with sequence&#8208;controlled primary structure and diverse degradable bonds. The methodology is overall simple and effective and involves an in situ organocatalyst switch, which leads to different polymerization mechanisms, and as a consequence, specific degradability functions are encoded.







Abstract
The clever one&#8208;pot combination of two macromolecular concepts, ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and step&#8208;growth polymerization (SGP), is demonstrated to be a simple, yet powerful tool to design a library of sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with diverse and spatially regulated degradability functions. ROP and SGP occur sequentially at room temperature when the organocatalytic conditions are switched from basic to acidic, and each allows the encoding of specific degradable bonds. ROP controls the sequence length and position of the degradability functions, while SGP between the complementary vinyl ether and hydroxyl chain&#8208;ends enables the formation of acetal bonds and high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass copolymers. The result is the rational combination of cleavable bonds prone to either bulk or surface erosion within the same macromolecule. The strategy is versatile and offers higher chemical diversity and level of control over the primary structure than current aliphatic polyesters or polycarbonates, while being simple, effective, and atom&#8208;economical and having potential for scalability.

         <title>Introduction of a Luminophore into Generic Polymers via Mechanoradical Coupling with a Prefluorescent Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric mechanoradicals were formed in situ under ball&#8208;milling conditions to undergo radical&#8211;radical coupling with a prefluorescent nitroxide&#8208;based reagent in order to incorporate a luminophore into the polymer main chains via a covalent bond. The method allows the direct and conceptually simple preparation of luminescent polymeric materials from a wide range of generic polymers such as polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel strategy for introducing a luminophore into generic polymers facilitated by mechanical stimulation. In this study, polymeric mechanoradicals were formed in situ under ball&#8208;milling conditions to undergo radical&#8211;radical coupling with a prefluorescent nitroxide&#8208;based reagent in order to incorporate a luminophore into the polymer main chains via a covalent bond. This method allowed the direct and conceptually simple preparation of luminescent polymeric materials from a wide range of generic polymers such as polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene. These results indicate that the present mechanoradical coupling strategy may help to transform existing commodity polymers into more valuable functional materials.

         <title>Amplified Interfacial Effect in an Atomically Dispersed RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd 2D Inverse Nanocatalyst for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd ultrathin 2D inverse nanocatalyst with amplified oxide/metal interface effects may serve as an excellent Pt&#8208;alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed oxide&#8208;on&#8208;metal inverse nanocatalysts provide a blueprint to amplify the strong oxide&#8211;metal interactions for heterocatalysis but remain a grand challenge in fabrication. Here we report a 2D inverse nanocatalyst, RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd nanosheets, by in situ creating atomically dispersed RuOx/Pd interfaces densely on ultrathin Pd nanosheets via a one&#8208;pot synthesis. The product displays unexpected performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium, which represents 8.0&#8208; and 22.4&#8208;fold enhancement in mass activity compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts, respectively, showcasing an excellent Pt&#8208;alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations validate that the RuOx/Pd interface can accumulate partial charge from the 2D Pd host and subtly change the adsorption configuration of O2 to facilitate the O&#8722;O bond cleavage. Meanwhile, the d&#8208;band center of Pd nanosubstrates is effectively downshifted, realizing weakened oxygen binding strength.

         <title>Hierarchical Two&#8208;Level Supramolecular Chirality of an Achiral Anthracene&#8208;Based Tetracationic Nanotube in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Host&#8211;guest complexation with nucleoside triphosphates in water has led to an achiral anthracene&#8208;based tetracationic nanotube showing two levels of supramolecular chirality. This nanotube, which can adopt M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformations, exhibits adaptive chiral recognition with opposite CD spectra for ATP/GTP and CTP/UTP, and a strong excimer showing strong circularly polarized luminescence ((+)&#8208;CPL; glum&#8776;10&#8722;2) with ATP in water.







Abstract
Herein, we report an achiral anthracene&#8208;based tetracationic nanotube (1&#8901;4Cl&#8722;) that shows two levels of supramolecular chirality: namely, conformationally adaptive host&#8211;guest complexation with nucleoside triphosphates (e.g. ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) and twisted packing of the chiral host&#8211;guest complexes in water. Interestingly, achiral 1&#8901;4Cl&#8722; exhibits chiral recognition for ATP/GTP and CTP/UTP through structural transformation of its intramolecular M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformation as the first level of supramolecular chirality, which leads to adaptive chirality with opposite CD responses. Furthermore, the formation of chiral M&#8208;1&#8901;4Cl&#8722;&#8835;ATP can promote an intermolecular P&#8208;twisted dimeric packing of anthracene rings as the second level of supramolecular chirality to achieve assembled chirality with strong circularly polarized luminescence arising from the excimer ((+)&#8208;CPL, glum&#8776;10&#8722;2) in water.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;In&#8208;Conjugation&#8208;Boosted Organic Semiconductor Gas Sensor Operating at High Temperature and Immune to Moisture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust NO2 sensor device based on an ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation structure maintained its performance at high temperature, which counteracted the effects of humidity (see picture; NO2 blue/red, H2O green/yellow). Charge transfer between NO2 and the chemiresistor was more efficient at 100&#8201;&#176;C than at room temperature. The fabricated sensor had a parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) NO2 detection limit and showed the highest sensitivity of all reported NO2 chemiresistive sensors.







Abstract
Organic electrical gas sensors have been developed for many decades because of their high sensitivity and selectivity. However, their industrialization is severely hindered by their intrinsic humidity susceptibility and poor recovery. Conventional organic sensory materials can only operate at room temperature owing to their weak intermolecular interactions. Herein, we demonstrate using a croconate polymer (poly&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylcroconate) that the &#8220;ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation&#8221; concept enables organic gas sensors to operate at 100&#8201;&#176;C and 70&#8201;% relative humidity with almost complete recovery. The fabricated sensor had a parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) detection limit for NO2 and showed the highest sensitivity (2526&#8197;ppm&#8722;1 at 40&#8197;ppb) of all reported NO2 chemiresistive sensors. Furthermore, charge transfer increased with temperature. Theoretical calculations and in situ FTIR spectra confirmed the ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation&#8208;inspired hydrogen bond as key for excellent sensitivity. A NO2 alarm system was assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of this sensor.

         <title>High&#8208;Spin Imido Cobalt Complexes with Imidyl Radical Character**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Syntheses and structures of rare trigonal, high&#8208;spin imido cobalt complexes are presented, which have very long Co&#8722;N bonds. Comprehensive spectroscopic studies reveal a radical imidyl character of the imide unit. Computational analyses corroborate these findings and show that the high&#8208;spin state is responsible for the imidyl radical character. The imido cobalt complexes are able to mediate intra&#8208; or intermolecular C&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of a variety of trigonal imido cobalt complexes [Co(NAryl)L2]&#8722;, (L=N(Dipp)SiMe3), Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) with very long Co&#8722;NAryl bonds of around 1.75&#8197;&#197;. Their electronic structure was interrogated using a variety of physical and spectroscopic methods such as EPR or X&#8208;Ray absorption spectroscopy which leads to their description as highly unusual imidyl cobalt complexes. Computational analyses corroborate these findings and further reveal that the high&#8208;spin state is responsible for the imidyl character. Exchange of the Dipp substituent on the imide by the smaller mesityl function (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) effectuates the unexpected Me3Si shift from the ancillary ligand set to the imidyl nitrogen, revealing a highly reactive, nucleophilic character of the imidyl unit.

&lt;p&gt;We report on the synthesis of a variety of trigonal imido cobalt complexes [Co(NAryl)L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, (L=N(Dipp)SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), Dipp=2,6-diisopropylphenyl) with very long Co&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;Aryl&lt;/sub&gt; bonds of around 1.75&#8197;&#197;. Their electronic structure was interrogated using a variety of physical and spectroscopic methods such as EPR or X-Ray absorption spectroscopy which leads to their description as highly unusual imidyl cobalt complexes. Computational analyses corroborate these findings and further reveal that the high-spin state is responsible for the imidyl character. Exchange of the Dipp substituent on the imide by the smaller mesityl function (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) effectuates the unexpected Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si shift from the ancillary ligand set to the imidyl nitrogen, revealing a highly reactive, nucleophilic character of the imidyl unit.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controlling Catenation in Germanium(I) Chemistry through Hemilability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the rational construction of chains of Group&#8197;14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8211;metal bonds is reported, which exploits hemilabile ancillary ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The resulting oligo&#8208;dimetallyne chains feature alternating single and double metal&#8211;metal bonds.







Abstract
We present a novel approach for constructing chains of Group&#8197;14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8211;metal bonds that exploits hemilabile ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The formation/nature of catenated species (oligo&#8208;dimetallynes) can be controlled by the use of (acidic/basic) &#8220;protecting groups&#8221; and through variation of the ligand scaffold. Reduction of ArNiPr2GeCl (ArNiPr2=2,6&#8208;(iPr2NCH2)2C6H3)&#8212;featuring hemilabile NiPr2 donors&#8212;yields (ArNiPr2Ge)4 (2), which contains a tetrameric Ge4 chain. 2 represents a novel type of a linear homo&#8208;catenated GeI compound featuring unsupported E&#8722;E bonds. Trapping experiments reveal that a key structural component is the central two&#8208;way Ge=Ge donor&#8208;acceptor bond: reactions with IMe4 and W(CO)5(NMe3) give the base&#8208; or acid&#8208;stabilized digermynes (ArNiPr2Ge(IMe4))2 (4) and (ArNiPr2Ge{W(CO)5})2 (5), respectively. The use of smaller N&#8208;donors leads to stronger Ge&#8208;N interactions and quenching of catenation behaviour: reduction of ArNEt2GeCl gives the digermyne (ArNEt2Ge)2, while the unsymmetrical system ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2 dimerizes to give tetranuclear (ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2)2 through aggregation at the NiPr2&#8208;ligated GeI centres.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Magnesium&#8208;Air Battery Based on Dual&#8208;Layer Gel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte was designed to simultaneously prevent the corrosion of Mg anode and production of the dense passive layer in a Mg&#8208;air battery. The resulting Mg&#8208;air battery exhibited a specific capacity of 2190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on total anodic weight and an energy density of 2282&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the total weight of anode and air electrode. It was further made into a fiber shape with high flexibility.







Abstract
Mg&#8208;air batteries are explored as the next&#8208;generation power systems for wearable and implantable electronics as they could work stably in neutral electrolytes and are also biocompatible. However, high corrosion rate and low utilization of Mg anode largely impair the performance of Mg&#8208;air battery with low discharge voltage, poor specific capacity and low energy density. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we first report a dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte to simultaneously solve the above two problems by preventing the corrosion of Mg anode and the production of dense passive layer, respectively. The resulting Mg&#8208;air batteries produced an average specific capacity of 2190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the total Mg anode (99.3&#8201;% utilization rate of Mg anode) and energy density of 2282&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the total anode and air electrode, both of which are the highest among the reported Mg&#8208;air batteries. Besides, our Mg&#8208;air batteries could be made into a fiber shape, and they were flexible to work stably under various deformations such as bending and twisting.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroborations with Broad Scope</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(hmds)2 enables clean hydroborations of C=X electrophiles (nitriles, amides, esters, pyridines, carbonates, diimides) at 20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C. The protocol was applied to polymer degradations (polyesters, polycarbonates) and CO2 reduction. Mechanistic studies indicate the catalytic role of MnII hydrides, for example, the isolated cluster [MnH(hmds)]6.







Abstract
Reductive transformations of easily available oxidized matter are at the heart of synthetic manipulation and chemical valorization. The applications of catalytic hydrofunctionalization benefit from the use of liquid reducing agents and operationally facile setups. Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroborations provide a highly prolific platform for reductive valorizations of stable C=X electrophiles. Here, we report an especially facile, broad&#8208;scope reduction of various functions including carbonyls, carboxylates, pyridines, carbodiimides, and carbonates under very mild conditions with the inexpensive pre&#8208;catalyst Mn(hmds)2. The reaction could be successfully applied to depolymerizations.

         <title>Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical challenge toward realizing Li metal anode has been the lack of stable SEI between Li and the electrolyte. We report an approach of using oxygen to induce unique decompositions of organic phosphate solvent, where simple reactions favor the formation of a stable SEI. This method permits repeated Li stripping/plating on Li metal in a flame retardant electrolyte. The results promise safe operations of Li in next generation batteries.







Abstract
Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next&#8208;generation battery technologies but is notoriously difficult to work with. The key to solving this challenge is believed to lie in the ability of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To further address potential safety issues, it is critical to achieve this goal in nonflammable electrolytes. Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant. The critical enabling factor of our approach was the introduction of oxygen, which upon electrochemical reduction induces the initial decomposition of TEP and produces Li3PO4 and poly&#8208;phosphates. Importantly, the reaction was self&#8208;limiting, and the resulting material regulated Li plating by limiting dendrite formation. In effect, we obtained a functional SEI on Li metal in a nonflammable electrolyte. When tested in a symmetric Li&#8741;Li cell, more than 300&#8197;cycles of stripping/plating were measured at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Prototypical Li&#8208;O2 and Li&#8208;ion batteries were also fabricated and tested to further support the effectiveness of this strategy. The mechanism by which the SEI forms was studied by density functional theory (DFT), and the predictions were corroborated by the successful detection of the intermediates and products.

         <title>Enhancing Thermocatalytic Activities by Upshifting the d&#8208;Band Center of Exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe Ternary Alloy Nanoparticles for the Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe nanoparticles were produced by topotactic exsolution. Compared to bimetallic and monometallic catalysts, the ternary Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the dry reforming of methane. DFT calculations indicated the enhanced activity originates from the optimal upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst.







Abstract
Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a feasible solution to address the reduction of greenhouse gases stipulated by the Paris Climate Agreement, given that it adds value by converting trivial gases, CO2 and CH4, simultaneously into useful syngas. However, the conventional Ni catalyst undergoes deactivation due to carbon coking and particle agglomeration. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient and durable DRM catalyst: exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe ternary alloy nanoparticles on the layered perovskite PrBaMn1.7Co0.1Ni0.2O5+&#948; produced by topotactic exsolution. This method readily allows the generation of a larger number of exsolved nanoparticles with enhanced catalytic activity above that of Ni monometallic and Co&#8208;Ni bimetallic particles. The enhancement is achieved by the upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe relative to those of Co&#8208;Ni and Ni, meaning easier charge donation to the adsorbate. Furthermore, the exsolved catalyst shows exceptional stability, with continuous DRM operation for about 350&#8197;hours.

         <title>Electrochemical Measurements Reveal Reactive Oxygen Species in Stress Granules**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arsenite&#8208;induced stress granules isolated from both non&#8208;cancer and cancer cells contain reactive oxygen species as revealed by amperometric measurements with Pt or platinized carbon microelectrodes. This finding supports a role for SGs as signaling hubs and unveils a correlation between SG biology and pathogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases and some cancers.







Abstract
Stress granules (SGs) are membrane&#8208;less organelles that assemble in the cytoplasm to organize cellular contents and promote rapid adaptation during stress. To understand how SGs contribute to physiological functions, we used electrochemical measurements to detect electroactive species in SGs. With amperometry, we discovered that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are encapsulated inside arsenite&#8208;induced SGs, and H2O2 is the main species. The release kinetics of H2O2 from single SGs and the number of H2O2 molecules were quantified. The discovery that SGs contain ROS implicates them as communicators of the cellular stresses rather than a simple endpoint. This may explain how SGs regulate cellular metabolism and stress responses. This may also help better understand their cytoprotective functions in pathological conditions associated with SGs such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), cancers and viral infections.

         <title>Hydrothermal Synthesis of Zinc&#8208;Doped Silica Nanospheres Simultaneously Featuring Stable Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy was developed for directly preparing zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres (Zn@SiNSs) in water, which can produce stable fluorescence (UV on) and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UV off) in water.







Abstract
Fluorescence and phosphorescence are known as two kinds of fundamental optical signals, which have been used for myriad applications. To date, simultaneous activation of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in the aqueous phase remains a big challenge. We prepare zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres (Zn@SiNSs) with fluorescence and RTP properties using a facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy. For the as&#8208;prepared Zn@SiNSs, the recombination of electrons and holes in defects and defect&#8208;stabilized excitons derived from oxygen vacancy/C=N bonds lead to the production of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived RTP (emission lasting for &#8776;9&#8197;s, quantum yield (QY): &#8776;33.6&#8201;%, RTP lifetime: &#8776;236&#8197;ms). The internal Si&#8722;O bonded networks and hydrophilic surface in Zn@SiNSs can reduce nonradiative decay to form self&#8208;protective RTP, and also provide high water solubility, excellent pH&#8208; and photostability.

         <title>Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ Sites for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>

         <dc:description>
Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella can break thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of CO2 reduction reaction and achieve the superior CO2 electroreduction performance.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts facilitate CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) to produce multi&#8208;carbon products. However, the roles of Cu0 and Cu+ and the mechanistic understanding remain elusive. This paper describes the controllable construction of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ sites derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide particles supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella to enhance CO2ER performance. 20&#8201;% Cu/CuSiO3 shows the superior CO2ER performance with 51.8&#8201;% C2H4 Faraday efficiency at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode during the 6&#8197;hour test. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism. The enhancement in CO2ER activity is mainly attributed to the synergism of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs: Cu0 activates CO2 and facilitates the following electron transfers; Cu+ strengthens *CO adsorption to further boost C&#8722;C coupling. We provide a strategy to rationally design Cu&#8208;based catalysts with viable valence states to boost CO2ER.

         <title>A Promising NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Sensor for Peptide&#8208;Mediated Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Kidney Dysfunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biological metabolism pathways of fluorophores can be altered by elaborately selected hydrophilic peptides. Hepatic cleared organic molecules and fast renal cleared ultrasmall nanoparticles can be retained in the kidney after conjugated to a peptide with high polarity. Based on the selected peptide, a ROS&#8208;responsive activatable bilateral NIR&#8208;II sensor was designed to detect early kidney injury and report on kidney dysfunctional progression.







Abstract
Kidney disease is usually &#8220;silent&#8221; at the early stage but can lead to severe kidney failure later on. The development of bioimaging probes with rapid distribution and long&#8208;term retention in the kidney is significant for the precise diagnosis of renal diseases. Here, a strategy for the peptide&#8208;mediated delivery and long&#8208;term accumulation (&gt;48&#8197;h) of second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores into the kidney is demonstrated. It is shown that both the hepatic&#8208;cleared organic molecules and fast renal&#8208;cleared ultrasmall nanoparticles can be retained in the kidney after conjugation to the peptide with high polarity. Moreover, a ROS&#8208;responsive activatable bilateral NIR&#8208;II sensor was designed based on the kidney targeting peptide, which enables both in&#8197;vivo long&#8208;term kidney monitoring and in&#8197;vitro urine analysis. The capability of the peptide&#8208;based sensor to detect early kidney injury and report on kidney dysfunctional progression is particularly crucial for chemotherapy regimen optimization and timely renoprotective intervention during medication.

         <title>ZIF&#8208;Based Nanoparticles Combine X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Nitrosative Stress with Autophagy Management for Hypoxic Prostate Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered nitrite (NO2&#8722;) is used for hypoxic prostate cancer therapy by inhibiting protective autophagy and inducing lethal nitrosative stress based on ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP. After entering tumor cells, the released 2&#8208;nitroimidazole ligands capture low&#8208;energy electrons derived from X&#8208;rays to produce NO2&#8722;, and the Zn2+ inhibits the migration and invasion of tumor cells.







Abstract
Although reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor treatments are predominant in clinical applications, ROS&#8208;induced protective autophagy promotes cell survival, especially in hypoxic tumors. Herein, X&#8208;ray triggered nitrite (NO2&#8722;) is used for hypoxic prostate cancer therapy by inhibiting autophagy and inducing nitrosative stress based on an electrophilic zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP). After internalization of pH&#8208;responsive ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP nanoparticles, electrophilic ligands and Zn2+ are delivered into cancer cells. Electrophilic ligands can not only consume GSH under hypoxia but also capture low&#8208;energy electrons derived from X&#8208;rays to generate NO2&#8722;, which inhibits autophagy and further elevates lethal nitrosative stress levels. In addition, dissociated Zn2+ specifically limits the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through ion interference. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results indicate that ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP nanoparticles under X&#8208;ray irradiation can effectively promote the apoptosis of hypoxic prostate cancer cells. Overall, this nitrosative stress&#8208;mediated tumor therapy strategy provides a novel approach targeting hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineered Nano&#8208;Ferroelectrics for High&#8208;Efficiency Piezocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroepitaxial strain in BaTiO3 nanoparticles with a designed porous structure is induced by engineering the surface reconstruction, resulting in a significant increase of the BaTiO3 tetragonality and thus its piezoelectricity. Benefiting from high piezoelectricity, the as&#8208;synthesized BaTiO3 nanoparticles possess a superb piezocatalytic overall water&#8208;splitting activity.







Abstract
Developing nano&#8208;ferroelectric materials with excellent piezoelectric performance for piezocatalysts used in water splitting is highly desired but also challenging, especially with respect to reaching large piezo&#8208;potentials that fully align with required redox levels. Herein, heteroepitaxial strain in BaTiO3 nanoparticles with a designed porous structure is successfully induced by engineering their surface reconstruction to dramatically enhance their piezoelectricity. The strain coherence can be maintained throughout the nanoparticle bulk, resulting in a significant increase of the BaTiO3 tetragonality and thus its piezoelectricity. Benefiting from high piezoelectricity, the as&#8208;synthesized blue&#8208;colored BaTiO3 nanoparticles possess a superb overall water&#8208;splitting activity, with H2 production rates of 159&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is almost 130 times higher than that of the pristine BaTiO3 nanoparticles. Thus, this work provides a generic approach for designing highly efficient piezoelectric nanomaterials by strain engineering that can be further extended to various other perovskite oxides, including SrTiO3, thereby enhancing their potential for piezoelectric catalysis.

         <title>A Nature&#8208;Inspired Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Discriminator for Differential Diagnosis of Cancer Cell Subtypes</title>

         <dc:description>
An azidosugar ZIF&#8208;8 carrier camouflaged with cancer cell membranes was devised to mimic cancer cell behaviors, and it accomplished cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective metabolic glycan labeling (MGL) in vivo. With abundant receptors, this biomimetic platform not only selectively targets homotypic cells but also realizes selective MGL for different breast cancer subtypes.







Abstract
Metabolic glycan labeling (MGL) followed by bioorthogonal chemistry provides a powerful tool for tumor imaging and therapy. However, selectively metabolic labeling of cells or tissues of interest remains a challenge. Particularly, owing to tumor heterogeneity including tumor subtypes and interpatient heterogeneity, it is far more difficult to realize tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;selective metabolic labeling for precise diagnosis. Inspired by nature, we designed azidosugar&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks camouflaged with cancer cell membranes to accomplish cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective MGL in vivo. With abundant receptors, this biomimetic platform not only selectively targets homotypic cells but also realizes different breast cancer subtype&#8208;selective MGL. Moreover, the endo/lysosomal&#8208;escaped ZIF&#8208;8 can make azidosugar escape from lysosomes and accelerate its metabolic incorporation. This strategy also takes advantage of cancer&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived cell membranes, which may have huge potential for personalized diagnosis and therapy.

         <title>Polysulfates Block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Uptake through Electrostatic Interactions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negatively charged polysulfates can bind to the positively charged patches of RBD of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and block viral interaction with host cells for infection inhibition. The synthetic linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) exhibits higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin, but lower anticoagulant activity. Therefore, it is considered to be a promising substitute for heparin in clinical applications.







Abstract
Here we report that negatively charged polysulfates can bind to the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 via electrostatic interactions. Using a plaque reduction assay, we compare inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by heparin, pentosan sulfate, linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) and hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate (HPGS). Highly sulfated LPGS is the optimal inhibitor, with an IC50 of 67&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 (approx. 1.6&#8197;&#956;m). This synthetic polysulfate exhibits more than 60&#8208;fold higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin (IC50: 4084&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1), along with much lower anticoagulant activity. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations, we verified that LPGS can bind more strongly to the spike protein than heparin, and that LPGS can interact even more with the spike protein of the new N501Y and E484K variants. Our study demonstrates that the entry of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 into host cells can be blocked via electrostatic interactions, therefore LPGS can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel viral inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Mechanism of the Arene&#8208;Limited Nondirected C&#8722;H Activation of Arenes with Palladium**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanistic study of the dual&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled directing&#8208;group&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation of arenes with palladium catalysts and the arene as limiting reagent is described. A detailed experimental and computational investigation supports a 1:1:1 complex of palladium and the two complementary ligands as the active species that enables a partially rate&#8208;limiting concerted C&#8722;H activation as part of a Pd0/PdII cycle.







Abstract
Recently palladium catalysts have been discovered that enable the directing&#8208;group&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation of arenes without requiring an excess of the arene substrate, thereby enabling methods for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex organic molecules. The key to success has been the use of two complementary ligands, an N&#8208;acyl amino acid and an N&#8208;heterocycle. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies on the dual&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled C&#8722;H activation of arenes have led us to identify the catalytically active species and a transition state model that explains the exceptional activity and selectivity of these catalysts. These findings are expected to be highly useful for further method development using this powerful class of catalysts.

The key to success has been the use of two complementary ligands, an N-acyl amino acid and an N-heterocycle. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies on the dual-ligand-enabled C&#8722;H activation of arenes have led us to identify the catalytically active species and a transition state model that explains the exceptional activity and selectivity of these catalysts. These findings are expected to be highly useful for further method development using this powerful class of catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of a Nitrogenase PN&#8208;Cluster Model with [Fe8S7(&#956;&#8208;Sthiolate)2] Core from the All&#8208;Ferric [Fe4S4(Sthiolate)4] Cubane Synthon</title>

A long&#8208;awaited challenging nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] (2) with two bridging thiolates has been synthesized for the first time from the all&#8208;ferric thiolate iron&#8208;sulfur cubane cluster Fe4S4(STbt)4 (1).







Abstract
Constructing synthetic models of the nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here, we report an optimal nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] (2) [Tbt=2,4,6&#8208;tris{bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl}phenyl] that is the closest synthetic mimic constructed to date. Of note is that two thiolate ligands and one hexacoordinated sulfide are connecting the two Fe4S3 incomplete cubanes similar to the native PN&#8208;cluster, which has never been achieved. Cluster 2 has been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and relevant physico&#8208;chemical methods. The variable temperature magnetic moments of 2 indicate a singlet ground state (S=0). The M&#246;ssbauer spectrum of 2 exhibits two doublets with an intensity ratio of 3:1, which suggests the presence of two types of iron sites. The synthetic pathway of the cluster 2 could indicate the native PN&#8208;cluster maturation process as it has been achieved from the Fe4S4 cubane Fe4S4(STbt)4 (1).

         <title>Stable Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells Based on Copper(II/I) Redox Mediators Bearing a Pentadentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, copper complexes bearing pentadentate ligands, namely [Cu(tpe)]2+/+ and [Cu(tme)]2+/+, have been reported as redox mediators in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Strikingly, devices based on [Cu(tme)]2+/+ complexes exhibit an excellent long&#8208;term stability and maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices employing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bipyridyl counterpart.







Abstract
In recent years, copper redox mediators have attracted growing interest in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). However, experiments revealed that ubiquitously used Lewis&#8208;base additives in the electrolytes coordinate to the CuII species, which restricts further enhancement of device performance and stability. We report the application of copper complexes endowed with diamine&#8208;tripyridine pentadentate ligands, [Cu(tpe)]2+/+ (tpe=N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tris(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine) and [Cu(tme)]2+/+ (tme=N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tris(6&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine), as redox mediators in DSCs. Experimental measurements demonstrate that the coordination environment of Cu(II) complexes with pentadentate ligands remains unchanged in the presence of TBP, which is in stark contrast to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bipyridyl counterpart. DSCs based on [Cu(tme)]2+/+ complexes exhibit an excellent long&#8208;term stability and maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 400&#8197;h under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices incorporating the bipyridyl counterpart (less than 80&#8201;%) under identical conditions.

         <title>Enabling Clinical Technologies for Hyperpolarized 129Xenon Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of hyperpolarized 129Xe has the potential to revolutionize clinical imaging, offering a non&#8208;ionizing contrast of organ function complementary to that of CT imaging and conventional MRI. In this Review, the physics of spin&#8208;exchange optical pumping (SEOP) is discussed, production modalities of hyperpolarized 129Xe are explained, and biomedical applications to lung imaging and beyond are described.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization is a technique that can increase nuclear spin polarization with the corresponding gains in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals by 4&#8211;8 orders of magnitude. When this process is applied to biologically relevant samples, the hyperpolarized molecules can be used as exogenous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. A technique called spin&#8208;exchange optical pumping (SEOP) can be applied to hyperpolarize noble gases such as 129Xe. Techniques based on hyperpolarized 129Xe are poised to revolutionize clinical lung imaging, offering a non&#8208;ionizing, high&#8208;contrast alternative to computed tomography (CT) imaging and conventional proton MRI. Moreover, CT and conventional proton MRI report on lung tissue structure but provide little functional information. On the other hand, when a subject breathes hyperpolarized 129Xe gas, functional lung images reporting on lung ventilation, perfusion and diffusion with 3D readout can be obtained in seconds. In this Review, the physics of SEOP is discussed and the different production modalities are explained in the context of their clinical application. We also briefly compare SEOP to other hyperpolarization methods and conclude this paper with the outlook for biomedical applications of hyperpolarized 129Xe to lung imaging and beyond.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene&#8208;Containing Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 15&#8201;% Efficiency and High Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing polymer acceptor PFY&#8208;3Se with a narrow band gap, high electron mobility, and improved intermolecular interaction was developed. In all&#8208;polymer solar cells, batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch insensitive PFY&#8208;3Se obtained an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 15&#8201;% with high reproducibility, which is much better than its analogue, selenophene&#8208;free PFY&#8208;0Se (13.0&#8201;%).







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) progressed tremendously due to recent advances in polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs), and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have exceeded 15&#8201;%. However, the practical applications of all&#8208;PSCs are still restricted by a lack of PSMAs with a broad absorption, high electron mobility, low energy loss, and good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility. A multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing PSMA, PFY&#8208;3Se, was developed based on a selenophene&#8208;fused SMA framework and a selenophene &#960;&#8208;spacer. Compared to its thiophene analogue PFY&#8208;0Se, PFY&#8208;3Se shows a &#8776;30&#8197;nm red&#8208;shifted absorption, increased electron mobility, and improved intermolecular interaction. In all&#8208;PSCs, PFY&#8208;3Se achieved an impressive PCE of 15.1&#8201;% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density of 23.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high fill factor of 0.737, and a low energy loss, which are among the best values in all&#8208;PSCs reported to date and much better than PFY&#8208;0Se (PCE=13.0&#8201;%). Notably, PFY&#8208;3Se maintains similarly good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch properties for realizing reproducible device performance, which is the first reported and also very rare for the PSMAs. Moreover, the PFY&#8208;3Se&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs show low dependence of PCE on device area (0.045&#8211;1.0&#8197;cm2) and active layer thickness (110&#8211;250&#8197;nm), indicating the great potential toward practical applications.

In all-PSCs, PFY-3Se achieved an impressive PCE of 15.1&#8201;% with both high short-circuit current density of 23.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and high fill factor of 0.737, and a low energy loss, which are among the best values in all-PSCs reported to date and much better than PFY-0Se (PCE=13.0&#8201;%). Notably, PFY-3Se maintains similarly good batch-to-batch properties for realizing reproducible device performance, which is the first reported and also very rare for the PSMAs. Moreover, the PFY-3Se-based all-PSCs show low dependence of PCE on device area (0.045&#8211;1.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and active layer thickness (110&#8211;250&#8197;nm), indicating the great potential toward practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Scaffold&#8208;Directed Face Selectivity Machine&#8208;Learned from Vectors of Non&#8208;covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning, ML, model based on vectors of transition&#8208;state interatomic contacts can predict face&#8208;selectivity of Michael additions or Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions more accurately than traditional ML schemes, energetic calculations, or seasoned organic chemists.







Abstract
This work describes a method to vectorize and Machine&#8208;Learn, ML, non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for scaffold&#8208;directed reactions important in synthetic chemistry. Models trained on this representation predict correct face of approach in ca. 90&#8201;% of Michael additions or Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions. These accuracies are significantly higher than those based on traditional ML descriptors, energetic calculations, or intuition of experienced synthetic chemists. Our results also emphasize the importance of ML models being provided with relevant mechanistic knowledge; without such knowledge, these models cannot easily &#8220;transfer&#8208;learn&#8221; and extrapolate to previously unseen reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Protein Labeling and Crosslinking by Covalent Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid aptamers were developed that are capable of covalently labeling their protein target with a functional molecule. Additionally, with little modification, the aptamer covalently crosslinked to its target instead, thereby inhibiting its function. Covalent aptamers offer a new tool for selective protein modification, detection, and inhibition.







Abstract
We developed a new approach to selectively modify native proteins in their biological environment using electrophilic covalent aptamers. These aptamers are generated through introduction of a proximity&#8208;driven electrophile at specific nucleotide sites. Using thrombin as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that covalent aptamers can selectively transfer a variety of functional handles and/or irreversibly crosslink to the target protein. This approach offers broad programmability and high target specificity. Furthermore, it addresses issues common to aptamers such as instability towards endogenous nucleases and residence times during target engagement. Covalent aptamers are new tools that enable specific protein modification and sensitive protein detection. Moreover, they provide prolonged, nuclease&#8208;resistant enzyme inhibition.

         <title>Quantitative Nano&#8208;amperometric Measurement of Intravesicular Glutamate Content and its Sub&#8208;Quantal Release by Living Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanowire electrochemical biosensor for the quantitative measurement of the intravesicular glutamate (Glu) content inside living neurons and its released fractions was developed. It is shown that only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. The sensor opens new possibilities for exploring the regulatory mechanisms of glutamatergic neurotransmission and plasticity.







Abstract
Quantitative measurements of intravesicular glutamate (Glu) and of transient exocytotic release contents directly from individual living neurons are highly desired for understanding the mechanisms (full or sub&#8208;quantal release?) of synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, this could not be achieved so far due to the lack of adequate experimental strategies relying on selective and sensitive Glu nanosensors. Herein, we introduce a novel electrochemical Glu nanobiosensor based on a single SiC nanowire that can selectively measure in real&#8208;time Glu fluxes released via exocytosis by large Glu vesicles (ca. 125&#8197;nm diameter) present in single hippocampal axonal varicosities as well as their intravesicular content before exocytosis. These measurements revealed a sub&#8208;quantal release mode in living hippocampal neurons, viz., only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. Importantly, this fraction remained practically the same when hippocampal neurons were pretreated with L&#8208;Glu&#8208;precursor L&#8208;glutamine, while it significantly increased after zinc treatment, although in both cases the intravesicular contents were drastically affected.

         <title>Cucurbituril&#8208;Encapsulating Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Mechanochemistry: Adsorbents with Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry has been applied to achieve one&#8208;pot fabrication of monolithic decamethylcucurbit[5]uril (MC5)&#8208;encapsulating metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The designed MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid material with MC5 as active domains shows enhanced uptake, and selective capture of lead(II) cations at low concentrations. This work opens up the novel possibility of designing task&#8208;specific porous host&#8211;guest hybrid materials on a macroscopic scale.







Abstract
The first examples of monolithic crystalline host&#8211;guest hybrid materials are described. The reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and Fe(NO3)3&#8901;9&#8201;H2O in the presence of decamethylcucurbit[5]uril ammonium chloride (MC5&#8901;2&#8201;NH4Cl&#8901;4&#8201;H2O) directly affords MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid monoliths featuring hierarchical micro&#8208;, meso&#8208; and macropores. Particularly, this &#8220;bottle&#8208;around&#8208;ship&#8221; synthesis and one&#8208;pot shaping are facilitated by a newly discovered Fe&#8208;MC5 flowing gel formed by mechanochemistry. The designed MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid material with MC5 as active domains shows enhanced CH4 and lead(II) uptake performance, and selective capture of lead(II) cations at low concentrations. This shows that host&#8211;guest hybrid materials can exhibit synergic properties that out&#8208;perform materials based on individual components.

         <title>Enhanced Band Convergence and Ultra&#8208;low Thermal Conductivity Synergistically Lead to High Thermoelectric Performance in SnTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SnTe, a structural analogue of champion thermoelectric material PbTe, has recently attracted wide attention for thermoelectric energy conversion. Here, we have demonstrated a co&#8208;doping strategy to improve the thermoelectric performance of SnTe via simultaneous modulation of electronic structure and phonon transport. The electrical transport is optimized by 3 mol% Ag doping in self&#8208;compensated SnTe (i.e., Sn1.03Te). Further, Mg doping in SnAg0.03Te resulted in highly converged valence bands, which enhanced the Seebeck coefficient markedly. The energy gap between the light and heavy hole valence bands (DEv) decreases to 0.10 eV in Ag and Mg co&#8208;doped SnTe compared to the value of 0.35 eV in pristine SnTe. As a result of optimized p&#8208;type carrier concentration and highly converged valence bands, we obtained a high power factor of ~27 mW/cmK2 at 865 K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te. The lattice thermal conductivity of Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te reached to an ultra&#8208;low value of ~ 0.23 W/mK at 865 K due to the formation of MgTe nanoprecipitates in SnTe matrix. With this synergy among optimized carrier concentration, enhanced valence band convergence and ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity, we obtained a high thermoelectric figure of merit, zT ~1.55 at 865 K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Biology of Werner&#8217;s Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Werner&#8217;s Complex, as a cationic coordination complex (CCC), has hitherto unappreciated biological properties derived from its binding affinity to highly anionic biomolecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and nucleic acids. Competitive inhibitor and spectroscopic assays confirm the high affinity to GAGs heparin, heparan sulfate (HS) and its pentasaccharide mimetic Fondaparinux (FPX). Functional consequences of this affinity include inhibition of FPX cleavage by bacterial heparinase and mammalian heparanase enzymes with inhibition of cellular invasion and migration. Werner&#8217;s Complex is a very efficient condensing agent for DNA and tRNA. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for translational implications, it is demonstrated to display antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) at micromolar concentrations with promising selectivity. Exploitation of non&#8208;covalent hydrogen&#8208;bonding and electrostatic interactions has motivated the unprecedented discovery of these properties, opening new avenues of research for this iconic compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Monocyclic and Dicyclic Dehydro[20]annulenes Integrated with Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes exhibiting specific sizes and topologies from regioselective unilateral  ortho  &#8208;diethynyl PDI, is developed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8208;Hay homo&#8208;coupling and cross&#8208;coupling. Through the integration of electron&#8208;deficient PDI chromophores into the dehydroannulene scaffolding, these macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and the degenerated LUMO levels. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed unique porous supramolecular structures, which display micropore characteristics with surface area of 120.74 m  2  g  &#8208;1  . A moderate electron mobility of 0.05 cm  2  &#160;V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  for chlorine&#8208;free dehydro[20]annulene based on micrometer&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline transistors was witnessed. The porous and yet semiconducting features signify the prospects of PDI&#8208;integrated dehydroannulenes in organic optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Reversal Polymer Nano&#8208;modulators for Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomedicine offers an effective way to regulate the balance between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and suppressive regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), which however has been rarely exploited for cancer immunotherapy. We herein report a charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulator (SPDMCN) activated by tumor microenvironment (TME) for photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPDMCN is constructed by conjugating an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) to the side chains of a photodynamic polymer via an acid&#8208;liable linker. The negative charge of SPDMCN ensures its high stability in blood circulation and ideal tumor accumulation; while the later exposure to acidic TME reverses its surface charge to positive, enhancing its tumor penetration and locally releasing DMC. Upon near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation, SPDMCN generates singlet oxygen to ablate tumor and promote maturation of dendritic cells. Concurrently, the released DMC inhibits PP2A activity and decreases Tregs differentiation. Such combinational action induces a sharp increase in CTL/Treg ratio in TME and effectively inhibits both primary and distant tumors in living mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing Element Migration over Bifunctional Metal&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts and its Impact on Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic performance of composite catalysts is not only affected by the physicochemical properties of each component, but also the proximity and interaction between them. Herein, we employ four representative oxides (In 2  O 3  , ZnO, Cr 2  O 3  , and ZrO 2  ) to combine with H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 for the hydrogenation of CO 2  to hydrocarbons directed by methanol intermediate and clarify the correlation between metal migration and the catalytic performance. The migration of metals to zeolite driven by the harsh reaction conditions can be visualized by electron microscopy, meanwhile, the change of zeolite acidity is also carefully characterized. The protonic sites of H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 are neutralized by mobile indium and zinc species via a solid ion&#8208;exchange mechanism, resulting in a drastic decrease of C 2+  hydrocarbon products over In 2  O 3  /H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZnO/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5. While, the thermomigration ability of chromium and zirconium species is not significant, endowing Cr 2  O 3  /H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZrO 2  /H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts with high selectivity of C 2+  hydrocarbons. This work preliminarily unveils the overlooked element migration and its profound impact on the catalytic behaviors of bifunctional catalysts for CO/CO 2  hydrogenation, providing insights into the rational design of emerging multifunctional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular protein&#8208;drug interactions probed by direct mass spectrometry of cell lysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding protein&#8208;ligand interactions in a cellular context is an important goal in molecular biology and biochemistry, and particularly for drug development. Investigators must demonstrate that drugs penetrate cells and specifically bind their targets. Towards that end, we present a native mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based method for analyzing drug uptake and target engagement in eukaryotic cells. This method is based on our previously introduced direct&#8208;MS method for rapid analysis of proteins directly from crude samples. Here, direct&#8208;MS enables label&#8208;free studies of protein&#8208;drug binding in human cells and is used to determine binding affinities of lead compounds in crude samples. We anticipate that this method will enable the application of native MS to a range of problems where cellular context is important, including protein&#8208;protein interactions, drug uptake and binding, and characterization of therapeutic proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;ion Binding Mediates the Reversible Interconversion of Cis and Trans Peroxido&#160;Dicopper Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupled dinuclear copper oxygen cores (Cu  2  O  2  ) featured in type III copper proteins (e.g. hemocyanin, tyrosinase, catechol oxidase) are vital for O  2  transport and substrate oxidation in a range of organisms.  &#956;  &#8208;1,2&#8208;  cis  peroxido dicopper cores (  C  P  ) have been proposed as key structures involved in the early stages of O  2  binding in these proteins, and their reversible isomerization to other Cu  2  O  2  cores are directly relevant to enzyme function. Despite the relevance of such species to type III copper proteins and the broader interest in the properties and reactivity of bimetallic  C  P  cores in biological and synthetic systems, the properties and reactivity of  C  P  Cu  2  O  2  species remain largely unexplored. Herein, we report our combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies which detail the first reversible interconversion of&#160;  &#956;  &#8208;1,2&#8208;  trans  peroxido (  T  P  ) and  C  P  dicopper cores. Ca  II  mediates this process through reversible binding at the Cu  2  O  2  core, and highlights the unique capability for metal&#8208;ion binding events to stabilize novel reactive fragments and control O  2  &#160;activation in biomimetic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminocatalytic [8+2] Cycloadditions toward Chiral Cyclazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and exceptionally stereoselective synthesis toward chiral cycl[3.2.2]azines has been realized, by means of the rational design and utilization of novel (  E  )&#8208;3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;3  H  &#8208;pyrrolizines in iminium&#8208;ion catalyzed [8+2] cycloadditions. The presented protocol allows for the incorporation of diverse enals, including cinnamaldehydes, enolizable aldehydes, and substrates of extended conjugation. The obtained products contain both an electron&#8208;rich alkenyl&#8208;pyrrole moiety and an electron&#8208;deficient carbaldehyde substituent, and both moieties can undergo selective transformations with retention of the stereochemical information established in the [8+2] cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>The Cytochrome P450 Catalyzing C&#8722;S Bond Formation in S&#8208;Heterocyclization of Chuangxinmycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome P450 CxnD exhibited C&#8722;S bond forming activity in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis, generating the unique tricyclic indole&#8208;S&#8208;hetero scaffold from thiol intermediates. Structural characterization of CxnD with a substrate analogue proposed a radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group of the substrate.







Abstract
Microbial sulfur&#8208;containing secondary metabolites show various biological activities, but the C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming in their biosynthetic metabolism has not been thoroughly understood. Here, we present genetic, biochemical and structural characterization of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CxnD exhibiting C&#8722;S bond forming activity in S&#8208;heterocyclization of chuangxinmycin biosynthesis. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that CxnD generated an indole&#8208;fused dihydrothiopyran skeleton from a L&#8208;Trp&#8208;derived thiol intermediate. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray crystal structure of CxnD in complex with a substrate analogue and structure&#8208;based mutagenesis revealed intimate details of the substrate binding mode. A radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group of the substrate was proposed for CxnD, which provided valuable insights into the molecular basis for the intra&#8208;molecular C(sp2)&#8722;H thiolation by the P450 in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Pyrrole &#945;&#8208;Cleavage with Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: Enzyme Model by Structural Constraint</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of triplet dioxygen with closed shell molecules is formally spin&#8208;forbidden. Nature overcomes this prohibition by a variety of enzymes. The surprising reactivity of calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate with O2 is described and the spin&#8208;inversion process is analyzed. The square&#8208;planar aluminates transpire as enzyme models that substantiate the critical role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity and structural constraint for the functions of aerobic life.







Abstract
The present work describes the reaction of triplet dioxygen with the porphyrinogenic calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates to alkylperoxido aluminates in high selectivity. Multiconfigurational quantum chemical computations disclose the mechanism for this spin&#8208;forbidden process. Despite a negligible spin&#8211;orbit coupling constant, the intersystem crossing (ISC) is facilitated by singlet and triplet state degeneracy and spin&#8211;vibronic coupling. The formed peroxides are stable toward external substrates but undergo an unprecedented oxidative pyrrole &#945;&#8208;cleavage by ligand aromatization/dearomatization&#8208;initiated O&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission. A detailed comparison of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates with dioxygen&#8208;related enzymology provides insights into the ISC of metal&#8208; or cofactor&#8208;free enzymes. It substantiates the importance of structural constraint and element&#8211;ligand cooperativity for the functions of aerobic life.

         <title>CeCl3/n&#8208;BuLi: Unraveling Imamoto's Organocerium Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seamless low&#8208;temperature syntheses, crystallization and spectroscopies provide structural details of the heterobimetallic reagent routinely used for regioselective carbon&#8722;carbon bond forming reactions with carbonyl compounds. 7Li&#8197;NMR spectroscopy takes on an important role here, tracking down n&#8208;BuLi dissociation.







Abstract
CeCl3(thf) reacts at low temperatures with MeLi, t&#8208;BuLi, and n&#8208;BuLi to isolable organocerium complexes. Solvent&#8208;dependent extensive n&#8208;BuLi dissociation is revealed by 7Li NMR spectroscopy, suggesting &#8220;Ce(n&#8208;Bu)3(thf)x&#8221; or solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs like &#8220;[Li(thf)4][Ce(n&#8208;Bu)4(thf)y]&#8221; as as the dominant species of the Imamoto reagent. The stability of complexes Li3Ln(n&#8208;Bu)6(thf)4 increases markedly with decreasing LnIII size. Closer inspection of the solution behavior of crystalline Li3Lu(n&#8208;Bu)6(thf)4 and mixtures of LuCl3(thf)2/n&#8208;BuLi in THF indicates occurring n&#8208;BuLi dissociation only at molar ratios of &lt;1:3. n&#8208;BuLi&#8208;depleted complex LiLu(n&#8208;Bu)3Cl(tmeda)2 was obtained by treatment of Li2Lu(n&#8208;Bu)5(tmeda)2 with ClSiMe3, at the expense of LiCl incorporation. Imamoto's ketone/tertiary alcohol transformation was examined with 1,3&#8208;diphenylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;one, affording 99&#8201;% of alcohol.

         <title>Small Exciton Binding Energies Enabling Direct Charge Photogeneration Towards Low&#8208;Driving&#8208;Force Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct photogeneration of free charge carriers enabled by remarkable low exciton binding energies is demonstrated in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nonfullerene acceptor of Y6 by a joint experimental and theoretical study. This results in efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets in the high&#8208;efficiency nonfullerene organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets, leading to over 18&#8201;% efficiency for the single&#8208;junction devices based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NFA of Y6. Herein, to reveal the underlying charge generation mechanisms, we have investigated the exciton binding energy (Eb) in Y6 by a joint theoretical and experimental study. The results show that owing to strong charge polarization effects, Y6 has remarkable small Eb of &#8722;0.11&#8211;0.15&#8197;eV, which is even lower than perovskites in many cases. Moreover, it is peculiar that the photoluminescence is enhanced with temperature, and the energy barrier for separating excitons into charges is evidently lower than the thermal energy according to the temperature dependence of photoluminescence, manifesting direct photogeneration of charge carriers enabled by weak Eb in Y6. Thus, charge generation in NFA&#8208;based OSCs shows little dependence on interfacial driving forces.

         <title>Stabilization of an Enantiopure Sub&#8208;monolayer of Helicene Radical Cations on a Au(111) Surface through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on noncovalent interactions has been developed to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chirality of the molecules being retained at the nanoscale.







Abstract
In the past few years, the chirality and magnetism of molecules have received notable interest for the development of novel molecular devices.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy based on noncovalent interactions has been developed to deposit a sub-monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre-functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chirality of the molecules being retained at the nanoscale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, the chirality and magnetism of molecules have received notable interest for the development of novel molecular devices. Chiral helicenes combine both these properties, and thus their nanostructuration is the first step toward developing new multifunctional devices. Here, we present a novel strategy to deposit a sub-monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre-functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chemical structure of these molecules being maintained at the nanoscale, as demonstrated by in-house characterizations. Furthermore, synchrotron-based X-ray natural circular dichroism confirmed that the handedness of the thia[4]helicene is preserved on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Metal Battery Achieved by a Safe Electrolyte Based on Recyclable and Low&#8208;Cost Molecular Sieve</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite was used to sieve the excess solvents within Li&#8208;ion solvation sheaths of typical carbonate electrolyte to eliminate the adverse effects (high&#8208;voltage/temperature oxidation, unstable CEI/SEI). As a result, high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal battery (LMB) that used this zeolite sieved electrolyte demonstrated a significantly improved cycling time and safety, but largely reduced production cost.







Abstract
As one typical clean&#8208;energy technologies, lithium&#8208;metal batteries, especially high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries which use concentrated electrolytes hold promising prospect for the development of a sustainable world. However, concentrated electrolytes with aggregative configurations were achieved at the expense of using extra dose of costly and environmental&#8208;unfriendly salts/additives, which casts a shadow over the development of a sustainable world. Herein, without using any expensive salts/additives, we employed commercially&#8208;available low&#8208;cost and environmental&#8208;friendly molecular sieves (zeolite) to sieve the solvation sheath of lithium ions of classic commercialized electrolyte (LiPF6&#8208;EC/DMC), and resulting in a unique zeolite sieved electrolyte which was more aggregative than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Inspiringly, the new&#8208;designed electrolyte exhibited largely enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation stability under high&#8208;voltage (4.6&#8197;volts) and elevated temperature (55&#8201;&#176;C). NCM&#8208;811//Li cells assembled with this electrolyte delivered ultra&#8208;stable rechargeabilities (over 1000&#8197;cycles for half&#8208;cell; 300&#8197;cycles for pouch&#8208;cell). More importantly, sustainable NCM&#8208;811//Li pouch&#8208;cell with negligible capacity decay can also be obtained through using recyclable zeolite sieved electrolyte. This conceptually&#8208;new way in preparing safe and highly&#8208;efficient electrolyte by using low&#8208;price molecular sieve would accelerate the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion/lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;As one typical clean-energy technologies, lithium-metal batteries, especially high-energy-density batteries which use concentrated electrolytes hold promising prospect for the development of a sustainable world. However, concentrated electrolytes with aggregative configurations were achieved at the expense of using extra dose of costly and environmental-unfriendly salts/additives, which casts a shadow over the development of a sustainable world. Herein, without using any expensive salts/additives, we employed commercially-available low-cost and environmental-friendly molecular sieves (zeolite) to sieve the solvation sheath of lithium ions of classic commercialized electrolyte (LiPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-EC/DMC), and resulting in a unique zeolite sieved electrolyte which was more aggregative than conventional concentrated electrolytes.

         <dc:description>Sulfur chemistry based on solid&#8208;liquid dissolution&#8208;deposition route inevitably encountered shuttle of lithium polysulfides, its parasitic interaction with lithium (Li) anode and flood electrolyte environment. The sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) cathode favors solid&#8208;solid conversion mechanism in carbonate ester electrolytes but fails to pair high&#8208;capacity Li anode. Herein, we rationally designed a cation&#8208;solvent fully coordinated ether electrolyte to simultaneously resolve the problems of both Li anode and S@pPAN cathode. Raman spectroscopy revealed a highly suppressed solvent activity and a cation&#8208;solvent fully coordinated structure (molar ratio 1:1). Consequently, Li electrodeposit evolved into round&#8208;edged morphology, LiF&#8208;rich interphase, and high reversibility. Moreover, S@pPAN cathode inherited a neat solid&#8208;phase redox reaction and fully eliminated the dissolution of lithium polysulfides.&#160; Finally, we harvested a long&#8208;life Li&#8208;S@pPAN pouch cell with slight Li metal excessive (0.4 time) and ultra&#8208;lean electrolyte design (1 &#181;L mg  S  &#8208;1  ), delivering 394 W h kg  &#8208;1  energy density based on electrodes and electrolyte mass.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Reactivity of Bottlebrush and Dendronized Polymers: Solid vs Solution States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We explored the mechanochemical degradation of bottlebrush and dendronized polymers in solution (with ultrasonication, US) and solid states (with ball&#8208;mill grinding, BMG). Over 50 polymers were prepared with varying backbone length and arm architecture, composition, and size. With US, we found that bottlebrush and dendronized polymers exhibited consistent backbone scission behavior, which was related to their elongated conformations in solution. Considerably different behavior was observed with BMG, as arm architecture and composition had a significant impact on backbone scission rates. Arm scission was also observed for bottlebrush polymers in both solution and solid states, but only in the solid state for dendronized polymers. Motivated by these results, multi&#8208;mechanophore polymers with bottlebrush and dendronized polymer architectures were prepared and their reactivity was compared. Although dendronized polymers showed slower arm&#8208;scission, the selectivity for mechanophore activation was much higher. Overall, these results have important implications to the development of new mechanoresponsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 by stable Ni nanocrystal on porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths at reduced temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dry reforming of CH  4  /CO  2  provides a promising and economically feasible route for the large&#8208;scale carbon fixation; however, the coking and sintering of catalysts remain a fundamental challenge. Here we stabilize single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles at the surface of porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths and show the quantitative production of syngas from dry reforming of CH  4  /CO  2  . We show the complete conversion of CH  4  /CO  2  even only at 700&#176;C with excellent performance durability after a continuous operation of 500 hours. The well&#8208;defined and catalytically active Ni&#8208;MgO interfaces facilitate the reforming reaction and enhance the coking resistance. Our findings would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the &#8220;Nanocrystal On Porous Single&#8208;crystalline Monoliths&#8221; technique could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering competitive routes for Ni&#8208;based nanoparticle electrodeposition by an operando optical monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrodeposition of earth&#8208;abundant iron group metals such as nickel is difficult to characterize by simple electrochemical analyses as the reduction of their metal salts often competes with inhibiting reactions. This makes the mechanistic interpretation sometimes contradictory, preventing unambiguous predictions about the nature and structure of the electrodeposited material. Herein, the complexity of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) electrodeposition on indium tin oxide (ITO) is unravelled  operando  and at a single entity NP level by optical microscopy correlated to  ex situ  SEM imaging. Our correlative approach allows differentiating the dynamics of formation of two different NP populations, metallic Ni and Ni(OH)  2  with a &lt;25nm limit of detection (l.o.d.), their formation being ruled by the competition between Ni  2+  and water reduction. At the single NP level this results from a self&#8208;terminated growth, an information which is most often hidden in ensemble averaged measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbene Catalysis for the Synthesis of Aliphatic and &#945;&#8208;Amino Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;electron  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has gained attention recently for the synthesis of C&#8211;C bonds. Guided by density functional theory and mechanistic analyses, we report the tunability of these NHC single&#8208;electron operators. Computational and experimental results reveal that the reactivity of the key radical intermediate is substrate&#8208;dependent and can be modulated through steric and electronic parameters of the NHC. Catalyst tunability is harnessed in the visible&#8208;light driven generation of an acyl azolium radical species that undergoes selective coupling with various radical partners to afford diverse ketone products. This methodology is showcased in the direct late&#8208;stage functionalization of amino acids and pharmaceutical compounds, highlighting the utility of these tunable single&#8208;electron NHC operators.</dc:description>

         <title>KIO4&#8208;mediated selective hydroxymethylation /methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes: a greener approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a KIO  4  &#8208;mediated, sustainable and chemoselective approach for the one&#8208;pot C3(  sp  2  )&#8208;H bond hydroxymethylation or methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes with formaldehyde, generated  in situ  via the oxidative cleavage of ethylene glycol or glycerol (renewable reagents) through the Malaprade reaction. In the presence of ethylene glycol, a series of 3&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes was obtained in good to excellent yields. These compounds are important intermediates to access pharmaceutical drugs,  e.g.,  Zolpidem. Furthermore, by using glycerol, bis(imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methane derivatives were selectively obtained in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Marriage of high throughput synthesis and high throughput protein crystallography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;ligand crystallography is widely used to drive advanced stages of drug optimization or to generate starting points for medicinal chemistry by fragment soaking. However, recent progress in protein crystallography could allow for a more integrated role of protein crystallography into the early drug discovery cycle. Here we demonstrate for the first time the interplay of high throughput synthesis and high throughput crystallography. For this we describe a practical multicomponent reaction approach to high diversity acrylamides and esters from diverse building blocks. Surprisingly, in the majority of acrylamides precipitation during the reaction was observed, making library synthesis on a mmol scale and a 96&#8208;well format particularly comfortable. The synthesis is also suitable for a high throughput nanoscale format in a highly automated fashion. Moreover, we exemplified the synthesis on a multigram scale featuring good yield and simple work&#8208;up. High throughput crystallography of our libraires yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in a time efficient manner. Our results demonstrate, that the marriage of  in situ  HT synthesis of (covalent) libraires and HT crystallography has the potential to accelerate hit finding and to provide meaningful strategies for medicinal chemistry projects.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;cleavable linkers for protein chemical synthesis through solid&#8208;phase ligations.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of long proteins requires the assembly of multiple fragments through successive ligations. The need for intermediate purifications is a strong limitation, as this generally leads to low to very low overall yields. An early&#8208;recognized solution to this problem is the assembly of the protein on a solid support, but no mature solid&#8208;supported chemical ligation (SPCL) technology has yet emerged. One of the main reasons lies in the difficulty to immobilize a first peptide segment on a SPCL&#8208;compatible solid support through a linker that can be cleaved under very mild conditions to release the assembled protein. A wide range of SPCL linkers have been developed but their cleavage requires chemical conditions sometimes incompatible with sensitive protein targets. Here, we describe the exploration of an alternative enzymatic approach in order to trigger cleavage under extremely mild and selective conditions. Optimization of the linker structure and use of a small enzyme able to diffuse into the solid support was a key for the success of the strategy. We demonstrated its utility by the native chemical ligation&#8208;based assembly of three peptide segments to afford a 15 kDa polypeptide.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Magnetic Fields on Electrochemical Reactions of Redox Cofactor Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox cofactors mediate many enzymatic processes and are increasingly employed in biomedical and energy applications. Exploring the influence of external magnetic fields on redox cofactor chemistry can enhance our understanding on magnetic field&#8208;sensitive biological processes and allow the application of magnetic fields to modulate redox reactions involving cofactors. Through a combination of experiments and modeling, we investigate the influence of magnetic fields on electrochemical reactions in redox cofactor solutions. By employing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor as a model system, we characterize magnetically induced changes in Faradaic currents. We find that radical pair intermediates have negligible influence on current increases in FMN solution upon application of a magnetic field. The dominant mechanism underlying the observed current increases is the magneto&#8208;hydrodynamic effect. We extend our analyses to other diffusion&#8208;limited electrochemical reactions of redox cofactor solutions and arrive at similar conclusions, highlighting the opportunity to use this framework in redox cofactor chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3,2,4&#8208;Diazadiboretidine, an isoelectronic heteroanalog of cyclobutadiene, is an interesting chemical species in terms of comparison with the carbon system, whereas its properties have never been investigated experimentally. According to Baird&#8217;s rule,&#160;H&#252;ckel antiaromatic&#160;cyclobutadiene acquires aromaticity in the lowest triplet state. Here we report experimental and theoretical studies on the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state&#160;antiaromaticity/aromaticity as well as the photophysical properties of an isolable 1,3,2,4&#8208;diazadiboretidine derivative. The crystal structure of the diazadiboretidine derivative revealed that the B  2  N  2&#160;  ring adopts a planar rhombic geometry in the ground state. Yet, theoretical calculations showed that the B  2  N  2&#160;  ring turns to a square geometry with a nonaromatic character in the lowest triplet state. Notably, the diazadiboretidine derivative has the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels and displays blue phosphorescence. The finding of these peculiar photophysical properties for the element&#8208;substituted cyclobutadiene provides new design guidelines for photofunctional materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The surging development of bioorthogonal chemistry has profoundly transformed chemical biology over the last two decades. Involving chemical partners that specifically react together in highly complex biological fluids, this branch of chemistry now allows researchers to probe biomolecules in their natural habitat through metabolic labelling technologies. Chemical reporter strategies include metabolic glycan labelling, site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids in proteins, or nucleic acid postsynthetic labelling. While a majority of literature reports marks cell&#8208;surface exposed targets, implementing bioorthogonal ligations in the interior of cells constitutes a more challenging task. Owing to limiting factors such as reagent membrane permeability, fluorescence background due to hydrophobic interactions and off&#8208;target covalent binding, or perfectible kinetics/stability balances, these strategies need mindful planning to achieve success. In this review, we emphasize the hurdles encountered when targeting biomolecules localized in cell organelles, and wish to give an easily&#8208;accessible summary of the strategies at hand for imaging intracellular targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Synergistically Enhanced Hyperpolarizability: Chiral Coordination Polymers with Nonpolar Structures Exhibiting Unusually Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four chiral coordination polymers (CPs), M[(  S  ,  S  )&#8208;C  14  H  14  N  2  O  6  ] and M[(  R  ,  R  )&#8208;C  14  H  14  N  2  O  6  ] (M = Zn or Cd), have been exclusively synthesized in high yields with the aid of newly designed chiral ligand under hydrothermal condition. The CPs crystallizing in the orthorhombic nonpolar space group,  C  222  1  , reveal three&#8208;dimensional framework structures composed of MO  4  tetrahedra and the corresponding homochiral linkers. Powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) measurements indicate that the nonpolar CPs reveal very strong SHG efficiency of  ca.  5&#8211;9 times that of KH  2  PO  4  and exhibit type&#8208;I phase&#8208;matching behavior. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the unusually large SHG efficiency found from the nonpolar CPs should be attributable to the synergistic effect of polarizable metal cations and enhanced hyperpolarizability in the donor&#8211;acceptor system originating from the hydrogen bonding in the coordinated linkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Bulk Morphology in Efficient Donor&#8211;Acceptor Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of photoactive materials, the morphology of donor:acceptor (D:A) photovoltaic films can be effectively adjusted. A large D:A ESP difference is required to assist charge generation, but too large ESP difference may result in additional nonradiative recombination loss and lead to hypermiscibility issues.







Abstract
Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a key role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thus determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology&#8208;performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. Herein, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. We show that the molecular orientation at the D&#8208;A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. Enhancing the D&#8208;A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Fine&#8208;tuning the bulk morphology can give balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells.

         <title>Chirality Transfer from an Innately Chiral Nanocrystal Core to a Nematic Liquid Crystal: Surface&#8208;Modified Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), neat or surface&#8208;modified with mesogenic motifs, transmit their inherent structural and morphological chirality to an achiral nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208;LC) elastic medium with a helical twisting power rivaling the most potent organic chiral dopants. The helical pitch, p, of the induced chiral N*&#8208;LC phase is tightened even when CNCs are decorated with achiral molecules bearing structural resemblance to the N&#8208;LC host.







Abstract
The vast majority of nanomaterials studied in light of their ability to transmit chirality to or amplify their chirality in a surrounding medium, constitute an achiral core with chirality solely installed at the surface by conjugation or encapsulation with optically active ligands. Here we present the inverse approach focusing on surface&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with core chirality at both the molecular and the morphological level to quantify transmission and amplification of core chirality through space using a host nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208;LC) as reporter. We find that CNCs functionalized at the surface with achiral molecules, structurally related to the N&#8208;LC, exhibit better N&#8208;LC solubility, thereby serving as highly efficient chiral inducers. Moreover, functionalization with chiral molecules only marginally enhances the efficacy of helical distortion in the host N&#8208;LC matrix, indicating the high propensity of CNCs to transfer chirality from an inherently chiral core.

         <title>Purification of Propylene and Ethylene by a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Mediated by Host&#8211;Guest Interactions</title>

A comprehensive understanding of the host&#8211;guest chemistry of MFM&#8208;520 at a molecular level rationalises the observed high selectivity towards olefins, and informs future designs of improved materials for challenging olefin/paraffin separations in industry.







Abstract
Industrial purification of propylene and ethylene requires cryogenic distillation and selective hydrogenation over palladium catalysts to remove propane, ethane and/or trace amounts of acetylene. Here, we report the excellent separation of equimolar mixtures of propylene/propane and ethylene/ethane, and of a 1/100 mixture of acetylene/ethylene by a highly robust microporous material, MFM&#8208;520, under dynamic conditions. In situ synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and analysis of adsorption thermodynamic parameters reveal that a series of synergistic host&#8211;guest interactions involving hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions underpin the cooperative binding of alkenes within the pore. Notably, the optimal pore geometry of the material enables selective accommodation of acetylene. The practical potential of this porous material has been demonstrated by fabricating mixed&#8208;matrix membranes comprising MFM&#8208;520, Matrimid and PIM&#8208;1, and these exhibit not only a high permeability for propylene (&#8776;1984 Barrer), but also a separation factor of 7.8 for an equimolar mixture of propylene/propane at 298&#8197;K.

         <title>A Divergent Strategy for Site&#8208;Selective Radical Disulfuration of Carboxylic Acids with Trisulfide&#8208;1,1&#8208;Dioxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trisulfide&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxides undergo rapid homolytic substitution with alkyl radicals. This has enabled the development of an oxidative photocatalytic approach for the direct conversion of carboxylic acids into disulfides as well as a related approach for the installation of a disulfide moiety by remote C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
The direct conversion of carboxylic acids into disulfides is described. The approach employs oxidative photocatalysis for base&#8208;promoted decarboxylation of the substrate, which yields an alkyl radical that reacts with a trisulfide dioxide through homolytic substitution. The trisulfide dioxides are easily prepared by a newly described approach. 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176; carboxylic acids with varied substitution are good substrates, including amino acids and substrates with highly activated C&#8722;H bonds. Trisulfide dioxides are also used to achieve the &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H disulfuration of amides through a radical relay sequence. In both reactions, the sulfonyl radical that results from substitution propagates the reaction. Factors governing the selectivity of substitution at S2 versus S3 of the trisulfide dioxides have been explored.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Bis(tricyanoborane)imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate Anion&#8212;A Ditopic Dianionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedentedly stable salts of the 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolate ion with different types of counterions were obtained on large scale. Deprotonation of the imidazolate ion provided access to the corresponding dianionic NHC that acts as ditopic ligand.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolate anion 1 was obtained in high yield from lithium imidazolate and B(CN)3&#8722;pyridine adduct. Anion 1 is chemically very robust and thus allowed the isolation of the corresponding H5O2+ salt. Furthermore, monoanion 1 served as starting species for the novel dianionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion 3 that acts as ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups at boron. First reactions of this new NHC 3 with methyl iodide, elemental selenium, and [Ni(CO)4] led to the methylated imidazolate ion 4, the dianionic selenium adduct 5, and the dianionic nickel tricarbonyl complex 6. These NHC derivatives provide a first insight into the electronic and steric properties of the dianionic NHC 3. Especially the combination of properties, such as double negative charge, different coordination sites, large buried volume and good &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability, make NHC 3 a unique and promising ligand and building block.

         <title>Can Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Work at Sub&#8208;Zero Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;temperature performances of zinc&#8211;air batteries are systematically investigated from both theoretical and experimental aspects in terms of feasibility verification, bottleneck analysis, and promotion strategies.







Abstract
Efficient energy storage at low temperatures starves for competent battery techniques. Herein, inherent advantages of zinc&#8211;air batteries on low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage are discovered. The electrode reactions are resistive against low temperatures to render feasible working zinc&#8211;air batteries under sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The relatively reduced ionic conductivity of electrolyte is identified as the main limiting factor, which can be addressed by employing a CsOH&#8208;based electrolyte through regulating the solvation structures. Accordingly, 500&#8197;cycles with a stable voltage gap of 0.8&#8197;V at 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. This work reveals the promising potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries for low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage and inspires advanced battery systems under extreme working conditions.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Manginoids&#8197;A and&#8197;C and Guignardones&#8197;A and&#8197;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total syntheses of fungal meroterpenoids, manginoids&#8197;A and C, as well as guignardones&#8197;A and C, are accomplished. This divergent and bioinspired synthetic strategy involves a Csp3&#8722;Csp2 Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of vinyl bromide, silica&#8208;gel&#8208;promoted semipinacol rearrangement, and oxidative 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl radical&#8208;initiated cyclization.







Abstract
An enantioselective synthetic approach for preparing manginoids and guignardones, two types of biogenetically related meroterpenoids, is reported. This bioinspired and divergent synthesis employs an oxidative 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl radical&#8208;initiated cyclization and cyclodehydration of the common precursor to forge the central ring of the manginoids and guignardones, respectively, at a late stage. Key synthetic steps include silica&#8208;gel&#8208;promoted semipinacol rearrangement to form the 6&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton and the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction of vinyl bromide to achieve fragment coupling. This synthesis protocol enables the asymmetric syntheses of four fungal meroterpenoids from commercially available materials.

         <title>Direct and Enantioselective Aldol Reactions Catalyzed by Chiral Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appropriate and simultaneous activation of robust and easily to handle [Tol&#8208;BINAP]NiCl2 and aromatic aldehydes with TIPSOTf orchestrates a direct, asymmetric, and catalytic aldol reaction of a wide array of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazinane&#8208;2&#8208;thiones. This method enables the corresponding TIPS&#8208;protected anti aldol adducts to be obtained in a highly efficient and atom economical manner.







Abstract
A direct and asymmetric aldol reaction of N&#8208;acyl thiazinanethiones with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel(II) complexes is reported. The reaction gives the corresponding O&#8208;TIPS&#8208;protected anti&#8208;aldol adducts in high yields and with remarkable stereocontrol and atom economy. Furthermore, the straightforward removal of the achiral scaffold provides enantiomerically pure intermediates of synthetic interest, which involve precursors for anti&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy carboxylic derivatives. Theoretical calculations explain the observed high stereocontrol.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Acid&#8208;Assisted Hydrogenation of Oximes to Hydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) complexes are found to be efficient catalysts for homogeneous oxime hydrogenation to hydroxylamine products. Only if equipped with an aryl&#8208;imine ligand and operating under strong acidic conditions. Remarkably they do not hydrogenolyse the fragile N&#8722;O bond. Experimental evidence suggests an unusual acid&#8208;assisted ionic hydrogenation mechanism which may be applicable to the reduction of other challenging substrates.







Abstract
We found that cyclometalated cyclopentadienyl iridium(III) complexes are uniquely efficient catalysts in homogeneous hydrogenation of oximes to hydroxylamine products. A stable iridium C,N&#8208;chelation is crucial, with alkoxy&#8208;substituted aryl ketimine ligands providing the best catalytic performance. Several Ir&#8208;complexes were mapped by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis in order to collect steric parameters that might guide a rational design of even more active catalysts. A broad range of oximes and oxime ethers were activated with stoichiometric amounts of methanesulfonic acid and reduced at room temperature, remarkably without cleavage of the fragile N&#8722;O bond. The exquisite functional group compatibility of our hydrogenation system was further demonstrated by additive tests. Experimental mechanistic investigations support an ionic hydrogenation platform, and suggest a role for the Br&#248;nsted acid beyond a proton source. Our studies provide deep understanding of this novel acidic hydrogenation and may facilitate its improvement and application to other challenging substrates.

         <title>General Synthesis of Ordered Mesoporous Carbonaceous Hybrid Nanostructures with Molecularly Dispersed Polyoxometallates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy is developed for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores, which exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol.







Abstract
Hybrid nanomaterials with controlled dimensions, intriguing components and ordered structures have attracted significant attention in nanoscience and technology. Herein, we report a facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores. By using various polyoxometallates such as ammonium phosphomolybdate, silicotungstic acid, and phosphotungstic acid, our approach can be generalized to synthesize ordered mesoporous hybrid nanostructures with diverse compositions and morphologies (nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical architectures, nanospheres, and nanorods). Moreover, the ordered mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical hybrids with molecularly dispersed POMs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol with the high isobutene selectivity (100&#8201;%) and long&#8208;term catalytic durability (80&#8197;h).

         <title>Large Telluroxane Bowls Connected by a Layer of Iodine Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large telluroxane clusters are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI3]2 or the oxidation of [PhTe]2 with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. They consist of two half&#8208;spheres with {(PhTe)19O24}9+ networks, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The central {PhTe}3+ units of each half&#8208;sphere can be replaced by other metal ions. Mass spectrometry shows that the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.







Abstract
Phenyltelluroxane clusters of the composition [{(PhTe)19O24}2I18(solv)] (1) are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI3]2 or the oxidation of various phenyltellurium(II) compounds with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. The compounds consist of two half&#8208;spheres with a {(PhTe)19O24}9+ network, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The spherical clusters can accommodate solvent molecules such as pyridine or methanol in the center of two rings formed by iodine atoms. The presence of other metal ions during the cluster formation results in a selective replacement of the central {PhTe}3+ units of each half&#8208;sphere as has been demonstrated with the isolation of [{(PhTe)18({Ca(H2O)2}O24}2I16] (2) and [{(PhTe)18({Y(NO3)(H2O)}O24}2I16] (3). A crownether&#8208;like coordination by six oxygen atoms of the telluroxane network is found for the {Ca(H2O}2}2+ and {Y(NO3)(H2O)}2+ building blocks. Mass spectrometric studies show that considerable amounts of the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.

         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;valence compounds were investigated as novel polarizing agents for DNP NMR. These compounds constitute a group of molecules in which molecular mobility persists even in solids. Consequently, they can be used to perform Overhauser&#8208;DNP NMR experiments in solid state, and they specifically show favorable properties for applications at ultra&#8208;high magnetic fields (DNP=dynamic nuclear polarization, NMR=nuclear magnetic resonance).







Abstract

Mixed&#8208;valence compounds constitute a group of molecules in which molecular mobility persists even in solids.

         <title>Atomic Sulfur Filling Oxygen Vacancies Optimizes H Absorption and Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14117-14123, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;atom doping of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 results in the occupation of the oxygen vacancies. S sites in the S&#8208;NiFe2O4 likely adsorb H adatoms and form S&#8208;H* in situ, which boosts the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that the lowered energy barrier for H2O dissociation induced by S doping is the key reason for the remarkable HER performance.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) usually has sluggish kinetics in alkaline solution due to the difficulty in forming binding protons. Herein we report an electrocatalyst in which sulfur atoms are doping in the oxygen vacancies (VO) of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 (S&#8208;NiFe2O4) to create active sites with enhanced electron transfer capability. This electrocatalyst has an ultralow overpotential of 61&#8197;mV at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability of 60&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;Acm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KOH media. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that S sites adsorb hydrogen adatom (H*) and in situ form S&#8208;H*, which favor the production of hydrogen and boosts HER in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that S introduction lowered the energy barrier of H2O dissociation. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed S atoms are active sites of the S&#8208;NiFe2O4.

         <title>Kinetic Microscale Thermophoresis for Simultaneous Measurement of Binding Affinity and Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13988-13995, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extension of microscale thermophoresis (MST) to perform temperature jumps by increasing the heat dissipation of the sample allows for quantification of binding affinities together with the kinetic rates. Relaxation kinetics for DNA hybridization were measured with high fidelity at different temperatures and various experimental conditions. The results shed light on the hybridization mechanism of DNA and confirmed determinants of DNA binding.







Abstract
Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a versatile technique to measure binding affinities of binder&#8211;ligand systems, based on the directional movement of molecules in a temperature gradient. We extended MST to measure binding kinetics as well as binding affinity in a single experiment by increasing the thermal dissipation of the sample. The kinetic relaxation fingerprints were derived from the fluorescence changes during thermodynamic re&#8208;equilibration of the sample after local heating. Using this method, we measured DNA hybridization on&#8208;rates and off&#8208;rates in the range 104&#8211;106&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 10&#8722;4&#8211;10&#8722;1&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively. We observed the expected exponential dependence of the DNA hybridization off&#8208;rates on salt concentration, strand length and inverse temperature. The measured on&#8208;rates showed a linear dependence on salt concentration and weak dependence on strand length and temperature. For biomolecular interactions with large enthalpic contributions, the kinetic MST technique offers a robust, cost&#8208;effective and immobilization&#8208;free determination of kinetic rates and binding affinity simultaneously, even in crowded solutions.

Abstract
A dual modulation strategy of consecutive nucleation and confined growth of Li metal is proposed by using the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derivative hollow capsule with inbuilt lithiophilic Au or Co&#8208;O nanoparticle (NP) seeds as heterogeneous host. The seeding&#8208;induced nucleation enables the negligible overpotential and promotes the inward injection of Li mass into the abundant cavities in host, followed by the conformal plating of Li on the outer surface of host during discharging. This modulation alleviates the dendrite growth and volume expansion of Li plating. The interconnected porous host network enables enhancement of cycling and rate performances of Li metal (a lifespan over 1200&#8197;h for Au&#8208;seeding symmetric cells, and an endurance of 220&#8197;cycles under an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for corresponding asymmetric cells). The hollow capsules integrated with lithiophilic seeds solve the deformation problem of Li metal for durable and long&#8208;life Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Single&#8208;Photon Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Responsiveness from the Molecular to the Supramolecular Level via Platination of Pentacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14076-14082, June 14, 2021. </description>

Single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems have been constructed on the basis of &#963;&#8208;platinated pentacenes, which display high photo&#8208;oxygenation efficiency from the molecular to the supramolecular level.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) responsiveness is important for various applications. Currently, single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems are rare compared to systems that display two&#8208;photon absorption and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation processes. Supramolecular stacking of photo&#8208;responsive chromophores results in decreased efficiency due to space&#8208;confinement effects. Herein we show that &#963;&#8208;platination of pentacenes is a feasible protocol to build single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems, with advantages including a low HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, high photochemical efficiency, and pathway specificity. The pentacene&#8208;to&#8208;endoperoxidation transformation is accompanied by color and absorbance changes. The high photo&#8208;oxygenation efficiency of &#963;&#8208;platinated pentacenes facilitates NIR responsiveness in one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers, resulting in the disappearance of supramolecular chirality signals and disruption of self&#8208;assembled nanofibers. Overall, the &#963;&#8208;platination strategy opens up new avenues toward NIR photo&#8208;responsive materials at the molecular and supramolecular levels.

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Insights into C&#8722;S Bond Formation in Gliotoxin</title>

A combination of structural biology, mutagenesis, natural product isolation and activity assays provides insights into the formation of two carbon&#8722;sulfur bonds in the fungal virulence factor gliotoxin and related epipolythiodioxopiperazine natural products. The exceptional glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferase GliG uses an unusual bis&#8208;hydroxylated gliotoxin precursor and successively links two molecules of glutathione.







Abstract
Glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) usually detoxify xenobiotics. The human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus however uses the exceptional GST GliG to incorporate two sulfur atoms into its virulence factor gliotoxin. Because these sulfurs are essential for biological activity, glutathionylation is a key step of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, the mechanism of carbon&#8722;sulfur linkage formation from a bis&#8208;hydroxylated precursor is unresolved. Here, we report structures of GliG with glutathione (GSH) and its reaction product cyclo[&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Ser]&#8208;bis&#8208;glutathione, which has been purified from a genetically modified A. fumigatus strain. The structures argue for stepwise processing of first the Phe and second the Ser moiety. Enzyme&#8208;mediated dehydration of the substrate activates GSH and a helix dipole stabilizes the resulting anion via a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack. Activity assays with mutants validate the interactions of GliG with the ligands and enrich our knowledge about enzymatic C&#8722;S bond formation in gliotoxin and epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) natural compounds in general.

Acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimides (AABIs), nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrenes with two imide functionalities (see structure), were found to exhibit excellent electron affinity, affording an air&#8208;stable radical anion. The intrinsic electron mobility of one derivative obeyed a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device showed high electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimide (AABI), a nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrene with two imide functionalities. AABI exhibits excellent electron affinity as evident by its low&#8208;lying LUMO level (&#8722;4.1&#8197;eV vs. vacuum). Single&#8208;electron reduction of one AABI derivative afforded the corresponding radical anion, which was stable under ambient conditions. Photoconductivity measurements suggest that the intrinsic electron mobility of an N&#8208;phenethyl AABI derivative obeys a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, an electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was attained with the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) device. The vacuum&#8208;deposited OFET device consisting of a polycrystalline sample exhibited high electron mobility of up to 0.27&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 even in air. This study demonstrates that dual incorporation of both imide substituents and imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms is an effective strategy to create novel electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;systems.

&lt;p&gt;Acridino[2,1,9,8-&lt;i&gt;klmna&lt;/i&gt;]acridine bisimides (AABIs), nitrogen-doped anthanthrenes with two imide functionalities (see structure), were found to exhibit excellent electron affinity, affording an air-stable radical anion. The intrinsic electron mobility of one derivative obeyed a band-transport model. Accordingly, the corresponding single-crystal organic field-effect transistor device showed high electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis and properties of acridino[2,1,9,8-&lt;i&gt;klmna&lt;/i&gt;]acridine bisimide (AABI), a nitrogen-doped anthanthrene with two imide functionalities. AABI exhibits excellent electron affinity as evident by its low-lying LUMO level (&#8722;4.1&#8197;eV vs. vacuum). Single-electron reduction of one AABI derivative afforded the corresponding radical anion, which was stable under ambient conditions. Photoconductivity measurements suggest that the intrinsic electron mobility of an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-phenethyl AABI derivative obeys a band-transport model. Accordingly, an electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was attained with the corresponding single-crystal organic field-effect transistor (OFET) device. The vacuum-deposited OFET device consisting of a polycrystalline sample exhibited high electron mobility of up to 0.27&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; even in air. This study demonstrates that dual incorporation of both imide substituents and imine-type nitrogen atoms is an effective strategy to create novel electron-deficient &#960;-systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reduced Arene Complexes of Hafnium Supported by a Triamidoamine Ligand</title>

A reduced anthracene complex of hafnium(IV) reacts with two equivalents of benzonitrile to form the hafnium&#8208;bis(iminyl) as the kinetic product that expulses one equivalent of benzonitrile to give an imido complex.







Abstract
A series of hafnium complexes with a reduced arene of the general formula [K(L)][Hf(Xy&#8208;N3N)(arene)] (Xy&#8208;N3N={(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8722;, L=THF, 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; arene=C10H82&#8722;, C14H102&#8722;) mimic the chemistry of hafnium in its formal oxidation state +II. All compounds were obtained upon reduction of the chlorido complex [HfCl(Xy&#8208;N3N)(thf)] with two equivalents of potassium naphthalenide or anthracenide. The reducing nature and the basicity of the reduced anthracene ligand were explored in the reaction of benzonitrile and azobenzene, and by deprotonation of tert&#8208;butylacetylene, respectively. The reduction of benzonitrile provides an initial double nitrile insertion product under kinetic control that rearranges after extrusion of one of the inserted nitriles to a hafnium imido complex as the thermodynamic product. The reduction of azobenzene resulted in a diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex. Treatment of terminal alkynes with the anthracene or diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex led to the selective protonation of the corresponding dianionic ligand.

         <title>A Ratiometric Fluorescent Biosensor Reveals Dynamic Regulation of Long&#8208;Chain Fatty Acyl&#8208;CoA Esters Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13996-14004, June 14, 2021. </description>

LACSer, a genetically encoded long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA fluorescence sensor, generates a specific fluorescence response to long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA, and can be used for the ratiometric quantification of long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA in cells and subcellular structures. The effects of ACSL and ACBP on the biosynthesis, transport, and downstream metabolism of long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA can be studied.







Abstract
Despite increasing awareness of the biological impacts of long&#8208;chain fatty acyl&#8208;CoA esters (LCACoAs), our knowledge about the subcellular distribution and regulatory functions of these acyl&#8208;CoA molecules is limited by a lack of methods for detecting LCACoAs in living cells. Here, we report development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that enables ratiometric quantification of LCACoAs in living cells and subcellular compartments. We demonstrate how this FadR&#8208;cpYFP fusion &#8220;LACSer sensor&#8221; undergoes LCACoA&#8208;induced conformational changes reflected in easily detectable fluorescence responses, and show proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for real&#8208;time monitoring of LCACoAs in human cells. Subsequently, we applied LACSer in scientific studies investigating how disruption of ACSL enzymes differentially reduces cytosolic and mitochondrial LCACoA levels, and show how genetic disruption of an acyl&#8208;CoA binding protein (ACBP) alters mitochondrial accumulation of LCACoAs.

Binding an organocatalyst inside a cucurbituril molecular host can reversibly up&#8208; or downregulate catalytic activity, which is demonstrated in temporal control over the rate of a range of organocatalyzed transformations.







Abstract
Dynamic regulation of chemical reactivity is important in many complex chemical reaction networks, such as cascade reactions and signal transduction processes. Signal responsive catalysts could play a crucial role in regulating these reaction pathways. Recently, supramolecular encapsulation was reported to regulate the activities of artificial catalysts. We present a host&#8208;guest chemistry strategy to modulate the activity of commercially available synthetic organocatalysts. The molecular container cucurbit[7]uril was successfully applied to change the activity of four different organocatalysts and one initiator, enabling up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of the reaction rates of four different classes of chemical reactions. In most cases CB[7] encapsulation results in catalyst inhibition, however in one case catalyst activation by binding to CB[7] was observed. The mechanism behind this unexpected behavior was explored by NMR binding studies and pKa measurements. The catalytic activity can be instantaneously switched during operation, by addition of either supramolecular host or competitive binding molecules, and the reaction rate can be predicted with a kinetic model. Overall, this signal responsive system proves a promising tool to control catalytic activity.

         <title>Transformable Nanosensitizer with Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Sonodynamic Process and Calcium Release for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

TiO2@CaP nanosonosensitizer promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS). In an acidic tumor microenvironment, the CaP shell releases Ca2+ under ultrasound. The cascade process induces mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced immunogenic cell death to boost T cells recruitment and infiltration into the cold tumor, leading to regression of the primary tumor, non&#8208;treated distant tumors, and inhibition of lung metastasis when in conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy.







Abstract
Despite the promise of sonodynamic processes in cancer therapy, existing sonosensitizers often fail to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) against tumors, potentially leading to off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. We report a transformable core&#8208;shell nanosonosensitizer (TiO2@CaP) that reinvigorates ROS generation and dissolves its CaP shell to release Ca2+ in an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) under ultrasound activation. Thus, TiO2@CaP acts as a smart nanosonosensitizer that specifically induces mitochondrial dysfunction via overloading intracellular Ca2+ ions to synergize with the sonodynamic process in the TME. TiO2@CaP substantially enhances immunogenic cell death, resulting in enhanced T&#8208;cell recruitment and infiltration into the immunogenic cold tumor (4T1). In conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy (anti&#8208;PD 1), TiO2@CaP&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy elicits systemic antitumor immunity, leading to regression of non&#8208;treated distant tumors and inhibition of lung metastasis. This work paves the way to development of &#8220;smart&#8221; TME&#8208;activatable sonosensitizers with temporospatial control over antitumor responses.

In conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy (anti-PD 1), TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@CaP-mediated sonodynamic therapy elicits systemic antitumor immunity, leading to regression of non-treated distant tumors and inhibition of lung metastasis. This work paves the way to development of &#8220;smart&#8221; TME-activatable sonosensitizers with temporospatial control over antitumor responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin has dramatic consequences on the solution behaviour of molybdates. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis (SAXS) reveals the formation of large nanoscopic Mo&#8208;based oligomers that give rise to the fast formation of supramolecular core&#8211;shell type systems. This behaviour has been attributed to the chaotropic effect able to amplify very weak supramolecular interaction and then generates sophisticated non&#8208;covalent hierarchical assemblies.







Abstract
Herein, we show how the chaotropic effect arising from reduced molybdate ions in acidified aqueous solution is able to amplify drastically weak supramolecular interactions. Time&#8208;resolved Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) analysis suggests that molybdenum&#8208;blue oligomeric species form huge aggregates in the presence of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) which results in the fast formation of nanoscopic {Mo154}&#8208;based host&#8208;guest species, while X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the ending&#8208;point of the scenario results in an unprecedented three&#8208;component well&#8208;ordered core&#8211;shell&#8208;like motif. A similar arrangement was found by using preformed hexarhenium chalcogenide&#8208;type cluster [Re6Te8(CN)6]4&#8722; as exogenous guest. This seminal work brings better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly processes in general and gives new opportunities for practical applications in the design of complex multicomponent materials via the simplicity of the non&#8208;covalent chemistry.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Crystalline Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Thin Films</title>

An unconventional ZIF&#8208;67 colloidal dispersion consisting of amorphous nanoparticles has been discovered, which was used as precursors to yield uniform films that deposited onto a number of substrates by a facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective spray&#8208;coating approach, enabling fabrication of large&#8208;area ZIF&#8208;67 thin films with highly controlled thickness. This method can be extended to fabricate ZIF&#8208;8 thin film.







Abstract
We report that continuous MOF films with highly controlled thickness (from 44 to 5100&#8197;nm) can be deposited over length scales greater than 80&#8197;centimeters by a facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective spray&#8208;coating method. Such success relies on our discovery of unprecedented perfectly dispersed colloidal solutions consisting of amorphous MOF nanoparticles, which we adopted as precursors that readily converted to the crystalline films upon low&#8208;temperature in situ heating. The colloidal solutions allow for the fabrication of compact and uniform MOF films on a great deal of substrates such as fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide, glass, SiO2, Al2O3, Si, Cu, and even flexible polycarbonate, widening their technological applications where substrates are essential. Despite the present work focuses on the fabrication of uniform cobalt&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)2 and zinc&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)2 films, our findings mark a great possibility in producing other high&#8208;quality MOF thin films on a large scale.

         <title>Coating the Right Polymer: Achieving Ideal Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Particle Dispersibility in Polymer Matrixes Using a Coordinative Crosslinking Surface Modification Method</title>

A new general method for the coating of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surfaces with a uniform layer of polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, or polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#8208;1 (PIM&#8208;1) is reported. By matching the surface polymer with the matrix polymer, ideal dispersibility of MOF particles in various polymer matrices can thus be achieved.







Abstract
This work describes the first generalizable method to modify various metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surfaces with polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, and polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#8208;1 (PIM&#8208;1). The method first utilizes electrostatic adsorption to rapidly decorate positively charged MOF surfaces with a layer of negatively charged metal&#8208;organic nanocapsule, PgC5Cu. After mixing with the polymer, the copper open metal sites on PgC5Cu can coordinatively crosslink the polar functional groups on the surface polymer upon thermal activation thereby resulting in the immobilization of a uniform sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm polymer coating. We quantitatively analyzed the distribution of free path spacing between MOF particles and demonstrated that when the surface polymer matches the matrix polymer, the MOF dispersion was not only visually improved but also found to align perfectly with a theoretically predicted ideal dispersion model where no aggregation driving force was present.

A three&#8208;step method produces COF aerogel monoliths, based on sol&#8211;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying. 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The aerogels have extremely low densities, high porosity, and mechanically behave as elastic or plastic materials under different strain. They show excellent absorption capacity with high removal efficiency.







Abstract
The use of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in practical applications demands shaping them into macroscopic objects, which remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple three&#8208;step method to produce COF aerogels, based on sol&#8208;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying, in which 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The resultant COF aerogel monoliths have extremely low densities (ca. 0.02&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3), high porosity (total porosity values of ca. 99&#8201;%), and mechanically behave as elastic materials under a moderate strain (&lt;25&#8211;35&#8201;%) but become plastic under greater strain. Moreover, these COF aerogels maintain the micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porosity of their constituent COFs, and show excellent absorption capacity (e.g. toluene uptake: 32&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1), with high removal efficiency (ca. 99&#8201;%). The same three&#8208;step method can be used to create functional composites of these COF aerogels with nanomaterials.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Palladium(II) Barrel for Binding of Fullerenes and Photosensitization Ability of the Fullerene&#8208;Encapsulated Barrel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14109-14116, June 14, 2021. </description>

A 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;based tetra&#8208;imidazole ligand and a PdII acceptor were employed to construct a trifacial molecular barrel (1), which acts as an efficient host for fullerenes. The barrel has better binding affinity towards C70 over C60 and predominantly encapsulates C70 from a mixture of C60/C70. In the presence of visible light, C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 show efficient photosensitizing ability for 1O2 generation.







Abstract
Fullerene extracts obtained from fullerene soot lack their real application due to their poor solubility in common solvents and difficulty in purification. Encapsulation of these extracts in a suitable host is an important approach to address these issues. We present a new Pd6 barrel (1), which is composed of three 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole panels, clipped through six cis&#8208;PdII acceptors. Large open windows and cavity make it an efficient host for a large guest. Favorable interactions between the ligand and fullerene (C60 and C70) allows the barrel to encapsulate fullerene efficiently. Thorough investigation reveals that barrel 1 has a stronger binding affinity towards C70 over C60, resulting in the predominant extraction of C70 from a mixture of the two. Finally, the fullerene encapsulated barrels C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 were found to be efficient for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced singlet oxygen generation. Such preferential binding of C70 and photosensitizing ability of C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 are noteworthy.

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Using a Hybrid Hypercrosslinked Polymer**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13978-13987, June 14, 2021. </description>

A hybrid hypercrosslinked polymer was prepared that is capable of encapsulating both organic and inorganic phase change materials via a novel homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous encapsulation strategy.







Abstract
In this work, an organic/inorganic hybrid polymer containing siloxyl functional groups was synthesized and applied to encapsulate phase change materials (PCMs). Owing to the mild conditions of the hypercrosslinking reaction, which only requires the addition of a catalytic amount of aqueous alkaline solution, both organic and inorganic PCMs are tolerated. It is noteworthy that the initial homogeneous state of the reaction mixture allowed the ultimate encapsulation rate of the PCMs and the uniform blending of the third nano&#8208;additives with the aim of thermal conductivity enhancement. Further study reveals that the presence of this hybrid hydrophobic polymer in a phase change composite endows the latter with a unique self&#8208;cleaning property. This novel PCM encapsulation protocol is suitable for nanoparticles including carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles, and inorganic oxide nanoparticles. A thermal conductivity enhancement of 600&#8201;% was achieved along with 93.7&#8201;% light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with a latent heat of 180&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1 without leakage.

         <title>Operando Cooperated Catalytic Mechanism of Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14005-14012, June 14, 2021. </description>

A dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom dispersed catalyst of Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 has been established for enhancing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Operando XANES combined with DFT calculation demonstrate that the Cu&#8722;N4 sites as active center experience the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8722;N4 during ORR process, and then turn to single&#8208;atom state again after reaction.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, the synergistic catalytic mechanism is not deeply understood. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalyst consisted of Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 on the N&#8208;doped carbon support (Cu/Zn&#8722;NC). It exhibits high&#8208;efficiency ORR activity with an Eonset of 0.98&#8197;V and an E1/2 of 0.83&#8197;V, excellent stability (no degradation after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles), surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and great mass of Pt&#8208;free single atom catalysts. Operando XANES demonstrates that the Cu&#8722;N4 as active center experiences the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8722;N4 during ORR process, and then turns to single atom state again after reaction. DFT calculation further indicates that the adjustment effect of Zn on the d&#8208;orbital electron distribution of Cu could benefit to the stretch and cleavage of O&#8208;O on Cu active center, speeding up the process of rate determining step of OOH*.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type Oxidation of Olefins at Room Temperature with 1,3&#8208;Diketones or Neocuproine as Ligands**

Various iron catalyst systems featuring a range of different ligands have been evaluated for the Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of olefins to ketones in the presence of phenylsilane at room temperature and ambient air. The transformation is operationally simple, sustainable, exhibits a high functional group tolerance, and is applicable to natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a convenient and general method for the oxidation of olefins to ketones using either tris(dibenzoylmethanato)iron(III) [Fe(dbm)3] or a combination of iron(II) chloride and neocuproine (2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) as catalysts and phenylsilane (PhSiH3) as additive. All reactions proceed efficiently at room temperature using air as sole oxidant. This transformation has been applied to a variety of substrates, is operationally simple, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and shows a high functional&#8208;group tolerance. The ketones are formed smoothly in up to 97&#8201;% yield and with 100&#8201;% regioselectivity, while the corresponding alcohols were observed as by&#8208;products. Labeling experiments showed that an incorporated hydrogen atom originates from the phenylsilane. The oxygen atom of the ketone as well as of the alcohol derives from the ambient atmosphere.

pH/enzyme&#8208;responsive nanoreservoirs are co&#8208;loaded with anticancer drugs and antibiotics for overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance. They can effectively inhibit tumor growth and remarkably activate the immune system in the presence of bacteria. This work presents a safe and efficacious method to reverse bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and convert the intratumoral bacteria from foes to friends for cancer therapy.







Abstract
The presence of bacteria in the tumor can cause cancer resistance to chemotherapeutics. To fight against bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance, herein we design self&#8208;traceable nanoreservoirs that are simultaneously loaded with gemcitabine (an anticancer drug) and ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic) and are decorated with hyaluronic acid for active tumor targeting. The nanoreservoirs have a pH&#8208;sensitive gate and an enzyme&#8208;responsive gate that can be opened in the acidic and hyaluronidase&#8208;abundant tumor microenvironment to control drug release rates. Moreover, the nanoreservoirs can specifically target the tumor regions without eliciting evident toxicity to normal tissues, kill the intratumoral bacteria, and inhibit the tumor growth even in the presence of the bacteria. Unexpectedly, the nanoreservoirs can activate T cell&#8208;mediated immune responses through promoting antigen&#8208;presenting dendritic cell maturation and depleting immunosuppressive myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells in bacterium&#8208;infected tumors.

&lt;p&gt;pH/enzyme-responsive nanoreservoirs are co-loaded with anticancer drugs and antibiotics for overcoming bacterium-induced drug resistance. They can effectively inhibit tumor growth and remarkably activate the immune system in the presence of bacteria. This work presents a safe and efficacious method to reverse bacterium-induced drug resistance and convert the intratumoral bacteria from foes to friends for cancer therapy.

         <title>Efficient Nitrogen Fixation to Ammonia through Integration of Plasma Oxidation with Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14131-14137, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step process, serially integrating non&#8208;thermal plasma technique for facile N2 to NOx&#8722; and electrocatalytic reduction for highly selective conversion of NOx&#8722; to NH3, is presented. A surface boron&#8208;rich nickel boride electrocatalyst was developed to boost the activity, selectivity, and stability for nitrate reduction to NH3 with nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and low overpotential.







Abstract
Present one&#8208;step N2 fixation is impeded by tough activation of the N&#8801;N bond and low selectivity to NH3. Here we report fixation of N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 can be decoupled to a two&#8208;step process with one problem effectively solved in each step, including: 1)&#8197;facile activation of N2 to NOx&#8722; by a non&#8208;thermal plasma technique, and 2)&#8197;highly selective conversion of NOx&#8722; to NH3 by electrocatalytic reduction. Importantly, this process uses air and water as low&#8208;cost raw materials for scalable ammonia production under ambient conditions. For NOx&#8722; reduction to NH3, we present a surface boron&#8208;rich core&#8211;shell nickel boride electrocatalyst. The surface boron&#8208;rich feature is the key to boosting activity, selectivity, and stability via enhanced NOx&#8722; adsorption, and suppression of hydrogen evolution and surface Ni oxidation. A significant ammonia production of 198.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved, together with nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency.

         <title>Alcohol Dehydrogenases and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Gold(I) Catalysts: Design of a Chemoenzymatic Cascade towards Optically Active &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13945-13951, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concurrent process involving a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (IPrAuNTf2) and an alcohol dehydrogenase is described for the first time. This cascade approach allows the development of a Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement for the transformation of racemic propargylic alcohols, mostly with good selectivities towards the corresponding E&#8208;allylic ketone intermediates, in aqueous medium, which are subsequently reduced to obtain the desired alcohol enantiomers with excellent optical purities.







Abstract
The combination of gold(I) and enzyme catalysis is used in a two&#8208;step approach, including Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement of a series of readily available propargylic alcohols followed by stereoselective bioreduction of the corresponding allylic ketone intermediates, to provide optically pure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted allylic alcohols. This cascade involves a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and an enzyme, demonstrating the compatibility of both catalyst types in aqueous medium under mild reaction conditions. The combination of [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene][bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf2) and a selective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH&#8208;A from Rhodococcus&#8197;ruber, KRED&#8208;P1&#8208;A12 or KRED&#8208;P3&#8208;G09) led to the synthesis of a series of optically active (E)&#8208;4&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ols in good yields (65&#8211;86&#8201;%). The approach was also extended to various 2&#8208;hetarylpent&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, hexynol, and butynol derivatives. The use of alcohol dehydrogenases of opposite selectivity led to the production of both allyl alcohol enantiomers (93&#8208;&gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) for a broad panel of substrates.

         <title>Rational Design of Multicolor&#8208;Emitting Chiral Carbonized Polymer Dots for Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

The synthesis of red&#8208; and multicolor&#8208;emitting chiral carbonized polymer dots (Ch&#8208;CPDs) is reported for the first time. The quantum yield of the Ch&#8208;CPDs is between 31&#8201;% and 54&#8201;%. Furthermore, these Ch&#8208;CPDs were combined with chiral gels through supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, thereby yielding their multicolor and white circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting chiral carbonized polymer dots (Ch&#8208;CPDs) are attracting great interest because of their extraordinary photonic properties, but modulating their band&#8208;gap emission, especially at long wavelength, and maintaining their chiral structure to achieve multicolor, high&#8208;emission Ch&#8208;CPDs remains challenging. Reported here for the first time is the synthesis of red&#8208; and multicolor&#8208;emitting Ch&#8208;CPDs using the common precursors L&#8208;/D&#8208;tryptophan and o&#8208;phenylenediamine, and a solvothermal approach at one temperature. The quantum yield of the Ch&#8208;CPDs was between 31&#8201;% and 54&#8201;%. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly provided multicolor&#8208;emitting Ch&#8208;CPDs showing novel circularly polarized luminescence, with the highest dissymmetric factor (glum) of 1&#215;10&#8722;2. Importantly, circularly polarized white&#8208;emitting CPDs were fabricated for the first time by tuning the mixing ratio of the three colored Ch&#8208;CPDs in a gel. This strategy affords exciting opportunities for designing functional chiroptical materials.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation of Alkenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14068-14075, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is presented for nickel&#8208; catalyzed asymmetric reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides react to produce oxindole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. Notably, synthesis of a range of bioactive pyrroloindolines was achieved.







Abstract

         <title>Generating Assembled MFI Nanocrystals with Reduced b&#8208;Axis through Structure&#8208;Directing Agent Exchange Induced Recrystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13959-13968, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned plate&#8208;shaped MFI crystals with reduced b&#8208;axis thickness were synthesized through homogeneous nucleation followed by structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) exchange induced recrystallization, using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH). The obtained materials markedly exaggerated propene selectivity and showed prolonged catalyst lifetime in the conversion of dimethyl ether&#8208;to&#8208;olefins.







Abstract
Controlling crystal size and shape of zeolitic materials is an effective way to promote their mass transport and catalytic properties. Herein, we report a single step, Na+&#8208; and porogen&#8208; free crystallization of MFI hierarchical architecture made up of aligned nanocrystals with reduced b&#8208;axis thickness (5&#8211;23&#8197;nm) and adjustable Si/Al ratios between 35 to 120, employing the commonly used tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) as structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs). Homogeneous nucleation driven by both SDAs and subsequent SDA&#8208;exchange induced dissolution&#8208;recrystallization are responsible for the formation of such structure. The enhanced textural and diffusion properties account for a notable exaggeration of propene selectivity and catalyst lifetime in dimethyl ether&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (DTO) conversion. This protocol is extendable to the rational synthesis of other hierarchical zeolites through crystallization process control.

         <title>The Hydrotropic Effect of Ionic Liquids in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolytes**
</title>

Ionic liquids boost the LiTFSI solubility in water from 21 to 60&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Excess lithium salt solubility arises from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. This approach improves particularly the reductive stability of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes, enabling stable cycling of commercially relevant LTO/NMC811 full cells.







Abstract
Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have successfully expanded the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes beyond 2&#8197;V. Further improvements in stability can be achieved by partially substituting water with either classical organic solvents or ionic liquids. Here, we study ternary electrolytes composed of LiTFSI, water, and imidazolium ionic liquids. We find that the LiTFSI solubility strongly increases from 21&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in water to up to 60&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in the presence of ionic liquid. The solution structure is investigated with Raman and NMR spectroscopy and the enhanced LiTFSI solubility is found to originate from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. The increased reductive stability of the ternary electrolytes enables stable cycling of an aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery with an energy density of 150&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 on the active material level based on commercially relevant Li4Ti5O12 and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 electrode materials.

         <title>Effect of the Ligand Backbone on the Reactivity and Mechanistic Paradigm of Non&#8208;Heme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo during Olefin Epoxidation</title>

The steric and electronic effects exerted by the bulky quinoline&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) in the non&#8208;heme complex [FeIV(2PyN2Q)(O)]2+ play a key role in olefin epoxidation by oxygen atom transfer and trigger mechanistic diversification. In the present study, the mechanism of olefin epoxidation was thoroughly investigated and rationalized with a detailed computational study.







Abstract
The oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactivity of the non&#8208;heme [FeIV(2PyN2Q)(O)]2+ (2) containing the sterically bulky quinoline&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) has been thoroughly studied with different olefins. The ferryl&#8208;oxo complex 2 shows excellent OAT reactivity during epoxidations. The steric encumbrance and electronic effect of the ligand influence the mechanistic shuttle between OAT pathway I and isomerization pathway II (during the reaction stereo pure olefins), resulting in a mixture of cis&#8208;trans epoxide products. In contrast, the sterically less hindered and electronically different [FeIV(N4Py)(O)]2+ (1) provides only cis&#8208;stilbene epoxide. A Hammett study suggests the role of dominant inductive electronic along with minor resonance effect during electron transfer from olefin to 2 in the rate&#8208;limiting step. Additionally, a computational study supports the involvement of stepwise pathways during olefin epoxidation. The ferryl bend due to the bulkier ligand incorporation leads to destabilization of both 
 and 
 orbitals, leading to a very small quintet&#8211;triplet gap and enhanced reactivity for 2 compared to 1. Thus, the present study unveils the role of steric and electronic effects of the ligand towards mechanistic modification during olefin epoxidation

         <title>Cooperation between a T&#8197;Domain and a Minimal C&#8208;Terminal Docking Domain to Enable Specific Assembly in a Multiprotein NRPS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14171-14178, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between two non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) proteins mediates the biosynthesis of PAX peptides and involves an extended docking interface, where a part of the thiolation (T) domain and a minimal C&#8208;terminal docking domain (CDD) cooperate to bind to the N&#8208;terminal docking domain (NDD) with nanomolar affinity&#8212;the highest docking domain affinity yet observed in such megasynthases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) produce natural products from amino acid building blocks. They often consist of multiple polypeptide chains which assemble in a specific linear order via specialized N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal docking domains (N/CDDs). Typically, docking domains function independently from other domains in NRPS assembly. Thus, docking domain replacements enable the assembly of &#8220;designer&#8221; NRPS from proteins that normally do not interact. The multiprotein &#8220;peptide&#8208;antimicrobial&#8208;Xenorhabdus&#8221; (PAX) peptide&#8208;producing PaxS NRPS is assembled from the three proteins PaxA, PaxB and PaxC. Herein, we show that the small CDD of PaxA cooperates with its preceding thiolation (T1) domain to bind the NDD of PaxB with very high affinity, establishing a structural and thermodynamical basis for this unprecedented docking interaction, and we test its functional importance in vivo in a truncated PaxS assembly line.

     alt="Cooperation between a T&#8197;Domain and a Minimal C-Terminal Docking Domain to Enable Specific Assembly in a Multiprotein NRPS"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interaction between two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) proteins mediates the biosynthesis of PAX peptides and involves an extended docking interface, where a part of the thiolation (T) domain and a minimal C-terminal docking domain (&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;DD) cooperate to bind to the N-terminal docking domain (&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;DD) with nanomolar affinity&#8212;the highest docking domain affinity yet observed in such megasynthases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) produce natural products from amino acid building blocks. They often consist of multiple polypeptide chains which assemble in a specific linear order via specialized N- and C-terminal docking domains (&lt;sup&gt;N/C&lt;/sup&gt;DDs). Typically, docking domains function independently from other domains in NRPS assembly. Thus, docking domain replacements enable the assembly of &#8220;designer&#8221; NRPS from proteins that normally do not interact. The multiprotein &#8220;peptide-antimicrobial-Xenorhabdus&#8221; (PAX) peptide-producing PaxS NRPS is assembled from the three proteins PaxA, PaxB and PaxC. Herein, we show that the small &lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;DD of PaxA cooperates with its preceding thiolation (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) domain to bind the &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;DD of PaxB with very high affinity, establishing a structural and thermodynamical basis for this unprecedented docking interaction, and we test its functional importance in vivo in a truncated PaxS assembly line. Similar docking interactions are apparently present in other NRPS systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Oxygenation of Hydrocarbons by Mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo Dicopper(II) Species Resulting from O&#8722;O Cleavage of Tetranuclear CuI/CuII Peroxo Complexes</title>

UV/Vis and rRaman spectroscopies complemented by XAS and UHR&#8208;ESI mass spectrometry are employed to monitor the binding of O2 in a tetranuclear copper cluster, followed by homolytic O&#8722;O bond cleavage. The resulting mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper(II) complexes catalytically oxygenate a variety of hydrocarbons, establishing an unprecedented, 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economic scenario for the monooxygenation of organic substrates from gaseous O2.







Abstract
One of the challenges of catalysis is the transformation of inert C&#8722;H bonds to useful products. Copper&#8208;containing monooxygenases play an important role in this regard. Here we show that low&#8208;temperature oxygenation of dinuclear copper(I) complexes leads to unusual tetranuclear, mixed&#8208;valent &#956;4&#8208;peroxo [CuI/CuII]2 complexes. These Cu4O2 intermediates promote irreversible and thermally activated O&#8722;O bond homolysis, generating Cu2O complexes that catalyze strongly exergonic H&#8208;atom abstraction from hydrocarbons, coupled to O&#8208;transfer. The Cu2O species can also be produced with N2O, demonstrating their capability for small&#8208;molecule activation. The binding and cleavage of O2 leading to the primary Cu4O2 intermediate and the Cu2O complexes, respectively, is elucidated with a range of solution spectroscopic methods and mass spectrometry. The unique reactivities of these species establish an unprecedented, 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economic scenario for the catalytic, copper&#8208;mediated monooxygenation of organic substrates, employing both O&#8208;atoms of O2.

         <title>Tunable Hydrophobicity via Dimensionally Confined Polymerization of Organometallic Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13929-13936, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By restricting polymerization in the native pores of pre&#8208;packed undercooled particles, organometallic adducts were autonomously generated on either flat&#8208; or pre&#8208;textured particle beds. These adducts&#8217; fine structures successfully turned the Wenzel wetting state of metal rose into the Cassie state of composite lotus.







Abstract
Fabrication of tunable fine textures on solid metal surfaces often demands sophisticated reaction/processing systems. By exploiting in&#8197;situ polymerization and self&#8208;assembly of inorganic adducts derived from liquid metals (the so&#8208;called HetMet reaction) with concomitant solidification, solid metal films with tunable texture are readily fabricated. Serving as a natural dimensional confinement, interparticle pores and capillary&#8208;adhered thin liquid films in a pre&#8208;packed bed of undercooled liquid metal particles lead to the expeditious surface accumulation of organometallic synthons, which readily oligomerize and self&#8208;assemble into concentration&#8208;dictated morphologies/patterns. Tuning particle size, particle packing (flat or textured), and reactant concentration generates diverse, autonomously organized organometallic structures on a metal particle bed. Concomitant solidification and sintering of the underlying undercooled particle bed led to a multiscale patterned solid metal surface. The process is illustrated by creating tunable features on pre&#8208;organized metal particle beds with concomitant tunable wettability as illustrated through the so&#8208;called petal and lotus effects.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Pairing Approach to Stereoselective Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>

Stereoselective ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization is achieved by non&#8208;covalent interactions, such as ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics and solvation effects, in a metal&#8208;free condition.







Abstract
Stereochemistry can have a profound impact on polymer and materials properties. Unfortunately, straightforward methods for realizing high levels of stereocontrolled polymerizations are often challenging to achieve. In a departure from traditional metal&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), we discovered a remarkably simple method for controlling alkene stereochemistry in photoredox mediated metal&#8208;free ROMP. Ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics, and solvation effects each had profound impact on the stereochemistry of polynorbornene (PNB). Simple modifications to the reaction conditions produced PNB with trans alkene content of 25 to &gt;98&#8201;%. High cis content was obtained from relatively larger counterions, toluene as solvent, low temperatures (&#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C), and initiators with low Charton values. Conversely, smaller counterions, dichloromethane as solvent, and enol ethers with higher Charton values enabled production of PNB with high trans content. Data from a combined experimental and computational investigation are consistent with the stereocontrolling step of the radical cationic mechanism proceeding under thermodynamic control.

We report the isolation of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold. The absolute configurations and antibacterial activities of benditerpenoic acid and the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene core were established.







Abstract
A new bicyclic diterpenoid, benditerpenoic acid, was isolated from soil&#8208;dwelling Streptomyces sp. (CL12&#8208;4). We sequenced the bacterial genome, identified the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster, verified the function of the terpene synthase, and heterologously produced the core diterpene. Comparative bioinformatics indicated this Streptomyces strain is phylogenetically unique and possesses nine terpene synthases. The absolute configurations of the new trans&#8208;fused bicyclo[8.4.0]tetradecanes were achieved by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including Mosher's analysis, J&#8208;based coupling analysis, and computations based on sparse NMR&#8208;derived experimental restraints. Interestingly, benditerpenoic acid exists in two distinct ring&#8208;flipped bicyclic conformations with a rotational barrier of &#8776;16&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in solution. The diterpenes exhibit moderate antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including methicillin and multi&#8208;drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This is a rare example of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold.

         <title>Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;Sheet Mimetics that Target the Transcriptional Coactivator &#946;&#8208;Catenin and Inhibit Wnt Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13937-13944, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from a 52 amino acid protein binding epitope, a bicyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin structure was developed to bind the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8208;catenin. Our structure&#8208;based design approach was supported by screening a focused library of bicyclic mimetics which was generated via late&#8208;stage diversification. The most active bicyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin shows cell&#8208;penetration and inhibits Wnt signaling in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
Protein complexes are defined by the three&#8208;dimensional structure of participating binding partners. Knowledge about these structures can facilitate the design of peptidomimetics which have been applied for example, as inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). Even though &#946;&#8208;sheets participate widely in PPIs, they have only rarely served as the basis for peptidomimetic PPI inhibitors, in particular when addressing intracellular targets. Here, we present the structure&#8208;based design of &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics targeting the intracellular protein &#946;&#8208;catenin, a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on a protein binding partner of &#946;&#8208;catenin, a macrocyclic peptide was designed and its crystal structure in complex with &#946;&#8208;catenin obtained. Using this structure, we designed a library of bicyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics employing a late&#8208;stage diversification strategy. Several mimetics were identified that compete with transcription factor binding to &#946;&#8208;catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling in cells. The presented design strategy can support the development of inhibitors for other &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;mediated PPIs.

Methyl&#8208;group NMR spectroscopy offers exceptional benefits for structural studies of complex biological systems. Yet, restrictive isotope labeling requirements have obstructed its use in emerging protein expression systems. In their Communication on page&#8197;13783, Manuel Etzkorn, Vladimir Gelev, Haribabu Arthanari, and co&#8208;workers report a five&#8208;step synthesis of stereoselectively methyl&#8208;labeled leucine, which greatly facilitates applications in eukaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems, providing desirable NMR sensors in so far inaccessible protein systems.

Bicyclic peptidomimetics bind the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8208;catenin. A structure&#8208;based design strategy has been applied to minimize a 52 amino acid binding motif into bicyclic 16&#8208;mer &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics. The biologically most active mimetic exhibits robust cellular uptake and inhibits Wnt signaling in a cell&#8208;based assay, as reported by Tom&#8197;N. Grossmann and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;13937.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A hybrid hypercrosslinked polymer&lt;/b&gt; is reported by Changhui Liu and co-workers in their Research Article on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202103186"&gt;page&#8197;13978&lt;/a&gt;. It is capable of encapsulating both organic and inorganic phase change materials via a novel homogeneous-to-heterogeneous encapsulation strategy with the aim to meet the demand for highly efficient thermal energy storage.

Zeolite catalysts often display highly intergrown structures, yielding a zeolite &#8220;flower&#8221; or &#8220;sun&#8221; at the microscale. Using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and in&#8197;situ fluorescence microscopy, Bert&#8197;M. Weckhuysen et&#8197;al. show in their Communication on page&#8197;13803 that porosity is developed only in specific segments of zeolites, which might cause strong local discrepancies in performance and deactivation behavior. The yellow sun against a black background is reminiscent of the symbol of Utrecht University, where the work was performed.

         <title>Contemporary Approaches for Site&#8208;Selective Dual Functionalization of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13757-13777, June 14, 2021. </description>

Site&#8208;selective dual protein functionalization serves as an invaluable tool for investigating protein structures and functions in complicated cellular environments and accomplishing semi&#8208;synthetic protein conjugates. The methodologies, as well as the applications of dual&#8208;functionalized protein bioconjugates are highlighted in this review.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective protein functionalization serves as an invaluable tool for investigating protein structures and functions in complicated cellular environments and accomplishing semi&#8208;synthetic protein conjugates such as traceable therapeutics with improved features. Dual functionalization of proteins allows the incorporation of two different types of functionalities at distinct location(s), which greatly expands the features of native proteins. The attachment and crosstalk of a fluorescence donor and an acceptor dye provides fundamental insights into the folding and structural changes of proteins upon ligand binding in their native cellular environments. Moreover, the combination of drug molecules with different modes of action, imaging agents or stabilizing polymers provides new avenues to design precision protein therapeutics in a reproducible and well&#8208;characterizable fashion. This review aims to give a timely overview of the recent advancements and a future perspective of this relatively new research area. First, the chemical toolbox for dual functionalization of proteins is discussed and compared. The strengths and limitations of each strategy are summarized in order to enable readers to select the most appropriate method for their envisaged applications. Thereafter, representative applications of these dual&#8208;modified protein bioconjugates benefiting from the synergistic/additive properties of the two synthetic moieties are highlighted.

Made for each other! Striking similarity in reactivity has been observed for organocatalytically generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums towards various nucleophiles. Analogous [3+3] and [3+2] annulations, cascade reactions, and Michael additions of these highly electrophilic intermediates are highlighted in this Minireview.







Abstract
The secondary amine&#8208;catalyzed reactions proceeding via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed transformations taking place via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazoliums are the two widely used electrophilic intermediates in organocatalysis. Over the last two decades, these two intermediates are extensively utilized for the enantioselective construction of valuable molecules. Both intermediates are generated by the covalent binding of catalysts to the substrates leading to LUMO activation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. A variety of soft nucleophiles are known to add to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums in a conjugate fashion, and in many cases, striking similarity in reactivity has been observed. Having said this, there are few cases where these intermediates exhibit difference in reactivity. This Minireview is aimed at highlighting the resemblances in reactivity between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums thereby shedding light on the unnoticed parallels of the two intermediates in organocatalysis.

Chelating&#8208;benzylidene ruthenium complexes (so&#8208;called Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs catalysts) activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWGs) are finding practical applications in target&#8208;oriented synthesis, medicinal chemistry, the preparation of fine&#8208;chemicals, and in materials chemistry.







Abstract
Advanced applications of the Nobel Prize winning olefin metathesis reaction require user&#8208;friendly and highly universal catalysts. From many successful metathesis catalysts, which belong to the two distinct classes of Schrock and Grubbs&#8208;type catalysts, the subclass of chelating&#8208;benzylidene ruthenium complexes (so&#8208;called Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs catalysts) additionally activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWGs) provides a highly tunable platform. In the Review, the origin of the EWG&#8208;activation concept and selected applications of the resulting catalysts in target&#8208;oriented synthesis, medicinal chemistry, as well as in the preparation of fine&#8208;chemicals and in materials chemistry is discussed. Based on the examples, some suggestions for end&#8208;users regarding minimization of catalyst loading, selectivity control, and general optimization of the olefin metathesis reaction are provided.

Polymer networks cross&#8208;linked through bonds capable of exchanging with one another have a high potential for increasing the sustainability of polymeric materials. However, the adaptive and responsive properties of these networks can also enhance the properties of electroactive polymers in smart and functional devices. This Minireview highlights recent work at this emerging research boundary and discusses future directions for dynamic polymer networks in soft machine applications.







Abstract
While the fascinating field of soft machines has grown rapidly over the last two decades, the materials they are constructed from have remained largely unchanged during this time. Parallel activities have led to significant advances in the field of dynamic polymer networks, leading to the design of three&#8208;dimensionally cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials that are able to adapt and transform through stimuli&#8208;induced bond exchange. Recent work has begun to merge these two fields of research by incorporating the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of dynamic polymer networks into soft machine components. These include dielectric elastomers, stretchable electrodes, nanogenerators, and energy storage devices. In this Minireview, we outline recent progress made in this emerging research area and discuss future directions for the field.

         <title>Catalytic Co&#8208;Conversion of CH4 and CO2 Mediated by Rhodium&#8211;Titanium Oxide Anions RhTiO2&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13788-13792, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to syngas mediated by single Rh atom&#8208;doped titanium oxide anions (RhTiO2&#8722;) has been experimentally identified. The production of free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) could be achieved at room temperature while the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of the COads from RhTiO2CO&#8722;.







Abstract
Catalytic co&#8208;conversion of methane with carbon dioxide to produce syngas (2&#8201;H2+2&#8201;CO) involves complicated elementary steps and almost all the elementary reactions are performed at the same high temperature conditions in practical thermocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate by mass spectrometric experiments that RhTiO2&#8722; promotes the co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) at room temperature; the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of COads from the RhTiO2CO&#8722; to reform RhTiO2&#8722;. This study not only identifies a promising active species for dry (CO2) reforming of methane to syngas, but also emphasizes the importance of temperature control over elementary steps in practical catalysis, which may significantly alleviate the carbon deposition originating from the pyrolysis of methane.

         <title>An Ultralow Temperature Aqueous Battery with Proton Chemistry</title>

An aqueous Pb&#8208;quinone battery based on H+ coordination/un&#8208;coordination behavior was developed in anti&#8208;freezing H2SO4 solution. The batteries can work well even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C due to the fast H+ diffusion kinetics and high ionic conductivity of electrolyte.







Abstract
Conventional aqueous batteries usually suffer from serious capacity loss under subzero conditions owing to the freeze of electrolytes. To realize the utilization of aqueous batteries in extremely cold climates, low&#8208;temperature aqueous battery systems have to be developed. Herein, an aqueous Pb&#8208;quinone battery based on p&#8208;chloranil/reduced graphene oxide (PCHL&#8208;rGO) in H2SO4 electrolyte is developed. Such aqueous Pb/PCHL&#8208;rGO batteries display H+ insertion chemistry, which endows the batteries with fast reaction kinetics and high rate capability. In addition, the hydrogen bonds between water molecules can be significantly damaged in electrolyte by modulating the interaction between SO42&#8722; and water molecules, lowering the freezing point of electrolyte. As a result, the Pb/PCHL&#8208;rGO batteries deliver extraordinary electrochemical performance even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C. This work will broaden the horizons of aqueous batteries and open up new opportunities to construct low&#8208;temperature aqueous batteries.

         <title>Silylated Sulfuric Acid: Preparation of a Tris(trimethylsilyl)oxosulfonium [(Me3Si&#8722;O)3SO]+ Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13798-13802, June 14, 2021. </description>

The &#8220;larger&#8221; analog of protonated sulfuric acid, [H3SO4]+, the silylated oxosulfonium ion, [(Me3Si)3SO4]+, was obtained in the reaction of silylated sulfuric acid with a [Me3Si]+ transfer reagent such as [Me3Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiMe3]+[wca]&#8722;, when a weakly coordinating anion ([wca]&#8722;) is used as counterion.







Abstract
The chemistry of silylated sulfuric acid, O2S(OSiMe3)2 (T2SO4, T=Me3Si; also known as bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfate), has been studied in detail with the aim of synthesizing the formal autosilylation products of silylated sulfuric acid, [T3SO4]+ and [TSO4]&#8722;, in analogy to the known protonated species, [H3SO4]+ and [HSO4]&#8722;. The synthesis of the [TSO4]&#8722; ion only succeeds when a base, such as OPMe3 that forms a weakly coordinating cation upon silylation, is reacted with T2SO4, resulting in the formation of [Me3POT]+[TSO4]&#8722;. [T3SO4]+ salts could be isolated starting from T2SO4 in the reaction with [T&#8722;H&#8722;T]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; or T+[CHB11Br6H5]&#8722; when a weakly coordinating anion is used as counterion. All silylated compounds could be crystallized and structurally characterized.

&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of silylated sulfuric acid, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S(OSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, T=Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si; also known as bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfate), has been studied in detail with the aim of synthesizing the formal autosilylation products of silylated sulfuric acid, [T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [TSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, in analogy to the known protonated species, [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The synthesis of the [TSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion only succeeds when a base, such as OPMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that forms a weakly coordinating cation upon silylation, is reacted with T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in the formation of [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;POT]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[TSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. [T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salts could be isolated starting from T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the reaction with [T&#8722;H&#8722;T]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[CHB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; when a weakly coordinating anion is used as counterion. All silylated compounds could be crystallized and structurally characterized.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Separation&#8208;Controlled Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13892-13895, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox reactions are quite difficult to control because their reaction equilibrium constants strongly depart from unity (particularly if at least one of the reactants is a potent oxidizing or reducing agent). Based on calculations, smooth control of charge transfer depending solely on the separation between oxidizer and reductant is proposed. AgF2, a powerful oxidizer, may be electron&#8208;doped to a controlled extent using this approach.







Abstract
In the era of molecular devices and nanotechnology, precise control over electron&#8208;transfer processes is strongly desired. However, redox reactions are usually characterized by reaction equilibrium constants strongly departing from unity. This leads to strong favoring of either reactants or products and does not permit subtle control of transferred charge (doping). Here we propose, based on theoretical studies for periodic systems, how charge transfer between reactants could be finely manipulated in the epitaxially grown system composed of extremely strong oxidizer, reducing agent, and an inert separator&#8212;the key factor of control.

         <title>Persistent peri&#8208;Heptacene: Synthesis and In Situ Characterization</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the hitherto unknown peri&#8208;heptacene 7&#8208;PA is demonstrated by a rational molecular design strategy in which the reactive zigzag edges are kinetically protected. The formation of 7&#8208;PA is validated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and in situ FT&#8208;Raman spectroscopy. The open&#8208;shell 7&#8208;PA displays a narrow optical energy gap of 1.01&#8197;eV and exhibits a persistent stability (half&#8208;life &#8776;25&#8197;min) under inert conditions.







Abstract
n&#8208;peri&#8208;Acenes (n&#8208;PAs) have gained interest as model systems of zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons for potential applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics. However, the synthesis of n&#8208;PAs larger than peri&#8208;tetracene remains challenging because of their intrinsic open&#8208;shell character and high reactivity. Presented here is the synthesis of a hitherto unknown n&#8208;PA, that is, peri&#8208;heptacene (7&#8208;PA), in which the reactive zigzag edges are kinetically protected with eight 4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4 groups. The formation of 7&#8208;PA is validated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and in situ FT&#8208;Raman spectroscopy. 7&#8208;PA displays a narrow optical energy gap of 1.01&#8197;eV and exhibits persistent stability (t1/2&#8776;25&#8197;min) under inert conditions. Moreover, electron&#8208;spin resonance measurements and theoretical studies reveal that 7&#8208;PA exhibits an open&#8208;shell feature and a significant tetraradical character. This strategy could be considered a modular approach for the construction of next&#8208;generation (3&#8201;N+1)&#8208;PAs (where N&#8805;3).

         <title>Chemical Imaging of Hierarchical Porosity Formation within a Zeolite Crystal Visualized by Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering and In&#8208;Situ Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13803-13806, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical porosity within a zeolite crystal is visualized by X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy to probe nanoporosity within the inorganic zeolite phase. In complement, in situ fluorescence microscopy allows to monitor pore hierarchization in real&#8208;time via organic fluorescent stains, which fill the meso&#8208; and macropore space.







Abstract
Introducing hierarchical porosity to zeolites is vital for providing molecular access to microporous domains. Yet, the dynamics of meso&#8208; and macropore formation has remained elusive and pore space ill&#8208;characterized by a lack of (in situ) microscopic tools sensitive to nanoporosity. Here, we probe hierarchical porosity formation within a zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 crystal in real&#8208;time by in situ fluorescence microscopy during desilication. In addition, we introduce small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy as novel characterization tool to map intracrystal meso&#8208; and macropore properties. It is shown that hierarchical porosity formation initiates at the crystal surface and propagates to the crystal core via a pore front with decreasing rate. Also, hierarchical porosity only establishes in specific (segments of) subunits which constitute ZSM&#8208;5. Such space&#8208;dependent meso&#8208; and macroporosity implies local discrepancies in diffusion, performance and deactivation behaviors even within a zeolite crystal.

         <title>Local Deuteration Enables NMR Observation of Methyl Groups in Proteins from Eukaryotic and Cell&#8208;Free Expression Systems</title>

Methyl&#8208;based magnetization usage can strongly benefit investigations of large protein systems via NMR spectroscopy. Here, a simple and cost&#8208;effective method to obtain locally deuterated leucine suitable for methyl NMR and to quantify its benefits is presented. The approach substantially expands the applicability of methyl labeling in emerging expression systems including cell&#8208;free and eukaryotic systems.







Abstract
Therapeutically relevant proteins such as GPCRs, antibodies and kinases face clear limitations in NMR studies due to the challenges in site&#8208;specific isotope labeling and deuteration in eukaryotic expression systems. Here we describe an efficient and simple method to observe the methyl groups of leucine residues in proteins expressed in bacterial, eukaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems without modification of the expression protocol. The method relies on simple stereo&#8208;selective 13C&#8208;labeling and deuteration of leucine that alleviates the need for additional deuteration of the protein. The spectroscopic benefits of &#8220;local&#8221; deuteration are examined in detail through Forbidden Coherence Transfer (FCT) experiments and simulations. The utility of this labeling method is demonstrated in the cell&#8208;free synthesis of bacteriorhodopsin and in the insect&#8208;cell expression of the RRM2 domain of human RBM39.

         <title>E. coli Nickel&#8208;Iron Hydrogenase 1 Catalyses Non&#8208;native Reduction of Flavins: Demonstration for Alkene Hydrogenation by Old Yellow Enzyme Ene&#8208;reductases**

Robust [NiFe] hydrogenase 1 (Hyd1) from Escherichia coli is shown to have non&#8208;native, H2&#8208;dependent activity for FMN and FAD reduction. It is a promising recycling system for FMNH2 or FADH2 supply to flavoenzymes for chemical synthesis when coupled with an Old Yellow Enzyme ene&#8208;reductase.







Abstract
A new activity for the [NiFe] uptake hydrogenase&#8197;1 of Escherichia coli (Hyd1) is presented. Direct reduction of biological flavin cofactors FMN and FAD is achieved using H2 as a simple, completely atom&#8208;economical reductant. The robust nature of Hyd1 is exploited for flavin reduction across a broad range of temperatures (25&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C) and extended reaction times. The utility of this system as a simple, easy to implement FMNH2 or FADH2 regenerating system is then demonstrated by supplying reduced flavin to Old Yellow Enzyme &#8220;ene&#8208;reductases&#8221; to support asymmetric alkene reductions with up to 100&#8201;% conversion. Hyd1 turnover frequencies up to 20.4&#8197;min&#8722;1 and total turnover numbers up to 20&#8201;200 were recorded during flavin recycling.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Giant Conjugated Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13896-13899, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant conjugated macrocycles with a diameter of roughly 7&#8197;nm consisting of up to 30 subunits were synthesized on a Ag(111) surface in a two&#8208;step reaction. Site&#8208;selective debromination initiated the synthesis, resulting in arched covalent oligomers and macrocycles, which were assisted by C&#8211;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits. The subsequent cyclodehydrogenation steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles.







Abstract
We have achieved an on&#8208;surface synthesis of giant conjugated macrocycles having a diameter of &#8776;7&#8197;nm and consisting of up to 30 subunits. The synthesis started with a debrominative coupling of the molecular precursors on a hot Ag(111) surface, leading to the formation of arched oligomeric chains and macrocycles. These products were revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with density functional theory to be covalent oligomers. These intermediates also display C&#8211;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits due to site&#8208;selective debromination and the asymmetric molecular conformation. Subsequent cyclodehydrogenation at higher temperatures steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles. Our findings provide a novel design strategy toward &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles and open up new opportunities for the precise synthesis of organic nanostructures.

Prepare for trouble&#8212;and make it double: A organoselenium&#8208;catalysed, regiospecific para&#8208;hydroxylation starting from N&#8208;aryl hydroxamic acids through double [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to form para&#8208;aminophenols was developed. This operationally easy reaction delivers useful para&#8208;aminophenol building blocks on small and large scales and its mechanism is supported through quantum chemical calculations as well as labeling experiments.







Abstract
A selenium&#8208;catalysed para&#8208;hydroxylation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;hydroxamic acids is reported. Mechanistically, the reaction comprises an N&#8722;O bond cleavage and consecutive selenium&#8208;induced [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement to deliver para&#8208;hydroxyaniline derivatives. The mechanism is studied through both 18O&#8208;crossover experiments as well as quantum chemical calculations. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation provides an unconventional synthetic approach to para&#8208;aminophenols.

An asymmetric multicomponent interrupted Kinugasa allylic alkylation (IKAA) reaction has been developed with a synergistic Cu&#8208;catalyzed Kinugasa and Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation system. This strategy provides a high yield and highly selective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams, which are not easily produced by other methods. Stereoselective coupling of two transient organometallic intermediates formed in&#8197;situ is the most important feature of this reaction.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Polyimide&#8208;Graphene Heterostructure with Ultra&#8208;fast Interlayer Charge Transfer</title>

We demonstrate a general but reliable on&#8208;water synthesis and assembly strategy toward the preparation of 2D polyimide (2DPI)&#8208;graphene (G) van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) on water surface. Remarkably, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultra&#8208;fast interlayer charge transfer (ca. 60&#8197;fs) after protonation in the heterostructure, which is among the fastest reports of vdWHs.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) are a class of atomically/molecularly thin crystalline organic 2D materials. They are intriguing candidates for the development of unprecedented organic&#8211;inorganic 2D van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) with exotic physicochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate the on&#8208;water surface synthesis of large&#8208;area (cm2), monolayer 2D polyimide (2DPI) with 3.1&#8208;nm lattice. Such 2DPI comprises metal&#8208;free porphyrin and perylene units linked by imide bonds. We further achieve a scalable synthesis of 2DPI&#8208;graphene (2DPI&#8208;G) vdWHs via a face&#8208;to&#8208;face co&#8208;assembly of graphene and 2DPI on the water surface. Remarkably, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultra&#8208;fast interlayer charge transfer (ca. 60&#8197;fs) in the resultant 2DPI&#8208;G vdWH upon protonation by acid, which is equivalent to that of the fastest reports among inorganic 2D vdWHs. Such large interlayer electronic coupling is ascribed to the interlayer cation&#8211;&#960; interaction between 2DP and graphene.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Phosphonylation of Indoles at the C4 and C6 Positions by a Radical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13871-13876, June 14, 2021. </description>

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote phosphonylation for the indole C4&#8208; and C6&#8208;positions was achieved by a radical approach. The preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reactions may proceed via a C7&#8208;palladacycle/remote&#8208;activation process.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H activation of indole benzenoid moiety has been achieved in the past decade. However, palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote C&#8722;H activation of indoles is rare. Herein, we report a challenging palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote C4&#8208;H phosphonylation of indoles by a radical approach. The method provides access to a series of C4&#8208;phosphonylated indoles, including tryptophan and tryptophan&#8208;containing dipeptides, which are typically inaccessible by direct C4&#8208;H activation due to its heavy reliance on C3 directing groups. Notably, unexpected C6&#8208;phosphonylated indoles were obtained through blocking of the C4 position. The preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reactions may proceed via a C7&#8208;palladacycle/remote&#8208;activation process. Based on the strategy, examples of remote C4&#8208;H difluoromethylation with BrCF2COOEt are also presented, suggesting that the strategy may offer a general blueprint for other cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Ce=O Terminated CeO2</title>

A combined experimental and computational study of the (

Abstract
Multiply bonded lanthanide oxo groups are rare in coordination compounds and have not previously been reported for a surface termination of a lanthanide oxide. Here we report the observation of a Ce=O terminated ceria surface in a CeO2(111)&#8208;(
&#215;
)R30&#176; reconstruction of &#8776;3&#8197;nm thick ceria islands prepared on Pt(111). This is evidenced by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and high&#8208;resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) measurements in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A Ce=O stretching frequency of 775&#8197;cm&#8722;1 is observed in HREELS, compared with 766&#8197;cm&#8722;1 calculated by DFT. The calculations also predict that the Ce=O bond is weak, with an oxygen vacancy formation energy of 0.85&#8197;eV. This could play an important role in the facile removal of lattice oxygen from CeO2, accompanied by the reduction of CeIV to CeIII, which is a key attribute of ceria&#8208;based systems in connection with their unique catalytic properties.

         <title>Ultrastable and Efficient Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 Reduction Triggered by Regenerative Oxygen&#8208;Vacancies in Bi2O2CO3 Nanosheets</title>

Regenerative surface vacancies could be repeatedly created by external conditions like UV light irradiation. These regenerative surface vacancies can significantly improve the cycling stability and eventually realize both high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Herein, we first design a fast low&#8208;pressure ultraviolet light irradiation strategy for easily regenerating the nearly equivalent surface vacancies. Taking the defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets as an example, nearly equal amount of oxygen vacancies can be regenerated under UV light irradiation. Synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra disclose the Bi sites in the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets can act as the highly active sites, which not only help to activate CO2 molecules, but also contribute to stabilizing the rate&#8208;limiting COOH* intermediate. Also, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ mass spectrometry unravel the UV light irradiation contributes to accelerating CO desorption process. As a result, the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets achieve a stability up to 2640&#8197;h over 110 cycling tests and a high evolution rate of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO.

         <title>Reversing the Chirality of Surface Ligands Can Improve the Biosafety and Pharmacokinetics of Cationic Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13829-13834, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improved biosafety and in vivo transportation of cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) are achieved by tuning the chirality of surface ligands. D&#8208;GNCs effectively shield the high toxicity induced by cationic ligands. Post&#8208;exposure to mice, renal&#8208;/hepatic&#8208;clearable D&#8208;GNCs also show superior in vivo performances in aspects of biological circulation and tumor accumulation.







Abstract
Severe toxicity and rapid in vivo clearance of cationic nanomaterials seriously hinder their clinical translation. Present strategies to improve the biosafety and in vivo performance of cationic nanomaterials require neutralization of positive charge, which often compromises their efficacy. Herein, we report that substituting L&#8208;glutathione (L&#8208;GSH) on cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) with its D&#8208;counterpart can effectively improve the biosafety and pharmacokinetics. Compared with L&#8208;GNCs, D&#8208;GNCs do not exhibit cellular cytotoxicity, hemolysis, or acute damage to organs. Cationic D&#8208;GNCs show less cell internalization than L&#8208;GNCs, and do not induce cellular apoptosis. In vivo, the chirality of surface ligands distinctly affects the pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting abilities of D&#8208;/L&#8208;GNCs. D&#8208;GNCs show higher extended circulation time in blood plasma compared to similarly&#8208;sized and poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that the choice of chirality of surface ligands can determine toxicities and pharmacokinetics of cationic nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Improved biosafety and in vivo transportation of cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) are achieved by tuning the chirality of surface ligands. D-GNCs effectively shield the high toxicity induced by cationic ligands. Post-exposure to mice, renal-/hepatic-clearable D-GNCs also show superior in vivo performances in aspects of biological circulation and tumor accumulation.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of 16&#960; Antiaromatic 2,7&#8208;Dihydrodiazapyrenes: Antiaromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons with Embedded Nitrogen</title>

N,N&#8242;&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;dihydrodiazapyrenes were synthesized and characterized. X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a distorted quinoidal structure with a pronounced bond&#8208;length alternation. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and calculations confirmed the presence of a distinct paratropic ring current. N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;dihydrodiazapyrenes exhibit an antiaromatic character derived from their peripheral 16&#960;&#8208;electron conjugation.







Abstract
We describe the two&#8208;electron reduction of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diazapyrenium dications (MDAP2+), which afforded the corresponding reduced form (MDAP0) as a highly electron&#8208;rich 16&#960; antiaromatic system. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of MDAP0 revealed a distorted quinoidal structure with high bond&#8208;length alternation. The 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum of MDAP0 exhibited a diagnostic proton signal (4.6&#8197;ppm) that is distinctly upfield shifted compared to that of aromatic diazapyrene (8.3&#8197;ppm). Theoretical calculations supported the existence of a paratropic ring current. These results indicate that MDAP0 exhibits antiaromatic character derived from its peripheral 16&#960;&#8208;electron conjugation.

         <title>A Colorimetric Method for Quantifying Cis and Trans Alkenes Using an Indicator Displacement Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13819-13823, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput method was developed using a colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) to quantify the alkene stereochemistry present within mixtures to an accuracy of 2&#8211;3&#8201;%. Within a series of 96&#8208;well plates, alkenes were dihydroxylated and the resulting diols were subjected to an IDA with an indicator and a boronic acid to determine the amount of threo and/or erythro vicinal diols present.







Abstract
A colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation was developed to determine the percentage of cis and trans alkenes. Using 96&#8208;well plates two steps are performed: a reaction plate for dihydroxylation of the alkenes followed by an IDA screening plate consisting of an indicator and a boronic acid. The dihydroxylation generates either erythro or threo vicinal diols from cis or trans alkenes, depending upon their syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;addition mechanisms. Threo diols preferentially associate with the boronic acid due to the creation of more stable boronate esters, thus displacing the indicator to a greater extent. The generality of the protocol was demonstrated using seven sets of cis and trans alkenes. Blind mixtures of cis and trans alkenes were made, resulting in an average error of &#177;2&#8201;% in the percentage of cis or trans alkenes, and implementing E2 and Wittig reactions gave errors of &#177;3&#8201;%. Furthermore, we developed variants of the IDA for which the color may be tuned to optimize the response for the human eye.

Abstract
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic dihydrodibenzosilines featuring axially chiral 6&#8208;membered bridged biaryls is demonstrated. In the presence of a RhI catalyst with a chiral diphosphine ligand, a wide range of dihydrodibenzosilines containing both silicon&#8208;central and axial chiralities are conveniently constructed in excellent enantioselectivities via dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation. Absolute configuration analysis by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures revealed a novel silicon central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality relay phenomenon, which we believe will inspire further research in the field of asymmetric catalysis and chiroptical materials.

         <title>Ammonia Formation Catalyzed by a Dinitrogen&#8208;Bridged Dirhenium Complex Bearing PNP&#8208;Pincer Ligands under Mild Reaction Conditions**

The first successful example of catalytic nitrogen fixation using a rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complex as a catalyst under mild reaction conditions is described in this paper. The dinitrogen&#8208;bridged dirhenium complex worked as an effective catalyst for the formation of ammonia and silylamine, where up to 8.4&#8197;equiv of ammonia and 11.7&#8197;equiv of silylamine were produced based on the Re atom of the catalyst.







Abstract
A series of rhenium complexes bearing a pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligand are synthesized from rhenium phosphine complexes as precursors. A dinitrogen&#8208;bridged dirhenium complex bearing the PNP&#8208;type pincer ligands catalytically converts dinitrogen into ammonia during the reaction with KC8 as a reductant and [HPCy3]BArF4 (Cy=cyclohexyl, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) as a proton source at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C to afford 8.4&#8197;equiv of ammonia based on the rhenium atom of the catalyst. The rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complex also catalyzes silylation of dinitrogen in the reaction with KC8 as a reductant and Me3SiCl as a silylating reagent under ambient reaction conditions to afford 11.7&#8197;equiv of tris(trimethylsilyl)amine based on the rhenium atom of the catalyst. These results demonstrate the first successful example of catalytic nitrogen fixation under mild reaction conditions using rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complexes as catalysts.

&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Cy=cyclohexyl, Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;=3,5-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as a proton source at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C to afford 8.4&#8197;equiv of ammonia based on the rhenium atom of the catalyst. The rhenium-dinitrogen complex also catalyzes silylation of dinitrogen in the reaction with KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; as a reductant and Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl as a silylating reagent under ambient reaction conditions to afford 11.7&#8197;equiv of tris(trimethylsilyl)amine based on the rhenium atom of the catalyst. These results demonstrate the first successful example of catalytic nitrogen fixation under mild reaction conditions using rhenium-dinitrogen complexes as catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Coordinated Heteronuclear Calcium&#8211;Iron Carbonyl Cation Complexes [CaFe(CO)n]+ (n=5&#8211;12) with d&#8722;d Bonding</title>

The [CaFe(CO)10]+ cation is characterized to be a coordination saturated ion where a Fe(CO)4 fragment is bonded with a Ca(CO)6 moiety through two side&#8208;on bridging carbonyl ligands. The complex is best described by the bonding interactions between a [Ca(CO)6]2+ dication and an [Fe(CO)4]&#8722; anion forming a Fe&#8722;Ca d&#8722;d dative bond that is enhanced by the attraction between Ca and the bridging CO ligands.







Abstract
Heteronuclear calcium&#8211;iron carbonyl cation complexes in the form of [CaFe(CO)n]+ (n=5&#8211;12) are produced in the gas phase. Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations confirm that the n=10 complex is the coordination saturated ion where a Fe(CO)4 fragment is bonded with a Ca(CO)6 fragment through two side&#8208;on bridging carbonyl ligands. Bonding analysis indicates that it is best described by the bonding interactions between a [Ca(CO)6]2+ dication and an [Fe(CO)4]&#8722; anion forming a Fe&#8594;Ca d&#8722;d dative bond in the [(CO)6Ca&#8211;Fe(CO)4]+ structure, which enriches the pool of experimentally observed complexes of calcium that mimic transition metal compounds. The molecule is the first example of a heteronuclear carbonyl complex featuring a d&#8722;d bond between calcium and a transition metal.

         <title>Substituted Dihydropyridine Synthesis by Dearomatization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13793-13797, June 14, 2021. </description>

Metal&#8208;free dearomatization of N&#8208;heteroarenes is a well&#8208;known and powerful method to yield partially saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic building blocks. Yet, the use of sensitive reagents restricts the applicability in synthetic laboratories. Herein, we present a very mild and selective reduction of N&#8208;heteroarenes by amine borane to synthesize a broad variety of N&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines.







Abstract
Dearomatization is an effective method to transform readily available N&#8208;heterocycles into partially saturated motifs. Manipulation of dihydro&#8208;derivatives holds great potential and provides access to a variety of semi&#8208;saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic building blocks. However, current strategies are limited in scope and the use of sensitive reagents restricts the applicability in synthetic laboratories. Herein, we report the synthesis of a broad variety of N&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines by very mild and selective reduction with amine borane for the first time.

         <title>A Double Deprotonation Strategy for Cascade Annulations of Palladium&#8211;Trimethylenemethanes and Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Carbonates to Construct Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane Frameworks</title>

The palladium&#8211;trimethylenemethane 1,3&#8208;dipoles can be chemoseletively generated from 2&#8208;(cyanomethyl)allyl carbonates via a deprotonation strategy, which allows the SN2&#8242;&#8208;addition to Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates from activated ketones. Cascade [1+2]/[3+2] annulations are followed to construct enantioenriched bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane frameworks with three contiguous quaternary stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Here we report that the chemoselective activation of Tsuji's 2&#8208;(cyanomethyl)allyl carbonates to generate the palladium&#8211;trimethylenemethane 1,3&#8208;dipoles via a deprotonation strategy can be realized in the presence of Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates from substantial activated ketones. The following SN2&#8242;&#8208;addition enables the formation of new 1,3&#8208;dipole species having an activated alkene moiety through a second deprotonation process, which then undergo cascade [1+2]/[3+2] annulations to furnish complex bicyclic [3.1.0]hexane frameworks having three contiguous quaternary stereogenic centers with good to excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, by using benzoyl aldehyde&#8208;derived substrates, a [1+4]/[3+2] annulation sequence is similarly developed to produce fused cyclopenta[b]furan architectures.

The protein caveolin&#8208;1 was divided into five peptide segments for solid&#8208;phase synthesis. To improve the solubility of the triply palmitoylated C&#8208;terminal region, O&#8208;acyl isopeptide structures were incorporated. After ligation, introduction of the palmitoyl groups, and removal of the protecting groups, the isopeptide structures were converted into the native peptide bonds (see scheme). The obtained polypeptide was successfully inserted into bicelles.







Abstract
Caveolin&#8208;1, which is an essential protein for caveola formation, was chemically synthesized. It is composed of 177 amino acid residues, is triply palmitoylated at the C&#8208;terminal region, and is inserted into the lipid bilayer to form a V&#8208;shaped structure in the middle of the polypeptide chain. The entire sequence was divided into five peptide segments, each of which was synthesized by the solid&#8208;phase method. To improve the solubility of the C&#8208;terminal region, O&#8208;acyl isopeptide structures were incorporated. After ligation by the thioester method and the introduction of the palmitoyl groups, all the protecting groups were removed and the isopeptide structures were converted into the native peptide bond. Finally, the obtained polypeptide was successfully inserted into bicelles, thus showing the success of the synthesis.

         <title>ZW800&#8208;PEG: A Renal Clearable Zwitterionic Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophore for Potential Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13847-13852, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZW800&#8208;PEG is a water&#8208;soluble, non&#8208;sticky, and renal clearable near&#8208;infrared fluorophore owing to the balanced zwitterionic charges. By introducing a stable sulfide linker, it improves serum stability and also exhibits potential for augmenting photothermal therapy. It shows a maximum emission wavelength at 800&#8197;nm, enabling its use for image&#8208;guided interventions in the OR using conventional near&#8208;infrared imaging systems.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has advanced medical imaging and image&#8208;guided interventions during the past three decades. Despite tremendous advances in imaging devices, surprisingly only a few dyes are currently available in the clinic. Previous fluorophores, ZW800&#8208;1A and ZW800&#8208;1C, significantly improved the poor performance of the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green. However, ZW800&#8208;1A is not stable in serum and ZW800&#8208;1C induces severe stacking in aqueous media. To solve such dilemmas, ZW800&#8208;PEG was designed by introducing a flexible yet stable thiol PEG linker. ZW800&#8208;PEG shows high solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents, thus improving renal clearance with minimal binding to serum proteins during systemic circulation. The sulfide group on the meso position of the heptamethine core improves serum stability and physicochemical properties including the maximum emission wavelength shift to 800&#8197;nm, enabling the use of ZW800&#8208;PEG for image&#8208;guided interventions and augmenting photothermal therapy.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Cancer Meroterpenoids Dysideanone&#8197;B and Dysiherbol&#8197;A and Structural Reassignment of Dysiherbol&#8197;A</title>

The first total synthesis of marine anti&#8208;cancer natural products dysideanone&#8197;B and dysiherbol&#8197;A have been completed and the structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A has been revised. A radical cyclization was employed to construct the 6/6/6/6 skeleton of dysideanone&#8197;B and a Heck reaction was utilized to forge the 6/6/5/6 core structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of marine anti&#8208;cancer meroterpenoids dysideanone&#8197;B and dysiherbol&#8197;A have been accomplished in a divergent way. The synthetic route features: 1)&#8197;a site and stereoselective &#945;&#8208;position alkylation of a Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone derivative with a bulky benzyl bromide to join the terpene and aromatic moieties together and set the stage for subsequent cyclization reactions; 2)&#8197;an intramolecular radical cyclization to construct the 6/6/6/6&#8208;tetracycle of dysideanone&#8197;B and an intramolecular Heck reaction to forge the 6/6/5/6&#8208;fused core structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A. A late&#8208;stage introduction of the ethoxy group in dysideanone&#8197;B reveals that this group might come from the solvent ethanol. The structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A has been revised based on our chemical total synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Benzothiophene/Benzofuran&#8208;Fused Biaryls by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed Arene Formation</title>

The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed enantioselective de novo synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls from enals and 2&#8208;benzylbenzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes has been developed. This cascade process comprises a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion, allowing rapid access to atropoisomeric tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl scaffolds are prevalent in natural products, chiral ligands, and organocatalysts. However, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed de novo construction of an aromatic ring with concomitant axial chirality induction for the synthesis of biaryl atropisomers is far less developed, and the efficient synthesis of axially chiral tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls remains an unsolved problem under NHC catalysis. Reported here is an NHC&#8208;catalyzed de novo synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls from enals and 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes through a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization cascade with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion. The developed method provides efficient and general access to novel axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls in high enantioselectivities and works well for the synthesis of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls.

         <title>Enzyme Mimic Facilitated Artificial Cell to Mammalian Cell Signal Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyzing biochemical reactions with enzymes and communicating with neighboring cells via chemical signaling are two fundamental cellular features that play a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of organisms. Herein, we present an artificial enzyme (AE) facilitated signal transfer between artificial cells (ACs) and mammalian HepG2 cells. We synthesize metalloporphyrins (MPs) based AEs that mimic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) to catalyze a dealkylation and a hydroxylation reaction, exemplified by the conversion of resorufin ethyl ether (REE) to resorufin and coumarin (COU) to 7&#8208;hydroxycoumarin (7&#8208;HC), respectively. The AEs are immobilized in hydrogels to produce ACs that generate the two diffusive fluorophores, which can diffuse into HepG2 cells and result in dual intracellular emissions. This work highlights the use of AEs to promote AC to mammalian signal transfer, which opens up new opportunities for integrating the synthetic and living world with a bottom&#8208;up strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;directed modification of active Matrix Metalloproteases: New activity&#8208;based probes with no photolabile group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activity&#8208;based probes enable discriminating between the active enzyme and its inactive or inactivated counterparts. Since metalloproteases catalysis is non&#8208;covalent, activity&#8208;based probes targeting them have been systematically developed by decorating reversible inhibitors with photo&#8208;crosslinkers. By exploiting two types of ligand&#8208;guided chemistry, we identified novel activity&#8208;based probes capable of covalently modifying matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) active site without any external trigger. The ability of these probes to label recombinant MMPs was validated in vitro and the identity of the main labelling sites within their S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rsquo; region unambiguously assigned. We also demonstrated that our affinity probes can react with rhMMP12 at nanogram scale present at 0.07% (w/w) in complex proteomes. &amp;nbsp;Finally, this ligand&#8208;directed chemistry was successfully applied to label active MMP&#8208;12 secreted by eukaryote cells. We believe that this approach could be transferred more widely to many other metalloproteases, thus contributing to tackle their unresolved proteomic profiling in vivo.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phytochrome proteins are light receptors that play a pivotal role in regulating the life cycles of plants and microorganisms. Intriguingly, while cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 and cyanobacteriochrome AnPixJ use the same phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore to absorb light, their excited&#8208;state behavior is very different. We employ multiscale calculations to rationalize the different early photoisomerization mechanisms of PCB in Cph1 and AnPixJ. We find that their electronic S  1  , T  1  , and S  0  potential minima exhibit distinct geometric and electronic structures due to different hydrogen bond networks with the protein environment. These specific interactions influence the S  1  electronic structures along the photoisomerization paths, ultimately leading to internal conversion in Cph1 but intersystem crossing in AnPixJ. This explains why the excited&#8208;state relaxation in AnPixJ is much slower (ca. 100 ns) than in Cph1 (ca. 30 ps). Further, we predict that efficient internal conversion in AnPixJ can be achieved upon protonating the carboxylic group that interacts with PCB. Our work not only exemplifies the decisive role of protonation in tuning the photochemistry of biological chromophores, but also represents an important step toward comprehensive understanding the natural evolution of bilin&#8208;containing photoreceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective bacterial targeting and infection&#8208;triggered release of antibiotic colistin conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The treatment of life&#8208;threatening diseases with small molecule drugs often leads to a fragile balance between desired efficacy and undesired toxic effects. A prominent example concerns the natural lipopeptide colistin that has been re&#8208;introduced clinically as a &#8216;last resort&#8217; antibiotic for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant infections, in spite of strong and frequent nephrotoxic effects. In order to render such potent, but toxic antibiotics more selective, we have explored a novel conjugation strategy that includes drug accumulation followed by infection&#8208;triggered release of the drug. Bacterial targeting was achieved using a modified fragment of the human antimicrobial peptide ubiquicidin, as demonstrated by fluorophore&#8208;tagged variants. To limit the release of the effector colistin only to infection&#8208;related situations, we introduced a linker that was cleaved by neutrophil elastase (NE), an enzyme secreted by neutrophils at infection sites. The linker carried an optimized sequence of amino acids that was required to assure sufficient cleavage efficiency. The antibacterial activity of five regioisomeric conjugates prepared by total synthesis was masked, but was released upon exposure to recombinant NE when the linker was attached to amino acids at the 1&#8208; or the 3&#8208;position of colistin. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept was achieved in co&#8208;cultures of primary human neutrophils and  Escherichia  coli that induced the secretion of NE, the release of free colistin, and an antibacterial efficacy that was equal to that of free colistin.</dc:description>

         <title>Current&#8208;density regulating lithium metal directional deposition for long cycle&#8208;life Li metal batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncontrolled dendrite formation in the high energy density of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) may pose serious safety risks. While numerous studies have attempted to protect separators, these proposed methods fail to effectively inhibit upward dendrite growth that punctures through the separator. Here, we introduce a novel &#8216;orientated&#8208;growth&#8217; strategy that transfers the main depositional interface to the anode/current collector interface from the anode/separator interface. We placed a layer of cellulose/graphene carbon composite aerogel (CCA) between the current collector and the anode (LCL&#8208;bottom). This layer works as a charge organizer; it induces a higher apparent current density and encourages Li to deposit at the anode/current collector interface. Both  in situ  and  ex situ  images of the electrode demonstrate that the anode part of the cell has been flipped; with the newly deposited particles facing the current collector and the smooth surface facing the separator. Electrochemical characterization of the electrode in half and full cells showed outstanding cyclic stability and rate capability, with the LCL&#8208;bottom/LPF full cell capable of maintaining 94% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. We believe that this innovative strategy will leapfrog the barriers of LMBs development.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitaxial Nickel Ferrocyanide Stabilizes Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortions of Manganese Ferrocyanide for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based Prussian Blue, Na2&#8208;&#948;Mn[Fe(CN)6] (MnPB), is an auspicious candidate for sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials due to its high capacity. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay during battery cycling due to the destabilizing Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions it undergoes as Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+. In this work, the structure is stabilized by a thin epitaxial surface layer of nickel&#8208;based Prussian Blue (Na2&#8208;&#948;Ni[Fe(CN)6]). The one&#8208;pot synthesis relies on a chelating agent with an unequal affinity for Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions, which prevents Ni2+ from reacting until the Mn2+ is consumed. This is a new and simpler synthesis of core&#8208;shell materials, which traditionally require several steps. The resulting material has an electrochemical capacity of 93 mA h g&#8208;1, of which it retains 96% after 500 charge&#8208;discharge cycles (vs 37% for MnPB). The material&#8217;s rate capability is also remarkable: at 4 A g&#8208;1 (ca. 55 C) it can reversibly store 70 mA h g&#8208;1, which is also reflected in its diffusion coefficient of ~10&#8208;8 cm2 s&#8208;1. The epitaxial nature of the outer layer appears to exert an anisotropic strain on the inner layer, which may prevent the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions it normally undergoes during de&#8208;sodiation.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Approach to Convert Hemicyanine Dyes into Highly Optimized Photoacoustic Scaffolds for Analyte Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents are based on the repurposing of existing fluorescent dye platforms that exhibit non&#8208;optimal properties for PA applications. Herein, we introduce PA&#8208;HD, a new dye scaffold optimized for PA probe development which features an increase in sensitivity of 4.8&#8208;fold and a red&#8208;shift of the &#955;  abs  from 690 nm to 745 nm to enable ratiometric imaging. Computational modelling was employed to elucidate the origin of these enhanced properties. Moreover, to demonstrate the generalizability of our remodeling efforts, we developed three probes for &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal), nitroreductase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR), and H  2  O  2  (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H  2  O  2  ). We generated two cancer models to evaluate PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR. Additionally, we employed a murine model of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease to test PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H  2  O  2  . In this latter example, we observed a PA signal increase at 735 nm of 1.79 &#177; 0.20&#8208;fold relative to background indicating the presence of oxidative stress. These results were confirmed via ratiometric calibration which was not possible using the parent HD platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Etherification of Branched Aldehydes via an Oxidative Umpolung Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saturated carbonyl compounds are, via their enolate analogs, inherently nucleophilic at the &#945;&#8208;position. In the presence of a benzoquinone oxidant, the polarity of the &#945;&#8208;position of racemic &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes is inverted, allowing for an enantioselective etherification using readily available oxygen&#8208;based nucleophiles and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. A survey of benzoquinone oxidants identified  p  &#8208;fluoranil and DDQ as suitable reaction partners.  p  &#8208;Fluoranil enables the preparation of &#945;&#8208;aryloxylated aldehydes using phenol nucleophiles in up to 91%  ee  , following either a one&#8208;step or a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol. DDQ allows for a more general etherification protocol in combination with a broader range of alcohol nucleophiles with enantioselectivities up to 95%  ee  . Control experiments and isolation of a key quinol intermediate supports mechanism proceeding via a S  N  2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution. These studies provide the basis for an aminocatalytic umpolung concept that allows for the asymmetric construction of tertiary ethers in the &#945;&#8208;position of aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Hydro(Chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of Diazo Compounds with Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical synthesis of SF5Cl from sulfur powder, dry KF, and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) in MeCN is described. The new synthetic utility of SF5Cl is well demonstrated by the chemoselective hydro(chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of diazo compounds.







Abstract
Pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl) is the most prevalent reagent for the incorporation of SF5 group into organic compounds. However, the preparation of SF5Cl often relies on hazardous reagents and specialized apparatus. Herein, we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solution of SF5Cl in n&#8208;hexane under gas&#8208;reagent&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic application of SF5Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro&#8208; and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K3PO4 or copper catalyst, respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various &#945;&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds of high value for potential applications.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl or Monocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available and bench&#8208;stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds are shown to undergo Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecific deoxygenative cyclopropanation. This method has led to an array of valuable cyclopropanes in yields of up to 90&#8201;% and with exclusive regioselectivity. This strategy was further applied to the cyclopropanation of a simple monocarbonyl compound.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes by the decomposition of diazo compounds is a powerful and straightforward strategy to produce cyclopropanes, but is tempered by the potentially explosive nature of diazo substrates. Herein we report the Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecific deoxygenative cyclopropanation of readily available and bench&#8208;stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, in which one of the two carbonyl groups acts as a carbene equivalent upon deoxygenation and engages in the subsequent cyclopropanation process. The use of a commercially available Mo catalyst afforded an array of valuable cyclopropanes with exclusive regioselectivity in up to 90&#8201;% yield. The synthetic utility of this method was further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and the cyclopropanation of a simple monocarbonyl compound. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that phosphine (or silane) acts as both a mild reductant and a good oxygen acceptor that efficiently regenerates the catalytically active Mo catalyst through reduction of the Mo&#8208;oxo complexes.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dealkenylative Arylation of Alkenes with Arylboronic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes with arylboronic compounds has been developed to provide an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
The C&#8722;C bond formation reaction represents a fundamental and important transformation in synthetic chemistry, and exploring new types of C&#8722;C bond formation reactions is recognized as appealing, yet challenging. Herein, we disclose the first example of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes with arylboronic compounds, thereby providing an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemoselectivity. In this method, C(aryl)&#8722;C(alkenyl) and C(alkenyl)&#8722;C(alkenyl) bonds in various alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes can be cleaved via a hydrometalation and followed by &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination pathway for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions. Furthermore, a series of novel organic fluorescent molecules with excellent photophysical properties has been efficiently constructed with this protocol.

         <title>Atomic Tungsten on Graphene with Unique Coordination Enabling Kinetically Boosted Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic tungsten on graphene with a unique W state of the W&#8208;N2O2 structure are first used to decorate the separator of a Li&#8208;S battery to promote its electrochemical performance. The unique local coordination structure of W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C moiety not only acts as an active site for anchoring lithium polysulfides, but also boosts their kinetic conversion via electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Use of catalytic materials is regarded as the most desirable strategy to cope with sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) transformation and severe shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;utilization are advantagous in serving as anchoring and electrocatalytic centers for LiPSs. Herein, a novel kind of tungsten (W) SAC immobilized on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (W/NG) with a unique W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C coordination configuration and a high W loading of 8.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% is proposed by a self&#8208;template and self&#8208;reduction strategy. The local coordination environment of W atom endows the W/NG with elevated LiPSs adsorption ability and catalytic activity. LSBs equipped with W/NG modified separator manifest greatly improved electrochemical performances with high cycling stability over 1000&#8197;cycles and ultrahigh rate capability. It indicates high areal capacity of 6.24&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with robust cycling life at a high sulfur mass loading of 8.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Unified Approach for the Total Synthesis of cyclo&#8208;Archaeol, iso&#8208;Caldarchaeol, Caldarchaeol, and Mycoketide</title>

Cyclo&#8208;archaeol, iso&#8208;caldarchaeol, caldarchaeol, and mycoketide are prepared employing asymmetric hydrogenation to prepare the multiple stereocenters.







Abstract
Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkene hydrogenation is presented as the strategy par excellence to prepare saturated isoprenoids and mycoketides. This highly stereoselective synthesis approach is combined with an established 13C&#8208;NMR method to determine the enantioselectivity of each methyl&#8208;branched stereocenter. It is shown that this analysis is fit for purpose and the combination allows the synthesis of the title compounds with a significant increase in efficiency.

         <dc:description>
A coupling module composed of (trimethylsilyl)ethynyl and chlorophenyl groups selectively accelerated sluggish desilylative on&#8208;surface Sonogashira coupling with homocoupling efficiently suppressed. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) with a CO&#8208;functionalized tip enabled investigation of this coupling reaction and evaluation of its chemoselectivity (see picture).







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis is a powerful method for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;A coupling module composed of (trimethylsilyl)ethynyl and chlorophenyl groups selectively accelerated sluggish desilylative on-surface Sonogashira coupling with homocoupling efficiently suppressed. Bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) with a CO-functionalized tip enabled investigation of this coupling reaction and evaluation of its chemoselectivity (see picture).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-surface synthesis is a powerful method for the fabrication of &#960;-conjugated nanomaterials. Herein, we demonstrate chemoselective Sonogashira coupling between (trimethylsilyl)ethynyl and chlorophenyl groups in silylethynyl- and chloro-substituted partially fluorinated phenylene ethynylenes (SiCPFPEs) on Ag(111). The desilylative Sonogashira coupling occurred with high chemoselectivity up to 75&#8201;%, while the competing Ullmann and desilylative Glaser homocoupling reactions were suppressed. A combination of bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) and DFT calculations revealed that the oligomers were obtained by the formation of intermolecular silylene tethers (-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si-) through CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Si bond activation at 130&#8201;&#176;C and subsequent elimination of the tethers at an elevated temperature of 200&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrolyte Structure of Lithium Polysulfides with Anti&#8208;Reductive Solvent Shells for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte structure of lithium polysulfides (PSs) with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proven to be a key reason for the decreased reactivity of PSs towards Li. With isopropyl ether as a cosolvent, the reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. The stability of practical Li&#8211;S batteries was improved and a pouch cell of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated.







Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising secondary battery. However, constant parasitic reactions between the Li anode and soluble polysulfide (PS) intermediates significantly deteriorate the working Li anode. The rational design to inhibit the parasitic reactions is plagued by the inability to understand and regulate the electrolyte structure of PSs. Herein, the electrolyte structure of PSs with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled by molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proven to be a key reason for the decreased reactivity of PSs towards Li. With isopropyl ether (DIPE) as a cosolvent, DIPE molecules tend to distribute in the outer solvent shell due to poor solvating power. Furthermore, DIPE is more stable than conventional ether solvents against Li metal. The reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. Consequently, the cycling performance of working Li&#8211;S batteries was significantly improved and a pouch cell of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated. The fundamental understanding in this work provides an unprecedented ground to understand the electrolyte structure of PSs and the rational electrolyte design in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymers for Efficient Fluorocarbon&#8208;Based Adsorption Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first joint experimental&#8211;computational study of fluorocarbon adsorption into porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) reveals that the presence of structure defects leading to the creation of mesopores with a broad size range offers not only exceptional high&#8208;uptake adsorption of fluorocarbon R134a, but also unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms. COPs are thus proven to be excellent sorbent materials for cooling applications.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based cooling is an energy&#8208;efficient renewable&#8208;energy technology that can be driven using low&#8208;grade industrial waste heat and/or solar heat. Here, we report the first exploration of fluorocarbon adsorption using porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) for this cooling application. High fluorocarbon R134a equilibrium capacities and unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms are revealed for the materials, namely COP&#8208;2 and COP&#8208;3. The key role of mesoporous defects on this unusual adsorption behavior was demonstrated by molecular simulations based on atomistic defect&#8208;containing models built for both porous COPs. Analysis of simulated R134a adsorption isotherms for various defect&#8208;containing atomistic models of the COPs shows a direct correlation between higher fluorocarbon adsorption capacities and increasing pore volumes induced by defects. Combined with their high porosities, excellent reversibility, fast kinetics, and large operating window, these defect&#8208;containing porous COPs are promising for adsorption&#8208;based cooling applications.

         <title>Origin of the&#160;&#945;&#8208;Effect in SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect is a term used to explain the dramatically enhanced reactivity of&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophiles (R&#8211;Y&#8211;X:&#8211;  ) compared to their parent normal nucleophile (R&#8211;X:&#8211;  ) by deviating from the classical Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type reactivity&#8211;basicity relationship. The exact origin of this effect is, however, still heavily under debate. In this work, we have quantum chemically analyzed the&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect of a set of anionic nucleophiles, including&#160;  O&#8208;,&#160;N&#8208; and&#160;S&#8208;based normal and&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophiles, participating in an SN2 reaction with&#160; ethyl chloride using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. Our activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses identified two criteria an&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophile needs to fulfill in order to show&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect: (i) a small HOMO lobe on the nucleophilic center, pointing towards the substrate, to reduce the repulsive occupied&#8211;occupied orbital overlap and hence (steric) Pauli repulsion with the substrate; and (ii) a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital overlap with the substrate, as a consequence of the first criterion, by reducing the HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital energy gap. If one of these two criteria is not fulfilled, one can expect no&#160;a&#8208;effect or inverse&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect. These principles will allow one to qualitatively predict if an&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophile possesses&#160;&#945;&#8208;effect solely based on the electronic structure of the&#160;&#945;&#8208;nucleophile and, therefore, have the potential to enable chemists to better understand these fundamental&#160;reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Ionization Induced Stable White Organic Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials with afterglow duration in the scale of minutes or even hours are still rare. Most OLPL systems are based on exciplexes, which require complicated multi&#8208;component system in order to realize white afterglow with slightly compromised duration and color stability. In this work, OLPLs lasting from 20 to 40 minutes are realized with a simple binary system based on two&#8208;photon ionization mechanism, which can harvest simultaneously excitons from both singlet and triplet excited states, making it potentially the most promising candidate to achieve stable white OLPL. Through modulation and optimization of dopant structures in dibenzo[b,d]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yldiphenyl phosphine oxide host, the emission profiles of afterglow can be readily tuned from cyan (0.19, 0.22), cold white (0.31, 0.35), standard white (0.33, 0.33) to warm white (0.31, 0.46), with excellent color consistency.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Intermolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions for Water&#8208;Stable Low Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optoelectronically active hybrid lead halide perovskites dissociates in water. To prevent this dissociation, here, we introduce long&#8208;range intermolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between A&#8208;site cations of hybrid perovskites. An aromatic diamine like 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridine, if protonated, can show a long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; stacking, and therefore, serves as our A&#8208;site cation. Consequently, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridinium lead bromide [(4,4&#8242;&#8208;TMDP)Pb  2  Br  6  ], a one&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite, remains completely stable after continuous water treatment for six months. Mechanistic insights about the cation&#8208;&#960; interactions are obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The concept of long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is further extended to another A&#8208;site cation 4,4&#8242;&#8208;ethylenedipyridinium ion (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP), forming water&#8208;stable (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP)Pb  2  Br  6  perovskite. These water&#8208;stable perovskites are then used to fabricate white light&#8208;emitting diode and for light up&#8208;conversion through tunable third&#8208;harmonic generation. Note that the achieved water stability is the intrinsic stability of perovskite composition, unlike the prior approach of encapsulating the unstable perovskite material (or device) by water&#8208;resistant materials. The introduced cation&#8208;&#960; interactions can be a breakthrough strategy in designing many more compositions of water&#8208;stable low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optoelectronically active hybrid lead halide perovskites dissociates in water. To prevent this dissociation, here, we introduce long-range intermolecular cation-&#960; interactions between A-site cations of hybrid perovskites. An aromatic diamine like 4,4&#8242;-trimethylenedipyridine, if protonated, can show a long-range cation-&#960; stacking, and therefore, serves as our A-site cation. Consequently, 4,4&#8242;-trimethylenedipyridinium lead bromide [(4,4&#8242;-TMDP)Pb  2  Br  6  ], a one-dimensional hybrid perovskite, remains completely stable after continuous water treatment for six months. Mechanistic insights about the cation-&#960; interactions are obtained by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

         <title>Dynamic Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution of Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dynamic nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines (SNTz) is presented herein. It combines all the advantages of dynamic covalent chemistry with the versatility of the tetrazine moiety. Indeed, libraries of compounds or sophisticated molecular structures can be easily obtained, which are susceptible to post&#8208;functionalization by Inverse Electron Demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which also locks the exchange. Additionally, the structures obtained can be disassembled upon the application of the right stimulus, either UV&#8208;irradiation or a suitable chemical reagent. Moreover, SNTz is compatible with the imine chemistry of anilines. The high potential of this methodology has been proved by building two responsive supramolecular systems: A macrocycle that displays a light&#8208;induced release of acetylcholine; and a truncated [4+6] tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent fluorescent cage which is disassembled by thiols unless it is post&#8208;stabilized by IEDDA.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new compound (  1  ) formed by two antiparallelly disposed tetracyano thienoquinoidal units has been synthesized and studied by electrochemistry, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR, IR, EPR and transient spectroscopies. Self&#8208;assembly of  1  on a Au(111) surface has been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. Experiments have been rationalized by quantum chemical calculations.  1  exhibits a unique charge distribution in its anionic form, with a gradient of charge yielding a neat molecular in&#8208;plane electric dipole momentum, which transforms out&#8208;of&#8208;plane after surface deposition due to twisted&#8594;folded conformational change and to partial charge transfer from Au(111).

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic cofactor regeneration coupled to CO2 fixation in a redox&#8208;active hydrogel for stereoselective C&#8208;C bond formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable capture and conversion of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) is key to achieving a circular carbon economy. Bioelectrocatalysis, which aims at using renewable energies to power the highly specific, direct transformation of CO  2  into value added products holds promise to achieve this goal. However, the functional integration of CO  2  &#8208;fixing enzymes onto electrode materials for the electrosynthesis of stereochemically complex molecules remains to be demonstrated. Here, we show the electricity&#8208;driven regio&#8208; and stereoselective incorporation of CO  2  into crotonyl&#8208;CoA by an NADPH&#8208;dependent enzymatic reductive carboxylation. Co&#8208;Immobilization of a ferredoxin NADP  +  reductase and crotonyl&#8208;CoA carboxylase/reductase within a 2,2&#180;&#8208;viologen modified hydrogel enabled iterative NADPH recycling and stereoselective formation of (2  S  )&#8208;ethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA, a prospective intermediate towards multi&#8208;carbon products from CO  2  , with 92&#160;&#177;&#160;6&#160;% faradaic efficiency and at a rate of 1.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm  &#8208;2  &#160;h  &#8208;1  . This approach opens the way for realizing even more complex bioelectrocatalyic cascades in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Covalent Reactivity of a Kinase Inhibitor with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent kinase inhibitors account for some of the most successful drugs that have recently entered the clinic and many others are in preclinical development. A common strategy is to target cysteines in the vicinity of the ATP binding site using an acrylamide electrophile. To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, it could be advantageous to control the reactivity of these electrophiles with light. Here, we introduce covalent inhibitors of the kinase JNK3 that function as photoswitchable affinity labels (PALs). Our lead compounds contain a diazocine photoswitch, are poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitors in the dark, and becomes effective covalent inhibitors after irradiation with visible light. Our proposed mode of action is supported by X&#8208;ray structures that explain why these compounds are unreactive in the dark and undergo proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following exposure to light.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Demethylation by a Cas13d&#8208;Directed Demethylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  1  &#8208;methyladenosine (m  1  A) is a prevalent and reversible RNA modification, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA fate and gene expression. However, the lack of tools to precisely manipulate m  1  A sites in specific transcripts has hindered efforts to  clarify the association between a specific m  1  A&#8208;modified transcript and its phenotypic outcomes.  Here we develop a CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d&#8208;based tool called  re  engineered m  1  A  mo  dification  v  alid  er  aser (termed &#8220;REMOVER&#8221;) for targeted m  1  A demethylation of a specific transcript. The catalytically inactive RfxCas13d (dCasRx) is fused to the m  1  A demethylase ALKBH3, and the dCasRx&#8208;ALKBH3 fusion protein can mediate potent demethylation of m  1  A&#8208;modified RNAs. We further find that REMOVER can specifically demethylate m  1  A of MALAT1 and PRUNE1 RNAs, thereby significantly increasing their stability. Our study establishes REMOVER as a tool for targeted RNA demethylation of specific m  1  A&#8208;modified transcripts, which enables further elucidation of the relationship between m  1  A modification of specific transcripts and their phenotypic outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial order of functional modules enabling diverse intracellular performance of fluorescent probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To overcome a series of challenges in tumor therapy, modular&#8208;agent probes (MAPs) comprised of various functional modules have been proposed. Nowadays, researchers have tried to optimize the MAPs by exploiting the new modules or increasing the numbers of module, while neglecting the configuration of various modules. Here, we focus on the different spatial&#8208;arrangements of existing modules. By utilizing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative with stereochemical structure and dual modifiable end&#8208;group sites as small molecule scaffold, two MAPs with same modular agents (module T for enhancing the internalization of MAPs by tumor cells and module M for causing mitochondrial dysfunction) but different spatial&#8208;arrangements (on the one side, TM&#8208;AIE, and two sides, T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M, of the molecule scaffold) are designed. It was found that T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M with bigger RGD binding angle performed higher specificity, while TM&#8208;AIE characterizing longer &#945;&#8208;helix structure displayed superior toxicity. This interesting phenomenon sheds light on the design concept of future MAPs and opens a window for the renaissance of existing MAPs by rearranging modules.</dc:description>

By utilizing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative with stereochemical structure and dual modifiable end-group sites as small molecule scaffold, two MAPs with same modular agents (module T for enhancing the internalization of MAPs by tumor cells and module M for causing mitochondrial dysfunction) but different spatial-arrangements (on the one side, TM-AIE, and two sides, T-AIE-M, of the molecule scaffold) are designed. It was found that T-AIE-M with bigger RGD binding angle performed higher specificity, while TM-AIE characterizing longer &#945;-helix structure displayed superior toxicity. This interesting phenomenon sheds light on the design concept of future MAPs and opens a window for the renaissance of existing MAPs by rearranging modules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reducing defects density and enhancing hole extraction for efficient perovskite solar cells enabled by &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular doping is an of significance approach to reduce defects density of perovskite and to improve interfacial charge extraction in perovskite solar cells. Here, we show a new strategy for chemical doping of perovskite via an organic small molecule, which features a fused tricyclic core, showing strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;Pb  2+  interactions with under&#8208;coordinated Pb  2+  in perovskite. This &#960;&#8208;Pb  2+  interactions could reduce defects density of the perovskite and suppress the nonradiative recombination, which was also confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. In addition, this doping via &#960;&#8208;Pb  2+  interactions could deepen the surface potential and downshift the work function of the doped perovskite film, facilitating the hole extraction to hole transport layer. As a result, the doped device showed excellent efficiency of 21.41% with ignorable hysteresis. This strategy of fused tricyclic core&#8208;based doping provides a new perspective for the design of new organic materials to improve the device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional metal organic framework film for realizing optoelectronic synaptic plasticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) film as active layer show promising application prospects in various fields including the sensors, catalysis, and electronic device. However, exploring the application of 2D MOF film in the field of artificial synapses has not been implemented yet. In this work, we fabricated one kind of novel monolayer MOF film (Cu&#8211;THPP, THPP = 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;21H,23H&#8208;porphine), and further used it as an active layer to explore the application in the simulation of human brain synapses. It shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties, and exhibits the foundation function of synapses such as long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), and the conversion of STP to LTP. Most critically, the MOF based artificial synaptic device exhibit an excellent stability in atmosphere. This work opens the door for the application of MOF film in the simulation of human brain synapses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Direct Organocatalytic Enantioselective Route to Functionalized trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Products Having the Norcarane Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective methodology to construct trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder scaffolds by organocatalysis with excellent selectivity, high yield and up to five contiguous stereocenters is presented. The reaction concept integrates the halogen effect and a novel discovered pseudo&#8208;halogen effect to direct an endo&#8208;selective, secondary&#8208;amine catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reaction allowing for the subsequent formation of trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadducts featuring the norcarene scaffold. The methodology relies on the reaction between an in situ generated trienamine and an &#945;&#8208;brominated or &#945;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;halogenated enone to form a fleeting cis&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder intermediate. The endo&#8208;transition state&#8212;enhanced by the (pseudo&#8208;)halogen effect&#8212;sets the stereochemistry that allows for a subsequent SN2&#8208;like reaction at a tertiary center to obtain the trans&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder scaffold. The mechanism was investigated and supported by experimental results as well as computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Engineered Supported Gold Clusters as a Stable Catalyst for Propylene Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing a stable and selective catalyst with high H  2  utilisation is of pivotal importance for the direct gas&#8208;phase epoxidation of propylene. This work describes a facile one&#8208;pot methodology to synthesise ligand&#8208;stabilised sub&#8208;nanometre gold clusters immobilised onto a zeolitic support (TS&#8208;1) to engineer a stable Au/TS&#8208;1 catalyst. A non&#8208;thermal O  2  plasma technique is used for the quick removal of ligands with limited increase in particle size. Compared to untreated Au/TS&#8208;1 catalysts prepared using the deposition precipitation method, the synthesised catalyst exhibits improved catalytic performance, including 10 times longer lifetime (&gt;20 days), increased PO selectivity and hydrogen efficiency in direct gas phase epoxidation. The structure&#8208;stability relationship of the catalyst is illustrated using multiple characterisation techniques, such as XPS,  31  P MAS NMR, DR&#8208;UV/VIS, HRTEM and TGA. It is hypothesised that the ligands play a guardian role in stabilising the Au particle size, which is vital in this reaction. This strategy is a promising approach towards designing a more stable and reproducible heterogeneous catalyst.</dc:description>
