         <title>Ultrafast Construct Local Acidic Microenvironment of Boron&#8208;Intercalated Osmium with Anti&#8208;Precipitation and Corrosion&#8208;Resistant for Seawater&#8208;splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interstitial boron in B&#8208;Os catalysts exhibit lower overpotential and superior stability compared with commercial Pt/C. Experimentally, the electron&#8208;rich Os can effectively inhibit precipitation formation and chloride corrosion in natural seawater environment, which is highly consistent with theoretical calculations and experimental observations. In addition, the catalyst also demonstrates outstanding performance in anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, which shows excellent prospects for commercial applications.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis represents a promising avenue for hydrogen production, nevertheless, the Cl&#8722; corrosion and surface deposition of Ca(OH)2/Mg(OH)2 hinder its practical application by deactivation. Herein, an interstitial boron doped osmium (B&#8208;Os) is ultrafast (10&#160;s) constructed by microwave quasi&#8208;solid approach, where theoretical and experimental analysis proves that the interstitial boron triggers electron enrichment at the Os site and the formation of negative charge centers. The modified electronic structure electrostatically inhibits Cl&#8722; corrosion as well as promotes H3O+ adsorption, creating a local acidic microenvironment in the natural seawater, neutralizing OH&#8722; and effectively avoiding Ca2+/Mg2+ deposition. In situ spectroscopy and local pH monitoring confirm the pivotal role of the microenvironment in regulating reaction kinetics and stability. Therefore, B&#8208;Os exhibits a remarkably low overpotential, for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), of 7 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater, while maintaining stable performance over 400 h of stable operation in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C. Economic evaluation highlights its hydrogen production costs ($0.81 GGE&#8722;1) undercutting the U.S. DOE target.

         <title>Retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Polymerization of Tetrabenzoporphyrin into Pyramidal Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin derivative with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties has been accomplished by applying the thermal precursor approach with the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in the system. Furthermore, the polymerization leads to the formation of unique pyramid&#8208;like multilayer structures with a spiral nature.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of &#960;&#8208;extended compounds with hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites remains challenging, especially at high concentrations, due to their limited solubility in nonpolar solvents. Herein, we report a novel method incorporating a thermal precursor approach for the supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) derivative with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites and chiral cholesterol groups (BPChol). Polymerization in the nonpolar solvent tetralin is induced by the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the highly soluble precursor (CPChol) to BPChol in the hot solution and subsequent natural cooling, as confirmed by monitoring absorption spectra. The emergence of circular dichroism signals corroborates the formation of aggregates with supramolecular chirality, as the first chiroptical characterization of BP aggregates. Detailed structural analysis using high&#8208;resolution microscopies reveals a unique pyramidal multilayer structure with a spiral nature. Additionally, faster cooling produces monolayer nanosheets, which differ from the multilayer structures formed upon natural cooling. This is due to a different nucleation process in the cooperative polymerization. By using the nanosheets as seeds, seed&#8208;induced polymerization is achieved, resulting in extended sheets. Notably, the indirect precursor method using CPChol enables outstanding polymerization at high concentrations (mM level) to afford micro&#8208;sized pyramids, which cannot be realized by a direct method using BPChol.

         <title>Enhancing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Step&#8208;Growth Polymers by Narrowing Their Molar Mass Distribution: A Dynamic Bond&#8208;Mediated Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces asymmetric dynamic bond&#8208;mediated polymerization (ADBP), a method to narrow molar mass distributions in step&#8208;growth polymers via asymmetric, reversibly&#8208;deactivated AA'&#8208;type electrophiles. ADBP initially forms low&#8208;dispersity dimers/trimers, later polymerizing into polyurethanes with controlled dispersities (&#272;&#160;&#8804;&#160;1.5), yielding materials with enhanced nanostructure ordering and improved mechanical properties compared to traditional methods.








Abstract
Step&#8208;growth polymerization (SGP) typically produces polymers with exceptional versatility in terms of applications, but its inherently uncontrolled nature leads to broad molecular weight distributions (&#272;) and consequently polymers with poor nanostructure control in comparison to chain growth polymers. In this study, we provide a solution to this long&#8208;lasting problem by introducing a new concept, asymmetric dynamic bond mediated polymerization (ADBP). In this case, the polymerization between asymmetric and reversibly deactivated AA&#8217;&#8208;type dielectrophiles and B2&#8208;type dinucleophiles has a preferential reaction pathway between the functionality A&#8217; of the asymmetric AA&#8217; monomer with B2. We observe that this polymerization allows us to achieve better control of the step&#8208;growth process where in the first stage only well&#8208;defined trimers and dimers are primarily formed up to conversion (p)&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.6, followed by their polymerization stage (p&#160;&#8805;&#160;0.6). This leads to polymers with reduced &#272; (&lt;1.5), in comparison to traditional SGP, and improved molar mass control. Such technique is further exploited to prepare polyurethanes with &#272;&#160;=&#160;1.2, which exhibit the ability to form microphase&#8208;separated domains with higher ordering, giving rise to polyurethane thermosets with superior mechanical properties compared to a traditional SGP analog.

         <title>White Circularly Polarized OLEDs Enabled by Orthogonal Engineering of Achiral Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters and Chiral Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising strategy by orthogonal engineering of achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters and chiral orange assemblies was proposed to fabricate white circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This strategy leverages the high exciton utilization and chiral amplification, yielding a record gEL of 0.34 and EQEmax of 6.3%. This work represented the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art white CP&#8208;OLEDs, delivering the highest reported combination of external quantum efficiency (EQE) and gEL to date. 








Abstract
The development of white circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) faces a critical challenge in simultaneously achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and large dissymmetry factors (g), due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between exciton utilization and chirality amplification. Herein, we propose an orthogonal architecture synergizing an achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with chiral orange assemblies to overcome this limitation. The chiral assemblies, featuring exceptional chiroptical activity (|gabs| = 0.95 and |glum| = 0.85), are engineered as both photon&#8208;selective filters and emitters. When integrated with a blue TADF layer, this dual&#8208;layer design enables 100% internal quantum efficiency through TADF&#8208;enabled triplet harvesting and chiral amplification via selective absorption of blue photons with a specific polarization direction, generating amplified white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). The resulting white CP&#8208;OLED (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) achieves a record |gEL| of 0.34 alongside an EQEmax of 6.3%, demonstrating the unprecedented white CP&#8208;OLEDs when considering both EQE and gEL values. By optimizing the TADF doping ratio, a cool&#8208;white CP&#8208;OLED is realized with an EQE of 14.7% and |gEL| of 0.32. This work establishes a material orthogonal engineering to decouple exciton&#8208;chirality interdependencies, opening avenues for fabricating high&#8208;performance CPEL devices.

         <title>Bioinspired Anti&#8208;Freezing Hydrogel With Localized Ice Regulation for Subzero Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by freeze&#8208;tolerant organisms, we develop a bioinspired anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel by embedding bacterial membrane&#8208;anchored ice nucleating protein (BMIP)&#8208;loaded microgels (BGEL) into an ice binding protein (IBP)&#8208;containing PAMAC matrix. BMIP triggers localized ice nucleation in BGEL, while IBP suppresses further growth, spatially confining ice within BGEL. This ensures BGEL freezes at subzero temperatures but the surrounding PAMAC matrix remains unfrozen.








Abstract
Freezing hydrogels at subzero temperatures severely compromises mechanical flexibility, ionic conductivity, and structural integrity, thereby limiting their application in low&#8208;temperature environments. Hydrogel freezing involves both ice nucleation and ice growth; however, simultaneously inhibiting these two processes remains a significant challenge. In nature, freeze&#8208;tolerant organisms do not rely on completely preventing ice formation to survive freezing conditions. Instead, they utilize bacterial membrane&#8208;anchored ice nucleating protein (BMIP) to promote ice nucleation and ice binding protein (IBP) to regulate ice growth, thereby achieving freeze protection through precise ice management. Inspired by this biological strategy of &#8220;selective nucleation of small ice crystals with restricted growth,&#8221; we developed anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels by incorporating both BMIP and IBP. The anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels exhibit enhanced mechanical and electrical performance at low temperatures, with a non&#8208;freezing matrix stable down to &#8722;30&#176;C and excellent structural integrity over multiple freeze&#8208;thaw cycles. When employed as a functional component of a robotic hand designed for low&#8208;temperature operation and integrated with machine learning algorithms, the anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels enable precise recognition of object stiffness and size under ultra&#8208;low temperature conditions. This bioinspired approach provides a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels capable of supporting stable human&#8208;robot&#8208;environment interactions in harsh, low&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Targeting Integrated Sandwich&#8208;Structured Na3Zr2Si2PO12 Composite Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;like NZSP composite electrolyte was constructed by designing an artificial interface layer of SbF3 and PVDF on the anode and cathode sides, respectively. Due to the unique interface design, this PVDF&#8208;NZSP&#8208;SbF3 electrolyte could effectively address the interface contacts on both cathode/anode, thus facilitating the Na+ diffusion kinetics, thereby achieving excellent rate capability and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability for SMBs.








Abstract
Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) has stimulated considerable attention due to its remarkable ionic conductivity and exceptional chemical/electrochemical stability. However, an unstable electrolyte/electrode interface and large interface resistance severely restricted its practical application. To settle this issue, an interface&#8208;targeting integrated sandwich&#8208;like NZSP composite electrolyte was constructed by designing an artificial interface layer on both the anode and cathode sides. The uniformly deposited SbF3 layer on the anode side of NZSP instantly formed a NaxSb/NaF&#8208;rich conductive layer during discharging, which effectively suppressed the growth of Na dendrites. The flexible PVDF layer on the cathode side of NZSP mitigated volume expansion/contraction and thus enhanced the poor solid&#8211;solid interfacial contact. Befitting the unique interface design, the Na/SbF3&#8208;NZSP&#8208;SbF3/Na symmetric cells demonstrated a critical current density of up to 1.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and achieved ultra&#8208;stable plating/stripping cycling over 2600&#160;h at 0.1 and 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Noticeably, the Na3V2(PO4)3/PVDF&#8208;NZSP&#8208;SbF3/Na full cells attained a high capacity retention of 90.0% after 2100 cycles at 0.5 C. Even for a high mass loading of 10.33&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, Na3V2(PO4)3/PVDF&#8208;NZSP&#8208;SbF3/Na has no capacity attenuation over 50 cycles at 0.1 C. This bilateral interface design strategy promotes the utilization of NZSP electrolytes and offers an avenue for the development of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs).

         <title>Chiral Single Molecule with Biphenyl Component Exhibiting Both TADF and RTP Emissions Enables Highly Efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel chiral biphenyl&#8208;based single molecule emitter, CP&#8208;D3, with both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions, achieving the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 32.44% in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This represents the first report of a chiral single&#8208;molecule emitter incorporating a biphenyl component that exhibits simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions, as well as highly efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs. 








Abstract
Chiral single molecules that exhibit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) pose significant challenges, primarily due to their competitive luminescence mechanisms and the scarcity of studies on their applications in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). In this work, we develop a novel chiral emitter, CP&#8208;D3, with an axially chiral biphenyl segment selected as the chiral center. As a result, CP&#8208;D3 successfully exhibits both TADF and RTP properties with a high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of 91%. The high dissymmetry factors (gCPPL) of &#8722;7.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and +7.47&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 are obtained for (R/S)&#8208;CP&#8208;D3, respectively. Notably, the CP&#8208;D3&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 32.44%, which represents the highest value among chiral luminance materials based on an axially chiral biphenyl component. The gCPEL is recorded as &#8722;8.13&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4/+5.92&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 for (R/S)&#8208;CP&#8208;D3&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs. This work presents the first report on a chiral single&#8208;molecule emitter incorporating an axially chiral biphenyl component, which exhibits simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions and enables highly efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Folding Synthons for Designing Superselective and Ultrapermeable Artificial Water Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Butterfly&#8208;shaped nanotubes of 3.7&#160;nm in average length and 6.7&#160;&#197; in pore diameter demonstrate an ultrafast water conduction rate of 2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;H2O s&#8722;1 per channel, outperforming the naturally occurred aquaporin 1 by 140% respectively while concurrently achieving high rejections of both salts (i.e., NaCl and KCl) and protons.








Abstract
Water transport across biological membranes is essential for life, facilitated by water channel proteins like aquaporins (AQPs). Drawing inspiration from these natural systems, artificial water channels (AWCs) have emerged as transformative tools for advancing industrial and environmental applications. Herein, we report the design and comprehensive characterization of a groundbreaking class of AWCs, derived from unprecedented butterfly&#8208;shaped aromatic folding synthons, carefully engineered to emulate the functional attributes of natural AQPs. These foldamers, with their intricate helical architectures, exhibit exceptional water transport performance. Remarkably, the highest&#8208;performing AWC achieves an ultrafast water transport rate of 2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;H2O s&#8722;1 per channel&#8212;2.4 times the efficiency of AQP1&#8212;without the need for lipid anchors to preserve its functional orientation within phospholipid bilayers, while effectively excluding salts such as NaCl and KCl, along with protons. This work presents an ideal bio&#8208;inspired, high&#8208;performance artificial alternative to natural systems, demonstrating the remarkable potential of foldamer&#8208;based AWCs as next&#8208;generation solutions for tackling critical challenges in water purification and desalination.

         <title>A Streamlined Approach to Indoles, Pyrroles, and Benzimidazoles via Redox&#8208;Neutral Aromatization and CO Reduction Mediated by Cs2CO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have discovered a general method to convert vicinal alkyl and nitro groups on arenes or alkenes into various heteroaromatic compounds, including indoles, pyrroles, and benzimidazoles avoiding any transition metal. This protocol uses a redox&#8208;neutral aromatization and CO reduction sequence just using Cs2CO3, with high atom, step, and redox efficiency.








Abstract
The synthesis of nitrogen heteroarenes has a rich history, including many illustrious name reactions. These reactions often involve complex oxidative processes or the need for transition metal catalysts, and the synthesis of different N&#8208;heteroarenes typically requires a case&#8208;by&#8208;case approach. Here, we have discovered the conversion of vicinal alkyl and nitro groups on arenes or alkenes into an array of N&#8208;heteroarenes, including indoles and pyrroles. Moreover, our approach also facilitates the synthesis of benzimidazoles from ortho NH&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes. This versatile method leverages a redox&#8208;neutral aromatization and CO reduction sequence, uniquely utilizing Cs2CO3, and is remarkable for its omission of any transition metals. Our strategy is particularly noteworthy for its exceptional atom, step, and redox efficiency, offering significant advantages for the synthesis of alkaloids that are important in pharmaceutical applications. Extensive experimental and computational studies have allowed us to understand the preferred mechanistic pathways for these heteroarene formations.

         <title>A Highly Transparent Thermoplastic Synthesized from Ethylene that Melts Above 200&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a highly transparent ethylene&#8208;based thermoplastic (transmittance of 92%, haze of 8% and clarity of 92%) with a very low density (0.86g cm&#8722;3) and an high melting point (up to 228&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Polyolefin&#8208;based thermoplastics are the most widely used polymers and produced in megaton scale. Their applicability depends strongly on the melting point, and a high&#8208;melting ethylene&#8208;based plastic would be highly desirable. Herein, we report the synthesis of isotactic poly(4&#8208;ethylhex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) (P4EH), a highly transparent and ethylene&#8208;based thermoplastic that melts above 220&#160;&#176;C and has an extremely low density. Molecular catalysts were used to synthesize atactic, syndiotactic, and isotactic P4EH with narrow molecular weight distributions. Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts were used to synthesize isotactic and processable P4EH. Processable i&#8208;P4EH was used to produce discs, and a transmittance of 92%, a haze of 8% and a clarity of 92% were measured. In addition, a density of 0.86&#160;g cm&#8722;3 was observed.

         <title>Continuous Flow Electrochemistry Unlocks Broadly Applicable Arene C&#9472;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical C&#8211;H amination strategy enables efficient and scalable synthesis of (hetero)arylamines from electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arenes via a pyridination&#8211;aminolysis sequence. The method avoids strong oxidants and metal catalysts, delivering over 100 grams of product with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance.








Abstract
The direct C&#9472;H amination of arenes is a powerful strategy for synthesizing arylamines, yet existing methods often suffer from limited substrate scope, poor selectivity, or scalability issues, particularly for electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Here, we introduce a continuous flow electrochemical C&#9472;H amination via a pyridination&#8208;aminolysis sequence, enabling the efficient functionalization of arenes with diverse electronic properties. The method operates under continuous flow electrochemical conditions, avoiding the need for divided cells, strong chemical oxidants, or homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The broad substrate scope includes a wide range of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and halogenated arenes, as well as heterocycles, demonstrating excellent functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the process is readily scalable, as shown by a 4&#8208;day continuous operation in parallel microreactors, producing over 100 grams of aniline product with high efficiency. This study highlights the potential of continuous&#8208;flow electrochemistry as a versatile and practical platform for sustainable C&#9472;H functionalization in organic synthesis.

Chiral &#947;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;amines: Highly stereoselective nucleophilic fluoromethylation of C&#9552;C bonds with fluorinated sulfoximines was achieved by remote neighboring group participation of the nitro group. This transformation provides an effective solution to the long&#8208;standing challenge of the synthesis of chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;difluoro&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;monofluoroamines.








Abstract
There remains an ongoing challenge to develop facile methods for the preparation of chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;difluorinated amines, which are commonly considered a privileged motif in bioactive compounds. In this context, we report a straightforward protocol for the stereoselective nucleophilic difluoro(sulfoximidoyl)methylation of C&#9552;C bonds (considered to be more challenging than the reported C&#9552;O bonds), which exhibits high stereoselectivity and broad substrate scope. The key features of this chemistry include 1) stereoselective addition of the difluoro(sulfoximidoyl)methyl anion to C&#9552;C bonds, although it was considered to be highly unfavorable from the view of hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base (HSAB) theory; 2) intriguing neighboring group participation of the oxygen from the nitro group that was found to play a crucial role in controlling the stereoselectivity and efficiency of the transformation and was supported by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations. This method has been applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of several complex molecules and the preparation of enantioenriched bioactive &#947;&#8208;fluorinated amines, such as a phytopathogenic fungi inhibitor, TRPC6 and CDK11 inhibitors, and even monofluorinated lorcaserin, which further demonstrated the significance and potential of this approach.

Abstract
Magnetoelectric materials have attracted considerable interests due to their unique capability to facilitate reciprocal control between the charges and spins in matter. Based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) involving modulated and pulsed electric fields, we have studied a Ce (III)&#8208;based molecular qubit under electric control. We observed linear spin&#8208;electric coupling (SEC) in the powder sample, which challenges the previous routine of spectral analysis and strength estimation for SEC. We determined the SEC parameter |Txyz| to be 2.04(16) &#215; 10&#8722;10 m &#183; V&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude&#160;larger than the effective value directly extracted from comparing the signal intensity, as validated by our electric&#8208;field&#8208;modulated (EFM) continuous&#8208;wave EPR experiments and simulation program. The coherence time of this Ce(III) qubit is 24.1(13) &#181;s at 5&#160;K with dynamical decoupling and the electric control efficiency is approaching 0.1 Hz &#183; m &#183; V&#8722;1. Our work provides an insight into the EFM detection of the SEC effect of the uniaxial molecule and offers a reference for the coherent electric manipulation of rare&#8208;earth molecular quantum systems.

&lt;p&gt;Magnetoelectric materials have attracted considerable interests due to their unique capability to facilitate reciprocal control between the charges and spins in matter. Based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) involving modulated and pulsed electric fields, we have studied a Ce (III)-based molecular qubit under electric control. We observed linear spin-electric coupling (SEC) in the powder sample, which challenges the previous routine of spectral analysis and strength estimation for SEC. We determined the SEC parameter |&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;xyz&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;| to be 2.04(16) &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt; m &#183; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, two orders of magnitude&#160;larger than the effective value directly extracted from comparing the signal intensity, as validated by our electric-field-modulated (EFM) continuous-wave EPR experiments and simulation program. The coherence time of this Ce(III) qubit is 24.1(13) &#181;s at 5&#160;K with dynamical decoupling and the electric control efficiency is approaching 0.1 Hz &#183; m &#183; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work provides an insight into the EFM detection of the SEC effect of the uniaxial molecule and offers a reference for the coherent electric manipulation of rare-earth molecular quantum systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Sugars and Polyols Using Zeolites for Renewable Surfactant Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zeolite&#8208;catalyzed strategy enables size&#8208;selective monoacetalization of sugars and polyols in a single step by leveraging pore confinement to distinguish between mono&#8208; and multi&#8208;substituted species. This broadly applicable method avoids protection steps and excess reagents, opening new routes to bio&#8208;based amphiphiles with strong surface activity and hard&#8208;water resistance.








Abstract
Diol functionalization with acetals in carbohydrates and polyols is ubiquitously used in protection chemistry and in the manufacture of several platform chemicals. However, the selective functionalization of molecules where multiple acetalization reactions can occur typically involves multiple protection/deprotection steps. Here, we show that zeolites can be used to size&#8208;selectively acetalize sugars and polyols in a single step, and we demonstrate the potential of this approach for producing functional chemicals and materials. We show that high selectivity is dependent on effective pore confinement, which is achieved by a careful pairing of the substrate size and the zeolite morphology. This zeolite&#8208;catalyzed strategy exhibited consistently good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields (70%&#8211;95%) of novel polyol/sugar monoacetals, notably offering an easy route to bio&#8208;based amphiphiles. These resulting xylose&#8208;based surfactants exhibited similar or superior surface activity and, remarkably, hard&#8208;water resistance compared to their nonrenewable ethoxylated analogues, which illustrates the potential for practical applications of this approach.

         <title>De Novo Designed &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Peptides Mimicking the Copper&#8208;Binding Histidine Brace Motif of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the copper&#8208;binding histidine brace (His&#8208;brace) motif found in lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) enzymes was engineered in de novo designed peptides that fold as &#946;&#8208;hairpins (HisPins). Cu&#8208;HisPins complexes showed LPMO&#8208;like activity, including light&#8208;stimulated melanin&#8208;mediated oxidative cellulose degradation. Hence, they represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on folded peptide scaffolds.








Abstract
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are Cu&#8208;containing enzymes that play a crucial role in lignocellulosic biomass degradation for use in biofuel production. These enzymes carry out the selective oxidation of C&#9472;H bonds in the sugar units, leading to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Creating LPMO mimics facilitates the study of the mechanism of action, the characterisation of the reactive species responsible for the C&#9472;H bond activation and the potential scale up for industrial application. Here, we report the design, structural and functional characterisation of two novel Cu&#8208;binding &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptides, called HisPins, that mimic the Histidine&#8208;brace site of LPMOs. Activity assays were conducted with p&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside (PNPG) and demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;HisPins show LPMO&#8208;like activity on the model substrate. Furthermore, the Cu&#8208;HisPins can also perform light&#8208;driven oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) in the presence of melanin, similarly to some LPMO enzymes. Hence, the Cu&#8208;HisPins represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on short, folded peptide sequences and show a light&#8208;stimulated melanin&#8208;mediated oxidative activity, which is unreported for any LPMO mimic characterised so far. Thus, this work paves the way to further exploration of LPMO mechanism, structure&#8208;activity relationship and substrate scope expansion.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Profiling Using Nanopores and Dimeric Aptamer&#8208;Modified DNA Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a nanopore&#8208;based biosensor for single&#8208;molecule protein profiling using aptamer&#8208;modified DNA carrier dimerization strategy, enabling selective and ultrasensitive detection of proteins and protein complexes. This approach promises advances in early&#8208;stage clinical diagnostics and precision medicine.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well&#8208;suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore&#8208;based detection strategy utilising an aptamer&#8208;protein&#8208;aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double&#8208;stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge&#8208;based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub&#8208;picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer&#8208;binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based diagnostics.

         <title>Anchoring and Competition: Weakly Solvated Structure of Glymes Enhances Stability in Lithium Metal Batteries Operating under Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Originally, lithium ions coordinate with multiple O atoms on diglyme, which would result in a strong binding energy. With the addition of LiNO3, the strong binding energy of NO3&#8722; anchors the solvation structure on one side, and by adding a co&#8208;solvent, diglymes with single O atom coordination are generated, which significantly reduces the desolvation energy of the solvation structure to improve the performance of Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) face challenges from unstable and fragile solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). In this work, we successfully develop a novel electrolyte by effectively modulating the competitive solvation process in LMBs. In this formulation, the C&#9472;O&#9472;C motifs of glymes are competitively substituted by other anions and solvents to achieve single oxygen site coordination, thereby facilitating a weak solvation effect. At an apparent concentration of 1.25&#160;M, a solvated sheath enriched with anions and single oxygen&#8208;bound complexes is formed, which significantly enhances lithium metal compatibility and promotes rapid desolvation kinetics. The designed electrolyte using weakly solvated structures exhibits remarkable stability at both 25&#176; and 80 &#176;C, enabling the lithium iron phosphate (LFP)||Li cell to achieve over 2000 cycles (capacity retention: 90%) and 500 cycles (capacity retention: 96%), respectively. Interestingly, the low N/P ratio LFP||Li (N/P&#160;=&#160;1.8) full battery maintains a stable capacity over 50 cycles, and the commercial 1.1 Ah LFP||Li pouch cell shows a great stability (capacity retention: 91.0%, CE: 99.82%) over 20 cycles. The distinctive solvation regulation strategy has paved a novel research avenue for the realization of high&#8208;performance LMBs.

Supramolecular confinement in silver nanochemistry was demonstrated. Two cyclodextrin&#8208;like host&#8211;guest cyclic polyoxovanadate (POV) supermolecules were constructed, which served as templates for the formation of POV&#8208;bearing giant Ag0/I nanoclusters.








Abstract
Although polyoxovanadates (POVs) and their silver nanocluster composites have attracted significant research attention owing to their remarkable structural diversity and multifunctional properties, the mechanistic interplay between their dual chemical roles&#8212;serving simultaneously as host matrices in supramolecular architectures and as structural templates directing silver nanocluster (Ag NC) assembly&#8212;remains insufficiently understood. Herein, we systematically optimized the condensation of {VOx} (x&#160;=&#160;4, 5) tetrahedra or square pyramids around simple anions (S2&#8722; and SO42&#8722;) to tailor two distinct host&#8211;guest cyclodextrin&#8208;like POV supermolecules: [S@V16O48]18&#8722; and [SO4@V14O42]16&#8722;. Remarkably, these two cyclic POVs were generated in situ and have never been observed before, either in vanadate chemistry or in silver nanoclusters, representing a new category of POV condensation species. These two host&#8211;guest supramolecular anions function as templates, inducing the formation of the POV&#8208;bearing Ag0/I NCs, dubbed as Ag78 and Ag68. Furthermore, the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of Ag68 and Ag78 is comprehensively discussed and the excellent PCE is attributed to the nonradiation transition process, encompassing the fast deactivation of the excited charge transfer (CT) state and the slow recombination of CT state, as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This work not only optimizes the condensation of {VOx} (x&#160;=&#160;4, 5) polyhedral building units to tailor novel host&#8211;guest POV supermolecules but also offers a new perspective on supramolecular anion templates in guiding the assembly of silver NCs.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Nanoparticle FRET for Biosensing: Photophysics Versus Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) systems with luminescent nanoparticles (NPs) as donors and acceptors (inter&#8208;NP FRET) combine unique photophysical properties with large sizes. This review discusses the influence of NP type, architecture, surface chemistry, and optical properties on FRET and the pros and cons of inter&#8208;NP FRET for bioanalytical applications.








Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) enables the quantification of nanoscale distances and biomolecular interactions. Luminescent nanoparticles (NPs) are frequently combined with fluorescent dyes or proteins in FRET. However, their use in inter&#8208;NP FRET with luminescent NPs as both donor and acceptor remains less common due to the inherent size constraints that can limit FRET efficiencies. This review critically examines the early advances and current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of inter&#8208;NP FRET with a focus on the most commonly used NPs, namely quantum dots (QDs), upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), and fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs). We show how NP sizes, surface shells, and coatings increase FRET&#8208;distances; propose how these drawbacks can be overcome or outcompeted by the unique photophysical properties of the NPs; and discuss representative examples of inter&#8208;NP FRET for biosensing. High luminescence brightness, outstanding photostability, near&#8208;infrared excitation and emission, spectral and temporal multiplexing, and large surfaces for multifunctional bioconjugation are only some of the features that make luminescent NPs very attractive for biosensing, and FRET efficiencies up to 90% have demonstrated their potential for successful translation into bioanalytical applications.

         <title>Edge/Corner&#8208;Sharing 2D Perovskite Functional Layer for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The special N&#8208;methylethylenediamine cations (MEDA2+) create the n&#8208;type edge/corner&#8208;sharing (E/C&#8208;sharing) [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedral framework with narrow interlayer spacing, which boosts the octahedral interlayer coupling to improve carrier mobility. Furthermore, the resulting n&#8208;type E/C&#8208;sharing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite functional layer at the perovskite/C60 interface reinforces surface lattice stability by inducing a compressive stress field and increasing defect formation energy and forms a type&#8208;II 3D/2D heterojunction for efficient electron transfer.








Abstract
Tuning the surface structure of perovskite films based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites with narrow octahedral interlayer spacing is essential yet challenging to mitigate quantum and dielectric confinement, achieve interfacial energy&#8208;level matching, and promote efficient carrier transport kinetics in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Innovatively, an n&#8208;type 2D perovskite functional layer featuring a distinctive edge/corner&#8208;sharing (E/C&#8208;sharing) [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedral framework is constructed on a 3D film surface by utilizing N&#8208;methylethylenediamine cations (MEDA2+) to regulate the connection modes of [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedral units. Specifically, the 2D&#8208;MEDAPb2I6 with the E/C&#8208;sharing octahedra yields the narrowest interlayer spacing recorded to date (8.39&#160;&#197;) among 2D perovskites, thus boosting the octahedral interlayer coupling effect and weakening the quantum and dielectric confinement effect to improve carrier mobility. Additionally, the 2D capping layer reinforces surface lattice stability by inducing a compressive stress field and increasing defect formation energy. The resulting type&#8208;II 3D/2D heterojunction significantly lowers the interfacial energy barriers for electron transfer and reduces the carrier recombination losses. Consequently, the inverted PSCs achieve an optimal efficiency of 26.43% (certified at 26.10%) and maintain over 94% of their initial efficiency after operating for 1200 hours under simulated AM 1.5G illumination. This research provides a unique perspective for developing novel 2D perovskites in perovskite&#8208;based photovoltaics.

         <title>Reactions of Difluorocarbene with Organogold(I) Complexes: Synthesis of Gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Organometallics via Difluorocarbene Insertion and Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report stable and isolable difluoromethylene transition metal complexes, synthesized by reaction of free difluorocarbene with organogold(I) precursors. Difluorocarbene insertion reactions occurs with alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;gold(I) complexes, whereas the difluorocarbene cycloaddition reaction occurs with alkynylgold(I) complex.








Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluoromethylene functional group is an important motif in medicinal chemistry, and development of new fluoroalkyl&#8208;metal systems has been crucial to enable new syntheses of gem&#8208;difluoromethylenes. However, well&#8208;defined and isolable examples of either nucleophilic RCF2M or difluorocyclopropenyl transition metal complexes are rare. The Au(I) platform has been useful for the synthesis of isolable transition&#8208;metal complexes bearing reactive ligands. Herein we utilize reactions of difluorocarbene with organogold(I) complexes, analogous to reactions of difluorocarbene with organic substrates, to access novel examples of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene organometallics. First, difluorocarbene insertion into the R&#9472;Au(I) bond of organogold(I) species with free difluorocarbene was demonstrated for the first time, forming alkyl&#8208;CF2&#8208;Au(I) and aryl&#8208;CF2&#8208;Au(I) species. Second, via a difluorocarbene cycloaddition reaction we isolate for the first time a &#954;1&#8208;difluorocyclopropenyl&#8208;transition metal complex, formed by reaction of alkynylAu(I) complex with free difluorocarbene. Subsequent study of these reaction systems by density functional theory calculations facilitated study of the difluorocarbene insertion reactions, and a comparison of difluorocarbene insertion and cycloaddition pathways in the reaction of difluorocarbene and alkynylAu(I).

         <title>From Flue Gas to Syngas: Composite Electrode Based on Ionic Liquid and Microporous Polymer for MEA&#8208;Based CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite gas&#8208;diffusion electrode (GDE) with a thin CO2&#8208;selective interlayer beneath the catalyst facilitates direct MEA electrolysis of simulated flue gas (with O2) to CO/syngas, eliminating costly pre&#8208;purification. The interlayer&#8212;an intrinsically microporous polymer scaffold infused with CO2&#8208;philic [Emim][BF4]&#8212;delivers high CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivity, directing CO2 to the catalyst layer, and greatly enhancing process economics.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2R) offers a promising pathway to convert CO2 into value&#8208;added products. While catalyst advances remain crucial, gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (GDEs) architecture is equally vital in CO2 electrolyzer design. Most ECO2R studies use pure CO2 feeds, whereas industrial sources like flue gas contain &#8764;15% CO2, requiring costly purification. Eliminating this step demands electrolyzers that directly process impure streams via in situ separation. Here, we introduce a composite GDE (CGDE) featuring a thin CO2&#8208;selective interlayer of intrinsically microporous polymer (PIM&#8208;1) reinforced with the CO2&#8208;philic ionic liquid [Emim][BF4]. This layer selectively adsorbs CO2 and suppresses N2/O2 existence at the catalyst interface. In simulated flue gas (15% CO2, 5% O2 in N2), the CGDE with 20 wt% [Emim][BF4]/PIM&#8208;1 achieved &gt;70% CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, versus &#8764;20% FE for a pristine GDE. Multiphysics simulations confirmed effective CO2 delivery through the selective layer, with minimal O2 permeation. Cost estimation analysis indicates around 25% reduction in CO's minimum selling price using the integrated design and &gt;50% under ideal performance metrics by eliminating compression/transport. These results demonstrate that advanced electrode design with CO2&#8208;selective interlayer enables direct mixed&#8208;gas ECO2R, establishes key design criteria for selective layers, and significantly improves process economics.

         <title>Polymerisation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly on Planar Surfaces: A New Approach for Controlling Surface Topography and Modulating Material&#8208;Bio Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates surface&#8208;initiated photopolymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (surface PISA) as an innovative strategy for directing nanostructure formation on planar surfaces, providing a new approach to tailoring material surface topography and achieving enhanced antifouling and antibacterial surface properties. 








Abstract
Polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has emerged as a highly efficient method for synthesising polymeric nanoparticles with diverse and well&#8208;defined morphologies for a range of applications. While extensive research has focused on solution&#8208;based PISA mediated by conformationally free macro&#8208;stabilisers, the process of PISA on planar surfaces using surface&#8208;tethered macro&#8208;stabilisers with constrained mobility, namely surface PISA, remains largely unexplored. Investigating this process is significant to further advance PISA technology and expand its applications. In this work, we explore surface PISA through both experimental and computational approaches, revealing key differences from conventional solution&#8208;based PISA. We also demonstrate that surface PISA offers an innovative approach for controlling surface topography and modulating material&#8208;bio interactions. Specifically, we showcase its versatile application in creating slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) and encapsulating antibiotics, endowing material surfaces with enhanced antifouling and antimicrobial properties. We believe this work is a significant step forward for PISA technology and will create new opportunities for its broader applications.

         <title>Helical Poly(isocyanide anthraquinones)&#8208;Based Cathodes for Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a palladium catalyst of Pd&#8208;II for living polymerization of side&#8208;chain anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;type pendant polyisocyanide achieves controllable molecular weight and a low polymer dispersity index (PDI). This cathode maintains stability with no significant degradation after 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1 in the lithium metal batteries (LMBs). What is more, polymer ionic liquid electrolytes are used to construct soft PIC&#8208;2AQ pouch batteries, which maintain performance after bending and cutting, combining safety and practicality.








Abstract
Thanks to the unique rigid conformation and designable side&#8208;chain structure, helical polymers are starting to be more widely considered as ideal electrode materials in secondary batteries. In this study, a series of helical poly(isocyanide anthraquinones) (PIC&#8208;AQs), including PIC&#8208;1AQn and PIC&#8208;2AQn, were designed and synthesized via living polymerization using a palladium catalyst (Pd&#8208;II). The polymers feature a helical polyisocyanide main chain and anthraquinone (AQ) pendants, offer high yields (approximately 90%), controlled number&#8208;average molecular weight (Mn), and a low polymer dispersity index (PDI). Attributed to a narrow energy band gap, low unoccupied molecular orbitals, and high spatial freedom of PIC&#8208;2AQ, it exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), maintaining 141 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1. Additionally, an in situ polymerized poly(ionic liquid) electrolyte was prepared for assembling a PIC&#8208;2AQ all&#8208;solid&#8208;state soft&#8208;pouch battery. And it remained stable under extreme operations like bending or cutting. Such a battery significantly broadens the application scope of organic LMBs and offers great potential for their use in flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Ligand Coordination Equilibria&#8211;Drived Homogeneous Electrodeposition Enables Coatings with Superior Corrosion Resistance and Mechanical Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand coordination equilibrium (LCE) was proposed to precisely control the morphology of alloy electrodeposits. By synergistically regulating ion solvation structures, concentration distributions, and electrochemical reduction pathways, this approach achieved uniform and compact alloy coatings with substantially improved corrosion resistance and mechanical strength, highlighting its potential for industrial applications.








Abstract
Electroplating technology is crucial for interfacial engineering due to its flexible controllability and excellent protective performance. However, electroplated coatings often exhibit uneven deposition morphology due to the uncontrollable nucleation and growth of metal grains, which results in degraded coating performance. Here, we propose ligand coordination equilibria (LCE) that creates a dense coating by simultaneously modulating the solvation structure and optimizing the reduction process, exemplified by Al/Zr alloy electroplating. Multiscale calculations revealed that Cl&#8722; coordination with AlCl3 and ZrCl4 forms a dynamic equilibrium between active ionic species Al2Cl7&#8722; and ZrCl5&#8722;, which is predominantly governed by AlCl3 due to its stronger Lewis acidity. This coordination mechanism was directly validated by Raman spectroscopy. The dynamic equilibrium between Al2Cl7&#8722;, which dominates nucleation density and growth rate, and ZrCl5&#8722;, which increases the interfacial diffusion barrier, synergistically promotes the small&#8208;sized alloy grain. The resulting compact microstructure significantly enhanced the hardness (268 HV) and corrosion resistance (&#8722;0.78&#160;V versus SCE) of the coating, far surpassing that of conventional aluminum alloys coatings. This work highlights the innovative use of LCE for interfacial engineering by tailoring the dynamic equilibrium of active ionic species, providing new insights for the industrial electroplating of high&#8208;performance alloys.

         <title>Deoxygenative Functionalization of Alcohols and Carbonyl Compounds via Electrochemical Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the abundance of oxygen&#8208;containing molecules, no unified approach exists that can activate various oxidation states of oxygenated functional groups for deoxygnenative functionalization. Here, we disclose a tandem, one&#8208;pot hydrosilylation&#8211;electroreduction sequence that enables the conversion of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and esters into nucleophilic reagents widely used in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups are prevalent motifs in natural products and feedstock chemicals, but direct methods for their deoxygenative transformation remain rare due to the difficult cleavage of the strong C&#8211;O bond. Here, we develop a general activation strategy that employs hydrosilanes as activating reagents for alcohols, carbonyls, and esters to afford a common silyl ether intermediate. Electrochemical reduction of the in situ generated silyl ether results in C&#8211;O cleavage to afford a carbanion, which reacts with a number of electrophiles for the construction of C&#8211;Si, C&#8211;B, C&#8211;Ge, and C&#8211;Sn bonds.

Here, we develop a general activation strategy that employs hydrosilanes as activating reagents for alcohols, carbonyls, and esters to afford a common silyl ether intermediate. Electrochemical reduction of the in situ generated silyl ether results in C&#8211;O cleavage to afford a carbanion, which reacts with a number of electrophiles for the construction of C&#8211;Si, C&#8211;B, C&#8211;Ge, and C&#8211;Sn bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hofmeister &#8220;Salting&#8208;In&#8221; Assisted Slurry Homogenization for Ultra&#8208;Thin Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>

This work introduces a slurry&#8208;based strategy for ultrathin SSE fabrication leveraging Hofmeister &#8220;salting&#8208;in&#8221; effect to disperse binders in poor&#8208;solvent environments. The homo&#8208;dispersed and high dielectric binders formed a flexible ion&#8208;conductive network with Li&#8208;salts that creates Li+ pathways while providing cushioning to stabilize interfaces and enable long&#8208;term ASSB cycling. The thermal transfer printing renders ultrathin SSE compatible with industrial winding and lamination for scalability.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) demand ultra&#8208;thin electrolytes to achieve low impedance and high energy density, yet scalable fabrication remains bottlenecked by the incompatibility between binder/ solvent and sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, we introduce a pioneering slurry&#8208;based strategy leveraging Hofmeister &#8220;salting&#8208;in&#8221; effect to disperse binders in a poor&#8208;solvent environment, dramatically expanding the applicable binder spectrum. The copolymer poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVTC) was uniformly dispersed in tetrahydrofuran via Li&#8208;salts mediation, reducing chain aggregate to hundreds of nanometers. PVTC with reduced size was homo&#8208;dispersed in the Li6PS5Cl slurry, enabling the film&#8208;formation of SSE/ PVTC composite electrolytes (SCEs) with an ultra&#8208;low resistance of 0.69&#160;&#937; cm&#8722;2, synchronously facilitating the formation of continuous polymer networks to provide mechanical cushioning that stabilizes interfaces during cycling. The high dielectric PVTC enhances Li&#8208;salts dissociation, eradicating conduction barriers and establishing efficient Li+&#8208;pathways. Notably, the excellent thermal transfer capability of SCEs enables direct lamination onto electrodes, enabling industrial manufacturing. ASSBs featuring LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes and silicon&#8208;based anodes exhibited energy densities exceeding 380&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and retained 80% capacity over 750 cycles. This work breakthrough traditional binder limitations for sulfide SSEs, addresses the transport obstruction through rational structure design, and ushers in a new era for scalable ASSB production.

         <title>Harnessing the Dynamic Nature of a Zirconium&#8208;Oxo Nanocluster for Reversible Protein Capture and Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zr17&#8208;oxo nanocluster&#8208;based solid enables efficient, site&#8208;selective hydrolysis of myoglobin, mimicking enzymatic proteolysis. Its recyclable, heterogeneous nature and tunable ligand shell allow control over peptide product profiles. This work highlights how nanocluster surface chemistry governs protein interaction and reactivity, enabling advanced catalyst design and nanocluster recovery for reuse.








Abstract
Selective proteolysis remains a significant challenge with relevance to industrial and pharmaceutical applications, motivating development of chemical strategies emulating the specificity of natural proteases. Here, we report that the discrete Zr&#8208;oxo nanocluster&#8208;based solid, [Zr17O8(OH)24(OH2)12(HCO2)12(SO4)8] &#183; 6 HCl &#183; 30 H2O (Zr17) serves as an efficient, recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for site&#8208;selective proteolysis with tunable fragment selectivity. A combination of solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy highlighted the importance of the ligand environment of solid Zr17 for enabling efficient protein&#8208;cluster interaction and controlling reactivity. We demonstrate that Zr17 achieves a proteolytic performance comparable to natural enzymes while allowing fine modulation of peptide product profiles by adjusting reaction parameters. Substrate adsorption and product desorption were found to be governed by the net charge of both catalyst and substrate, as well as rapid reorganization of the cluster's capping ligands, according to UV&#8208;Vis/IR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Crucially, the insoluble nature and excellent stability of Zr17, evidenced by pair distribution function analysis, allowed reuse across multiple catalytic cycles, overcoming a major limitation of proteolytic systems. This study reveals how cluster surface chemistry governs substrate interaction and catalysis, guiding rational design of next&#8208;generation cluster&#8208;based catalysts, including hybrid materials such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks.

         <title>Postassembly Modification of Interior Spaces Within M12L24 Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described a procedure for the quantitative postassembly modification of the confined space within M12L24 nanospheres. Nanospheres with covalent linked interior pyridinium&#8208;carboxyaldehydes are prepared. These groups form imines with amine derivatives. The describe strategy establishes guidelines for postmodification of supramolecular systems, thus providing new opportunities for unique confined spaces.








Abstract
Post assembly modification (PAM) of coordination&#8208;based supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies has developed in the past 10 years as a tool that allows expansion of the chemical diversity available in supramolecular synthesis. In this contribution we apply PAM to enable the creation of M12L24 nanospheres with unique interior spaces. We introduce alkyl N&#8208;pyridinium carboxy aldehydes (ANCA) as ideal orthogonal functional group for PAM. The herein presented nanospheres undergo quantitative PAM with a variety of aniline derivatives, allowing the creation of hydrophobic, chiral, catalytic, and other confined spaces. As the parent spheres can be easily characterized before PAM, this methodology not only allows for the preparation of highly desirable multifunctional confined spaces but also serves with its post modulation possibilities as a fast and efficient tool for screening secondary interactions and confined spaces on probes of interest.

         <title>Improving Charge Extraction and Operational Stability in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Conjugated Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated block copolymers, featuring a polyfluorene block for rapid electron transport and a quaternized conjugated block that effectively passivates both cation and anion defects, serve as interfacial modulators in inverted perovskite solar cells, achieving an efficiency of 26.11% with exceptional long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
A defect&#8208;passivated, electronically benign interface is essential for high&#8208;performance, stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Most conventional surface passivation strategies frequently introduce electrically resistive interlayers that compromise charge transport/extraction between the perovskite and charge&#8208;transport layers. We resolve this challenge through the rational implementation of all&#8208;conjugated block copolymers (CBCPs). The CBCPs demonstrate dual&#8208;functional capabilities of offering charge transport channels while facile integrating multiple defect&#8208;passivating moieties, thereby enabling efficient charge carrier transport and defect passivation. This dual&#8208;functional synergy yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.11% in our best device. The target PSCs maintained &gt;90% of their initial PCEs after maximum power point tracking for &gt;1400&#160;hours at 65&#160;&#176;C. This approach offers a promising strategy for interface engineering that improves both charge extraction and defect reduction using conjugated block copolymers.

         <title>A Chiral Organic Radical Ferroelectric with Magnetic Circular Dichroism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first chiral organic radical ferroelectric crystals that exhibit both paramagnetism and ferroelectricity at room temperature, along with a pronounced magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) effect. The natural circular dichroism (CD) signal of these crystals can be modulated and even reversed by an external magnetic field of 1.6&#160;T, demonstrating a remarkable magneto&#8208;optical response.








Abstract
Chiral ferroelectrics are attracting tremendous interest because of their unique intrinsic chirality and various intriguing optical properties, such as natural circular dichroism (NCD) effects. However, the magnetic CD (MCD), a kind of important magneto&#8208;optical effect, has never been explored in chiral ferroelectrics. Herein, through implementing a homochiral strategy on organic radical charge&#8208;transfer complexes, we designed a pair of chiral organic radical ferroelectric crystals, R&#8208; and S&#8208;[TBSQ][TCNQ] (TBSQ&#160;=&#160;3&#8208;((tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)quinuclidine, TCNQ&#160;=&#160;tetracyanoquinodimethane), which show both paramagnetism and ferroelectricity at room temperature. Notably, the chiral transfer from homochiral R/S&#8208;TBSQ+ to TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; radical makes R&#8208; and S&#8208;[TBSQ][TCNQ] can produce remarkable NCD signal in the absorbance region of TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; radical. More importantly, the CD signal can be modulated and reversed by an external magnetic field of 1.6&#160;T, showing a remarkable magneto&#8208;optical response. The magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) effect is further demonstrated with the strength gMCD being &#8764;1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;T&#8722;1 at about 600&#160;nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on chiral ferroelectrics with MCD effect. Our findings shed light on the exploration of magneto&#8208;optical effects in chiral ferroelectrics and stimulate further study on the chemical design of chiral radical ferroelectrics.

&lt;p&gt;We report the first chiral organic radical ferroelectric crystals that exhibit both paramagnetism and ferroelectricity at room temperature, along with a pronounced magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) effect. The natural circular dichroism (CD) signal of these crystals can be modulated and even reversed by an external magnetic field of 1.6&#160;T, demonstrating a remarkable magneto-optical response.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Light&#8208;Driven Ratchet Mechanism Accelerates Regioselective Metal&#8208;Cation Exchange in a Heterobimetallic Helicate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoswitchable helicate acts like a molecular claw machine: under 405 nm light, it functions as a molecular ratchet that greatly speeds up regioselective ZnII&#8594;FeII exchange, converting a homometallic ZnII helicate into a heterometallic one. Consequently, FeII cations are captured with precise spatial and temporal control, similar to arcade claw machines. Moreover, this ratchet operates autonomously under white light, creating an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium structure, as reported by Larissa von Krbek et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202508952).

         <title>Constructing Synergistic Interactions Between Multi&#8208;Hydroxyl Molecules and Perovskite to Alleviate Mechanical&#8208;Thermal Mismatch for Achieving High&#8208;Performance Flexible Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced three hydroxy&#8208;substituted phenylacetic acid molecules into the perovskite films to investigate how the interaction patterns between multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules and perovskite affect the mechanical&#8208;thermal properties of flexible photovoltaic cells. The multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules reduced the Young's modulus and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the perovskite film by 11.1% and 38.5%, respectively, ultimately achieving a PCE of 25.01%. Additionally, these devices maintained 90% of their initial PCE after 3000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Due to the presence of residual tensile strain, as well as the inherent brittleness and film quality of the perovskite, flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) face ongoing challenges in stability. To address these issues, this study introduces a multi&#8208;hydroxyl regulated stress management strategy for f&#8208;PSCs. Three hydroxyl&#8208;substituted phenylacetic acids (p&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid) are incorporated into the perovskite films to investigate the significance of their interaction modes with perovskite in regulating f&#8208;PSC performance. These multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules, through their progressively enhanced synergistic interactions with the perovskite, effectively promote greater energy dissipation during stress deformation, reducing the Young's modulus of the perovskite by 11.1% and decreasing the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskite film by 38.5%, thereby improving the mechanical strength of the f&#8208;PSCs. Additionally, the multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules regulate the excess PbI2 during the fabrication process of perovskite, enhancing the film quality and optimizing the energy level alignment. As a result, the inverted f&#8208;PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.01%. These devices demonstrated excellent mechanical and thermal stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 3000 bending cycles, and maintaining 83% of their initial PCE after continuous heating at 85&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h.

Additionally, the multi-hydroxyl molecules regulate the excess PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during the fabrication process of perovskite, enhancing the film quality and optimizing the energy level alignment. As a result, the inverted f-PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.01%. These devices demonstrated excellent mechanical and thermal stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 3000 bending cycles, and maintaining 83% of their initial PCE after continuous heating at 85&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Node Flexibility Unlocks Structural Adaptability and Guest Versatility of Anionocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing node flexibility has proved an effective strategy to enhance the structural adaptability and guest versatility of anionocages. Unprecedented, nano&#8208;sized anionocages were obtained, enabling the binding of [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; with a significant increase in quantum yield (&#8764;5&#8208;fold) and lifetime (&#8764;2&#8208;fold), as well as the emergence of circularly polarized luminescence from racemic [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; via host&#8211;guest chirality transfer.








Abstract
Due to their exceptional nodal flexibility, anionocages are promising host molecules capable of mimicking the dynamic self&#8208;assembly and host&#8211;guest chemistry of proteins. However, their application has been limited by the challenges in constructing large internal cavities. Here, we present an effective strategy to overcome this limitation by enhancing node flexibility to improve both structural adaptability and guest encapsulation versatility. Specifically, anion coordination between a C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;urea ligand (L) and an organophosphate, PhPO42&#8722; (A), generates highly flexible nodes that enable adaptive self&#8208;assembly and the encapsulation of guests of unprecedented size. Crystal structures revealed that the same ligand and anion can form three geometrically distinct anionocages (A4L4 tetrahedron 1, A6L6 trigonal antiprism 2, and A6L8 octahedron 3), with cavity sizes ranging from 0.208 to 1.320&#160;nm3. In solution, controlled interconversions among the three anionocages can be achieved by modulating the guest template, A/L ratio, and concentration. These nanoscale cavities successfully encapsulate the luminescent metal complex, [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; (bpy = 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), resulting in a &#8764;5&#8208;fold increase in quantum yield, and a &#8764;2&#8208;fold increase in lifetime. Moreover, circularly polarized luminescence of racemic [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; is induced via chirality transfer using a chiral&#8208;anion&#8208;directed octahedral cage (4) as the host.

         <title>Switching&#8208;Off to Switching&#8208;On Triplet Formation Through Singlet&#8211;Triplet Intersystem Crossing in Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reminiscent of natural LHC arrays, excitonic coupling in FB&#8208;porphyrin MOFs produces multi&#8208;strut&#8208;spanned singlet excitons compared to localized triplets, resulting in a small SOC matrix element that prevents triplet formation through ISC. This can be activated by a higher Zeff in Pd&#8208;porphyrin MOFs. The triplet dynamics in Pd&#8208;MOFs are governed by the topology, which determines the extent and efficiency of the triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation process.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state artificial photosystems need precise control over their singlet or triplet excited states to enable desired photochemical transformations. While persistent triplets are often selected to drive chemical bond formation or spin&#8208;specific photoreactions, singlets can allow for ambient applications. Among different heterogeneous systems, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a solution&#8208;stable platform with many benefits, including large chemically accessible interior surfaces where excitons can be transferred from their original formation sites. Porphyrins demonstrate high intersystem crossing efficiency, with QYISC&#160;&#8776;&#160;80% for free&#8208;base (FB) cores, which can be increased to about 92% for palladium&#8208;metalated cores. This study shows that framework assembly prevents ISC in FB&#8208;MOFs; whereas, ISC is enhanced in Pd&#8208;MOFs compared to monomeric linkers. The MOF topology influences the excited state dynamics, resulting in short&#8208;lived triplets with &#964;0.5 &#8818;10&#160;ps in microporous MOFs. This extensive control over QYISC (from 0 to approximately 100%) and triplet behavior through framework assembly offers new design principles for creating artificial photosystems that operate exclusively in their singlet or triplet states manifold.

         <title>Three Is Better than One: A Multimetal Complex that Triggers Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple metal prodrug that codelivers PtII, RuII, and AuI species triggers a potent immunogenic cell death (ICD) response via combined Type I/II pathways. The tri&#8208;metallic scaffold promotes tumor inhibition, immune memory, and peripheral leukocyte activation, offering a next&#8208;generation chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic approach (created in BioRender. Babu, T., 2025).








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a form of regulated cell death capable of stimulating an adaptive immune response through release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). While several metal complexes have shown promise as ICD inducers, conjugates containing more than one metal center remain to be explored for ICD. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a tri&#8208;metallic AuI&#8208;PtIV&#8208;RuII prodrug (5) that codelivers oxaliplatin (Type I ICD inducer), RuII arene 2&#8208;pyridinecarbothioamides (Type I), and Au(I) bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic (Type II) using a single scaffold. Upon reduction, complex 5 releases all three cytotoxic species, resulting in enhanced inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1&amp;2), elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and in vitro DAMP release. In vivo studies of complex 5 in a colorectal cancer mouse model demonstrated tumor growth suppression, reduced off&#8208;target metal accumulation, and improved immune memory in a tumor challenge study compared to a 1:1:1 mixture of the constituent agents. Furthermore, peripheral white blood cell (WBC) profiling revealed that complex 5 activates both the innate and adaptive immune compartments. This study demonstrates an integrated chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic strategy that unifies multiple ICD triggers within a single prodrug framework. It thus highlights a promising approach to the creation of metal&#8208;based multimodal anticancer therapies.

         <title>Extending the Chemistry of Scheelite&#8208;type Oxides with Borates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the first successful isolation of [BO2F2] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO2F2] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO2F2&#8212;the first borate compound adopting a scheelite&#8208;type structure.








Abstract
Scheelite&#8208;type oxides have been extensively investigated in diverse inorganic systems due to their exceptional structural versatility and promising multifunctional properties, ranging from luminescence to ionic conduction. However, despite decades of research, borates have remained conspicuously absent from this important structural family. This exclusion stems from a fundamental synthetic and structure chemistry challenge: the difficulty in achieving the essential zero&#8208;dimensional anionic framework composed of isolated tetrahedral units, a defining characteristic of scheelite&#8208;type materials. In this work, we break this long&#8208;standing barrier by reporting the first successful isolation of [BO2F2] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This breakthrough was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO2F2] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO2F2&#8212;the first borate compound adopting a scheelite&#8208;type structure. Through a combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, spectroscopic techniques, and first&#8208;principles calculations, we unequivocally confirm the scheelite&#8208;type framework of SbBO2F2 and demonstrate its remarkable multifunctional properties, including anisotropic thermal expansion, ionic conductivity, and large birefringence. This work not only expands the structural chemistry of scheelite&#8208;type oxides with borates but also opens new avenues for designing multifunctional materials through targeted anionic group isolation.

Through a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic techniques, and first-principles calculations, we unequivocally confirm the scheelite-type framework of SbBO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and demonstrate its remarkable multifunctional properties, including anisotropic thermal expansion, ionic conductivity, and large birefringence. This work not only expands the structural chemistry of scheelite-type oxides with borates but also opens new avenues for designing multifunctional materials through targeted anionic group isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Diversified Biisoquinoline&#8208;Containing Polymers by Multicomponent C&#9472;H Activation/Annulation Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient multicomponent C&#9472;H activation/annulation polymerization was established for the in situ synthesis of diversified biisoquinoline&#8208;containing polymers (BCPs). The obtained BCPs possess good solution processability, film&#8208;forming ability, and tunable luminescent properties, and can be applied to fluorescent photopatterns. By using chiral rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP&#8211;metal complex are prepared.








Abstract
Biisoquinoline scaffolds with unique photophysical properties and latent axial chirality have received considerable attention in medical chemistry, asymmetric catalysis, and materials science. However, limited by the large synthetic difficulties, functional biisoquinoline&#8208;containing polymers (BCPs) have rarely been reported. Furthermore, the construction of optically active BCPs via asymmetric catalytic polymerization have not been achieved so far. Herein, we developed a multicomponent cascade C&#9472;H activation/annulation polymerization (CAAP) strategy that can facilely convert readily available benzil derivatives, internal diynes, and ammonium acetate into structurally diverse BCPs via successive C&#9472;H activation and N&#8208;annulation processes in a one&#8208;pot and one&#8208;step operation. The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed CAAP reactions proceed efficiently under air, affording a variety of multisubstituted BCPs with high molecular weights (Mw up to 49900&#160;g mol&#8722;1) in good yields. Benefiting from the unique structures, the resulting BCPs exhibit excellent solubility, good film&#8208;forming capability, and readily tunable luminescent properties. The luminescent thin films of a photosensitive BCP can be applied for the generation of multiscale fluorescent photopatterns with high resolution. Moreover, by using different chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP&#8211;metal complex with stable axially chiral configurations are in situ generated from the asymmetric CAAP reactions.

         <title>Organic Surface Passivation on Rh@CeO2 Cocatalysts for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh@CeO2 cocatalysts modified with PPOA as a surface passivation layer, effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO2 overlayers, leading to a significantly enhanced performance in photocatalytic overall water splitting.








Abstract
Decorating Rh cocatalysts with Cr2O3 overlayers can enhance the performance of photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS). However, there is a general concern on the dissolution of Cr2O3, calling for the development of environment&#8208;friendly metal oxides. Here, we employ phenylphosphonic acid (PPOA) as a model surface modifier to decorate the model Rh@CeO2 cocatalysts and demonstrate the critical role of organic surface passivation in H2 evolution catalysis. We identify a &#8220;surface passivation effect&#8221; in photocatalysis, wherein the PPOA modification on CeO2 overlayers not only suppress the adsorption and activation of oxygen but exhibit strong resistance to hydrogen reduction during POWS. This dual functionality effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO2 overlayers, resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability. Importantly, this strategy is not limited to Rh@CeO2&#8208;PPOA systems; it also improves POWS performance in systems where other reducible oxides&#8208;organophosphonic acids structure are used as passivation layers on other noble metal cocatalysts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the universal principles of surface passivation in photocatalysis and offer a practical framework for regulating the reverse reactions and provide guidance for optimizing POWS through targeted surface organic modification.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Radical C(sp2)&#8722;H Trifluorovinylation of (Hetero)arenes with a Trifluorovinyl Iodine(III) Reagent (TrFVI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis of trifluorovinyl hypervalent iodine reagent [ArI(CF&#160;=&#160;CF2)OTf] (TrFVI) has been successfully developed using bulk chemical HFC&#8208;134a. Light&#8208;induced radical C(sp2)&#8211;H trifluorovinylation of (hetero)arenes with TrFVI reagent is achieved and exhibits good functional group compatibility. Detailed mechanism studies show a plausible radical chain pathway.








Abstract
Trifluorovinyl group is an emerging and valuable motif in drug discovery and material science, especially in polymer&#8208;related researches. However, the practical and efficient synthesis of trifluorovinylated compounds with broad structural diversity still remains a challenging task. Herein, we report the scalable synthesis of a trifluorovinyl hypervalent iodine(III) reagent, ArI(CF &#9552; CF2)OTf (TrFVI), from a bulk chemical, HFC&#8208;134a. The first C(sp2)&#9472;H trifluorovinylation of (hetero)arenes is achieved using TrFVI reagent via photoredox catalysis, which shows good functional group compatibility. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage trifluorovinylation of highly modified substrates, including drug candidates, is achieved to illustrate the powerfulness of our method. A possible radical pathway is proposed according to the mechanism study.

         <title>Efficient Glycine Electrosynthesis via CO2&#8208;Recyclable Hydrogen Donation on Pb/Pb7Bi3 Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2&#8208;assisted Pb/Pb7Bi3 catalytic system enables efficient and selective electrochemical glycine synthesis from oxalic acid and nitrogen sources. The PbBi&#8208;II catalyst achieves a high glycine Faradaic efficiency of 91.8% via a cyclic hydrogen&#8208;donation pathway and maintains stable performance over 120 h, highlighting the effectiveness of heterointerface engineering and CO2 co&#8208;catalysis in facilitating C&#9472;N bond formation.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a sustainable platform in constructing C&#9472;N bonds for amino acid production. Glycine, a particularly valuable target compound, continues to experience escalating global demand, yet achieving simultaneous high efficiency and operational stability remains a persistent challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a CO2&#8208;mediated strategy for glycine electrosynthesis using oxalic acid and N2/nitrate as feedstocks. By using Pb/Pb7Bi3&#8208;CO2 catalytic system, a very high glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.8% with durable stability over 120 h could be achieved. Moreover, when using nonthermal plasma&#8208;activated N2 as the nitrogen source, the glycine production rate could maintain at 94.4&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with N&#8208;selectivity as high as 93.2%. Mechanistic investigations combining experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that CO2 undergoes facile protonation on the Pb/Pb7Bi3 heterointerfaces to form *OCOH intermediate, which donates hydrogen for the reduction of oxalic acid and nitrate into glyoxylic acid and NH2OH, respectively, while CO2 is simultaneously regenerated. Notably, hydrogenation via the *OCOH intermediate significantly lowers the energy barriers compared to direct protonation, thereby promoting the subsequent spontaneous C&#9472;N bond formation and enabling highly efficient electrosynthesis of glycine.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn and Ir Synergistic Modulation of Substrate and Active Sites for High&#8208;Performance Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodisperse Zn1N3O3 and Ir4+ synergistically modulate substrate and active sites for high&#8208;performance ammonia oxidation. Atomically dispersed Zn single atoms in an N,O&#8208;doped carbon support serve as dedicated *OH&#8208;adsorption sites, while Ir&#8208;modulated Pt(100) nanocubes selectively activate NH3.








Abstract
A rationally designed, bifunctional ammonia&#8208;oxidation catalyst spatially decouples NH3 activation and *OH adsorption to overcome the intrinsic trade&#8208;off of single&#8208;component systems. Atomically dispersed Zn single atoms in an N,O&#8208;doped carbon support (Zn1/NOC) serve as dedicated *OH&#8208;adsorption sites, while Ir&#8208;modulated Pt(100) nanocubes selectively activate NH3. Comprehensive structural characterization (AC HAADF&#8208;STEM, XPS, XANES, EXAFS) confirms Zn&#8208;N3O3 coordination and atomically isolated Zn centers. Electrochemical&#8208;kinetic analysis, mechanistic spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveal that Zn1/NOC lowers the *OH&#8208;adsorption energy by 0.84&#160;eV (to &#8722;0.98&#160;eV versus &#8722;0.14&#160;eV on Pt), facilitating the dehydrogenation steps and reducing surface poisoning. Simultaneously, traces of stabilized Ir4+&#8208;decorated Pt cubes enhance NH3 dissociation kinetics to form N2. The catalyst demonstrates a specific activity of 3.80&#160;mA cm&#8722;2PGMs, exceeding the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks. When deployed in a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly direct ammonia fuel cell, the catalyst achieves a maximum current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a peak power density of 18&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, representing a significant improvement over previously reported systems, with &#8764;250% increase over Ptnp&#8211;C || Pt/C and more than double monofunctional systems. This work demonstrates a generalizable strategy for engineering spatially decoupled active sites in multistep electrochemical reactions, paving the way for high&#8208;performance ammonia fuel cells and beyond.

         <title>Reductive Deamination of a Diaminogermylene Promoted by an Aluminyl Anion: Isolation of Ge(I), Ge(0) and Ge(&#8208;I) Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] reacts with Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2 by a sequential reductive deamination pathway. The initially formed aluminacyclodigermene contains Ge(I) centres and may be considered as a &#951;2&#8208;coordinated digermyne at aluminium. Further reduction leads to compounds containing a &#956;,&#951;2,&#951;2&#8208;[Ge(0)]2 unit coordinated to two Al(NON) groups, or a Ge4&#8208;cluster containing species with oxidation state Ge(&#8208;I). DFT analysis indicates reduced Al centres and Ge&#9472;Ge multiple bonding in both the [RGeGeR] and [Ge2] groups.








Abstract
The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8722;&#160;=&#160;[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;, Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with the diaminogermylene Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2 afforded [K(C6H6)][Al(NON){(Me3Si)2NGeGeN(SiMe3)2}] containing an AlGe2 ring. Structural and computational analysis confirm an aluminacyclodigermene complex that can be considered as an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated digermyne at aluminium with Ge(I) centres. This compound is an intermediate on the reduction pathway to K3[(Ge4){Al(NON)}2{N(SiMe3)2}], which contains a distorted tetrahedral cluster of Ge(&#8208;I) centres. Characterisation of the dialumane (NON)Al&#9472;Al(NON) from this reaction is indicative of sequential one electron redox processes initiated by the aluminyl anion. Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane afforded K2[{Al(NON)}2(Ge2)], containing a formally digermanium(0) unit with an exceptionally long Ge&#9552;Ge double bond.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Poly&#8208;Lewis Acids Allow the Controlled Release of Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces redox&#8208;switchable poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs) based on dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene, whose reduction leads to planarisation, &#960;$\upi$&#8208;system extension, and weakened Lewis acidity, enabling controlled guest release. The reversible switching of these PLAs and their coordination polymers highlights their potential for applications in catalysis, electronics, and functional materials.








Abstract
Presently, there is a notable interest in poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs), their host&#8208;guest chemistry and their application in catalytic processes. The present study combines PLAs with redox&#8208;active dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene (dbCOT) units. dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs can be planarised by a two&#8208;electron reduction. The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc&#8208;XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended &#960;$\upi$&#8208;systems. This &#960;$\upi$&#8208;system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al&#9472;P coordination polymer. sc&#8208;XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state. The possibility of switching such dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs and their adducts as well as the formed coordination polymers between two states with different structures and electronic compositions is of interest for the development of functional materials in the fields of electronics, optics and magnetism as well as for the development of switchable catalysts.

         <title>Simultaneous Charge Extraction Enhancement and Defect Passivation Via a Planar Conjugated Molecular Interface Enable 22.49%&#8208;Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a planar conjugated molecule, 1,8&#8208;naphthyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine (2&#8208;NA), is introduced as a multifunctional interfacial modifier in CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite solar cells. It enhances hole extraction and passivates undercoordinated Pb2+ defects, boosting carrier dynamics and reducing recombination. Furthermore, a hydrophobic interfacial layer also improves moisture resistance, ultimately enabling a record 22.49% efficiency.








Abstract
Rational molecular design at the perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface presents a viable strategy to suppress nonradiative recombination in CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, simultaneously achieving efficient defect passivation and rapid charge extraction with a single molecular modifier remains challenging. Herein, we employ a planar conjugated molecule, 1,8&#8208;naphthyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine (2&#8208;NA), as a multifunctional interfacial modifier that concurrently enhances charge extraction and suppresses interfacial recombination in CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx PSCs. Combined density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analyses reveal that 2&#8208;NA forms a dense protective layer via noncovalent interactions (e.g., &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding), effectively passivating undercoordinated Pb2+ while inhibiting ion migration. Remarkably, 2&#8208;NA incorporation facilitates hot&#8208;carrier extraction, reducing the carrier cooling time from 515 to 240 fs and quadrupling the carrier diffusion length, thereby improving charge transport. As a result, the optimized device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.49%, the highest reported value for this class of PSCs to date. Furthermore, the device retains 93.6% of its initial PCE after 1008 h under ambient conditions, demonstrating exceptional stability. This work offers a promising molecular engineering approach for enhancing the performance and durability of inorganic PSCs through interfacial modification.

         <title>Metallaphotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings of Aryl Chlorides and Alkyl Halides: Harnessing the &#963;&#8208;Donor/&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Synergy of a 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;Imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) pyridine Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and versatile metallaphotoredox catalyst system has been developed to promote highly selective C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) cross&#8208;electrophile couplings of aryl chlorides and alkyl halides. The design and development of a unique PyIm ligand was crucial in tuning the reactivity of the less reactive aryl chlorides. The strength of the protocol has been demonstrated through peptide diversification and direct functionalization of drugs, such as fenofibrate, indomethacin, and etoricoxib.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) reactions that forge C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bonds have received considerable attention due to the vast libraries of commercially available organohalides. However, the incorporation of ubiquitous aryl chlorides remains a challenge due to the slow rate of oxidative addition of metal catalysts to these electrophiles relative to iodide and bromide derivatives. This study reports a simple metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) method for the selective coupling of a broad range of aryl chlorides and alkyl halides. By design, this methodology exploits the enabling interplay of a bidentate 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligand, incorporating the strong &#963;&#8208;donor capacity of a 1H&#8208;imidazole moiety with the moderate &#960;&#8208;acceptor capacity of a pyridine unit. The synergy provided by these modular components allowed for the electronic requirements of elementary steps to be accommodated, such as the synchronous integration of alkyl radical generation (typically relatively fast) and oxidative addition of low valent nickel species to aryl chlorides (often relatively slow). This protocol enabled the efficient late&#8208;stage diversification of the drugs Me&#8208;fenofibrate, indomethacin, and etoricoxib to enhance their sp3&#8208;rich complexity. Using an equimolar ratio of substrates, this methodology facilitated a decagram XEC in continuous flow, showcasing the applicability of the method for large scale synthesis.

         <title>Formal Cyclopropylation of Imines with Cyclopropanols: Stereocontrolled Access to Conformationally Constrained &#947;&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal cyclopropylation of imines with cyclopropanols enables stereoselective access to cyclopropane&#8208;embedded &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols bearing three contiguous stereocenters. The transformation proceeds through a sequence of Mannich&#8208;type addition and ring closure involving enolized zinc homoenolate, and is applicable to both N&#8208;sulfonyl and chiral N&#8208;sulfinyl trifluoromethyl imines, providing building blocks diversifiable to various aminocarbonyl compounds.








Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Amino alcohols are essential motifs in bioactive compounds and chiral catalysts, yet the synthesis of their conformationally constrained variants remains challenging due to the lack of suitable methodologies. Here, we report a formal cyclopropylation of imines with cyclopropanols, enabling the construction of previously inaccessible cyclopropane&#8208;embedded &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols. This transformation leverages the unique reactivity of enolized zinc homoenolates, which effectively act as a &#946;&#8208;hydroxycyclopropyl anions and engage imines through a sequence of Mannich addition and ring closure. The key to this reactivity lies in the use of bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, which promote efficient coupling with N&#8208;sulfonyl aldimines as well as chiral N&#8208;sulfinyl trifluoromethyl&#8208;ketimines while ensuring excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters. Furthermore, the resulting &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols can be transformed into &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;aminofunctionalized ketones via homoenolate or &#946;&#8208;keto radical intermediates, offering versatile platforms for downstream derivatization.

         <title>Decoupling Roles of Cationic Dimensionality and Valence&#8208;Electron Compatibility on Structural Resilience and Kinetics in High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy Prussian blue with great mechanochemical compatibility is proposed as cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, contributing high reversible specific capacity, great rate capability and long&#8208;term lifespan over 9000 cycles due to the suppressed Jahn&#8211;Teller lattice distortion as well as the enhanced electron/ion transfer kinetics benefited from high&#8208;entropy effect. 








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have considered as high&#8208;performance cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the impact of high&#8208;entropy component compatibility on electrodes&#8217; lattice stress and kinetics remains underexplored. Herein, a series of high&#8208;entropy PBAs are served as cathode materials for SIBs. The tailoring Na2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2[Fe(CN)6] (HE&#8208;Cu) with superior mechanochemical compatibility shows superior phase stability without obvious lattice stress and faster electron/ion transfer kinetics. Intrinsic and accumulated lattice stresses can be obtained by ion&#8208;incompatible Sn&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy PBA (HE&#8208;Sn) and valence&#8208;electron mismatched Ti&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy PBA (HE&#8208;Ti), thereby exhibiting poor structure stability and dynamics. Serious Jahn&#8211;Teller structural distortion and unstable octahedron, observed in Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] with complicated Na&#8208;ion storage phase evolution (monoclinic &#8596; cubic &#8596; tetragonal), can be entirely suppressed by high&#8208;entropy effect, appearing a zero&#8208;strain solid&#8208;solution reaction mechanism for HE&#8208;Cu employing Mn, Fe, and Co&#8208;ions as redox centers to involve in charge compensation. Consequently, HE&#8208;Cu presents high initial specific capacity of 120.4&#160;mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, superior rate capability and outstanding cyclability with ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 9000 cycles with the lowest capacity&#8208;decay&#8208;rate of 0.0042% per cycle. Na&#8208;ion full cell demonstrates high initial energy density of 397.0&#160;Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 and perfect cycling stability with long lifespan over 2000 cycles.

         <title>Wacker Oxidation of Trisubstituted Alkenes: Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Ring Expansion of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl to 2&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
First examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes, coupled with electrophilic fluorination, enable a one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls to 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;acyl&#8208;cycloalkanones.








Abstract
The Wacker oxidation is a powerful synthetic method widely employed for the transformation of monosubstituted alkenes into methyl ketones. Its substrate scope has progressively expanded to include internal disubstituted and, more recently, gem&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Herein, we report the first examples of Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes under Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis. In the presence of Selectfluor (2.3 equiv) and a catalytic amount of Pd(MeCN)4(BF4)2 (10 mol%), exocyclic trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds undergo a fluorinative one&#8208;carbon ring expansion to deliver 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in good yields. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, including alkyl halide, aryl halide, alkyl tosylate, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, ester, secondary amide, ketone, cyano, and N&#8208;phthalimide. While a semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement of the Pd(IV) intermediate is a plausible mechanistic pathway given the excellent nucleofugality of the Pd(IV) atom, preliminary studies suggest that a 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement is operative in product formation.

         <title>Specific Recognition of Cysteine in a Mixed&#8208;Valence Bimetallic Organic Framework with Unique Channel Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional mixed&#8208;valence bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) features unique tubular and sinuous channels alongside ligand&#8208;provided active sites, and exhibits exceptional colorimetric selectivity for detecting cysteine or cysteine residues. This specific synergistic interaction enables the MOF to function as a highly promising sensor for monitoring thiolase enzyme activity, underscoring its significant potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
We have successfully designed and synthesized a mixed&#8208;valence bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), denoted ZnCoBTCHx, featuring periodic tubular and sinuous channels along with active sites provided by the ligands. This MOF demonstrates exceptional colorimetric selectivity toward cysteine (Cys). X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state&#160;13C NMR, UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectra, electrochemical analysis, and density functional theory calculations complementarily validate the valence state switching of cobalt centers in ZnCoBTCHx, the host&#8211;guest interactions and significant electron transfer between Cys and the framework. Additionally, isothermal titration calorimetry data suggest potential adsorption occurring within the channels of ZnCoBTCHx. In contrast, the mixed&#8208;valence CdCoBTCHx possesses a monoporous architecture wherein all potential N/O donor atoms of the ligands are engage in metal coordination. CdCoBTCHx displays a colorimetric response not only to Cys but also to other sulfur&#8208;containing amino acids. Notably, ZnCoBTCHx represents the first reported MOF that exhibits the ability to selectively recognize Cys residues in polypeptides and enzymes. This distinctive property enables ZnCoBTCHx to serve as a promising sensor for thiolase activity, underscoring its significant potential for biomedical applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Polyoxometalate Supramolecular Nanosheets for Efficient and Durable Water Oxidation</title>

Three self&#8208;assembled polyoxometalate superstructures with ultrathin graphene&#8208;like morphologies exhibit enhanced conductivity and increased exposure of activity sites, leading to a significant improvement in catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Superstructures assembled from nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs) attract considerable interest due to their well&#8208;defined architectures and outstanding physicochemical properties. However, the targeted synthesis of self&#8208;assembled POM&#8208;based superstructures with high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalytic performance remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of three POM&#8208;based superstructures with ultrathin graphene&#8208;like morphologies and well&#8208;organized frameworks via a simple self&#8208;assembled method, in which transition metals (TMs) bridge POMs into graphene&#8208;like planes, while cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) serves as an intercalation agent, endowing the structures with high surface area and enhanced electronic conductivity. Among the resulting materials (denote as POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;TM, TM&#9552;Co, Ni, or Cu), POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a low overpotential of 292&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations underscore that the Co atoms within the POM serve as active sites and facilitate the rate&#8208;determining step of *OOH formation. Moreover, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer employing POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;Co as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode demonstrates exceptional performance, delivering a current density of 2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 2.247&#160;V, along with remarkable durability exceeding 2000&#160;h at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This study develops a simple and efficient method for synthesizing supramolecular POM&#8208;based nanosheets as OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Spatially Engineered Ternary Schottky/S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially integrated Nb2C/Nb2O5/ZnO heterostructure couples Schottky and S&#8208;scheme interfaces to promote directional charge separation and photothermal&#8208;assisted CO2 activation, enabling efficient photoreduction without molecular cocatalysts or sacrificial agents through synergistic interfacial engineering and carrier dynamic control.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into solar fuels presents a promising strategy for carbon mitigation and sustainable energy conversion. However, single&#8208;component photocatalysts suffer from inefficient charge separation, while binary heterojunctions&#8212;even with cocatalysts assistance&#8212;often undergo rapid Coulombic recombination due to timescale mismatches between ultrafast charge transfer and slower surface reaction kinetics. To overcome these limitations, a spatially engineered Nb2C/Nb2O5/ZnO ternary heterostructure is developed by anchoring ZnO quantum dots (QDs) onto Nb2O5 nanorods grown in situ from Nb2C MXene. This architecture integrates an Nb2O5/ZnO S&#8208;scheme heterojunction and an Nb2C/Nb2O5 Schottky junction, sharing Nb2O5 as a central mediator, thereby establishing bidirectional interfacial electric fields (IEFs) that direct photogenerated electrons toward ZnO and holes toward Nb2C. In situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveal interface&#8208;specific electronic interactions and time&#8208;resolved carrier dynamics, confirming efficient and spatially resolved charge migration across the decoupled interfaces. This spatial charge separation effectively suppresses Coulombic recombination and prolongs carrier lifetimes. Additionally, the photothermal effect of Nb2C MXene enhances CO2 chemisorption and activation at defective ZnO QDs. These synergistic effects collectively enable high&#8208;efficiency CO2 photoreduction without molecular cocatalysts or sacrificial agents, providing a mechanistically distinct and scalable approach for artificial photosynthesis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofluidics has garnered significant attention due to the designability and unique transport features at the nanoscale. With the development of nanofabrication, nanofluidic devices are systematically developed for ultrasensitive molecular recognition and physical perception, paving the way for intelligent recognition applications in the fields of bioscience, food safety, medical diagnostics, and so on.








Abstract
Nanofluidics has garnered significant attention as the ultra&#8208;sensitive method for molecular recognition and physical perception that are not easily accessible through the traditional methods. The development of nanofluidic devices necessitates the integrated solid&#8208;state nanochannels/nanopores with versatile surface modification strategies using precise nanofabrication techniques. This review systematically summarizes the development of the solid&#8208;state nanochannels and nanopores, nanofabrication methods, sensing principles, transport characteristics, and the strategies employed to perceive molecules and physical stimuli. The discussion also emphasizes promising research directions and explores how the interaction between interface chemistry influenced by molecular recognition and physical stimuli, in conjunction with the exceptional ion transport properties of nanofluidic devices, significantly impacts the sensing performance of the nanofluidics. Lastly, we present the vision for the future prospects of biomimetic nanofluidic devices in ionic sensing applications.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Cations in Phosphates: A Pathway to Solar&#8208;Blind UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Phase&#8208;Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduce &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation as a universal paradigm to equilibrate bandgap, birefringence, and SHG&#8208;responsible constraints. Enable an NLO crystal (GUPO) that exhibits full&#8208;wavelength PM ability (down to 215&#160;nm) and outperforms the traditional commercial KDP's PM wavelength limit by 43&#160;nm blueshift.








Abstract
While birefringence phase&#8208;matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (&#916;n&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region (&#955; &lt; 280&#160;nm). Herein, we demonstrate a &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite&#8208;based NLO crystals: (C2N4OH7)H2PO3 (GUPO) and C(NH2)3H2PO3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guanidinium cations and [H2PO3]&#8315; anions enables record&#8208;breaking optical anisotropy (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.19 @ 589.3&#160;nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates. Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full&#8208;wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215&#160;nm. Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP at 1064&#160;nm and 1.0 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BBO at 532&#160;nm), which may enable direct 266&#160;nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations.

     alt="&#960;-Conjugated Cations in Phosphates: A Pathway to Solar-Blind UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Phase-Matching"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduce &#960;-conjugated cation as a universal paradigm to equilibrate bandgap, birefringence, and SHG-responsible constraints. Enable an NLO crystal (GUPO) that exhibits full-wavelength PM ability (down to 215&#160;nm) and outperforms the traditional commercial KDP's PM wavelength limit by 43&#160;nm blueshift.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While birefringence phase-matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) region (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 280&#160;nm). Herein, we demonstrate a &#960;-conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite-based NLO crystals: (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (GUPO) and C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (GPO). The synergistic alignment of &#960;-conjugated guanidinium cations and [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8315; anions enables record-breaking optical anisotropy (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.19 @ 589.3&#160;nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates. Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full-wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215&#160;nm. Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second-harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP at 1064&#160;nm and 1.0 &#215; &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-BBO at 532&#160;nm), which may enable direct 266&#160;nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes &#960;-conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bispecific DNA&#8208;Peptide Probes for Targeting Receptor Pairs on Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA duplex&#8208;programmed presentation of two different (cyclo)peptides provides bispecific agents that recognize unique fingerprints of cells through improved avidity and specificity. Bispecific DNA&#8208;cyclopeptide complexes enabled a cell&#8208;specific targeting and internalization of cytotoxic payload. 








Abstract
Chemical modification and nucleic acid self&#8208;assembly can be used to make protein receptor ligands form specific arrangements. While this property has been extensively exploited for probing of homomultivalent interactions, there has been comparatively little attention paid to the exploration of heteromultivalent interactions. In this study, we investigated the use of readily assemblable DNA duplexes for programming bispecific targeting of specific cell types. In contrast to previous bispecific agents, we leverage the potential of peptide&#8208;based high&#8208;affinity binders of cell surface proteins used in diagnostics/therapeutics. Systematic spatial screening revealed the optimal distance between two (cyclo)peptides required for selectively recognizing cells expressing unique combinations of receptors. The VGFR2/&#945;V&#946;3 receptor system on HUVECs was tolerant to changes of the distance between two cyclopeptides (L and cyclo(&#8208;RGDf(N&#8208;Me)K&#8208;)) and required that the distance exceeded the equivalent of 20 nucleotides distance. A different distance&#8208;affinity landscape was observed for recognition of EGFR and MET on A549 cells (through GE11 and bicyclic peptide GE&#8208;137). The DNA&#8208;programmed bispecific binders demonstrated specificity and efficient internalization into target cells. Auristatin&#8208;loaded DNA enabled a selective targeting of cytotoxic payload. Of note, the distance&#8208;optimized bispecific DNA&#8208;peptide probes have much lower molecular weight than previously used agents based on DNA nanostructures or antibodies.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active &#960;&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Carbon Nanohoop Featuring Unique Kasha/Anti&#8208;Kasha Dual Emissions: Structure, Photophysical Properties, and Photoconductivity</title>

         <dc:description>
exTTF[10]CPP, featuring shape&#8208;persistent architecture and curved conjugation, exhibits tunable Kasha/anti&#8208;Kasha dual emissions. Meanwhile, exTTF[10]CPP not only exhibits reversible redox responsiveness but also shows redox&#8208;dependent tunability in its binding interaction with C60. Moreover, its complex with C60 displays exceptional charge&#8208;transfer property, enhancing the photocurrent in C60&#8834;exTTF[10]CPP&#8208;based cast film.








Abstract
Developing functionalized cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) that respond to various stimuli, particularly redox, remains challenging yet crucial for advanced nanocarbon applications. Here, we report the exploration of the synergy between the concave &#960;&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (exTTF) and the curved CPP scaffold for constructing the rigid, conjugated nanohoop exTTF[10]CPP. X&#8208;ray analysis reveals a unique spherical packing arrangement in which six adjacent nanohoops interlock through concave and convex interactions. Interestingly, fluorescence studies revealed that exTTF[10]CPP exhibited unexpected anti&#8208;Kasha emissions originating from higher excited states, along with Kasha emission from S1 excited state in toluene and THF. However, in a PMMA film, it displayed a redshifted Kasha emission. The unique Kasha/anti&#8208;Kasha dual&#8208;emission behavior represents a rarely explored photophysical phenomenon within exTTF derivatives and nanocarbon&#8208;based systems. Ultraviolet&#8208;Visible (UV&#8211;vis) absorption investigations showed that exTTF[10]CPP demonstrated reversible redox responsiveness with tunable binding affinity for C60 up to 1.92&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;M&#8722;1. Notably, femtosecond transient absorption measurements further revealed a prolonged lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state, C60&#8226;&#8722;/exTTF[10]CPP&#8226;+, which provides sufficient time for charge utilization. This exceptional charge&#8208;transfer property enhances the photocurrent in C60&#8834;exTTF[10]CPP&#8208;based cast film, which is 2.43 times higher than that of exTTF[10]CPP alone, highlighting its potential in photoelectronic device.

         <title>Strong Oxide&#8208;Support Interaction Induced Thermal Stabilization of Pt Single Atoms for Durable Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are prone to sintering into larger particles under high&#8208;temperature oxidation. In contrast, a La2O3&#8208;modified Pt/Al2O3 catalyst undergoes a transformation to the formation of Al2O3&#8208;Pt1&#8208;La2O3 structure via strong oxide&#8208;support interaction (SOSI)&#8212;driven interfacial reconstruction during calcination, markedly improving CO oxidation performance and thermal durability.








Abstract
Supported metal nanoparticle catalysts often suffer from sintering&#8208;induced size&#8208;dependent deactivation, limiting their high&#8208;temperature applications. Although high&#8208;temperature redispersion offers a potential solution, this strategy remains restricted to reducible support materials, severely limiting the selection of catalyst supports with versatile compositions and tunable functionalities. Here, we engineer cationic vacancies at Al2O3&#8208;La2O3 interface via strong oxide&#8208;support interaction (SOSI)&#8212;driven interfacial reconstruction during calcination. The vacancy&#8208;mediated confinement effect dynamically intercepts migrating Pt species, enabling the construction of Al2O3&#8208;Pt1&#8208;La2O3 structure with precisely defined coordination environments. The resulting catalyst achieves complete CO conversion at 145&#160;&#176;C and maintains stability with minimal decline after a 6&#8208;h treatment at 1100&#160;&#176;C in air with 10% steam. This interfacial engineering strategy proves universal, as demonstrated by ZrO2&#8208;La2O3 counterparts. Our findings break the reducibility dependency in traditional single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) stabilization by establishing oxide&#8211;oxide interface as universal anchoring platforms, which expands the design space of industrial&#8208;grade SACs beyond conventional reducible oxides.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Fortification of FeS Clusters Reshapes Anaerobic CO Dehydrogenase into an Air&#8208;Viable Enzyme through Multilayered Sealing of O2 Tunnels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered CO dehydrogenase (CODH) that remains active in air through a multilayered gas tunnel is illustrated on the cover. The architecture selectively blocks O2 while allowing CO/CO2 to access the FeS cluster, thereby maintaining redox balance and preventing oxidative destabilization. The visual contrast between inactive and active forms highlights the tunnel's protective role. This work offers a tunnel&#8208;guided strategy for engineering air&#8208;stable metalloenzymes with practical potential, as described by Suk Min Kim, Hyung Ho Lee, Yong Hwan Kim et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202508565).

         <title>Inside Front Cover: A Bidirectional Ion Kinetic Regulator Suppressing Lithium Dendrites in Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sande's formula suggests that anion migration has a more significant impact on the deposition behavior of Li+ compared to cation migration. In their Research Article (e202504398), Jun Jiang, Junwu Zhu, Yongsheng Fu et&#160;al. propose a bidirectional ion kinetic regulator. By controlling the bidirectional migration of anions (TFSI&#8208;) and cations (Li+), they successfully delayed the formation of lithium dendrites. This study provides a novel strategy for the development of high&#8208;safety and stable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>An Immobilized Rh&#8208;Based Solid Molecular Catalyst for the Reductive Hydroformylation of 1&#8208;Octene</title>

In the center a greenish droplet made of marble can be seen from which a chemical structure emerges, exemplifying the presented heterogenized, but molecular catalyst system for the reductive hydroformylation. The catalyst design was inspired by a homogeneous Rh&#8208;predecessor, which can be seen in the back in a characteristic dark green. Surrounding the droplet of the best&#8208;performing catalyst are masonry tools and broken drops featuring previous, less effective catalyst design iterations. Details of this research are reported by Andreas J. Vorholt et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202424144).

In their Research Article (e202504154), Julian Thiele et&#160;al. present an efficient and rapid step test for determining optimum printing parameters in Digital Light Processing (DLP). It enables the testing of several parameter settings within one print, it is easy to implement, and adaptable to other UV&#8208;polymerization&#8208;based printing methods, thus speeding up the time from resin screening to optimal printing parameters and products. Cover art designed by Martin Schumann and Marie Zeil.

Perfluoroalkylation reactions are important to the pharmaceutical industry, and for a long time their synthesis was limited to the use of oxidants, heating, complex catalysts or inert atmospheres. In their Communication (e202504137), Julia R. Khusnutdinova and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the mechanochemical activation of Celite and biogenic sand to obtain perfluoroalkylated molecules.

         <title>Collision&#8208;Induced Fragmentation of Oligosaccharides: Mechanistic Insights for Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Glycomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>

Glycan fragmentation with collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry (MS) leads to a range of specific disassembly mechanisms, which are being reviewed in detail.








Abstract
Structural alterations in oligosaccharides are often associated with disease, positioning clinical glycomics as an emerging tool for diagnostics. This is most commonly achieved using a controlled collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) of larger oligosaccharides into fragments and measuring their mass in a mass spectrometer. Due to the complexity of oligosaccharides, and particularly their unusual fragmentation mechanisms, the underlying processes are poorly understood. Deciphering glycan fragmentation and making it understandable is highly desirable and would transform the field of glycomics from an expert technique into a widely applicable tool available to non&#8208;specialists. Here, we review the current knowledge of glycan fragmentation mechanisms in CID, with particular emphasis on hexose migrations and the anomeric memory. We discuss challenges and perspectives for future investigations, opening the window to widespread use of glycomics in clinical applications based on a fundamental understanding of glycan fragmentation.

         <title>Backbone Protecting Groups for Enhanced Peptide and Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive account of the use of backbone N&#8208;protecting groups in peptide synthesis. It includes detailed synthetic methods relating to their introduction and removal and their application to &#8220;difficult&#8221; peptides and proteins of biological significance in both academic and industry contexts.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis has become an indispensable technique for the routine preparation of linear peptides of up to approximately 40 amino acids in length. However, the solid&#8208;phase approach is still hampered by chain insolubility and aggregation, which reduces synthetic yields. Moreover, many of the deletion impurities that can form are often chromatographically inseparable from the target sequence, which diminishes final product purity. The use of backbone N&#8208;protecting groups can ameliorate this synthetic inefficiency by increasing peptide chain solubility and suppressing aggregation. Backbone protection is also useful for promoting peptide macrocyclization, suppressing common side reactions in peptide chemistry, and improving solution&#8208;phase handling. Commercially available precursors containing benzyl&#8208;based groups and pseudoprolines have found widespread use, in academic laboratories and industry. A range of other strategies have also been investigated in a bid to increase the utility of backbone protecting groups and to develop more efficient methods for their introduction and removal. This review provides a comprehensive account of the state of the art, and includes detailed synthetic methods relating to the use of backbone protection, and its application to &#8220;difficult&#8221; peptides and proteins of biological significance. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are analyzed, and a commentary on future directions is provided.

The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of one&#8208;dimensional (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC) doped with Cd2+ remains consistently high (&#8764;95%) across the studied composition range (x&#160;=&#160;Cdx/Mn1&#8208;x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;0.22). By combining PL lifetime measurements, high&#8208;pressure optical absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction structural analysis, we demonstrate that the PLQY exhibits only minimal dependence on x. This finding contrasts with recent reports,1 claiming that the PLQY initially rises with Cd2+ content up to x&#160;=&#160;0.08, then declines sharply from 95% to 77% at x&#160;=&#160;0.22.








Abstract
The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of tetramethyl ammonium manganese(II) chloride, (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC), doped with Cd2+/Cu2+ is analyzed through photoluminescence measurements, X&#8208;ray diffraction, optical absorption, and time&#8208;resolved excitation and emission under hydrostatic pressure. Contrary to recent studies reporting a PLQY increase up to x&#160;=&#160;Cdx/Mn1&#8208;x&#160;=&#160;0.08 followed by a decline (from 95% to 77% at x&#160;=&#160;0.22),1 we demonstrate that the PLQY remains consistently high (&#8805;95%) across the concentration range x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;0.22.

Acid&#8208;induced dissolution of a drug crystal from molecular dynamics simulations. We suggest a two&#8208;step crystal dissolution mechanism encompassing solute aggregates within a &#8220;dense&#8208;solutes domain&#8217;&#8221; Between the crystal and the bulk solvent, such aggregates act as &#8220;puffer species&#8221; to maintain constant concentration of the fully solvated solutes species &#8211; thus providing a molecular rationale of commonly used macroscopic crystal dissolution models.








Abstract
The kinetics of drug release from molecular crystals is commonly described by the Nernst&#8208;Brunner model created in 1904 &#8211; and since then, numerous empirical evidence supporting its suitability as a mathematical approximation has been collected. However, providing mechanistic rationales turned out to be much more complicated. Elaborating on the molecular mechanisms of acid&#8208;induced carbamazepine (CBZ) dissolution, we suggest a molecular simulation case study of &#8220;Nernst&#8208;Brunner type&#8221; drug release to an aqueous solution featuring an interfacial &#8220;diffusion&#8221; layer. Mimicking pH&#160;=&#160;2, we find drastic protonation of the drug crystallite model, followed by the dissolution of both single CBZH+ solutes and fragments of the crystal edges. The latter lead to the release of [CBZHn]n+ aggregates (with n&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;8) into the solution, thus fueling a dynamic interplay of different solute species. In some analogy to so&#8208;called two&#8208;step crystal nucleation, we therefore suggest a two&#8208;step crystal dissolution mechanism encompassing solute aggregates within a &#8220;dense&#8208;solutes domain&#8221;. Within an interfacial region between the crystal and the bulk solvent, such aggregates are suggested as &#8220;puffer species&#8221; that account for a constant concentration of the fully solvated solute species.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Fixation into Dimethyl Carbonate via Multiple Active Sites Constituted by VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O Vacancy Clusters on Single&#8208;Unit&#8208;Cell CeO2 Nano&#8208;Sheets</title>

Vacancy engineering was employed to precisely design and construct the unique structure of Ce1&#8208;&#948;O2&#8208;x atomic layers (thickness: about 0.65&#160;nm) with enriched vacancy clusters comprising of cationic&#8208;anion defects. These unique vacancy&#8208;cluster sties facilitate the synergistic activation of CO2/CH3OH, enhancing the formation of key intermediates for the highly efficient synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (31.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1).








Abstract
The thermodynamic stability and intrinsic kinetic inertia of CO2 present a critical challenge for its effective activation in the synthesis of high&#8208;value dimethyl carbonate (DMC). In this work, we report the fabrication of novel O&#8208;Ce&#8208;O vacancy clusters (VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O) incorporated into CeO2 nano&#8208;sheets with a near single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell thickness to construct atomically adjacent multiple active sites on their surfaces. These active sites significantly enhance the activation of both CO2 and CH3OH. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared CeO2 with VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O catalyst exhibits an excellent DMC yield of 31.2&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1, surpassing previously reported Ce&#8208;based catalysts under equivalent reaction conditions. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that oxygen vacancy increases the reducibility of lattice oxygen, facilitating CO2 activation, while cerium vacancies weaken the *CH3O adsorption, promoting the coupling reaction between *CH3O and *CO2 to form the intermediate (*CH3OC(O)2). Notably, the formation of vacancy clusters reduces the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;controlled step (*CH3OC(O)2 dissociation to *CH3OCO), thereby boosting the DMC yield. Our new findings provide valuable insights into surface engineering and active site modulation of cerium&#8208;based catalysts, offering a viable pathway for green resource utilization of CO2.

         <title>An Immobilized Rh&#8208;Based Solid Molecular Catalyst for the Reductive Hydroformylation of 1&#8208;Octene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>

The reductive hydroformylation of olefins can be catalyzed by Rh which is immobilized on a highly branched amine containing polymer for efficient recycling and a high selectivity and alcohol yield.








Abstract
The reductive hydroformylation of olefins is an important process in the chemical industry to produce alcohols directly without isolating the aldehydes as intermediates. As the hydroformylation is a homogeneously catalyzed reaction, the catalyst recycling and down&#8208;stream processing is often complex and energy intensive. A heterogeneous reductive hydroformylation catalyst was developed in this work by immobilizing Rh on polymeric amine macroligands to form solid molecular catalysts (SMCs). An iterative macroligand improvement was carried out by increasing the basicity and number of amine groups at the immobilization sites. With the best performing SMC, olefins were fully converted to &gt;99% alcohols without a hydrogenation of the substrate in a solvent free environment, thus requiring only a separation of the heterogeneous catalyst to yield the pure product. The catalyst was successfully recycled over 12 runs with a perpetual Rh leaching as low as 1.2%, and the metal to macroligand ratio was identified as most important parameter in reducing metal loss.

         <title>Realizing Persistent Lithium Protection and Revival with Dissolution&#8208;Equilibrium&#8208;Driven Sustainable Additives Reservoir</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a dissolution equilibrium&#8208;driven AgI additive reservoir that provides a durable lithium protection. The sustainably released trace amounts of Ag+ and I&#8722; promote a constantly stable interphase on the anode and facilitate the reactivating of inactive lithium. The practical pouch cells utilizing this strategy demonstrate a prolonged cycle life over 200 cycles with 82% capacity retention.








Abstract
Additive chemistry plays a pivotal role in enhancing the cycling stability of lithium metal batteries. Conventional additives with high solubility facilitate the formation of a stable interface in the early stages of cycling, yet typically act as &#8220;sacrificial agents&#8221;, failing to maintain a durable interface over long time. Herein, we demonstrate a sustainable lithium protection and retrieval strategy based on additive reservoirs driven by chemical dissolution equilibrium. A sparingly soluble AgI coating on the separator provides a continuous supply of constant concentration of Ag+ and I&#8722;, where Ag+ contributes to the formation of a Li&#8211;Ag alloy interphase, promoting uniform Li deposition, while I&#8722; assisting in the recovery of inactive Li. With this strategy, symmetric Li||Li batteries deliver an extended cycle life over of 1000 h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Additionally, practical pouch cells demonstrate a prolonged cycle life of over 200 cycles with 82% capacity retention. This work offers new insights into additive chemistry and paves the way for the development of durable lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Regioselective Hydrocyanation of Internal Alkynes Enabled by a Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free dual&#8208;catalytic hydrocyanation of internal, electronically non&#8208;activated alkynes has been developed. The methodology merges base&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;allene isomerization and phosphine&#8208;catalyzed HCN transfer, affording high chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity in synthesis of diverse vinyl nitriles in excellent yields, demonstrating broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions.








Abstract
Since its discovery in 1954, the hydrocyanation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds has emerged as a powerful strategy for the synthesis of nitriles. However, the elusive control of selectivity and typical reliance on expensive and toxic transition metal (TM) based catalysts significantly hinder the utility of this process. Here, we report an exclusively regioselective hydrocyanation of unbiased alkynes, driven by base&#8208;catalyzed reversible alkyne&#8208;allene isomerization and phosphine&#8208;catalyzed HCN transfer to the allene. This TM&#8208;free, dual&#8208;catalytic approach introduces a novel mode of selectivity control via regioselective hydrocyanation of the allene intermediate.

     alt="Regioselective Hydrocyanation of Internal Alkynes Enabled by a Transition-Metal-Free Dual-Catalytic System"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transition-metal-free dual-catalytic hydrocyanation of internal, electronically non-activated alkynes has been developed. The methodology merges base-catalyzed alkyne-allene isomerization and phosphine-catalyzed HCN transfer, affording high chemo-, stereo-, and regioselectivity in synthesis of diverse vinyl nitriles in excellent yields, demonstrating broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its discovery in 1954, the hydrocyanation of multiple carbon-carbon bonds has emerged as a powerful strategy for the synthesis of nitriles. However, the elusive control of selectivity and typical reliance on expensive and toxic transition metal (TM) based catalysts significantly hinder the utility of this process. Here, we report an exclusively regioselective hydrocyanation of unbiased alkynes, driven by base-catalyzed reversible alkyne-allene isomerization and phosphine-catalyzed HCN transfer to the allene. This TM-free, dual-catalytic approach introduces a novel mode of selectivity control via regioselective hydrocyanation of the allene intermediate. The methodology secures a cost-effective access to a broad range of vinyl nitriles (40 examples) with yields up to 97% and Z/E stereoselectivity up to 20:1, including complex natural product derivatives. A comparison with TM-based systems highlighted a 2500-fold cost reduction, as well as the elimination of the troublesome separation of the regioisomers. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway, shedding light on the achieved regioselectivity. By altering one catalyst in a dual-catalytic system, we demonstrated the regioselectivity switch, thereby facilitating regiodivergent hydrocyanation (eight examples). In a broader context, this approach offers a foundation for developing the next generation of TM-free strategies for the regioselective hydrofunctionalizations of unbiased alkynes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Complex Donuts: Small Variations in DNA Sequence Dictate Pathway Complexity in DNA Nanotoroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical information encoded in the sequence of DNA amphiphiles enables the selective formation of kinetically trapped DNA nanotoroids through a complex self&#8208;assembly pathway. The toroids are formed as on&#8208;pathway structures via a competitive mechanism only when a toroid&#8208;selective DNA sequence is used.








Abstract
The formation of higher&#8208;order structures in natural biopolymers, such as polypeptides and nucleic acids, is governed by sequence specificity and monomer chemistry. Although nucleic acids can assemble into programmable nanostructures through base&#8208;pairing interactions, their chemical diversity is limited to four nucleobases. DNA amphiphiles overcome this limitation by introducing orthogonal interactions through non&#8208;nucleosidic modifications. These amphiphiles self&#8208;assemble into diverse morphologies, such as spheres, fibers, or sheets, with closely packed, parallel DNA strands on their exterior. This unusual arrangement can give rise to emergent properties absent in simple DNA strands. Here, we show that the precise sequence of single&#8208;stranded DNA, independent of double helix base&#8208;pairing, can be used to program the self&#8208;assembled morphology of DNA amphiphiles. Remarkably, small sequence variations can drive the formation of nonequilibrium DNA nanotoroids, rather than conventional morphologies. The DNA nanotoroids were formed as on&#8208;pathway structures via a competitive mechanism, only when a toroid&#8208;selective DNA sequence was used. They could be stabilized noncovalently by a small molecule cross&#8208;linker or coassembly with a secondary DNA amphiphile. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the dependence of toroid formation on the structure of the end &#960;&#8208;stacking unit. This work introduces a new class of DNA&#8208;based nanotoroid materials with assembly properties controlled by unique sequences, akin to proteins, for applications in cell delivery, nanofiltration, nanoreactors, and materials templation.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Driven In Situ Formation of Bimetallic Catalysts via Sn2+/Sn4+ Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative in situ redox&#8208;driven strategy utilizes Sn2+/Sn4+ ions interconversion for the synthesis of Sn&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts. This approach involves immobilizing Sn2+ ions on Al&#8208;deficient alumina, followed by secondary metal ions capture via redox reactions.








Abstract
Bimetallic catalysts have garnered substantial interest across diverse fields due to their distinctive geometric and electronic structures. Nevertheless, achieving uniformly distributed bimetallic catalysts remains challenging due to the solubility or charge properties of ions in specific bimetallic systems. Herein, we present an innovative in situ redox&#8208;driven synthesis strategy utilizing Sn2+/Sn4+ interconversion to address these challenges. By immobilizing Sn2+ ions on Al&#8208;deficient alumina and capturing secondary metal ions through redox reactions, we successfully synthesized eight distinct Sn&#8211;M bimetallic catalysts. The representative Sn&#8211;Pt catalysts derived from [PtCl4]2&#8722; or [Pt(NH3)4]2+ ions, lead to the reduction of Pt2+ to Pt0 with analogous local structures, resulting in comparable catalytic performance in carbon monoxide oxidation and propane dehydrogenation. This redox&#8208;driven synthesis strategy can be extended to other bimetallic systems, with promising preliminary results observed in Cr&#8211;M systems. This innovative strategy effectively mitigates the hydrolysis of tin ions, neutralizes the influence of ion charges, and addresses the solubility challenges of secondary metal ions, providing a robust solution for the design of bimetallic catalysts.

         <title>Coordinative Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Limonene Carbamate Toward Phosgene&#8208; and Isocyanate&#8208;Free Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a phosgene&#8208; and isocyanate&#8208;free route to terpene&#8208;based polyurethanes using (R)&#8208;limonene as a bio&#8208;based feedstock. Through ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), limonene carbamate (LU) is converted into polyurethane (PLU) with high efficiency. Mechanistic insights are provided based on kinetic studies, end group analysis, and kinetic isotope effect experiments. Thermal analyses reveal promising material properties and chemical circularity.








Abstract
This study presents a phosgene&#8208; and isocyanate&#8208;free route for the synthesis of polyurethanes using (R)&#8208;limonene as a bio&#8208;based starting material. The synthesis of the cyclic limonene&#8208;based carbamate monomer LU is achieved in high yields using dimethyl carbonate as a sustainable, less hazardous phosgene surrogate and is verified by NMR, SC&#8208;XRD, ESI&#8208;MS, GC&#8208;MS, and elemental analysis. Polymerizations were carried out by coordinative ring&#8208;opening polymerization. Sn(Oct)2 showed the best catalytic performance, achieving up to 93% conversion with molecular weights up to 16.0&#160;kg mol&#8722;1 at a polydispersity of 1.5. Detailed mechanistic insights were obtained by kinetic studies, end group determination via ESI&#8208;MS and stoichiometric ninhydrin experiments, N&#8211;H methylation of LU, kinetic isotope experiments, and 119Sn&#160;NMR measurements. The resulting semi&#8208;crystalline polyurethane exhibits promising thermal properties, including a decomposition temperature of 252&#160;&#176;C and a glass transition temperature above 150&#160;&#176;C. Depolymerization in solution was achieved in high yield using the same catalyst. This work describes a coordinative ring&#8208;opening polymerization approach using a terpene&#8208;based carbamate as monomer, an important step toward bio&#8208;based polyurethanes.

         <title>Corrosion of Calcium Metal in Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc Electrolyte and its Solution via Alloy Interface and Competitive Solvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We revealed two types of corrosion of calcium metal in 0.3&#160;m Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc electrolytes: native passivation between Ca metal and DMAc solvent during initial aging and electrochemical corrosion between Ca metal and TFSI&#8722; anion upon charging/discharging afterwards. Bearing those failure mechanisms in mind, we proposed additive strategy to simultaneously mitigate both corrosion types through in situ alloying and competitive Ca2&#8314;&#8208;I&#8315; interactions.








Abstract
Calcium metal batteries (CMBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to calcium&#8216;s abundance and high theoretical capacity, but hindered by poor compatibility between electrolyte and calcium metal. Here, we unveil two corrosion types of calcium in calcium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide)/dimethylacetamide [Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc]&#160;electrolytes: native passivation from solvent reduction during aging and electrochemical corrosion from anion decomposition. The native passivation layer aggravates the electrochemical corrosion by the decomposition of TFSI&#8722; to the large grain Ca2+&#8208;insulator CaF2, leading to the calcium metal failure. We introduce a bifunctional SnI2 electrolyte additive to simultaneously mitigate both corrosions. Sn2+ facilitate the spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction to form the Ca&#8208;Sn alloy, inhibiting native passivation, while I&#8722; replace TFSI&#8722; to participate in the Ca2+ primary solvation shell and prevent the electrochemical TFSI&#8722; decomposition. By taking advantage of those features above, over 500 h of stable cycling with a reduced overpotential of 0.33&#160;V at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2 was achieved, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ca(TFSI)2&#8208;based electrolytes. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of corrosion at calcium metal surface and will guide suitable electrolyte design for anti&#8208;corrosion in metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;We revealed two types of corrosion of calcium metal in 0.3&#160;m Ca(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/DMAc electrolytes: native passivation between Ca metal and DMAc solvent during initial aging and electrochemical corrosion between Ca metal and TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion upon charging/discharging afterwards. Bearing those failure mechanisms in mind, we proposed additive strategy to simultaneously mitigate both corrosion types through in situ alloying and competitive Ca&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;-I&#8315; interactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium metal batteries (CMBs) are promising for large-scale energy storage due to calcium&#8216;s abundance and high theoretical capacity, but hindered by poor compatibility between electrolyte and calcium metal. Here, we unveil two corrosion types of calcium in calcium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide)/dimethylacetamide [Ca(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/DMAc]&#160;electrolytes: native passivation from solvent reduction during aging and electrochemical corrosion from anion decomposition. The native passivation layer aggravates the electrochemical corrosion by the decomposition of TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to the large grain Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-insulator CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to the calcium metal failure. We introduce a bifunctional SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte additive to simultaneously mitigate both corrosions. Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; facilitate the spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction to form the Ca-Sn alloy, inhibiting native passivation, while I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; replace TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to participate in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; primary solvation shell and prevent the electrochemical TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; decomposition. By taking advantage of those features above, over 500 h of stable cycling with a reduced overpotential of 0.33&#160;V at 0.1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved, outperforming state-of-the-art Ca(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based electrolytes. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of corrosion at calcium metal surface and will guide suitable electrolyte design for anti-corrosion in metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Biosensing of Drug&#8208;Induced Cell&#8208;Heterogeneous Injuries with an Ultrahigh Turn&#8208;On Ratio</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo biosensing of oxidative injury with a high turn&#8208;on ratio in the near&#8208;infrared, i.e., 800&#160;nm and beyond, is critical for drug development, disease diagnosis, and surgery. We developed a novel probe&#8208;design strategy, namely asymmetric conjugative addition, for a bisbenannulated xanthoid dye (EC5). Fluorescence emission at 890&#160;nm exhibited over 200&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on upon detection of oxidative species. Its feasibility for macroscopic and microscopic detection of drug&#8208;induced toxicities is demonstrated.








Abstract
Fluorescence probes of reactive oxygen species in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region, i.e., 800&#160;nm and beyond, are desired for in vivo biosensing, diagnosis, and pharmacology. However, the NIR dyes are typically prone to oxidative destruction, and the probes based on these dyes exhibit a poor fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratio and a low detection sensitivity. EC5 is a bright and stable NIR fluorochromic scaffold and yet has not been exploited for probe design. Despite the structural analogy of EC5 to xanthene dyes, the classic spiro&#8208;cyclization at the central methine carbon was surprisingly not applicable to EC5. Here, we report the rational development of a novel probe design strategy for EC5 dye, i.e., asymmetric conjugative addition at the quinone&#8208;methide carbon. EC5&#8208;H3 via this approach is a robust probe for highly oxidative species. Its merits include an ultrahigh turn&#8208;on ratio of ca. 200&#8208;fold and high resistance of the detection product toward ONOO&#8722;&#8208;mediated destruction. The feasibility of EC5&#8208;H3 for practical applications was showcased by in vivo biosensing of drug&#8208;induced oxidative injuries to the liver. The high turn&#8208;on ratio and high brightness of the probe allow tissue injuries to be imaged with confocal microscopy to reveal the heterogeneity in oxidative injuries to different liver cells.

         <title>Intriguing Reactivity of a 1,2&#8208;Dihydrodialumane Towards Organic Azides &#8211; From a Terminal Diazido&#8211;Dialumane to Pendulum&#8208;Clock&#8208;Like Azide Bridging</title>

         <dc:description>
The reaction of a dihydro&#8208;dialane supported by a hybrid ligand (DNI) with organic azides yields structurally diverse aluminium species, including the first example of low oxidation state aluminium azide complex, a diazido&#8208;dialane, along with an aluminium&#8208;tetrazole, and azide alumination. Spectroscopic studies reveal dynamic behaviour in solution, featuring a pendulum&#8208;clock&#8208;like motion of the benzyl azide and N&#945; oscillation within the complex.








Abstract
The reactivity of dihydro&#8208;dialane with organic azides is described. Treatment of the hybrid ligand&#8208;based dialane [(DNI{H}Al)2] (I) (DNI&#160;=&#160;[3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline)ethenyl]&#8208;3H&#8208;indolenine) with TMSN3 (TMS&#160;=&#160;trimethylsilyl) at room temperature gives the first diazido&#8208;dialane [(DNI{N3}Al)2] (1). The transformation from here to a more stable aluminium&#8208;tetrazole [DNIAl(NTMS)2N2] (2) is established. The reaction of other RN3 gives [(DNI{H}Al)2(&#954;2&#8208;N3R)] (R&#160;=&#160;Benzyl in 3 and 1&#8208;Adamantyl in 4) with the azide in a &#956;&#8208;bridging position between two aluminium atoms. Using 1H NOESY/EXSY NMR spectroscopy, a positional exchange of the two TMS groups (2) via rotation of the tetrazole unit is observed. In contrast, compound 3 exhibits a pendulum&#8208;clock&#8208;like dynamic, with N&#945; oscillating between the two aluminium atoms in solution. The reaction of dialane I with DippN3 (Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3) gives the dialuminium amine&#160;[{DNI(H)Al}2(&#956;&#8208;NDipp)] (5).

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Seeding, Acid Stalling, and Solidifying: Time&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Nonclassical Pathways in Metal&#8211;Organic Gel Assembly</title>

Stepwise analysis reveals a distinct formation pathway for UiO&#8208;66(Zr) gels, starting with heterogeneous nucleation by zirconium hydrolysis nanoparticles (Zr(OH)4) and followed by rapid crosslinking of amorphous clusters into a fractal network. Unlike classical metal&#8208;organic framework crystallization, this study explains how self&#8208;generated acid inhibits coordination, stabilizing complex frameworks in gel state with high ligand deficiency. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic gels (MOGs), an innovative subset of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), feature hierarchically porous architecture and self&#8208;shaping monolithic morphologies, demonstrating them significantly potential for advanced applications in catalysis, gas storage, and energy conversion. Despite their functional versatility, the synthesis of MOGs remains empirical, as the actual formation mechanisms are largely unexplored. Here, a multiscale characterization strategy integrating time&#8208;resolved in&#8208;situ small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), Zr K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and attenuated total reflectance Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) analyses are systematically employed to elucidate the formation mechanism of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) gel. The synthetic techniques provide a multidimensional perspective: (1) At the mesoscale, self&#8208;induced heterogeneous nucleation triggers a rapid evolution from linear prenucleation clusters to a 3D fractal network governed by autocatalytic hydrolysis of Zr precursors. (2) At the atomic level, the reorganization of Zr&#8211;oxo clusters and the substitution of coordinating H2O molecules and chloride ions with terephthalate ligands over prolonged timescales are uncovered. Crucially, in&#8208;situ generated acid&#8208;mediated coordination suppression emerges as a pivotal factor preventing the conversion of MOGs into their crystalline MOF counterparts. These findings highlight a nonclassical evolution pathways distinct from classical MOF crystallization, thereby providing a mechanistic foundation for tailoring MOGs with programmable morphological and structural attributes.

This work, by introducing solvent&#8211;solvent interactions, achieves an ion&#8208;aggregate&#8208;rich solvation structure at low concentrations, promoting the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, effectively suppressing the reaction between trimethyl phosphate and the sodium metal anode, thereby enabling stable cycling of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs), which possess abundant sodium resources and high energy density, have attracted widespread attention. However, the continuous reaction between the electrolyte and the sodium metal anode, along with the formation of an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), leads to rapid capacity decay and the safety hazard of potential ignition. In this work, designing a low&#8208;cost and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte with solvent&#8211;solvent interactions is achieved by introducing sodium&#8208;difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) as a single salt into the ester&#8208;based electrolyte on the basis of trimethyl phosphate. Theoretical research combined with experimental study disclose through the solvent&#8211;solvent interactions, an ion&#8208;aggregate&#8208;rich solvation structure is formed at low concentrations, leading to the formation of a gradient SEI enriched with inorganic compounds such as B and F on the anode. This effectively suppresses interfacial reactions and sodium dendrite growth, significantly improving the cycling stability along with the optimizing the safety of SMBs. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery using this electrolyte maintains a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93% after 5000 cycles (320 days) at 1C. This approach provides a reliable solution for the application of flame&#8208;retardant electrolytes in SMBs, which also sheds light on the designing principle of advanced battery systems.

         <title>Mechanoactivated Celite as a Catalyst for C&#8210;H Bond Perfluoroalkylation and Other Radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biogenic materials naturally containing trace metals such as Celite or diatomaceous earth promote practical perfluoroalkylation of C&#9472;H bonds of (hetero)arenes and a double bond bromination with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide upon mechanoactivation via ball milling. This conceptually broadens the scope of mechanoactivated solids beyond piezoelectric materials. This approach poses an advancement towards sustainable processes, as it demonstrates the new application of non&#8208;toxic, untreated biominerals.








Abstract
Herein, we report that Celite (diatomaceous earth) commonly viewed as an innocent filter aid or support material, or Earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;toxic metal oxides are efficient mechanoactivated catalysts for arene and heteroarene C&#9472;H bond radical trifluoromethylation and pentafluoroethylation, with the activity comparable with previously reported mechanochemical methods utilizing piezoelectric materials. Celite was also applied for mechanochemical dibromination of a double bond with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide, eliminating the need to use of lithium titanate as a piezoelectric mechanoredox catalyst. Mechanoactivation via ball milling in the presence of minimal amount of solvent was crucial to observe the reactivity, while sonication or using a pre&#8208;ground suspension in a bulk solvent were not efficient. The EDX studies and comparison with individual metal oxides suggest a possible role of trace metal oxides in mechanoinduced reactivity. Celite could be recycled and reused several times without significant loss of activity. This approach offers environmentally benign, biocompatible and inexpensive nature&#8208;inspired materials as efficient mechanocatalyts and conceptually broadens the scope of mechanoactivated solids to the materials previously deemed inert.

         <title>Step Test for Rapid Screening of Material and Process Parameters for Resin Development in DLP 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an efficient and rapid step test for determining optimum printing parameters in digital light processing (DLP). It enables the testing of 24 printing parameter settings within one print, is easy to implement, and adaptable to other UV polymerization&#8208;based printing methods, thus speeding up the time from resin screening to optimal printing parameters and products. Yet, it only involves simple validation by eye of 3D&#8208;printed test structures. 








Abstract
The success of 3D printing based on vat polymerization by spatially controlled UV light exposure strongly depends on appropriate resins. However, in search of new resins, optimizing a resin's composition as well as its printing parameters can be time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive. To address these challenges, we present a rapid parameter screening that enables efficient evaluation of 24 printing parameter settings within one print focusing on exposure energy, exposure time, and layer thickness as the most crucial process parameters in 3D printing based on digital light processing (DLP). Our step test minimizes the required number of experimental iterations and 3D prints by relying on optical characterization without the need for special analytical devices, making it rapid and accessible for a broad range of users across different disciplines. For a proof of concept, the step test is applied to define optimal printing parameters of three commercial resins and evaluate the polymerization efficiency of two predominantly biobased, noncommercial resins containing either phenylbis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide or curcumin as photoinitiators. With that, we introduce a straightforward test that is easy to implement and adaptable to other UV polymerization&#8208;based printing methods, speeding up the time from resin screening to optimal printing parameters and products.

         <title>A Bidirectional Ion Kinetic Regulator Suppressing Lithium Dendrites in Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Sand equation reveals anions' greater impact on lithium dendrite growth versus cations. Guided by this, we created a bidirectional ion kinetic regulator of Ni&#8208;HAB that chelates TFSI&#8722; into octahedral structures, achieving simultaneous control of TFSI&#8722; and Li+ migration, suppressing lithium dendrites growth. Moreover, Ni&#8208;HAB boosts SRR kinetics and blocks the shuttle effect. Ah&#8208;level Li&#8208;S pouch cells with Ni&#8208;HAB show high safety and stability.








Abstract
Liquid organic electrolytes (LOEs) are of crucial significance in secondary battery deposition processes. Based on Sand's time formula, this study proposes a novel bidirectional ion kinetic regulator concept. Verified in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), it is demonstrated that regulating the migration of anions and cations simultaneously can effectively promote the realization of dendrite&#8208;free batteries. This bidirectional ion kinetic regulator forms octahedral complexes with TFSI&#8722;, decreasing TFSI&#8722; migration, enhancing Li+ desolvation and diffusion, and thus extending the dendrite formation time by over 25 times. Moreover, the attraction of the regulator towards solvent molecules and its improvement on the sulfur reduction kinetics effectively suppress the shuttle effect. Subsequently, the assembled Li||Li (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 2000&#160;h), Li&#8208;Cu (99.4% of CE), and Li&#8208;S (1000 cycles at 4 C) cells deliver extremely excellent cycling stability. An Ah&#8208;level Li&#8208;S pouch cell also exhibits negligible capacity decay (50 cycles without capacity decay). This confirms the importance of regulating both anions and cations for high&#8208;safety LSBs.

         <title>Scalable and Practical Electrooxidation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Methylarenes to Access Aromatic Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a practical and scalable electrochemical method for the oxidation of electron&#8208;deficient methylarenes to access aromatic aldehydes, eliminating the need for chemical oxidants or homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This approach demonstrates exceptional performance under industrially viable conditions&#8212;high current densities, minimal electrolyte loading, and operation in an undivided cell without additives.








Abstract
Aromatic aldehydes are pivotal synthetic intermediates with applications in fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. Although the oxidation of methylarenes represents an ideal route to aromatic aldehydes due to the availability of starting materials, existing methods face significant challenges, including reliance on hazardous oxidants, costly catalysts, poor scalability, and limited compatibility with electron&#8208;deficient substrates. To address these limitations, we report a practical and scalable electrochemical method for the oxidation of electron&#8208;deficient methylarenes to access aromatic aldehydes, eliminating the need for chemical oxidants or homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This approach operates under industrially viable conditions&#8212;high current densities (75&#160;mA cm&#8315;2), minimal electrolyte loading (0.05 equiv), and operation in an undivided cell without additives&#8212;to produce aromatic acetals, which are readily hydrolyzed to the corresponding aldehydes. The use of minimal electrolyte not only reduces costs and simplifies product isolation but also significantly enhances anodic oxidation selectivity, ensuring high efficiency and practicality. This protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, compatibility with both batch and continuous flow systems, and exceptional scalability, as demonstrated by successful kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis.

     alt="Scalable and Practical Electrooxidation of Electron-Deficient Methylarenes to Access Aromatic Aldehydes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported herein is a practical and scalable electrochemical method for the oxidation of electron-deficient methylarenes to access aromatic aldehydes, eliminating the need for chemical oxidants or homogeneous transition-metal catalysts. This approach demonstrates exceptional performance under industrially viable conditions&#8212;high current densities, minimal electrolyte loading, and operation in an undivided cell without additives.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatic aldehydes are pivotal synthetic intermediates with applications in fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. Although the oxidation of methylarenes represents an ideal route to aromatic aldehydes due to the availability of starting materials, existing methods face significant challenges, including reliance on hazardous oxidants, costly catalysts, poor scalability, and limited compatibility with electron-deficient substrates. To address these limitations, we report a practical and scalable electrochemical method for the oxidation of electron-deficient methylarenes to access aromatic aldehydes, eliminating the need for chemical oxidants or homogeneous transition-metal catalysts. This approach operates under industrially viable conditions&#8212;high current densities (75&#160;mA cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), minimal electrolyte loading (0.05 equiv), and operation in an undivided cell without additives&#8212;to produce aromatic acetals, which are readily hydrolyzed to the corresponding aldehydes. The use of minimal electrolyte not only reduces costs and simplifies product isolation but also significantly enhances anodic oxidation selectivity, ensuring high efficiency and practicality. This protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, compatibility with both batch and continuous flow systems, and exceptional scalability, as demonstrated by successful kilogram-scale synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization of Tetraazanonacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraazanonacene featuring four isolated pyridine&#8208;like rings was synthesized on Au(111) via STM tip manipulation. Its properties were characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, density functional theory, and multireference calculations. The study highlights how the distribution of nitrogen atoms influences the electronic structure and aromaticity of azaacenes.








Abstract
Isosteric replacement of CH units of acenes by nitrogen induces significant changes in their electronic, redox, and spectroscopic properties. Here, we describe the on&#8208;surface synthesis of a nonacene analogue substituted with four nitrogen atoms on a Au(111) surface by a two&#8208;step atom manipulation, employing a bis vinylene&#8208;bridged precursor synthesized in solution. The generated tetraazanonacene has been investigated by scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), combined with first&#8208;principles calculations. We found that, compared to the pristine nonacene, the electronegative nitrogen atoms lower the frontier orbitals, resulting in an increased STS transport gap of 1.49&#160;eV. Furthermore, the formation of four pyridine&#8208;like rings induces a stronger modulation of the aromaticity in tetraazanonacene compared to substitution patterns where nitrogen atoms form pyrazine&#8208;like rings. This observation is different from the nucleus independent chemical shift investigation of previous reported tetraazaundecacene, for which a stronger open&#8208;shell character is expected. Our work provides access to the synthesis of extended azaacenes and to an understanding of their properties.

         <title>Synthesis of Porous Carbon&#8208;Based Network Containing Ultranarrow Nonplanar Nanopores on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective synthesis of nonplanar [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network that contains the ultranarrow periodic nanopores on Au(111) have been achieved. The reaction mechanisms were confirmed by a series of control experiments. A significant hole doping due to charge transfer from [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network to Au(111) substrate was revealed by experimental and calculated characterizations.








Abstract
Introduction of twisted structures into low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;based nanostructures has important ramifications on their inherent physical behavior. The fabrication of graphene derivatives with nonplanar characteristics remains challenging, especially for extended two&#8208;dimensional&#160;(2D) structures. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel nonplanar [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network that contains the narrowest periodic nanopores and exhibits the highest negative curvature among 2D nonplanar carbon&#8208;based nanostructures synthesized up to date. The success is driven by the dissymmetrical debromination and regioselective coupling reactions of precursor molecules on Au(111) surface, as corroborated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES). We characterize electronic properties of the [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network with the aid of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and demonstrate a significant hole doping induced by interfacial charge transfer between the nonplanar nanoarchitecture and the Au(111) substrate.

         <title>A Multifunctional Polyester Nanoplatform for the Synergistic Anticancer: Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy and Targeted Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a multifunctional polyester nanoplatform integrating photodynamic activation, oxygen delivery, GSH depletion, HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA delivery, and tumor targeting. This system remodeled the tumor microenvironment by alleviating hypoxia and silencing hypoxia&#8208;inducing genes and greatly enhanced photodynamic and gene therapies for cancer.








Abstract
Gene therapy (GT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) present promising approaches for cancer treatment. However, GT is frequently impeded by the lysosomal capture of nucleic acids, while PDT is constrained by low oxygen levels in tumors. Herein, we reported the design of a versatile block polyester vector, BFN2, which comprises of a photosensitizer BODIPY (B), an oxygen carrying perfluorinated carbon chain (F) as well as a GSH&#8208;responsive, and RNA&#8208;condensing [12]aneN3 (N) moiety. In the presence of DOPE (D) and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;iRGD (R), BFN2 is able to carry oxygen and condense HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA efficiently and afford hybrid nanoparticles BFN2DR/HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA@O&#8322;. These combined functionalities work together to reverse tumor hypoxia, remodel the tumor microenvironment, and allow for the efficient lysosomal escape of nucleic acids, thereby significantly boosting the efficacy of PDT and GT in solid tumors. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the BFN2&#8208;DR/HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA@O&#8322; nanoplatform significantly exhibited substantial inhibitory effects in 4T1 tumors with TGI up to 87%. This research marks the first&#8208;in&#8208;class integration of such multimodality therapeutic strategies within a single block polymeric vector, thus offering a novel perspective for developing effective oncological treatment paradigms.

         <title>Chemical Coordination Induced Fullerene Dimers on Hot Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal evolution of C60${\rm C}_{60}$ islands on Pt(111) includes the transition from segregated fullerene islands to dimers and the subsequent growth of graphene quantum dots. After annealing at 800K$800 \,\mathrm{K}$, the coordination of C60${\rm C}_{60}$ molecules promotes structural transformations toward separated dimers, with potential for advanced synthesis and lubricative applications.








Abstract
The fullerene family is known for its unique properties, facilitating the formation of large, lubricated nano&#8208;onions and the fragmentation into small carbon clusters through various processes. In this study, we explore the thermal evolution of C60${\rm C}_{60}$ islands on Pt(111), focusing on the segregation of C60${\rm C}_{60}$ islands, the formation of fullerene dimers, and the subsequent development of large graphene sheets. Using noncontact atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed that after annealing at 500K$500 \,\mathrm{K}$, the C60${\rm C}_{60}$ islands showed minimal change compared to their deposition at room temperature. However, at 800K$800 \,\mathrm{K}$, pairs of separated C60${\rm C}_{60}$ dimers appeared, which, due to their low mobility, have the potential to transform into graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Further annealing at 900K$900 \,\mathrm{K}$ controlled and refined the quality and dimensions of the graphene patches. This process not only provides an effective method for producing high&#8208;quality graphene but also permits to preserve isolated C60${\rm C}_{60}$ dimers on the Pt(111) surface, offering valuable insights for advanced synthesis and lubrication&#160;applications.

The designed HEO cathode relieves the dissolution of transition metal ions and the exfoliation of transition metal oxide layer by virtue of the appropriate six&#8208;coordinated octahedral radii. The multielement doping also modify the localization of electrons and enhance the structural stability.








Abstract
Layered oxides, one of the most fascinating cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), have appropriate voltage window and feasible preparation process, however, cycling stability is the biggest challenge. Element doping is the most rational strategy to address this problem, but six&#8208;coordinated octahedral radii and different radii in different valence states of these doping elements and the functions of these elements need to be taken into account. Hence, an example of P2/O3&#8208;type Na0.7Mn0.53Ni0.26Fe0.15Mg0.01V0.01Co0.01Cu0.01Zn0.01Sn0.01O2 (high&#8208;entropy&#8208;doped layered oxides, HEO) has been designed in consideration of moderate six&#8208;coordinated octahedral radii and stabling the metal&#8211;oxygen bond. A reversible capacity of 126.9 mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved. Even tested at 1000&#160;mA g&#8722;1, an improved rate performance of 72.9 mAh g&#8722;1 can be observed with a capacity retention rate of 66.5% after 1000 cycles. Potential&#8208;based in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and corresponding distribution of relaxation time profiles prove the effect of multiple elemental combination. Concomitantly, in situ XRD results reveal the P2/O3 biphasic clamping reaction mechanism of HEO. Density functional theory results reveal that the multielement doping can modify the localization of electrons and enhance the structural stability. This work provides an idea of designing HEO cathode for SIBs by crystal structure modulation.

         <title>A Cobotic, Digitally Controlled Schlenk&#8208;line Unlocks Access to Elusive Lewis&#8208;Base Stabilised Copper Bis(Disilylamides)</title>

A Cobotic digital chemistry approach succeeds where manual synthesis failed. Herein, we present our new &#8220;AutoSchlenk&#8221; line which, coupled with other digital chemistry tools, was key to the synthesis and isolation of an unstable, and previously inaccessible, three&#8208;coordinate Cu(II) hexamethylsilylamide complex.








Abstract
Silylamides are important ligands in coordination chemistry for their ability to stabilise low coordination numbers and provide soluble, and even volatile, metal complexes. Such compounds provide valuable insights into the fundamental bonding and reactivity of their respective metals. Despite the wealth of homo&#8208; and heteroleptic hexamethyldisilazide complexes of divalent 3d ions (Sc&#8208;Ni, Zn), attempts to access the corresponding divalent copper complexes have yielded only Cu(I) species. Herein, we demonstrate the stabilisation and isolation of a formally Cu(II) bis&#8208;hexamethyldisilazide which was achieved by implementing novel digital chemistry tools. In order to successfully isolate (DMAP)CuII(N{SiMe3}2)2 (DMAP&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine), we investigated the roles of the co&#8208;ligand and silylamide transfer reagent in the kinetics of its formation. Crucial to these studies was our newly developed &#8220;cobotic&#8221; Schlenk line which provides&#160;digital control of the atmosphere under which we conduct our highly reactive syntheses. In digitising Schlenk&#8208;line handling, we have improved synthetic productivity by creating protocols for automated inertisation, solvent evaporation, liquid handling and crystallisation all while capturing reaction log data. Importantly, our Cu silylamide synthesis provides a case study showing that our cobotics approach allows for the discovery and isolation of unstable species which may remain elusive by traditional manual or fully autonomous methodologies.

         <title>A Strong and Tough Thermosetting Epoxy Resin for Recyclable High&#8208;Performance Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research develops a strong and tough thermosetting epoxy resin by integrating dynamic ester bonds into semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer networks. The epoxy resin demonstrates superior tensile strength of 123&#160;MPa and record&#8208;breaking impact strength of 52.3&#160;kJ m&#8722;2, making it ideal for high&#8208;performance on fiber&#8208;reinforced composites. Moreover, the embedded tertiary amines accelerate transesterification reactions, enabling closed&#8208;loop recycling of composites in water. 








Abstract
Epoxy&#8208;based carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced composites (EP&#8208;CFRCs) are appealing for engineering applications due to their exceptional specific strength and modulus. Nevertheless, the intrinsic brittleness and limited recyclability of highly cross&#8208;linked epoxy matrices pose significant challenges to their sustainable development. Herein, we present an approach combining dynamic ester bonds with semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPNs) to overcome these challenges. This strategy leverages the crosslinked epoxy network to resist deformation, while hydrogen bonds and entangled SIPNs to facilitate energy dissipation, enhancing both strength and toughness. The resultant epoxy matrix exhibits superior tensile strength of 123&#160;MPa and record&#8208;breaking impact strength of 52.3&#160;kJ m&#8722;2, effectively overcoming the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between strength and toughness in thermosets. This balanced performance renders it a promising matrix for high&#8208;performance EP&#8208;CFRCs, which display a tensile strength of 718&#160;MPa and a bending deflection of 0.59&#160;mm. Moreover, the embedded tertiary amines accelerate transesterification reactions, enabling closed&#8208;loop recycling of EP&#8208;CFRCs in water. The recycled carbon fibers and the degraded matrix can be reused in new composites and adhesives. This work presents a simple yet effective strategy for designing epoxy resin&#8208;based composites that overcome the limitations of traditional matrices and support the development of recyclable advanced materials for diverse industrial applications.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Metal Ce&#8208;Zr&#8208;Mn Clusters as Photo&#8208;Catalysts for Decarboxylative Functionalization of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative hydrazination of carboxylic acids is achieved using a 1:5:2 ratio of three metal salts, Ce(OtBu)4, Zr(OtBu)4, and Mn(OAc)3, as a catalyst under visible light irradiation, in which single cerium&#8208;incorporated hexanuclear mixed&#8208;metal clusters containing a [CeZr5O4(OH)4]12+ core are formed with association of manganese(II) species. The catalytic activity is much higher than that by hexanuclear cerium(IV) clusters.








Abstract
Decarboxylative hydrazination of carboxylic acids was achieved using a 1:5:2 ratio of three metal salts, Ce(OtBu)4, Zr(OtBu)4, and Mn(OAc)3, as a catalyst under visible light irradiation. The catalytic activity, compared with our previously developed Ce6 cluster photo&#8208;catalysts, was enhanced by the formation of single cerium&#8208;incorporated hexanuclear mixed&#8208;metal clusters containing a [CeZr5O4(OH)4]12+ core. The manganese salts further accelerated the overall reaction rate (10 times faster reaction rate with the manganese salt than that of the manganese&#8208;free conditions). Using the isolated cluster, CeZr5O4(OH)4(OCOCH2tBu)12(HOCOCH2tBu)4 (4a), with Mn(OAc)3, phenol and thiophenol&#8208;containing carboxylic acids were transformed to their decarboxylative hydrazinated products in moderate to high yields, while a mixture of Ce6O4(OH)4(OCOCH2tBu)12(HOCOCH2tBu)4 (4c) and Mn(OAc)3 or Ce(OtBu)4, Zr(OtBu)4, and Mn(OAc)3 yielded lower amounts of the products. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating cerium(IV) into the zirconium&#8208;based core to tolerate these easily oxidizable functional groups. Upon exposure of 4a to blue LED light under an argon atmosphere, the CeZr5 cluster produced 2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethylhexane, a radical coupling product derived from the carboxylate ligand on 4a, in half an equivalent per cluster, consistent with the photo&#8208;reduction of cerium(IV) and inertness of the oxo&#8208; and hydroxo&#8208;bridged Zr5 motif as a metallo&#8208;ligand around the cerium(IV) site. Moreover, decarboxylative oxygenation of carboxylic acids under air followed by treatment with NaBH4 resulted in the production of one&#8208;carbon shortened alcohols in excellent yields when using Ce(OtBu)4 and Zr(OtBu)4 or Hf(OtBu)4 in a 1:5 ratio: the reaction rates were 8&#8211;10 times higher than that of the previously developed cerium&#8208;catalyzed reaction under identical conditions.

Using the isolated cluster, CeZr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OCOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(HOCOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4a&lt;/b&gt;), with Mn(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, phenol and thiophenol-containing carboxylic acids were transformed to their decarboxylative hydrazinated products in moderate to high yields, while a mixture of Ce&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OCOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(HOCOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4c&lt;/b&gt;) and Mn(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Ce(O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Zr(O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and Mn(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yielded lower amounts of the products. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating cerium(IV) into the zirconium-based core to tolerate these easily oxidizable functional groups. Upon exposure of &lt;b&gt;4a&lt;/b&gt; to blue LED light under an argon atmosphere, the CeZr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; cluster produced 2,2,5,5-tetramethylhexane, a radical coupling product derived from the carboxylate ligand on &lt;b&gt;4a&lt;/b&gt;, in half an equivalent per cluster, consistent with the photo-reduction of cerium(IV) and inertness of the oxo- and hydroxo-bridged Zr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; motif as a metallo-ligand around the cerium(IV) site. Moreover, decarboxylative oxygenation of carboxylic acids under air followed by treatment with NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; resulted in the production of one-carbon shortened alcohols in excellent yields when using Ce(O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Zr(O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or Hf(O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in a 1:5 ratio: the reaction rates were 8&#8211;10 times higher than that of the previously developed cerium-catalyzed reaction under identical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast (600&#160;ps) Vacuum&#8208;UV Reflective Scintillation Enabled by Surface Exciton Recombination in Layered Perovskite PEA2PbBr4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is the first to report the ultrafast (600&#160;ps) decay time of the layered perovskite PEA2PbBr4 and its mechanism. The ultrashort photon penetration length in PEA2PbBr4 SC under vacuum&#8208;UV light generates a high&#8208;density exciton population on the crystal surface, significantly increasing the radiative recombination and nonradiative recombination probability. This highlights the potential application of PEA2PbBr4 SC in the VUV field.








Abstract
Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodetection is pivotal for space exploration and radiation monitoring, yet its dynamic imaging capability is significantly hindered by the slow response of conventional scintillators. However, existing scintillators exhibit microsecond&#8208;to&#8208;nanosecond decay time, failing to meet sub&#8208;nanosecond ultrafast imaging demands. Here, we uncovered a surface exciton recombination mechanism in layered perovskite PEA2PbBr4, where lattice contraction induced exciton localization, achieving ultrafast decay time of 600&#160;ps&#8212;over 100&#8208;fold faster than commercial scintillation. A reflective optical configuration was designed to suppress self&#8208;absorption, improving the light utilization efficiency. This work established a material paradigm for ultrafast dynamic imaging and opens avenues for advancing space science and high&#8208;energy physics detection.

         <title>Mediating Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation Kinetics on SiOx Anodes Using Proton Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel co&#8208;additive, bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl)amine (MBA), is introduced to enhance FEC utilization. MBA chemically reacts with FEC via nucleophilic substitution, forming carbamate intermediates that exhibit higher susceptibility to reductive degradation under electrochemical stimulation, thereby accelerating LiF nucleation.








Abstract
Silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes offer high energy density but suffer from significant volume variations, leading to an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). To enhance SEI stability, numerous electrolyte additives have been designed to decompose on the anode and form desirable SEI components (e.g., LiF). However, their electrochemical reduction kinetics on the anode surface competes with other electrolyte components, leading to suboptimal interfacial decomposition efficiency and a less stable SEI structure. Here, inspired by bioremediation strategies in petroleum pollution treatment, we introduce a proton acceptor that reacts with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), a commercially established additive, to generate an intermediate. Such an intermediate lowers the reduction kinetic barrier, accelerating the formation of LiF and enriching it in the inner layer of the SEI. Compared to the randomly distributed LiF structure, the resulting SEI exhibits better mechanical stability and lithium&#8208;ion conduction, effectively accommodating volume changes and mitigating stress concentration caused by local overlithiation. As a result, the electrochemical performance surpasses that of previously reported works. This intermediate&#8208;based strategy significantly improves the utilization efficiency of commercial additives, offering a practical direction for future electrolyte design.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Modified NiFe OER Catalyst Achieving Ultrastable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis via Dynamic Alkaline Microenvironment Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of quaternary ammonium cations significantly enhanced the transport of OH&#8722; at the AEM&#8208;anode catalyst interface, forming a locally alkaline&#8208;enriched microenvironment around the metal active sites, effectively inhibiting chemical corrosion, and simultaneously improving catalytic performance through pH regulation.








Abstract
The development of efficient nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for industrial anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) remains challenging, primarily due to sluggish OH&#8722; transfer from the anion exchange membrane (AEM) to catalytic sites, causing H+ accumulation and performance degradation. Herein, we developed a zwitterion&#8208;modified NiFe catalyst (z&#8208;NiFe) through gradient soaking, facilitates rapid OH&#8722; transfer across the AEM&#8208;electrocatalyst interface, effectively neutralizing the generated H+ and enhancing catalytic performance. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and OH&#8722; conductivity measurements reveal an alkaline&#8208;enriched surface environment, which inhibits H+ accumulation&#8208;induced chemical corrosion and enhances water oxidation performances. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis demonstrates that zwitterions stabilize adsorbed oxygen during catalysis, and reduce the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The z&#8208;NiFe shows an ultralow Tafel slope (28.5&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and high activity (190&#160;mV overpotential at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in 1&#160;M KOH. When integrated into an AEM&#8208;WE system, the z&#8208;NiFe&#8208;catalyzed AEM&#8208;WE device exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.76&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and record&#8208;breaking durability over 14000&#160;h, with a voltage degradation rate of 12.3 &#181;V h&#8722;1, representing a significant advancement in AEM&#8208;WE technology.

         <title>Axial&#8208;N Induced Square&#8208;Pyramidal Crystal Filed of Atomically Iron Sites for Enhancing Acidic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The axial&#8208;N ligand in the atomically dispersed Fe sites induces a square&#8208;pyramidal crystal field, which could promote the acidic oxygen reduction activity and stability for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The evolved FeN3O2 and FeN4O1 structures for the optimal FeN5 configuration during the reaction process could further accelerate the ORR kinetics.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;based catalyst represents a promising alternative to platinum for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the prevalent FeN4 configuration exhibits limited intrinsic activity in acidic media owing to its inherent instability, thereby restricting its application in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Herein, we introduce axial&#8208;N coordination to enhance the activity and stability of atomically dispersed Fe sites for acidic ORR by establishing a barrier to prevent Fe dissolution. Compared to the FeN4 configuration, the axial&#8208;N ligand in the FeN5, FeN5&#8208;Fe3, and FeN2C3 configurations induces a square&#8208;pyramidal crystal field, which diminishes the spin polarization in the dz2, dxz, and dyz orbitals, and alters the electronic delocalization of Fe atom. In a 0.10&#160;M HClO4 electrolyte, the ORR activity increases with enhanced electronic delocalization, following the trend: FeN5&gt;FeN5+Fe3&gt;FeN2C3&gt;FeN4. Operando technique further reveals that the dissociation of Fe&#9472;N bond in the FeN5 configuration occurs alongside the insertion of oxygen, leading to the formation of FeN3O2 and FeN4O1 structures that could accelerate the ORR kinetics. Consequently, the FeN5 configuration shows a positive shift of 30&#160;mV in half&#8208;wave potential compared to Pt/C and achieves a peak power of 1.2&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 3.2 A cm&#8722;2 in PEMFC.

     alt="Axial-N Induced Square-Pyramidal Crystal Filed of Atomically Iron Sites for Enhancing Acidic Oxygen Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The axial-N ligand in the atomically dispersed Fe sites induces a square-pyramidal crystal field, which could promote the acidic oxygen reduction activity and stability for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The evolved FeN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; structures for the optimal FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; configuration during the reaction process could further accelerate the ORR kinetics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed Fe-based catalyst represents a promising alternative to platinum for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the prevalent FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration exhibits limited intrinsic activity in acidic media owing to its inherent instability, thereby restricting its application in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Herein, we introduce axial-N coordination to enhance the activity and stability of atomically dispersed Fe sites for acidic ORR by establishing a barrier to prevent Fe dissolution. Compared to the FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration, the axial-N ligand in the FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3,&lt;/sub&gt; and FeN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; configurations induces a square-pyramidal crystal field, which diminishes the spin polarization in the d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;, and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals, and alters the electronic delocalization of Fe atom. In a 0.10&#160;M HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte, the ORR activity increases with enhanced electronic delocalization, following the trend: FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;+Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;FeN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Operando technique further reveals that the dissociation of Fe&#9472;N bond in the FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; configuration occurs alongside the insertion of oxygen, leading to the formation of FeN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; structures that could accelerate the ORR kinetics. Consequently, the FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; configuration shows a positive shift of 30&#160;mV in half-wave potential compared to Pt/C and achieves a peak power of 1.2&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 3.2 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in PEMFC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aluminum Distribution in Ferrierite Zeolites Influences the Performance of Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
FER&#8208;type aluminosilicate zeolites with preferential Al occupancy at T4 site favor direct methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol oxidation, while those with&#160;Al concentrated at T3 sites within 10&#8208;ring channels facilitate tandem conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol on oxidative sites, followed by methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons on acidic sites.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free aluminosilicate FER&#8208;type zeolite has been demonstrated to effectively catalyze methane to methanol using N2O as the oxidant with distorted tetra&#8208;coordinated aluminum (AlIV&#8208;2) and penta&#8208;coordinated aluminum (AlV) as potential active sites. However, the specific effects of Al distribution on the active Al species have not been thoroughly investigated. Herein, aluminosilicate FER&#8208;type zeolites with controllable Al distribution were developed. Al distribution, including the arrangement and location of Al atoms, was characterized using 27Al MQMAS/MAS and 29Si MAS NMR spectra. The arrangement of aluminum, particularly the isolated Al and paired Al in as&#8208;synthesized samples, influenced the proximity between oxidative and acidic sites in H&#8208;type samples. Al locations involved the specific positioning of bifunctional sites and affected the final product. The increased CH4 conversion at 250&#8211;275 &#176;C of FER zeolite with Al preferential population at T4 sites confirmed the higher activity of Al species from T4 sites. Additionally, a higher proportion of Al atoms in 10&#8208;ring channels facilitated the tandem conversion of methane to methanol on oxidative sites, followed by methanol to hydrocarbons on acidic sites at 300&#8211;375&#160;&#176;C. This study corroborated and expanded upon our recent research and highlighted the significant impact of Al distribution in FER zeolite on methane oxidation.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Clamps for the Passive Cell Diffusion of DNA and siRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized molecular clamps based on guanine and phenylalanine that have the ability to form chiral supramolecular fibers in DMSO and water mixtures and passively help carry genetic material into cells. They form stable structures and deliver DNA and RNA effectively, which could improve the future application of personalized medicine.








Abstract
The safe and effective delivery of DNA and RNA therapeutics continues to be a major hurdle toward personalized medicine, mainly due to the digestion of this genetic material during endosomal uptake. Herein, we designed a hydrophobic nonionic urea&#8208;linked molecular clamp (mol&#8208;clamp) based on guanine and phenylalanine (GFUFG) that can readily complex nucleic acids and transport them into cells through passive diffusion. The optimal chiral self&#8208;assembled state was achieved by controlling the dimethyl sulfoxide to water ratio in the solvent mixture. Dictated by the presence of hydrophobic moieties in the mol&#8208;clamp, a secondary structure was formed through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The negatively charged complex of mol&#8208;clamped nucleic acids was delivered in high efficiency as indicated by the signal of fluorescently labeled ssDNA to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The actual efficacy of GFUFG was further evaluated by delivering functional single&#8208;stranded DNA (DNAzyme) and siRNA (si&#8208;BCL&#8208;2), which downregulated EGR&#8208;1 and BCL&#8208;2 by 44% and 53%, respectively. We envisage that designing mol&#8208;clamps that can effectively complex genetic materials and promote passive diffusion rather than endocytosis can improve the field of biologics delivery for individualized therapy and cellular engineering.

         <title>Phosphorylation Regulation Promotes Bidirectional Dynamic Adaptive Interface for Achieving Stable Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular phosphorylation strategy is taken for optimizing zinc&#8211;iodine batteries. The produced phosphorylated additive enables a self&#8208;constructing dynamic interface for guiding homogeneous Zn2+ kinetic transfer and balancing pH environment at the anode while real&#8208;time capturing polyiodides at the cathode simultaneously.








Abstract
Unstable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces resulting from severe cathodic polyiodide shuttling, anodic parasitic corrosion reactions, and dendrite growth significantly impede the performance of zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries. Here, phosphorylation regulation is proposed to create dynamically adaptive water&#8208;lean interfaces for long&#8208;term Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. Phosphorylation reinforces the adaptive interface construction through the increased adsorption capability on the Zn anode and introduces a dynamic pH&#8208;balancing capability while simultaneously offering extra sites for the real&#8208;time capture of polyiodide intermediates at the cathode. Consequently, extended durability (4400&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), boosted coulombic efficiency (99.8% for 7500 cycles), and ultralong cycling for 8000 cycles at a high loading of 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 were maintained. These findings provide crucial insights into the optimization of adaptive interfaces through phosphorylation regulation for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Insight into the Carbon Monoxide Reduction Reaction on Cu(111) from Operando Electrochemical X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a modified dip&#8208;and&#8208;pull electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) approach is presented and used to probe the alkaline CO reduction reaction (CORR) over a Cu(111) surface. The results provide insight into the methane and acetate formation mechanisms and demonstrate a successful application of the method to the study of the CO(2)RR under operando conditions.








Abstract
In this work, we introduce a modified dip&#8208;and&#8208;pull electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ECXPS) approach that offers new mechanistic insight into the alkaline carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) over a Cu(111) single crystal surface. We tackle two major unresolved questions in the CORR mechanism that persist in the literature. Firstly, we address the mechanism for methane formation on Cu(111) and show that the mechanism likely proceeds via atomic carbon, which subsequently couples, leading to the accumulation of amorphous carbon on the surface. Secondly, we provide insight into whether the mechanism for acetate formation occurs entirely on the surface or partially within the solution phase, showing that acetate is present on the surface, indicating a surface&#8208;based reaction. These insights into surface&#8208;based mechanisms provide a handle for designing future catalysts that can efficiently target the binding of specific intermediates. Furthermore, we expect that our modified approach to dip&#8208;and&#8208;pull ECXPS &#8211; in which we have changed the electrode geometry, the method of introducing the reactant gas and used hard x&#8208;rays &#8211; will significantly expand the technique's applicability, enabling studies of the CO(2)RR and beyond.

Firstly, we address the mechanism for methane formation on Cu(111) and show that the mechanism likely proceeds via atomic carbon, which subsequently couples, leading to the accumulation of amorphous carbon on the surface. Secondly, we provide insight into whether the mechanism for acetate formation occurs entirely on the surface or partially within the solution phase, showing that acetate is present on the surface, indicating a surface-based reaction. These insights into surface-based mechanisms provide a handle for designing future catalysts that can efficiently target the binding of specific intermediates. Furthermore, we expect that our modified approach to dip-and-pull ECXPS &#8211; in which we have changed the electrode geometry, the method of introducing the reactant gas and used hard x-rays &#8211; will significantly expand the technique's applicability, enabling studies of the CO&lt;sub&gt;(2)&lt;/sub&gt;RR and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Embedded&#8208;Type Cu Nanoparticle with Largely Enhanced Catalytic Activity and Stability Toward Methanol Steam Reforming</title>

         <dc:description>
A Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst with a unique embedded structure was prepared via an interface reconstruction strategy, which exhibited an extraordinary catalytic performance and stability toward hydrogen production from methanol steam reforming. A CH3OH conversion of 99.3% and an H2 production rate of 124.6&#160;&#181;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 were obtained with a 400&#160;h stream&#8208;on&#8208;line stability, which was preponderant to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. 








Abstract
Hydrogen production through low&#8208;temperature methanol steam reforming (MSR) reaction plays a critical role in the development of new energy but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst, which is prepared via an interface reconstruction strategy. Interestingly, this catalyst is featured with a unique mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon structure: Cu nanoparticles are embedded into the Zn(Ga)Ox substrate, which ensures a stable Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Cu+&#8211;Ov&#8211;Ga&#948;+ interface structure. The resulting Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst exhibits 99.3% CH3OH conversion with an H2 production rate of 124.6&#160;&#181;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 at 225&#160;&#176;C, which is preponderant to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Furthermore, an ultra&#8208;high catalytic stability was demonstrated through a 400&#160;h stream&#8208;on&#8208;line test without obvious decline. Kinetic isotope analysis, in situ spectroscopy characterizations, and theoretical calculations reveal that the MSR reaction over Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst follows the formaldehyde oxidation route. The CH3O* and H2O molecule adsorb at the adjacent Cu+&#8722;Ov interface (intrinsic active site) with an oxygen&#8208;terminal adsorption configuration, which promotes electron transfer from the d&#8208;band center of Cu to the O (s,p)&#8208;band of the substrate molecule. This significantly reduces the energy barrier of C&#9472;H bond cleavage in CH3O* dehydrogenation (the rate&#8208;determining step) and H2O dissociation, accounting for the extraordinarily enhanced H2 production.

         <title>Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Assemblies for Tunable and Modular Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>

We present host&#8211;guest bridged lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras (HGTACs), a supramolecular platform for tunable, reversible protein degradation. Utilizing &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;adamantane interaction, HGTACs link lysosomal targeting receptors to proteins of interest, enabling targeted lysosomal degradation. By adjusting stoichiometry and introducing competitive ligands, we precisely control degradation, whereas the recyclable LTR&#8208;binding host ensures sustained activity, redefining lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras.








Abstract
Heterobifunctional drugs have revolutionized chemical biology and therapeutic innovation, yet their fixed covalent linkages constrain dynamic adaptability. Here, we introduce host&#8211;guest bridged lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras (HGTACs), a supramolecular bifunctional platform that utilizes &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;adamantane host&#8211;guest interactions to achieve tunable and modular assembly. HGTACs effectively facilitated lysosomal degradation of both extracellular and transmembrane proteins, including NS&#8208;650, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. By deconstructing lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras into host and guest components, HGTACs enable spatiotemporal control over protein degradation through noncovalent bridging. This strategy allows for the fine&#8208;tuning of degradation efficiency by adjusting stoichiometric ratios and introducing competitive ligands. Notably, the recyclable nature of the asialoglycoprotein receptor&#8208;binding host module conferred sustained degradation activity. In vivo, EGFR&#8208;targeting HGTACs significantly reduced EGFR protein levels and suppressed tumor growth in xenograft models. This supramolecular control system reshapes lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras, providing a flexible and efficient strategy for advancing chemically induced proximity&#8208;based modalities.

Abstract
Conformationally rigid bridged bicyclic scaffolds have emerged as bioisosteric replacements for planar aromatic rings. However, bioisosteric mimetics of heteroaromatic rings have been investigated less due to the challenges of incorporating heteroatoms into bicycloalkanes. Herein, we report a unified strategy to access both aza&#8208; and oxa&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes in a single experimental protocol from a readily accessible amino/hydroxy acid derivative under photoredox catalysis. The reaction exhibits a broad scope across a range of redox&#8208;active esters and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) and successfully provides previously inaccessible spiro&#8208; and fused&#8208;hetero&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes. Noteworthy, chiral amino/hydroxy acid derived redox&#8208;active esters could be used to access enantioenriched hetero&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes. Furthermore, the strategy has been extended to access aza&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, another important motif in medicinal chemistry. The functional groups introduced during the reaction serve as a synthetic handle for downstream manipulations, thus offering opportunities to build up molecular complexity rapidly. Density functional theory calculations and experimental studies support an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) mechanism and rationalize the observed regioselectivity.

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Preserving, Dimensionality&#8208;Increasing Strategy for the Stepwise Synthesis of Microporous &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with a Broad (100) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;preserving, dimensionality&#8208;increasing strategy was developed to synthesize 2D &#945;&#8208;MoO3 from 0D [Mo2O5(H2O)6]2+ via a 1D Mo2O6{(CH3)2NCHO} intermediate. Unlike conventional &#945;&#8208;MoO3, which predominantly exposes the (010) plane, simple temperature&#8208;controlled calcination of the 1D structure yielded metastable &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with the (100) plane as the broad face, large surface areas, and micropores, enabling high&#8208;performance acid catalysis.








Abstract
Metal oxides with diverse structures and dimensionalities are typically synthesized via solid&#8208;state or hydrothermal reactions.

This synthesis strategy is expected to facilitate the synthesis of metastable structures and the design of defects and surface structures at the atomic level.

&lt;p&gt;A structure-preserving, dimensionality-increasing strategy was developed to synthesize 2D &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from 0D [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; via a 1D Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;{(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCHO} intermediate. Unlike conventional &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which predominantly exposes the (010) plane, simple temperature-controlled calcination of the 1D structure yielded metastable &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with the (100) plane as the broad face, large surface areas, and micropores, enabling high-performance acid catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal oxides with diverse structures and dimensionalities are typically synthesized via solid-state or hydrothermal reactions. However, it is quite difficult to retain the structures of the starting materials when 0D metal salts or molecular clusters are used as precursors because higher-dimensional structures form by structural reorganization through isomerization and decomposition/condensation reactions. In this study, we demonstrated a structure-preserving, dimensionality-increasing strategy for the synthesis of 2D &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from 0D [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; species via a 1D [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;{(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCHO}]&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; intermediate while maintaining the structures of the precursors. By simple temperature-controlled calcination, metastable crystals of &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in which the (100) plane was the broad face were successfully synthesized, differing from conventional &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in which the (010) plane is the broad face. In addition, the prepared metastable crystals possessed large surface areas, unusual micropores, and surface-exposed coordinatively unsaturated Mo sites, allowing them to serve as high-performance acid catalysts. This synthesis strategy is expected to facilitate the synthesis of metastable structures and the design of defects and surface structures at the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Spin State of Ni Single Atomic Center for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two well&#8208;designed Ni&#8211;N4C single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with different coordinated nitrogen species have been developed via a gas&#8208;protected fast Joule&#8208;heating strategy. The pyridinic&#8208;type nitrogen coordinated Ni&#8211;Npyridinic&#8211;C exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity than the pyrrolic&#8208;type nitrogen coordinated Ni&#8208;Npyrrolic&#8208;C for CO2 reduction in H&#8208;type cell, with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for CO. Remarkably, excellent catalytic activities are also achieved in all alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes with industrial&#8208;level CO partial current densities. The outstanding durability and CO selectivity originate from modulating the spin&#8208;state of Ni center with different coordinated&#8208;N species, which significantly strengthens the interaction and facilitates the electron transfer between Ni center and *COOH intermediate, leading to the decreased energy barrier for *COOH formation and boosted reaction kinetics for *COOH further reduction.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely investigated and regarded as promising electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction. However, studies on the impact of coordinated&#8208;nitrogen species in the active center on the spin state and catalytic activity remain scarce. Herein, two single Ni atom electrocatalysts with distinct pyridinic&#8208;N and pyrrolic&#8208;N coordination through a rapid Joule&#8208;heating method that preserves precursor nitrogen configurations. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that pyridinic&#8208;N induces a high&#8208;spin state in Ni centers, while pyrrolic&#8208;N stabilizes a low&#8208;spin configuration. The high&#8208;spin Ni&#8211;Npyridinic&#8211;C demonstrates an exceptional performance in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, achieving 98.8% CO Faradaic efficiency in H&#8208;cells and maintaining&#160;&gt;99% Faradaic efficiency at industrial current densities (&#8805;250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) across alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes in a gas&#8208;diffusion flow cell. A maximum power density of 1.89&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent charge&#8211;discharge cyclability also achieve in zinc&#8211;CO2 battery, further demonstrating the applicability of Ni&#8211;Npyridinic&#8211;C. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the high&#8208;spin state enhances d&#8208;orbital dispersion, strengthening hybridization with &#960;* orbital of CO2 and stabilizing *COOH intermediates, thereby accelerating CO2 activation. This study not only establishes a novel strategy for spin&#8208;state engineering through coordination control but also advances scalable electrocatalyst design for efficient carbon cycling.

         <title>A Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Graphenic Buckybowl for Photocatalysis and Assembly With Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) is bent to a nitrogen&#8208;containing buckybowl (3N&#8208;HBC) through the incorporation of only three pentagons. The electron&#8208;donating nature and curved &#960;&#8208;surface of 3N&#8208;HBC enable its assembly with fullerenes (C60 and C70), and make it the first bowl&#8208;shaped organic photocatalyst that can be used to convert 2&#8208;isocyanobiphenyl to phenanthridine derivatives under blue LEDs irradiation at 1.0 mol% catalytic loading.








Abstract
A nitrogen&#8208;containing graphenic buckybowl (3N&#8208;HBC) has been synthesized through pentagonal cyclization at the bay positions of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (p&#8208;HBC) using a Pd&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative cycloamination as a key step. The incorporation of three pyrrole rings to the periphery of the bowl endows it with strong electron&#8208;rich character, showing three reversible oxidations in cyclic voltammetry (CV), and thus could be progressively oxidized into cationic radical and high&#8208;charged species upon gradual addition of the oxidant. Interestingly, the cationic radical was also generated by acids, which could be significantly accelerated by light, whether under an air or inert atmosphere. 3N&#8208;HBC exhibits interesting properties that arise from its electron&#8208;rich character and the unique curved geometry. 3N&#8208;HBC proved to be a superior organic photocatalyst for the conversion of 2&#8208;isocyanobiphenyl to phenanthridine derivatives at 1.0 mol% catalytic loading under blue LEDs irradiation. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;donating nature and curved &#960;&#8208;surface of 3N&#8208;HBC enable its association with fullerenes (C60 and C70) in solution and solid states. This work also demonstrates that nanographene sheets can be bent to &#960;&#8208;bowls through the introduction of a few pentagons containing small&#8208;sized heteroatoms to their bay regions.

         <title>Chiral Selenium&#8208;Integrated Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters Showing Improved Reverse Intersystem Crossing Rate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selenium&#8208;based tBuCz&#8208;DiKTaSe emitter containing a twisted ortho&#8208;disposed tert&#8208;butylcarbazole shows high &#934;PL, suppressed ACQ, fast kRISC and is chiral. The OLEDs show high EQEmax and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off compared to devices with carbonyl&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters.








Abstract
Nitrogen/carbonyl (N/C&#9552;O) based multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are attractive due to their bright, narrowband emission and the ease with which they can be synthesized. However, their photophysics typically suffer from slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) because of their relatively large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Thus, the organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with these emitters typically show severe efficiency roll&#8208;off. Here, two MR&#8208;TADF emitters DiKTaSe and tBuCz&#8208;DiKTaSe have been designed and synthesized. The introduction of selenium in the form of an annelated benzoselenophene enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling and increases the RISC rate. The twisted ortho&#8208;substituted tert&#8208;butylcarbazole moiety in tBuCz&#8208;DiKTaSe helps to suppress aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of the emission in films. In addition, the large size of the selenium atom and long C&#9472;Se bonds induce helical chirality in both DiKTaSe and tBuCz&#8208;DiKTaSe. Finally, the OLEDs with DiKTaSe showed maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 22.7% while OLEDs with tBuCz&#8208;DiKTaSe showed a higher EQEmax of 27.8% and less&#8208;pronounced efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQE at 100 cd m&#8722;2 (EQE100)/ EQE at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 (EQE1000) of 23.5/12.5%. These efficiency values are amongst the highest of devices employing DiKTa&#8208;based emitters. Our work provides key insight into how to judiciously employ heavy atoms to increase the performance of the emitter and the device.

Finally, the OLEDs with &lt;b&gt;DiKTaSe&lt;/b&gt; showed maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 22.7% while OLEDs with &lt;b&gt;tBuCz-DiKTaSe&lt;/b&gt; showed a higher EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 27.8% and less-pronounced efficiency roll-off, with EQE at 100 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (EQE&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;)/ EQE at 1000 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (EQE&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt;) of 23.5/12.5%. These efficiency values are amongst the highest of devices employing DiKTa-based emitters. Our work provides key insight into how to judiciously employ heavy atoms to increase the performance of the emitter and the device.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Lattice Selenium in Electrocatalytic Self&#8208;Reconstruction for Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>

This work provides insights into the cathode reconstruction of CoP perturbed by Se and unveils the Se&#8208;accelerated two&#8208;stage structural evolution by operando techniques. As a result, the reconstructed Se&#8208;CoP achieves a performance breakthrough for transition metal phosphides in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Cathode reconstruction is equally crucial for water electrolysis, yet it has received less attention than anode. Lattice selenium (Se) doping is an effective strategy to improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts in cathodes, but many fundamental questions concerning the actual role of Se on the active species as well as catalytic kinetics remain to be clarified, especially in those electrocatalytic self&#8208;reconstruction systems. Here, we showcase the accelerated two&#8208;stage structural evolution of Se&#8208;doped cobalt phosphide (Se&#8208;CoP) during alkaline HER by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the in situ formed dual&#8208;component heterostructure of highly crystalline Co(OH)2 and robust Co nanoclusters, which are decorated with residual Se, is responsible for the high HER performance. The reconstructed Se&#8208;CoP on carbon cloth delivers a low overpotential of 79 &#177; 2&#160;mV at 100 mA&#160;&#183;&#160;cm&#8722;2 and achieves an impressive charge transfer amount of 6.3&#160;&#215;&#160;105 C cm&#8722;2 operating at 500 mA cm&#8722;2, surpassing the reported electrocatalysts constructed by non&#8208;noble metal phosphides. This work provides brand&#8208;new perspectives on the self&#8208;reconstruction perturbed by heteroatoms for well&#8208;designed composite electrocatalysts.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Inducible Receptor Oligomerization Enables Fine&#8208;Tuning of T Cell Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamers targeting membrane receptors are extended with rolling circle amplification (RCA)&#8208;duplicated fragments of a split ATP&#8208;binding aptamer to facilitate ATP&#8208;responsive receptor oligomerization, allowing for the reconfiguration of T cell immunity in the tumor microenvironment, holding significant potential for advancing cancer therapeutic interventions.








Abstract
Receptor oligomerization plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular behaviors and functionalities. Stimuli&#8208;responsive artificial circuits are often programmed to rewire cell signaling by fine&#8208;tuning receptor interactions through targeted stimulation. Notably, the integration of tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive systems capable of locally altering cancer cell phenotypes or transforming anti&#8208;tumor responses of immune cells offers a novel and promising strategy for enhancing the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of cancer treatments. In this paper, we introduce an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;inducible receptor oligomerization (ATIRO) approach to facilitate the clustering of CD3 and CD8 of T cells and the engagement of CD3 and tumor markers of T cells and targeted cancer cells to prompt anti&#8208;tumor immunity. ATIRO enables the specific in situ activation of T cells by the high&#8208;level ATP presented in TME, thereby effectively suppressing tumor growth in vivo. ATIRO presents a versatile and readily adaptable strategy for the in&#8208;situ reconfiguration of T cell immunity, holding significant potential for advancing cancer therapeutic interventions.

         <title>Selective Functionalization of Benzene Ring via Carbene&#8208;Initiated [4,5]&#8208;Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although conventional carbene&#8208;mediated [2,3]&#8208;rearrangements focus on divalent functionalization of the carbene center, this study introduces an unprecedented carbene&#8208;initiated [4,5]&#8208;rearrangement cascade, which enables para&#8208;selective functionalization or dearomatizing functionalization of benzene rings. Three distinct product architectures are generated depending on the substituent groups.








Abstract
The extreme similarity in electronic and steric reactivity among the C&#9472;H bonds present on alkyl&#8208;substituted aromatic rings presents a formidable challenge when it comes to achieving high selectivity during the para&#8208;selective functionalization of these bonds. This article presents a unique study that delves into the para&#8208;selective functionalization or dearomatization functionalization of benzene rings, achieved through the reaction of carbenes with allyl sulfoxides. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the transformation likely proceeds via an uncommon carbene&#8208;mediated [4,5]&#8208;rearrangement process.

Polyoxometalate {Mo&#8327;O&#8322;&#8324;@&#947;&#8208;FeO(OH)}&#8208;catalyzed benzannulation of in situ generated oxaquadricyclane was achieved under visible light irradiation. The Anderson&#8208;type [Mo&#8327;O&#8322;&#8324;]&#8310;&#8315; anions enhance the stability of the photoactive &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore, offering superior thermal and oxidative stability. This novel photocatalyst enabled the synthesis of benzindene and dihydrophenanthrene from dienyl sulfoxonium ylides and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes.








Abstract
Given the significance of strain&#8208;release reactions, various spring&#8208;loaded molecules have emerged as important building blocks in diverse fields of chemical science. Despite progress in this area, oxaquadricyclanes remain an understudied class of molecules. In the present report, the strain energy of in situ generated oxaquadricyclane was utilized for benzannulation reaction, which was photocatalyzed by a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based photocatalyst ({Mo&#8327;O24@&#947;&#8208;FeO(OH)}), in which the Anderson&#8208;type polyoxomolybdate [Mo&#8327;O&#8322;&#8324;]&#8310;&#8315; anions enhance the stability of photoactive &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore. The band alignment of this POM&#8208;based complete inorganic semiconductor enables the harvesting of photons from visible light and provides superior thermal and oxidative stability while addressing the cost and performance limitations of conventional organo&#8208;photocatalysts. Using this novel photocatalyst, we successfully synthesized benzindene and dihydrophenanthrene scaffolds from dienyl sulfoxonium ylides and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes through unusual photochemical rearrangements. These benzannulated compounds are notable for their structural similarity to bioactive aromatic steroids and demonstrate their potential as lead candidates for therapeutic development. Through systematic optimization and mechanistic studies, we highlight the critical role of the POM catalyst, the challenges of controlling strain energy&#8208;driven reactivity, and the selective rearrangement of oxaquadricyclane scaffolds.

Triplex DNA plays essential roles in disease pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting. To unravel how environments and sequence modulate triplex stability, we developed a high&#8208;throughput 5DFRETMA method. Predictive models were further developed to not only predict thermal stability but also pioneer the prediction of pH stability under variable temperatures and ionic strengths.








Abstract
Triplex DNA, a critical noncanonical nucleic acid structure, plays essential roles in gene regulation, disease pathogenesis, and therapeutic targeting. To unravel how environmental and sequence factors modulate triplex stability, we developed a high&#8208;throughput 5D fluorescence resonance energy transfer melting annealing (5DFRETMA) method. No less than 414 sets of buffer conditions were tested. Monotonically negative correlations were observed between thermal stability and pH, as well as between pH stability and temperature. These relationships are sequence dependent: triplexes with higher G&#8226;C+ Hoogsteen base pair content display a higher sensitivity to pH and temperature variations. Ionic strength exerts dual effects: stabilizing the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in A&#8226;T base pairs while destabilizing them in G&#8226;C+ base pairs, resulting in a complex ionic strength dependent stability diagram. Critically, as the G&#8226;C+ content increases, the relationship between triplex stability and ionic strength shifts progressively from a monotonically positive to negative dependence. We developed predictive models that not only predict thermal stability but also pioneer the prediction of pH stability under variable temperatures and ionic environments. This work advances the mechanistic understanding of triplex DNA behavior in biologically complex settings, offering tools for the rational design of gene targeted therapeutics and synthetic biology applications.

         <title>Photothermal CuS as a Hole Transfer Layer on BiVO4 Photoanode for Efficient Solar Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a robust strategy to incorporate a photothermal CuS hole transfer layer between the BiVO4 photoanode and NiFeCoOx cocatalyst for remarkably enhancing PEC water splitting. Photothermal CuS HTL significantly acilitates hole transfer and accelerates water oxidation kinetics by elevating photoanode temperature in situ. The BiVO4/CuS/NiFeCoOx photoanode achieves a water oxidation photocurrent density of 6.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;VRHE and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 7.17% when connected in series with Si solar cells.








Abstract
Sluggish hole transport kinetics are one of the key limitations of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, severely impeding the attainment of high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency. Herein, a copper sulfide (CuS) hole transfer layer (HTL) with photothermal effect is reported to markedly enhance the PEC water splitting via the synergistic action of photothermal effect and hole transfer. This is demonstrated in the BiVO4/CuS/NiFeCoOx photoanode, where the CuS layer establishes a transport channel for photogenerated holes, effectively inhibiting charge recombination and trapping. Additionally, the thermal effect induced by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) enhances the water oxidation activity of the surface NiFeCoOx cocatalyst and boosts the charge mobility. The optimized BiVO4/CuS/NiFeCoOx photoanode exhibits exceptional performance, achieving a water oxidation photocurrent density of 6.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) and a STH conversion efficiency of 7.17% when connected in series with Si solar cells. Experimental analyzes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations collectively reveal the pivotal role of CuS HTL in facilitating carrier separation and transport. This work highlights the potential of interfacial engineering to facilitate charge separation and transfer, providing a new strategy for the construction of photoanodes to achieve efficient water splitting.

         <title>Enhancing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Activity by Controlling Oxidation State of Iridium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>

The IrOx/oxi&#8208;TiN catalysts demonstrate a general correlation between iridium oxidation state and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity.








Abstract
Iridium oxides with high oxidation states have been reported to be effective in enhancing the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Herein, we develop ultrasmall IrOx nanoparticles (NPs) over titanium nitride (TiN), which undergoes surface oxidation under oxidative conditions to form oxygen&#8208;modified TiN (oxi&#8208;TiN), enabling the formation of highly oxidized Ir&#948;+ (&#948; &gt; 4). This IrOx/oxi&#8208;TiN catalyst delivers higher Ir mass activity than commercial IrO2, while comparable stability is maintained. The superior OER activity of IrOx/oxi&#8208;TiN is further demonstrated in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE), requiring only 1.88&#160;V to reach 3 A cm&#8722;2, achieving the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 target (1.90&#160;V at 3 A cm&#8722;2). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms that the superior OER activity of IrOx/oxi&#8208;TiN originates from highly oxidized Ir&#948;+ under OER conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a general correlation between the oxidation state of Ir and OER overpotential. Specifically, the introduction of interfacial oxygen at the Ir/TiN interface increases the oxidation state of deposited Ir&#948;+ from &#948; &lt; 4 to &#948;&#160;&gt; 4, decreasing the OER overpotential. This study highlights the critical role of high oxidation states of Ir&#948;+ in enhancing OER activity, providing guidance for the development of advanced acidic OER catalysts.

         <title>Confinement of Polyiodides by Dual&#8208;Functional Tetrazine Cathodes in Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly engineered tetrazine derivative BMT enables dual&#8208;functional cathode chemistry in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. i) Redox enhancement: BMT exhibits reversible two&#8208;electron redox activity at 1.0&#160;V versus Zn/Zn2+, delivering supplementing electron transfer pathways for the cathode. ii) Polyiodide confinement: Stable 2I3&#8722;@BMT precipitates form through covalent&#8208;electrostatic synergistic interactions (binding constant: 6.28&#160;&#215;&#160;103&#160;M&#8722;1), effectively suppressing polyiodide shuttling. The BMT&#8208;based cathode achieves unprecedented performance metrics: record&#8208;high iodine anchoring efficiency index (IAEI&#160;=&#160;1.65), 99.6% Coulombic efficiency at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, ultralong cycle life exceeding 33&#160;000 cycles in coin cells, and practical high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading pouch cells (15.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) with 76.2% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries offer great potential for energy storage due to their long&#8208;term cycle stability, flat voltage plateau, inherent safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their performance is limited by capacity fading and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the I3&#8722; shuttle effect. In this work, we propose a molecularly engineered tetrazine derivative, 3,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;morpholinoethyl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine (BMT) as a multifunctional cathode to address these challenges. BMT exhibits a reversible two&#8208;electron redox process, boosting charge storage capacity, and forms stable precipitation with I3&#8722; ions at a 1:2 stoichiometric ratio, effectively inhibiting the shuttle of polyiodide by covalent&#8208;electrostatic synergistic confinement. As expected, the BMT&#8208;based cathode exhibits a CE of 99.6% at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, a high specific discharge capacity of 207&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 as well as &#8764;100% capacity retention over 33&#160;000 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, achieving a record iodine anchoring efficiency. Furthermore, the Zn&#8211;I2 pouch cell with high iodine mass loading (15.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers a practical cathode energy density of 145.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and maintains 76.2% of its capacity after 800 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work presents a mechanism&#8208;driven cathode design strategy that integrates redox activity and polyiodide confinement, providing a blueprint for the development of stable iodine&#8208;based batteries.

As expected, the BMT-based cathode exhibits a CE of 99.6% at 2&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high specific discharge capacity of 207&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as &#8764;100% capacity retention over 33&#160;000 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, achieving a record iodine anchoring efficiency. Furthermore, the Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell with high iodine mass loading (15.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) delivers a practical cathode energy density of 145.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains 76.2% of its capacity after 800 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work presents a mechanism-driven cathode design strategy that integrates redox activity and polyiodide confinement, providing a blueprint for the development of stable iodine-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multipath ROS Storm and Immune Activation via&#160;Sulfur Vacancy&#8208;Optimized ZnIn2S4&#160;Nanosheets for Piezocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modulate the piezocatalytic performance of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets (ZIS NSs) through sulfur vacancy (S&#7525;) engineering to construct a therapeutic system with multipath ROS generation and immune synergy. The gradient S&#7525; increases the piezoelectric coefficient of the ZIS. Under US, the piezoelectrically tilted band structure synergistically produces &#8226;O2&#8722;, 1O2, &#8226;OH and H2O2. ZIS NSs can effectively inhibit tumor growth under US and activate antitumor immune processes. 








Abstract
Piezocatalytic&#160;therapy is a novel therapeutic strategy that uses mechanical energy to drive catalytic reactions to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, existing materials are limited by low intrinsic catalytic efficiency and a single route to ROS production. This makes it difficult to break through the antioxidant barrier of the tumor microenvironment, which severely limits the antitumor efficacy. Herein, we synthesized sulfur vacancy (Sv)&#8208;engineered ZnIn2S4 nanosheets (ZIS&#8208;2/4/8) by adjusting the concentrations of sulfur source thioacetamide (TAA). The increase in Sv concentration simultaneously achieved the optimization of the energy band structure and the enhancement of the piezoelectric performance (d33 from 21.6 to 46.7&#160;mV V&#8722;1). Under US irradiation, Sv&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can efficiently generate ROS storms via multiple pathways, including &#8226;O2&#8722;, 1O2, &#8226;OH, and H2O2, which overcome the limitations of the tumor microenvironment and achieved effective tumor cell killing. In addition, the ROS storm induced by the ultrasound (US) can also initiate immunogenic cell death (ICD), promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and CD8&#8314; T cells infiltration. This multi&#8208;pathway ROS burst strategy not only breaks through tumor antioxidant defenses but also induces ICD to form a cascade of immune responses. This demonstrates the advantages of combining piezocatalytic and immunotherapy.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Catenane&#8208;Branched Dendrimers with Tunable Dimension for Reversible Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>

The first high&#8208;generation catenane&#8208;branched dendrimers with up to twenty&#8208;one [2]catenane branches have been precisely constructed through a controllable divergent approach, not only achieving the construction of novel high&#8208;order catenane dendrimers with well&#8208;defined topological arrangements, but also providing a new platform for dynamic multifunctional supramolecular materials.








Abstract
To tackle the challenge of the precise construction of catenane&#8208;based mechanically interlocked macromolecules with well&#8208;defined topological arrangements, starting from a novel [2]catenane building block with dendrimer growth sites, catenane&#8208;branched dendrimers have been precisely constructed via an efficient and controllable divergent approach. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, the third&#8208;generation dendrimer which consists of twenty&#8208;one [2]catenane branches is the most complicated discrete [2]catenane oligomer synthesized to date. Interestingly, the switchable coconformation transformations of [2]catenane branches triggered by sodium ions and cryptands lead to an integrated and amplified expansion&#8211;contraction motion of the resultant dendrimers, achieving reversible size regulation at the nanoscale. The unique recognition sites of the resultant catenane&#8208;branched dendrimers also facilitate the reversible binding of drug and dye guests. This work not only addresses the synthetic challenge of highly branched catenane dendrimers but also provides a new platform for dynamic supramolecular functional materials.

         <title>Catalytic Activation of Acceptor&#8211;Acceptor Bicyclobutanes Enabled by Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New synthons, acceptor&#8208;acceptor bicyclobutanes, and a novel cycloaddition strategy involving Lewis base catalysis have been introduced into the cycloaddition chemistry of BCBs, thereby expanding the toolkit for synthesizing pharmaceutically valuable bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes.








Abstract
Owing to the advent of various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies, the utilization of donor&#8208;acceptor bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as a three&#8208;atom component in (3&#160;+&#160;X) cycloaddition reactions has emerged as a highly efficient platform for constructing saturated bicyclic scaffolds that can serve as arene bioisosteres. However, the application of Lewis base catalysis in such reactions remains underexplored, and the strategy for the cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs remains unknown. Herein, we report the first formal (4&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs, which serve as a four&#8208;atom component, for the selective synthesis of pharmaceutically valuable oxa&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (oxa&#8208;BCHeps) enabled by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. BCBs and carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, with various functional groups, are well&#8208;tolerated under mild conditions, yielding oxa&#8208;BCHeps with up to 87% yield, competing with at least five side reactions. The versatility of this synthetic method is further demonstrated through derivatization of the (4&#160;+&#160;2) cycloadducts and late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. The reaction mechanism and the origins of the chemoselectivity were investigated by means of density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Interplay Between Stereochemically Active Lone Pair Repulsions, Sigma Hole Interactions, and Delocalized Redox Processes in Topochemical Fluoride&#8208;Ion Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride&#8208;ion insertion and diffusion within Sn2TiO4 is mediated by the complex interplay between the formation of Sn&#9472;F dative interactions and redox processes delocalized across Ti&#9472;O&#9472;Sn hybrid states counterbalanced by repulsions between fluoride&#8208;ions and stereochemically expressed Sn 5s2 electron lone pairs. The coupled ion&#8212;electron transfer and transport processes are mediated along large tunnels that themselves result from stereochemical expression and repulsions between Sn 5s2 electron lone pairs.








Abstract
Topochemical insertion/extraction of cations has emerged as a generalizable strategy for modulating the crystal and electronic structure of periodic solids. In contrast, strategies for topochemical anion insertion are poorly explored and fundamental principles for designing insertion hosts to accommodate anions remain scarce. Here, we observe reversible room&#8208;temperature fluoride&#8208;ion insertion within tunnels of Sn2TiO4 defined by the stereochemical expression of Sn 5s2 lone pairs. X&#8208;ray scattering studies of fluoride&#8208;ion&#8208;insertion&#8208;induced crystal structure modulation and X&#8208;ray absorption/emission spectroscopy probes of electronic structure along with magnetic susceptibility measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations are used to decipher design principles underpinning reversible fluoride&#8208;ion insertion and bulk diffusion. Fluoride&#8208;ion insertion is enabled by a combination of a large, polarizable tunnel, delocalized redox at Ti&#9472;O&#9472;Sn centers, inherent repulsion between the fluoride&#8208;ion and Sn 5s2 electron lone pairs, and the formation of dative interactions between Sn&#8208;centered &#963;&#8208;holes and fluoride&#8208;ions, yielding a reversible capacity of 0.5 fluoride&#8208;ions per Sn2TiO4 formula unit. Our results demonstrate that the complex interplay between dative interactions and stereochemically active lone pair repulsions is critical to defining the thermodynamics and kinetics controlling fluoride&#8208;ion insertion and diffusion. As such, the design of fluoride&#8208;ion insertion hosts for anion batteries requires site&#8208;selective modification to modulate lattice&#8212;ion interactions.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron lone pairs. The coupled ion&#8212;electron transfer and transport processes are mediated along large tunnels that themselves result from stereochemical expression and repulsions between Sn 5&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron lone pairs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topochemical insertion/extraction of cations has emerged as a generalizable strategy for modulating the crystal and electronic structure of periodic solids. In contrast, strategies for topochemical anion insertion are poorly explored and fundamental principles for designing insertion hosts to accommodate anions remain scarce. Here, we observe reversible room-temperature fluoride-ion insertion within tunnels of Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; defined by the stereochemical expression of Sn 5&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lone pairs. X-ray scattering studies of fluoride-ion-insertion-induced crystal structure modulation and X-ray absorption/emission spectroscopy probes of electronic structure along with magnetic susceptibility measurements and first-principles calculations are used to decipher design principles underpinning reversible fluoride-ion insertion and bulk diffusion. Fluoride-ion insertion is enabled by a combination of a large, polarizable tunnel, delocalized redox at Ti&#9472;O&#9472;Sn centers, inherent repulsion between the fluoride-ion and Sn 5&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron lone pairs, and the formation of dative interactions between Sn-centered &#963;-holes and fluoride-ions, yielding a reversible capacity of 0.5 fluoride-ions per Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formula unit. Our results demonstrate that the complex interplay between dative interactions and stereochemically active lone pair repulsions is critical to defining the thermodynamics and kinetics controlling fluoride-ion insertion and diffusion. As such, the design of fluoride-ion insertion hosts for anion batteries requires site-selective modification to modulate lattice&#8212;ion interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Selective Mineralization of Organohalides on Spatially Close Au Single&#8208;Atom and Nanocluster Neighbors Over Poly(Heptazine Imides)</title>

         <dc:description>
Spatially close Au single atoms and nanoclusters composing of approximately 3&#8211;10 Au atoms were grown on highly crystalline potassium&#8208;incorporated poly(heptazine imides) for photocatalytic selective oxidation of trace organohalides. Highly localized photogenerated holes could enable simultaneous generation of &#8226;OH on Au single atoms and selective adsorption of organohalides on Au nanoclusters, which greatly promoted the targeted removal of trace organohalides in water containing high concentrations of interferences.








Abstract
Organohalides are commonly found pollutants with long&#8208;term persistence in industrial wastewater and drinkable water. Although these pollutants only constitute a small portion of the total organic carbon (TOC), they contribute major toxicity, posing a threat to ecosystem, biodiversity, and public health. Selective removal of organohalides from wastewater/drinkable water is costly due to the orders of magnitude lower concentration of organohalides as compared to interferences. Herein, spatially close Au single atoms and nanoclusters composing of approximately 3&#8211;10 Au atoms were grown on highly crystalline potassium&#8208;incorporated poly(heptazine imides). Microscopy and spectroscopy characterizations together with theoretical calculations revealed that under visible&#8208;light illumination, the highly localized photogenerated holes could enable simultaneous generation of &#8226;OH on Au single atoms and selective adsorption of organohalides on Au nanoclusters, which greatly promoted the targeted removal of trace organohalides in water containing high concentrations of interferences. The fixed&#8208;bed photoreactor built using the spatially close Au single atoms and nanoclusters on poly(heptazine imides) achieved quick degradation of refractory organohalide pollutants in tap water and ground water (2&#160;L h&#8722;1), exhibiting an over 3&#8208;fold log efficiency enhancement compared to traditional advanced oxidation processes.

         <title>Effect of Ambient Organic Acids on the Water Structure at TiO2${\rm TiO}_{2}$ Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ambient organic acids such as formic acid tend to localize in the interfacial water layers close to TiO2${\rm TiO}_2$ surfaces, facilitated by the interaction and exchange of the acid proton with a surface oxygen. These localized acids make the anatase surface hydrophobic, which is offset by the larger fraction of dissociated water on rutile. Thus, the wettability of TiO2${\rm TiO}_2$ is largely controlled by acid&#8208;base chemistry rather than chemisorption.








Abstract
A molecular&#8208;level understanding of the effects of ambient organic compounds on the wettability of titanium dioxide (TiO2${\rm TiO}_2$) surfaces is relevant to many of its energy&#8208;related and environmental applications. Herein, we focus on two common atmospheric carboxylic acids, formic and acetic acid, and characterize their adsorption/ desorption at the aqueous interfaces of anatase and rutile TiO2${\rm TiO}_2$ using molecular dynamics with an ab initio deep neural network potential. Our simulations show that these acids prefer to be localized in the interfacial water layers close to the TiO2${\rm TiO}_{2}$ surface where they are stabilized by the interaction/exchange of their acid proton with a surface oxygen, rather than chemisorb at the surface Ti sites by displacing the adsorbed water. Notably, these acids make the surface of anatase hydrophobic, whereas the larger fraction of adsorbed water dissociation can offset their effect on rutile. These results provide a picture where carboxylic acids control the wettability of TiO2${\rm TiO}_2$ largely through acid&#8208;base chemistry at the interface rather than chemisorption on the oxide surface, a finding that can help improve the design of self&#8208;cleaning surfaces and photocatalytic devices.

         <title>Unraveling the Impact of Organic Cation Dipole Moment on Rashba Spin&#8208;Splitting in 2D Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By comparing two 2D perovskites with different organic cation dipole moments, we demonstrate that increased polarity leads to enhanced Rashba spin&#8208;splitting. A combination of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), CPL, circular dichroism/magnetic circular dichroism (CD/MCD), and spin&#8208;pumping techniques reveals a direct dipole&#8212;structure&#8212;spin correlation in hybrid perovskites.








Abstract
Rashba spin&#8208;splitting in hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) holds great potential for spintronic applications. However, strategies for controlling Rashba spin&#8208;splitting in these materials remain underexplored. Here, we find organic cation dipole moments play a pivotal role in modulating Rashba effects. By comparing p&#8208;FPEA2PbI4 and PEA2PbI4, we demonstrate that larger dipole moments amplify lattice distortion and local symmetry breaking, as confirmed by second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). This structural asymmetry doubles the Rashba spin&#8208;splitting energy, quantified through the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) and circularly polarized light excited photoluminescence (CPLEPL). Circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) reveal a Rashba&#8208;induced effective magnetic field, while spin pumping shows a &#8764;50% higher Rashba coefficient in p&#8208;FPEA2PbI4. These results establish a direct correlation between dipole moment and spin splitting in 2D HOIPs, a trend that extends to quasi&#8208;2D and 3D HOIPs. Our work shows dipole engineering as a general design rule for tailoring Rashba effects in HOIPs, paving the way toward high&#8208;efficiency spin&#8208;based optoelectronics and quantum devices.

A buried interface modification (BIM) strategy was proposed to regulate the crystallization of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films by using multifunctional surface modifiers. High&#8208;quality Sn&#8208;based perovskite films with a lower defect density were achieved, which leads to high&#8208;performance near&#8208;infrared (NIR) Sn&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.9%. 








Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskites show great potential for environmentally friendly and high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the development of Sn&#8208;based perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) lags significantly behind that of lead&#8208;based perovskites. This is mainly due to the faster crystallization rate of Sn&#8208;based perovskites that leads to a higher defect density in Sn&#8208;based perovskite films, thereby serious nonradiative recombination. Here, we demonstrated a buried interface modification (BIM) strategy to regulate the crystallization kinetics of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films by using carboxylate as multifunctional surface modifiers. We reveal that the buried interface is critical to improve the nucleation and crystallization of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films. As a result, efficient near&#8208;infrared Sn&#8208;based PeLEDs were achieved with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.9%. This work suggests an efficient and elegant route to obtain high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based perovskite films and devices.

         <title>Enhancing Clinical Detection Accuracy of Large Structured Viral RNA via DNAzyme Cleavage and Antisense&#8208;Assisted Rolling Circle Amplification</title>

We show that antisense oligonucleotides can be used to restructure secondary structural elements around the circular DNA template binding sites of the genomic RNA for subsequent rolling circle amplification. This strategy was employed to identify otherwise COVID &#8220;false negative&#8221; saliva samples by accurately detecting the presence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA in patient saliva samples, resulting in improved clinical sensitivity and specificity.








Abstract
Sensitive detection of viral RNA is critical for accurate diagnostic testing, particularly during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is a powerful isothermal amplification strategy that can be directly primed by RNA, eliminating the need for reverse transcription. Previous approaches have used 10&#8211;23 DNAzymes to cleave viral RNA, generating 3&#8242;&#8208;ends for hybridization to circular DNA templates (CDTs). However, the resulting RNA fragments often retained secondary or tertiary structures that hindered CDT binding and limited RCA efficiency. To address this challenge, we developed antisense oligonucleotide&#8208;assisted RCA (ASO&#8208;RCA), a general strategy that uses short upstream antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to remodel RNA structure and expose the CDT&#8208;binding site. Using five DNAzyme&#8208;CDT systems targeting distinct regions of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome, we show that ASO inclusion improves CDT hybridization and enhances RCA output&#8212;by up to 70&#8208;fold. This enhancement was observed using both linear and quasi&#8208;exponential RCA formats and remained effective in 50% pooled saliva. When applied to clinical saliva samples, ASO&#8208;assisted RCA markedly improved diagnostic performance, achieving 100% sensitivity and up to 97.5%&#8211;100% accuracy across multiple systems. These findings establish ASO&#8208;DNAzyme&#8208;RCA as a simple, robust, and clinically relevant platform for improving nucleic acid detection in structured RNA targets.

         <title>Twisting Chiral Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Macrocycles into a Microhelix with Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) active macrocycle structures (CP1, CP2) were designed and synthesized. Compared to the macrocycle RCP2 containing phenyl spacers, the rigid RCP1 macrocycle self&#8208;assembled into left&#8208;handed microhelix by body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) supramolecular packing with left&#8208;handed tendency, resulting in circularly polarized luminescence materials with high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) value. 








Abstract
The design and assembly of chiral macrocycles remain an underexplored frontier in supramolecular science. In this study, we synthesized a pair of enantiomeric macrocyclic molecules (CP1) through the condensation of chiral cyclohexanediamine with tetraphenylethylene (TPE) dialdehyde. These molecules exhibited remarkable circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties at the supramolecular level. Through supramolecular assembly in mixed solvent systems, we achieved a rare micron&#8208;scale helical structure, exhibiting a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.32&#8212;one of the highest values reported to date for macrocyclic self&#8208;assemblies. Furthermore, by designing a chiral macrocycle with phenyl spacers (CP2), we revealed that the confinement of macrocycles and restricted internal molecular rotation are critical for achieving high glum values and helical structure formation. This work not only advances the design of chiral macrocycles but also provides new insights into the relationship between molecular structure and supramolecular assembly, paving the way for the development of advanced chiral materials with potential applications in optics, sensing, and nanotechnology.

         <title>Si&#9472;O Molecular Engineering Enhances Cathode&#8208;Anode Interface Stability for High&#8208;Loading and High&#8208;Voltage Layered Cathode&#8208;Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose PFOTMS as an interfacial stabilizer, leveraging the Si&#9472;O bond conjugation and steric hindrance of long fluorinated chains to form a weakly coordinated structure that selectively excludes solvents. This structure preferentially oxidizes to generate a F and Si&#9472;O rich interface layer, stabilizing the cathode and anode, and mitigating crosstalk effects from severe solvent decomposition and transition metal migration under high&#8208;voltage, high&#8208;load conditions.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich layered cathodes and lithium metal anode are promising for the next generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface induces structural degradation and battery failure under high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;loading conditions. Herein, we report a fluorosilane&#8208;coupled electrolyte stabilizer with 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H&#8208;perfluorooctyltrimethoxysilane (PFOTMS), which presents higher adsorption energy with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode than solvents through the conjugation of Si&#9472;O bonds and therefore is oxidized on its surface to derive an interfacial layer rich in F and Si&#9472;O species. This architecture effectively stabilizes the cathode structure, suppresses transition metal migration, and promotes Li+ conduction and uniform deposition, which also suppresses the side reactions of electrolyte with both cathode and anode. This unique interfacial stabilization mechanism enables the Li||NCM811 battery to achieve a capacity retention rate of 80.8% after 600 cycles at 4.7&#160;V. The Li||LiCoO2 cell with a high mass loading of 20&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 achieves a remarkably high&#8208;capacity retention of 92.79% after 500 cycles at 4.4&#160;V. This work proposes an interfacial stabilization that overcomes high&#8208;voltage limitations in practical nickel&#8208;rich cathode/lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Strategic Secondary Coordination Implantation Towards Efficient and Stable Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in PEMFCs</title>

         <dc:description>
The novel Fe&#8208;based catalyst breaks the longstanding activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in PEMFCs through precise atomic&#8208;level electronic modulation. By constructing a dynamic electron reservoir around Fe&#8208;N4 active sites, the optimized catalyst simultaneously achieves an 86% improvement in ORR activity (reaching 1.73&#160;W cm&#8722;2 peak power density, comparable to Pt) and remarkable stability (97% Fe retention after long&#8208;term MEA stability tests, an 8.8&#8208;fold improvement over the pristine Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C material), demonstrating an unprecedented balance between significantly enhanced catalytic activity and long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
While state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalysts demonstrate platinum&#8208;comparable initial activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), their operational durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) remains fundamentally limited by progressive destabilization of Fe&#9472;N bond under electrochemical cycling, resulting in irreversible metal leaching, catastrophic catalyst degradation and the so&#8208;called activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principles screening, we demonstrate that the strategic implantation of transition metal ions with d&#8208;orbital characteristics analogous to the active site into the secondary coordination sphere, functioning as non&#8208;catalytic stabilizers, enables dynamic neutralization of reaction intermediates&#8208;induced electronic polarization, thereby achieving stabilization of metal&#9472;nitrogen bonds during the ORR cycle. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the integration of isovalent Ru ions as electron&#8208;buffing site in the designed FeRu dual&#8208;atom catalyst not only achieves a high peak power density of 1.73&#160;W cm&#8722;2 with a current density of 58&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.9&#160;V, but also exhibits exceptional durability, with a current decay rate of just 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and over 97% Fe retention after prolonged stability tests. This stands in stark contrast to Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C counterparts, which retain less than 11% of Fe sites under identical conditions.

         <title>High&#8208;Rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction by Dual&#8208;Proton Hydrogenation Pathway Over Pd&#8208;Anchored Oxygen&#8208;Deficient ZnO Nanosheets</title>

         <dc:description>
Note that the CO2 molecule is adsorbed and polarized on the metal nanocluster, while the two H2O molecules are simultaneously activated on the OL and VO, releasing two protons to assist CO2 activation into CH4 via the stepwise DPECT pathway, thus remarkably shortening the number of reaction steps relative to the traditional CO2&#8208;COOH&#8208;CH4 process.








Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 usually comprises upto eight proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps, greatly reducing the conversion performance. Here, we report a new dual&#8208;proton hydrogenation pathway for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, which can condense every two proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps into one single step. Also, we pioneer the use of in situ synchrotron&#8208;radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry to distinguish the crucial HCOOH from COOH intermediates, overcoming the limitation of in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy. Taking the synthetic Pd/ZnO&#8208;VO nanosheets as an example, synchrotron&#8208;radiation X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy discloses the Pd nanoclusters are anchored on the ZnO&#8208;VO nanosheets via building Pd&#9472;O bonds, while theoretical calculation demonstrates charge accumulation on the interfacial Pd sites. In situ spectroscopic characterizations, labelling experiments, and adsorption energy calculations collectively establish CO2 undergoes stepwise dual&#8208;proton hydrogenation routes, gradually transforming into *HCOOH, *HCHO, *CH3OH, and CH4, different from the traditional CO2&#8208;COOH&#8208;CH4 processes. Thus, the Pd/ZnO&#8208;VO nanosheets exhibit superior CH4 evolution rate of 257.6&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming all previously reported photocatalysts. This work unlocks an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 pathway, largely reducing the number of reaction steps.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Mediated Charge Transfer Regulation of Inner Core Clusters in Hybrid Copper(I)&#8208;Based Halides for High&#8208;Efficiency X&#8208;Ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by coordination dynamics, a solvent mediation strategy was used to modulate coordination environments and intramolecular charge transfer of organic cuprous halides to achieve vibrant emissions. After optimized regulation, a 10 times enhancement of radioluminescence (RL) compared to that of the C6H18N2Cu2Br4 scintillator was achieved with a high light yield of about 73881&#160;photons/MeV (C12H28N4Cu2I2) and excellent photochemical stability.








Abstract
Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides have gained significant interest as scintillators. However, their X&#8208;ray luminescence efficiency is mainly determined by the competition between radiative organic ligands and nonradiative metal cluster&#8208;centered charge transfer. How to regulate their charge transfer to enhance radiative emission is an intractable challenge. Here, guided by coordination dynamics, we present a solvent mediation strategy to modulate coordination environments and intramolecular charge transfer of organic cuprous halides to achieve vibrant emissions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the coordinated clusters can efficiently absorb radiation ionization to generate electron&#8208;hole pairs and transfer them to ligands for enhanced luminescence. Conversely, ligand&#8208;free structures exhibit an absence of organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;related excited states upon excitation, leading to luminescence quenching. Due to optimized metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) dynamics, a five times enhancement of emission efficiency was achieved with a peak photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 82.14%. Correspondingly, radioluminescence (RL) was significantly improved to 2.22 and 10 times greater than that of (Lu,Y)2SiO5:Ce (LYSO) and C6H18N2Cu2Br4 with a high light yield of 73881&#160;photons/MeV (C12H28N4Cu2I2) and excellent photochemical stability. A high X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of 9.7&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1 was also demonstrated by the soft C12H28N4Cu2I2 screen even with the thickness of 30&#160;&#181;m. Our study provides a solvent&#8208;mediated ligand engineering of copper halide cluster scintillators.

         <title>An Atomically Dispersed Photocatalyst for Undirected para&#8208;Selective C&#9472;H Bond Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an atomically dispersed recyclable heterogeneous photocatalytic method for para&#8208;selective trifluoromethylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes without directing groups. Unlike previous substrate&#8208;dependent approaches, this recyclable, atomically dispersed photocatalyst enables scalable synthesis of bioactive trifluoromethylated compounds with high regioselectivity. The findings advance understanding of C&#9472;H functionalization, photocatalysis, and trifluoromethylation, offering broad academic as well as industrial potential.








Abstract
Regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization is pivotal in modern scientific exploration, offering solutions for achieving novel synthetic methodologies and pharmaceutical development. In this aspect, achieving exceptional regioselective functionalization, like para&#8208;selective products in electron&#8208;poor aromatics, diverges from traditional methods. Leveraging the advantages of atomically dispersed photocatalysts, we designed a robust photocatalyst for an unconventional regioselective aromatic C&#9472;H bond functionalization. This innovation enabled para&#8208;selective trifluoromethylations of electron&#8208;deficient metadirecting aromatics (&#9472;NO2, &#9472;CF3, &#9472;CN, etc.), which is entirely orthogonal to the traditional approaches. Mechanistic experiments and DFT analysis confirmed the interaction between Cu&#8208;atom and the aromatic substrate, alongside the photocatalyst's molecular arrangement, driving selective exposure of the para&#8208;selective functionalization. This strategic approach elucidated pathways for precise molecular transformations, advancing the frontier of regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization by using atomically dispersed photocatalysts in organic synthesis.

         <title>[TeSeS2]2&#8722;: The First Heterotriple&#8208;Chalcogenide Motifs Decode Giant Mid&#8208;Far Infrared Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating S, Se, and Te, the first heterotri&#8208;chalcogenide motif, [TeSeS2]2&#8722;, is created in BaTeSeS2. It harmonizes ultrabroad IR transmission (&gt;25&#160;&#181;m) with giant optical anisotropy (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.55 at 550&#160;nm), outperforming all commercial birefringent crystals and reported IR birefringent materials.








Abstract
Optical anisotropy, a cornerstone of polarization control, presents fundamental challenge in functional optical material design due to the intricate interplay between its regulation mechanisms and performance optimization. The development of mid&#8208;far infrared (MFIR) birefringent crystals has long been shackled by the incompatibility between giant optical anisotropy and ultrabroad transparency in conventional chalcogenides. Here, we break this shackle via heterotriple&#8208;chalcogenide engineering in the first thiotellurite birefringent family, BaTeQ3 (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se), featuring isolated [TeQ3]2&#8315; motifs. BaTeS3 achieves a large experimental birefringence (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.193@550&#160;nm, 15&#215; commercial MgF2).

&lt;p&gt;Integrating S, Se, and Te, the first heterotri-chalcogenide motif, [TeSeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, is created in BaTeSeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It harmonizes ultrabroad IR transmission (&amp;gt;25&#160;&#181;m) with giant optical anisotropy (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.55 at 550&#160;nm), outperforming all commercial birefringent crystals and reported IR birefringent materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optical anisotropy, a cornerstone of polarization control, presents fundamental challenge in functional optical material design due to the intricate interplay between its regulation mechanisms and performance optimization. The development of mid-far infrared (MFIR) birefringent crystals has long been shackled by the incompatibility between giant optical anisotropy and ultrabroad transparency in conventional chalcogenides. Here, we break this shackle via heterotriple-chalcogenide engineering in the first thiotellurite birefringent family, BaTeQ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se), featuring isolated [TeQ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8315; motifs. BaTeS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; achieves a large experimental birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.193@550&#160;nm, 15&#215; commercial MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). More strikingly, the assembly of three distinct Group VIA chalcogens (S, Se, Te) creates the first heterotriple-chalcogenide motif&#8212;[TeSeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8315; in BaTeSeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, delivering giant &#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.55@550&#160;nm&#8212;a 284% increase from BaTeS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and surpassing all commercial benchmarks. BaTeSeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concurrently exhibit ultrabroad transparency (0.5&#8211;25&#160;&#181;m), overcoming the classical trade-off between anisotropy and transparency. First-principles calculations reveal that their extraordinary optical anisotropy stems from synergistic stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP)-driven electron localization in [TeQ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units (electron localization function&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;0.8) and Se-induced pyramidal distortion.

         <title>Fortification of FeS Clusters Reshapes Anaerobic CO Dehydrogenase into an Air&#8208;Viable Enzyme Through Multilayered Sealing of O2 Tunnels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fortification of FeS clusters in Ni&#9472;Fe CO dehydrogenase (Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans) reshapes this anaerobic enzyme into an air&#8208;viable variant through multilayered O2 tunnel sealing. The engineered enzyme retains structural integrity and catalytic efficiency in ambient air, offering a practical solution for industrial CO/CO2 bioconversion processes without the need for strict anaerobic conditions.








Abstract
The inherent O2 sensitivity of Ni&#9472;Fe carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs), crucial for rapid CO to CO2 interconversion, presents substantial challenges for industrial application. Transforming CO/CO2, a prevalent anthropogenic air pollutant, into valuable carbon chemicals either directly or through intermediate steps via biocatalytic methods offers a promising pathway to achieve net&#8208;zero emissions across industries and the environment. However, completely eliminating oxygen from industrial biotransformations, especially under ambient conditions, is exceedingly onerous. Here, we engineered variants of the CODH2 from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans (ChCODH2) with dual blocking at both the O2 entrance and near the active site, effectively sealing the tunnel against atmospheric O2 levels (20%). The O2&#8208;tunnel engineered A559W/V610H variant demonstrated a marked improvement in air stability, with a half&#8208;life of 24.6&#160;h compared to the wild type's 2.4&#160;h. Crystallographic snapshots of this air&#8208;viable variant after 24&#160;h of exposure revealed the robust integrity of the fortified FeS and NiFeS clusters. Additionally, electro&#8208;enzymatic reactions corroborated its CO/CO2 conversion capability even in ubiquitous air. These findings, which address the O2 sensitivity of anaerobic enzymes caused by O2&#8208;induced metal cluster collapse, enhance their potential for biological CO/CO2 transformations in O2&#8208;rich environments, thereby broadening their industrial viability and applicability.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Nanoscale Engineering of Iridium&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in acidic oxygen evolution reactions, a laser&#8208;induced nano&#8208;oven method is developed for the precise synthesis of ultra&#8208;small crystalline iridium and iridium oxide nanoparticles under ambient conditions, employing a silicon dioxide matrix as a nanoscale reaction chamber. The synthesized &#8764;2&#160;nm rutile IrO2 nanoparticles exhibit a high mass activity of 350&#160;&#177;&#160;15 A gIr&#8315;&#185; at 300&#160;mV overpotential, achieving activity comparable to RuO&#8322; catalysts while demonstrating superior stability compared to commercial IrO2.








Abstract
While ruthenium oxide exhibits higher activity, it suffers from significantly lower stability in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In contrast, crystalline iridium oxide is among the few materials that remain stable under such harsh conditions. However, its low activity and iridium scarcity require strategies to enhance atomic utilization. Conventional high&#8208;temperature post&#8208;synthetic processing increases the share of rutile&#8208;phase iridium oxide while promoting particle growth, reducing catalytic activity due to a diminished surface area. Here, we present a laser&#8208;induced nano&#8208;oven method using a silicon dioxide matrix as a nanoscale reaction chamber, enabling solid&#8208;state nanoparticle synthesis under ambient conditions while preventing agglomeration and allowing precise size control. The synthesized ultra&#8208;small crystalline rutile iridium oxide of &#8764;2&#160;nm achieves a high mass activity of 350&#160;&#177;&#160;15 A gIr&#8722;1 at 300&#160;mV overpotential, exceeding that of crystalline RuO&#8322; and reaching the activity benchmark of RuO2&#8208;based catalysts. Analysis using a channel flow cell with on&#8208;line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) confirms that laser&#8208;engineered iridium oxide exhibits superior stability to commercial iridium oxide. Operando electron impact MS provided the synthesis mechanistic insights, demonstrating the potential of this strategy for synthesizing ultra&#8208;small crystalline metals and metal oxides for various applications.

         <title>Chelation&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Design for Enhanced Interface and Electrochemical Window in Aqueous Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chelating agents have been reported as effective electrolyte additives in aqueous aluminum batteries. Bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl)amine (BMEA), in particular, is believed to reshape the solvation structure, thereby enabling a wider electrochemical window. Additionally, it can participate in the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the aluminum surface, evidenced by atom probe topography (APT), effectively protecting the electrode from corrosion. Aqueous aluminum&#8211;organic batteries utilizing this electrolyte containing BMEA demonstrate high specific capacity and stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries have garnered significant attention owing to the abundance of aluminum resources, high theoretical specific capacity, and excellent safety. However, challenges such as electrolyte&#8208;induced water decomposition, aluminum anode corrosion, and electrode material compatibility continue to constrain their performance. In this study, we restructured the solvation environment using the chelating reagent Bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl)amine (BMEA), achieving an expanded electrochemical window of 2.2&#160;V and mitigating hydrogen evolution side reactions. Advanced atom probe tomography analysis confirmed that BMEA actively participates in the formation of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), effectively preventing aluminum surface corrosion and extending the cycle life of the aluminum anode. Employed as a BMEA&#8208;containing electrolyte in aluminum&#8211;organic batteries, the resulting Al||Tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCB) battery delivered a high capacity of 218.0&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and demonstrated stable cycling over 300 cycles. This study highlights the potential of chelating agents as additives in advancing high&#8208;performance aluminum batteries.

Herein, we report the use of bis(trimethylaluminum)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABAl&#8208;Me3) as practical source of radicals for the introduction of valuable methyl groups to aryl bromides via a Nickel/metallaphotocatalytic cross coupling strategy.








Abstract
We report a metallaphotocatalytic strategy for the selective methylation of (hetero)aryl bromides via nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with bis(trimethylaluminum)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABAl&#8208;Me&#8323;), as a commercially available, air&#8208;stable, and non&#8208;pyrophoric aluminum&#8208;based reagent. The method enables a fast, robust, and scalable methylation protocol that broadly accommodates various functional groups while preventing protodehalogenation. Mechanistic studies confirm the unprecedented generation of methyl radicals from an organo&#8208;aluminum precursor under photoredox conditions, bypassing the limitations of conventional two&#8208;electron pathways. This work expands the toolbox of practical radical precursors and provides a streamlined approach for selective C(sp2)&#9472;CH3 bond formation.

         <title>Recyclable Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Carbon Nitride Colloidal Catalyst for Sustainable Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a versatile and scalable strategy for constructing recyclable g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based colloidal photocatalysts, bridging the gap between the high efficiency of homogeneous systems and the practicality of heterogeneous catalysis. By grafting polar sulfonylcyanide groups and incorporating K+ ions, the hydrophilicity of g&#8208;C3N4 is enhanced, enabling quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide for sustainable chemical applications.








Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) photocatalysts have attracted growing interest for the eco&#8208;friendly, solar&#8208;driven synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the catalytic efficiency remains limited by poor accessibility of reactive sites due to the hydrophobic nature and aggregation tendency of conventional g&#8208;C3N4. Here, we report a hydrophilic g&#8208;C3N4 colloidal photocatalyst, synthesized via potassium ion (K&#8314;) incorporation and surface grafting with sulfonylcyanide groups, which enables quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic H2O2 production (7,886&#160;&#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;), surpassing most reported g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based heterogeneous systems. The sulfonylcyanide groups facilitate O2 adsorption and reduction, while synergistically promoting charge separation in conjunction with K&#8314; ions. This work demonstrates the potential of hydrophilic g&#8208;C3N4 colloids in quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalysis and presents a versatile strategy for designing advanced g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts for sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective de novo Construction of Pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;fused Helicenoids via NHC Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented helicoselective synthesis of an array of pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;fused [5]helicenoids and [4]helicenoids has been realized by a one&#8208;step de novo construction strategy based on NHC&#8208;organocatalytic (3+3) annulation of ester&#8208;derived alkynyl acylazoliums with enolizable polyaromatic ketones.








Abstract
Helicenoids have attracted considerable interest in diverse research areas owing to their unique structural and electronic characteristics. However, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of helically chiral molecules has remained a formidable challenge. In particular, the organocatalytic enantioselective construction of heterohelicenoids has witnessed fairly limited progress, presumably due to the lack of rational design of competent substrates, the right choice of suitable reactions, and highly effective catalytic systems. In this study, we report the helicoselective and divergent synthesis of a new class of pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;fused [5]helicenoids and [4]helicenoids through an NHC organocatalytic step&#8208;economical (3+3) annulation reaction. The protocol features broad substrate scope, ease of late&#8208;stage functionalization, and excellent stereo&#8208;control with enantioselectivities up to &gt;99%. Moreover, the optical properties of the synthesized oxohelicenoids and their derivatives were characterized to explore their potential applications in material sciences.

         <title>Regulating Structures and Properties of Overcrowded&#8208;Ethylene Decorated (Diaza)Phosphinines via Tunable Main&#8208;Group Element Hyperconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining overcrowded&#8208;ethylene (OCE) with P element presented a new type of P&#8208;functionalized OCEs exhibiting the unprecedent P&#8208;hyperconjugation&#8208;regulated conformations and physical properties. The unique hyperconjugation&#8208;regulated tunability further enabled the design of a light&#8208;responsive open&#8208;shell P&#8208;anthraquinodimethane diradicaloid, which was controlled by the P&#8208;hyperconjugation effect in F&#8208;isomer and the aromaticity gain in T&#8208;isomer.








Abstract
Creating more sophisticated molecular systems that are responsive, dynamic, and controllable through a combination of chemical structure modification and external stimuli represents a pivotal challenge in the development of functional molecular machines. Herein, we report a new series of overcrowded&#8208;ethylene (OCE) decorated (diaza)phosphinines. Combining with the main&#8208;group element and nonplanar OCE structures, new P&#8208;molecules showed the tunable folded(F)/twisted(T)&#8208;conformations and physical properties via the distinct P&#8208;hyperconjugation of the P&#9472;C and P&#9472;N bonds. Such hyperconjugation&#8208;induced tunability is different from the classical OCEs where p&#8208;&#960;/&#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation effects are the dominating factors controlling the structures and properties. Furthermore, bromination of NP&#8208;oxide derivative induced an unexpected chemochromic T&#8594;F isomerization, highlighting the dynamic conformation character. Leveraging on the different structures, CP and NP derivatives further enabled the formations of radical cations and anions having different spin characters on the P&#8208;centers. As the new example of P&#8208;Thiele's hydrocarbon family, combining the NP structure with the overcrowded anthraquinodimethane structure yielded a light&#8208;responsive open&#8208;shell NP&#8208;anthraquinodimethane diradicaloid with a triplet ground state, which was influenced by the PN hyperconjugation effect in F&#8208;conformation and the aromaticity gain in T&#8208;conformation. Overall, our new strategy, namely the hyperconjugation&#8208;regulated tunability, paves the way toward complex organic materials with tunable the structures and physical properties.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly&#8208;Driven Multilevel Fluorescent Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the IQP&#8834;CB[8] photodriven [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, fluorescent information encryption materials featuring photo&#8208;responsiveness, pH&#8208;responsiveness, and time&#8208;dependent behavior were constructed, enabling multilevel information storage and encryption through synergistic multiparameter control.








Abstract
The growing demand for information security in the digital era has accelerated the development of novel encryption materials, among which optically responsive systems have emerged as particularly promising candidates due to their exceptional tunability and noninvasive characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the IQP&#8834;CB[8] photodriven [2+2] cycloaddition reaction based on supramolecular self-assembly, fluorescent information encryption materials featuring photo-responsiveness, pH-responsiveness, and time-dependent behavior were constructed, enabling multilevel information storage and encryption through synergistic multiparameter control.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing demand for information security in the digital era has accelerated the development of novel encryption materials, among which optically responsive systems have emerged as particularly promising candidates due to their exceptional tunability and noninvasive characteristics. However, current optical encryption materials remain largely confined to static or binary states, presenting a fundamental challenge in achieving precisely controlled hierarchically responses for developing high-capacity, multilevel encrypted materials. Herein, we successfully construct a novel class of dynamically multilevel responsive luminescent materials driven by supramolecular self-assembly and apply them to a multilevel information encryption system. The highly efficient host&#8211;guest complexation between 4-phenylpyridine-functionalized isoquinoline derivatives (IQP) and macrocyclic molecule CB[8] enables the construction of linear supramolecular polymers (IQP&#8834;CB[8]). Affected by the dynamic protonation of isoquinoline and the host&#8211;guest interaction, the monomer and polymer exhibit the characteristics of multicolor luminescence. Furthermore, IQP can undergo a reversible [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction in the confined space of CB[8], it can reversibly transform from a conjugated supramolecular polymer to a nonconjugated polyrotaxane and shows pronounced optical response on the time gradient.

         <title>HCl Intake via Nanobubbles Induces Redox Radicals for Aqueous Cl2 and H2 Production Without Catalyst and Bias Applied</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanobubble with HCl intake generates &#183;OH and e&#8722;aq, enabling efficient aqueous Cl2 and H2 production without catalysts or external bias. The gas composition critically determines the generation of water redox radicals, creating a sustainable interfacial region for halogenation chemistry and energy&#8208;efficient transformations.








Abstract
Bubbling is a widely used method to enhance gas hydration and dissolution in aqueous solutions. Understanding the bubble&#8208;induced interface&#8208;rich aqueous system is crucial for elucidating gas&#8208;involved solution chemical reactions, yet this area remains underexplored. Here we report the formation of aqueous Cl2 and H2 driven by nanobubbles, achieved by introducing redox&#8208;active HCl gas through a gas diffusion electrode without applying bias or loading catalysts. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed that increasing HCl intake elevates the concentration of hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) and hydrated electrons (e&#8722;aq), more than an order of magnitude higher than that of feeding Ar alone. High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry identified spin&#8208;trapping agent stabilized radical intermediates, including &#183;Cl, ClO&#183;, and &#183;H. Iodometric titration estimated the equivalent Cl2 content at approximately 18&#160;mmol L&#8722;1, while gas chromatography verified H2 formation. This study demonstrates that bubbling redox&#8208;active gases through aqueous solution can activate water reactivity, leading to the conversion of the gases themselves.

         <title>Controlling Asymmetry Amplification Through Supramolecular Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, using two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept chiral (S)&#8208;1 and (R)&#8208;1 Pt(II) complexes along with a model achiral compound 2, we demonstrate the ability of supramolecular polymorphism to control and amplify asymmetry. By strategically merging the distinct properties of polymorphs of (S)&#8208;1 and 2, we achieved a remarkable synergistic communication between chirality and luminescence in their coassemblies, paving the way for adaptive supramolecular materials with emergent functionalities. 








Abstract
Supramolecular polymorphism has recently emerged as a powerful concept, enabling a single chemical entity to form distinct, stable assemblies in solution with diverse morphological, photophysical, and electronic properties. Despite this progress, the interplay between supramolecular polymorphism and chirality remains unexplored. Herein, we harness supramolecular polymorphism to control the amplification of asymmetry in supramolecular polymerization (SP). For this purpose, we designed two Pt(II) complexes bearing &#960;&#8208;extended ligands and S&#8208; or R&#8208;chiral side chains (compounds (S)&#8208;1 and (R)&#8208;1) that self&#8208;assemble into two distinct supramolecular polymorphs in methylcyclohexane: nonemissive short fibers with parallel molecular packing (AggI) and thermodynamically more stable helical fibers with a rotationally offset stacking, closer Pt&#8943;Pt contacts, and weak 3MMLCT luminescence (AggII). These polymorphs exhibit markedly different amplification of asymmetry in majority rules (MR) and sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers (SaS) studies, with the thermodynamic polymorph displaying superior performance. Ultimately, coassembly studies between the achiral model compound 2&#8212;which exhibits strong 3MMLCT emission in the assembled state&#8212;and the chiral but weakly emissive AggII reveal a synergistic communication between chirality and luminescence, culminating in the emergence of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This study broadens the scope of supramolecular polymorphism and expands the design toolbox for adaptive supramolecular materials with emergent and synergistic functionalities.

         <title>Direct Activation of Sulfides by C&#8211;H Oxidation with Photoexcited Nitroarenes: Formal Manipulations of the C&#9472;S Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical anaerobic oxidation of sulfides, using nitroarenes as bifunctional reagents, enables the formal manipulation of the C&#9472;S bond. The method allows direct and selective access to versatile carbonyl compounds from largely inert sulfides by C&#8211;H oxidation, thus avoiding multistep activation by sulfur oxidation. The mild photo&#8208;induced protocol has been engaged in telescoped procedures to convert sulfides into amines, alcohols, and alkenes.








Abstract
The sulfide motif is distributed widely across chemical and biological space. In synthesis, its installation often marks the end point of a sequence, due to its relative inertness; sulfides typically require direct oxidation of sulfur before they are receptive toward transformation. Unfortunately, selective S&#8208;oxidation is not always straightforward, with the need for oxidants lacking chemoselectivity in the presence of functionality and delivering mixtures of oxidation products. This multistep manipulation of the sulfide motif, initiated by direct S&#8208;oxidation, limits the use of sulfides as synthetic handles for downstream manipulation. Herein, we describe a direct activation of sulfides by C&#8211;H oxidation alpha to sulfur&#8212;rather than traditional oxidation at sulfur&#8212;that facilitates efficient formal C&#9472;S bond manipulation. The mild nature of the photo&#8208;induced anaerobic oxidation protocol enables its merger with high&#8208;value transformations in telescoped or one&#8208;pot protocols that deliver branched amines, secondary alcohols, and alkenes from aldehyde and ketone intermediates. The method expands the chemistry of sulfides by diverting reactivity away from sulfur (oxidation, alkylation) and instead targeting directly the alpha position, resulting in formal manipulation of the C&#9472;S bond, and redefining sulfides as latent synthetic handles to be &#8220;switched on&#8221; at will.

         <title>A Universal Metal Ion&#8208;Targeting Coordination Strategy for Precise Synthesis of Heteronuclear Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a universal and controllable &#8220;metal ion targeting coordination&#8221; (MITC) strategy for the precise synthesis of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs). By constructing a bpy&#8208;M1(&#956;2&#8208;OH)&#8208;M2 precursor, this method overcomes the randomness of traditional routes. The resulting FeCo DAC exhibits excellent ORR performance via a favorable dissociative pathway, breaking the OH*&#8208;OOH* scaling relation.








Abstract
Heteronuclear dual&#8208;atoms catalysts (DACs) represent an emerging frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to maximum atom utilization and synergistic catalysis, yet their precise synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we propose a universal &#8220;metal ion targeting coordination&#8221; (MITC) strategy to construct a series of heteronuclear DACs. This approach utilizes the bipyridyl (bpy) ligands to coordinate a primary metal (M1), forming an artificial monooxygenase (bpy)M1(&#956;2&#8208;OH) structure, where electron&#8208;enriched oxygen atoms serve as anchoring sites for a secondary metal (M2). The oxygen bridged M1&#8208;O&#8208;M2 configurations in the resulting (bpy)M1(&#956;2&#8208;OH)M2 precursors enable precise synthesis of heteronuclear DACs during the subsequent pyrolysis. Benefiting from geometric and electronic structure merits, heteronuclear DACs can efficiently catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through a more desirable dissociative mechanism, thus circumventing the inherent OH*&#8208;OOH* linear scaling relations. Notably, the FeCo DAC exhibits exceptional ORR performance, with an onset and half&#8208;wave potential of 1.03&#160; and 0.93&#160;V, respectively.

     alt="A Universal Metal Ion-Targeting Coordination Strategy for Precise Synthesis of Heteronuclear Dual-Atom Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work presents a universal and controllable &#8220;metal ion targeting coordination&#8221; (MITC) strategy for the precise synthesis of heteronuclear dual-atom catalysts (DACs). By constructing a bpy-M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH)-M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursor, this method overcomes the randomness of traditional routes. The resulting FeCo DAC exhibits excellent ORR performance via a favorable dissociative pathway, breaking the OH*-OOH* scaling relation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heteronuclear dual-atoms catalysts (DACs) represent an emerging frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to maximum atom utilization and synergistic catalysis, yet their precise synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we propose a universal &#8220;metal ion targeting coordination&#8221; (MITC) strategy to construct a series of heteronuclear DACs. This approach utilizes the bipyridyl (bpy) ligands to coordinate a primary metal (M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), forming an artificial monooxygenase (bpy)M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH) structure, where electron-enriched oxygen atoms serve as anchoring sites for a secondary metal (M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The oxygen bridged M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-O-M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; configurations in the resulting (bpy)M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH)M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursors enable precise synthesis of heteronuclear DACs during the subsequent pyrolysis. Benefiting from geometric and electronic structure merits, heteronuclear DACs can efficiently catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through a more desirable dissociative mechanism, thus circumventing the inherent OH*-OOH* linear scaling relations. Notably, the FeCo DAC exhibits exceptional ORR performance, with an onset and half-wave potential of 1.03&#160; and 0.93&#160;V, respectively. The excellent ORR activity of FeCo DAC is further validated in anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), delivering a peak power density over 1.3&#8201;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a current density of 79.2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.9 V&lt;sub&gt;iR-free&lt;/sub&gt; under H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancing Sulfinyl Radical Chemistry: An Asymmetric Smiles Rearrangement with Chiral Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, asymmetric sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles rearrangement enables the enantioselective trifunctionalization of chiral sulfoxides via radical addition, 1,5&#8208;aryl migration, and sulfinyl radical interception. By tuning the redox potentials of key components, this cascade forms two C&#9472;C and one C&#9472;S bond in a single step, yielding enantioenriched sulfoxides and sulfones (up to 96:4 er) that can be further diversified into complex motifs.








Abstract
Chiral N&#8208;sulfinyl amides have recently emerged as powerful reagents for asymmetric, radical&#8208;mediated Smiles rearrangements, imparting excellent levels of relative and absolute stereocontrol in the intra&#8208; and intermolecular translocation of aryl groups. Here, we capitalize on the much more readily available and abundant chiral sulfoxides, which, in combination with radical precursors and alkylating reagents, afford enantioenriched sulfur&#8208;containing molecules via a photocatalytic multicomponent asymmetric sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles rearrangement with retention of &#8220;SO&#8221;. This cascade process involves radical addition, a stereocontrolled 1,5&#8208;aryl migration, and subsequent C&#9472;S bond formation, forging two new C&#9472;C bonds and a C&#9472;S bond in a single step under mild conditions. The resulting enantioenriched sulfur&#8208;containing scaffolds are not only common in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds but also serve as versatile synthetic intermediates, as demonstrated by their efficient derivatization into diverse motifs.

         <title>Modular Assembly of B(III)&#8208;Coordinated Fluorophores with Quantitatively Predictable Photoinduced Electron Transfer for Chemosensing and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the tetrahedral geometry of B(III) centers, we introduce the design of B&#8208;PeT dyes to precisely tailor their electronic energy levels and photophysical properties. A modular multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis was developed to rapidly assemble 75 visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR B(III)&#8208;dyes, facilitating the elucidation and prediction of structure&#8208;PeT activity. The B&#8208;PeT dyes enabled successful ER&#8208;targeted photoactivated imaging and lysosomal pH monitoring.








Abstract
Photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), a foundational mechanism for constructing stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent probes, faces persistent challenges, including the lack of generalizable quantitative models, limited systematic case studies, signal interference, and synthetic complexity. Herein, we propose a boron&#8208;centric PeT molecular engineering strategy that harnesses the unique tetrahedral coordination geometry of B(III) centers. This approach leverages the programmable nature of boron coordination chemistry to precisely tailor dye electronic energy levels and photophysical properties. Using dipyrromethane as a core scaffold and modulating boronic acid coordination with diverse nucleophiles (such as alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids), we developed a modular, multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis platform for efficient assembly of B&#8208;PeT dyes. Extending this strategy to pyrrolyldipyrrin and dipyrrolyldipyrrin scaffolds achieved the synthesis of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) B&#8208;PeT dyes. A library of 75 B(III)&#8208;derivatives was synthesized and characterized to enable systematic elucidation and predictive modeling of structure&#8208;PeT activity relationships, providing mechanistic insights to guide mitigation of PeT signal interference. The engineered B&#8208;PeT probes exhibit superior performance in photoactivated imaging and lysosomal pH sensing, highlighting their translational potential. Our work establishes boron coordination chemistry as a modular toolkit for rational PeT probe design, offering scalable molecular platforms for next&#8208;generation sensors with enhanced functionality and synthetic efficiency.

         <title>A Combined Aptamer Pulldown&#8208;DNAzyme Cleavage Assay for Intact Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid fluorescence and lateral flow assays were developed for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (SA) by combining a DNA aptamer for selective isolation and an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme for detection of MRSA.








Abstract
Accurate and convenient detection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) plays a vital role in determining appropriate antibiotic interventions. Herein, we report the first example combining a DNA aptamer and an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme (RCD) that bind different protein markers for selective preconcentration and detection of MRSA. An aptamer for the penicillin binding protein 2a (PBP2a) was generated by in vitro selection and was coupled to agarose beads to allow rapid pull down of intact MRSA cells from complex samples. A previously reported RCD for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) was then used to detect a second proteinaceous marker within the lysed cells based on a protein&#8208;activated cleavage reaction that was linked to both fluorescence and lateral flow assays, allowing for selective detection of MRSA over methicillin sensitive SA. An optimized LFD assay could detect &#8764;103&#160;cfu mL&#8722;1 of MRSA in either nasal mucus or serum with a total assay time of 1&#160;h using minimal sample processing.

         <title>Highly Efficient Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Polymerization Enabled by Direct Transmetalation with Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The longstanding challenge of competitive protodeboronation side reactions has critically hindered the synthetic utility of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings in polymer science. We herein report an optimized Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling polymerization protocol that enables efficient synthesis of device&#8208;grade conjugated polymers. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a novel pathway involving direct transmetalation of boronic esters plays a pivotal role in the success of the polymerization.








Abstract
The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction plays a pivotal role in the construction of carbon&#8211;carbon bonds, utilizing low&#8208;toxicity and readily available organoboron substrates. However, competitive protodeboronation of arylboronic acids has significantly limited its synthetic applications, particularly in the synthesis of optoelectronic polymer materials. Herein, a novel sulfonium salt&#8208;mediated Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling protocol is developed to synthesize high&#8208;quality &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs). The universality of this method was exemplified by successfully synthesizing twelve CPs with various electrophiles and nucleophiles. Impressively, the synthesized CPs exhibited enhanced optoelectronic properties, e.g., charge carrier mobilities, compared to those synthesized by traditional methods. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that direct transmetalation of boronic esters without prior conversion to more reactive intermediates play a critical role in this protocol, thus avoiding the problematic deboronation associated with unstable boronic acids. This method provides an environmentally benign approach to synthesize device&#8208;quality CPs.

         <title>Identifying the Role of Pt Active Species in CO&#8208;Sensitive Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In photocatalytic H2 evolution, Pt4+ species is identified as the key active species for H2 production when the amount ratio of CO to Pt is low (nCO/nPt&#160;&#8804;&#160;1.3), but the adsorbed CO molecules impede the interaction between H2O and Pt4+ species and prevent the generation of *H species and H2 at a high ratio of nCO/nPt (&gt; 1000). This study sheds light on the generation and transformation of active H species in CO&#8208;participated photocatalytic systems, which is missing in previous works, and is more significant for rationally designing Pt&#8208;based photocatalysts in large&#8208;scale H2 production.








Abstract
Platinum (Pt) has been widely employed in photocatalytic H2 production. However, the influence of CO on proton reduction to H2 over Pt active species remains unknown. Herein, using Pt/Nb2O5 as a model catalyst, the role of Pt active species in CO&#8208;sensitive photocatalytic H2 evolution is evaluated. Our results reveal that Pt4+ species exhibits superior activity in H2 production when the CO&#8208;to&#8208;Pt molar ratio is low (nCO/nPt&#160;&#8804;&#160;1.3), but their photocatalytic performance is suppressed at a high nCO/nPt ratio (&gt;1000). By contrast, increasing the loading amount of Pt suppresses Pt4+ species formation and the low valence state Pt species show inferior activity for H2 production, which is almost unaffected by the nCO/nPt ratio. The CO&#8208;TPD results, in situ FTIR spectra, and DFT calculations indicate that the role of adsorbed CO molecules is to impede the interaction between H2O and Pt4+ species and prevent the generation of *H species for H2 production. Significantly improving the H2 production rate by purging with argon suggests the importance of inhibiting the adsorption of CO on Pt4+ species. This study sheds light on the generation and transformation of active H species in CO&#8208;participated photocatalytic systems, which is missing in previous works, and is more significant for rationally designing Pt&#8208;based photocatalysts in large&#8208;scale H2 production.

         <title>Synthesis and Physical Properties of [n]Cycloparaphenylene Ketone (n&#160;=&#160;6, 7, 8, and 10)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
[n]Cycloparaphenylene ketone 4, [n]CPP&#8208;CO (n&#160;=&#160;6, 7, 8, 10) was synthesized. Because of the elevation of the occupied &#960;&#8208;orbital energies by the CPP units in 4, HOMO in 4 is the conjugated &#960;&#8208;system instead of the n&#8208;orbital. As a result, 4 exhibits photophysical properties that significantly differ from typical ketones; the lowest excited state of 4 is an S1 state with &#960;&#8211;&#960;* character, leading to fluorescing but not phosphorescing.








Abstract
[n]Cycloparaphenylene ketone 4, [n]CPP&#8208;CO, in which a carbonyl group is inserted into [n]CPP framework, with n&#160;=&#160;6, 7, 8, and 10, was synthesized by a coupling reaction between a CPP precursor and a ketone unit, followed by reductive aromatization. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed their M&#246;bius topology and significant molecular strain as characterized by the deviations in bond angles at the carbonyl carbon. The strain was also evidenced by size&#8208;dependent 20&#8211;50 cm&#8722;1 shifts in the carbonyl IR stretching bands. The CPP units in 4 significantly alter the electronic properties, particularly the relative orbital energies. Due to the elevation of the energy level of the occupied &#960;&#8208;orbitals by CPP units, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in 4 is the conjugated &#960;&#8208;system, in contrast to benzophenone, where the HOMO is the non&#8208;bonding n&#8208;orbital. Consequently, the lowest excited state of 4 is the singlet state (S1) with &#960;&#8211;&#960;* character rather than the conventional n&#8211;&#960;* triplet (T1) state. Furthermore, intersystem crossing from the S1 state to the T1 state, which is a characteristic process for typical aromatic ketones, does not occur efficiently. As a result, 4 exhibits unique photophysical properties opposite to those of typical aromatic ketones, such as fluorescing but not phosphorescing. Furthermore, the S1 state of 4 was quenched by molecular oxygen, most likely by the energy exchange mechanism. Optical and electrochemical properties showed a clear dependence on ring size, with smaller rings exhibiting greater strain, lower oxidation potentials, and red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission. These findings highlight the unique interplay between molecular topology, strain, and photophysics in CPP&#8208;based ketones and provide a foundation for designing novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials with tailored excited&#8208;state properties.

A nanoscale confined polymerization (NCP) strategy was employed to prepare a composite GPE comprising of porous COF and linear polymers (PDA@CityU&#8208;43). The PDA@CityU&#8208;43 achieves a high ionic conductivity (6.02&#215;10&#8722;3 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number (0.82), which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Highly improved cycling performance of 6000&#160;h cycling for symmetric cell and up to 96.15% capacity retention after 550 cycles for LFP full&#8208;cell are achieved.








Abstract
Conventional gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) struggle with lithium dendrite growth and long&#8208;term cycling stability due to low ionic conductivity. A nanoconfined polymerization (NCP) strategy was employed to develop a composite GPE (PDA@CityU&#8208;43) comprising porous COF and linear polymers. The crosslinked polymer chains are confined within the nanopores of CityU&#8208;43 along c&#8208;direction, improving polymer distribution and filler&#8208;polymer compatibility. The PDA@CityU&#8208;43 achieves a high ionic conductivity (6.02 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number (0.82), which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Thus, the Li||Li cell can stably operate over 6000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Li||PDA@CityU&#8208;43||LFP demonstrates significantly improved cycling stability at 5C, a reversible capacity of 108 mAh/g after 300 cycles. The Li||PDA@CityU&#8208;43||NCM811 cells with high mass loading (&#8764;5.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) exhibits 72.5% capacity retention after 100 cycles. This NCP strategy offers a new approach to designing advanced GPEs for Li metal batteries.

         <title>Internally BN&#8208;Doped Coronene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first derivatives of internally heteroatom&#8208;doped coronene with two covalent B&#9472;N units embedded on the central axis were synthesized. The B2N2 analogues retain the structure of coronene but exhibit stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, higher electronic coupling, and a narrowed solid&#8208;state bandgap. Driven by the B&#9472;N dipole&#8211;dipole interaction, all B2N2&#8208;coronene derivatives exhibit more ordered assembly with excimer emission in solution, which is absent in coronene. 








Abstract
We present the first synthesis of internally BN&#8208;doped coronenes (B2N2&#8208;C, H&#8208;B2N2&#8208;C, and 2H&#8208;B2N2&#8208;C) with two covalent B&#9472;N units embedded on the central axis of coronene. The B&#9472;N doping leads to unique electronic structures with distinct charge distribution, conjugation, aromaticity, and photophysical properties. The structures were successfully identified by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray scattering. B2N2&#8208;C without sidechains retains the structure of coronene but exhibits stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, higher electronic coupling, and a narrowed solid&#8208;state bandgap. Driven by the B&#9472;N dipole&#8211;dipole interaction, all B2N2&#8208;coronene derivatives exhibit more ordered assembly with excimer emission in solution, which is absent in coronene. Notably, two stable polymorphs emerge in single crystals of 2H&#8208;B2N2&#8208;C with two hexyl chains: a kinetically stable rod phase and a thermodynamically stable plate phase, where variations in processing conditions direct the formation of different phases.

         <title>Automated Iterative N&#9472;C and C&#9472;C Bond Formation</title>

         <dc:description>
Automated iterative assembly of MIDA or TIDA boronate building blocks enables generalized and automated preparation of many different types of small functional molecules in a modular fashion. However, until now, this engine could not leverage nitrogen atoms as iteration handles, excluding molecules rich in N&#9472;C and C&#9472;C bonds. Here, we disclose a new iteration&#8208;enabling group, CbzT, that reversibly attenuates the reactivity of nitrogen atoms and enables generalized catch&#8208;and&#8208;release purification. Leveraging CbzT, we achieve the automated modular synthesis of Imatinib (Gleevec), a widely used drug. This work substantially expands the range of small molecules that can be synthesized using automated block chemistry.








Abstract
Small molecule solutions to many contemporary societal challenges await discovery, but the artisanal and manual process via which this class of chemical matter is typically accessed limits the discovery of new functions. Automated assembly of (N&#8208;methyl iminodiacetic acid) MIDA or (tetramethyl N&#8208;methyl iminodiacetic acid) TIDA boronate building blocks via iterative C&#9472;C bond formation, an approach we call &#8220;block chemistry&#8221;, alternatively enables generalized and automated preparation of many different types of small molecules in a modular fashion. But in its current form, this engine cannot also leverage nitrogen atoms as iteration handles. Here, we disclose a new iteration&#8208;enabling group, CbzT (p&#8208;TIDA boronate&#8208;substituted carboxybenzyl), that reversibly attenuates the reactivity of nitrogen atoms and enables generalized catch&#8208;and&#8208;release purification. CbzT is leveraged to achieve the automated modular synthesis of Imatinib (Gleevec), an archetypical clinically approved kinase inhibitor, in which building blocks are iteratively linked by both N&#9472;C and C&#9472;C bonds. This work substantially expands the types of small molecules that can be iteratively assembled in an automated modular fashion. It also advances the concept of intentionally developing chemistry that machines can do.

         <title>Absolute Asymmetric Synthesis of a Homochiral Polymer from an Achiral Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the absolute asymmetric synthesis of a homochiral polymer from an achiral monomer. Owing to the preservation of symmetry and anisotropy in topochemical reactions, the supramolecular chirality inherent in the crystal packing of achiral monomers can be translated into molecular chirality in the resulting polymer. These findings may provide valuable insights into abiogenesis, particularly into the unresolved question of how the first chiral polymers emerged in the prebiotic world. 








Abstract
A compelling hypothesis for the origin of homochirality that led to the origin of life is that a chiral informational polymer, formed somehow from achiral monomers, biased the early chemical events, leading to the exclusive synthesis of chiral building blocks of life. However, the formation of a chiral polymer from achiral monomers continues to be a mystery. We exploited the ability of achiral molecules to rarely crystallize in chiral space groups to design achiral monomers for topochemical polymerization to obtain chiral polymers. One such achiral monomer synthesized, viz. a tripeptide monomer containing alkene and azide at its termini, crystallized in a chiral space group, forming a conglomerate as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Upon heating at a temperature above 70&#160;&#176;C, each enantiomorphic crystal underwent a regiospecific and stereospecific topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion to give a triazoline&#8208;linked homochiral helical polymer. We characterized several homochiral polymer crystals at atomic resolution either by SCXRD or by 3D electron diffraction.

         <title>Electrochemical Enantioselective Oxidation of Indoles via Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis in Cooperation with H3PO4 in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binary organic&#8211;inorganic acid cooperative catalytic system has been developed to achieve highly enantioselective electrochemical oxidative rearrangement of indoles. The use of electricity as an oxidant in this case showed several advantages including environmental benignity and improved enantiocontrol. A biphasic electrolysis system contributes to the general substrate scope by physically separating the chiral organic acids from the achiral inorganic acids.








Abstract
Disclosed here is the first catalytic enantioselective electrochemical oxidative rearrangement of indoles for the efficient synthesis of highly enantioenriched spirooxindoles. The in&#8208;situ generated HBr from substrate oxidation, known to be detrimental to the reaction itself, was perfectly consumed by cathode reduction. Challenges of this process include the difficulty in maintaining the synergy between substrate oxidation and cathode reduction as well as the general incompatibility of a hydrogen bonding catalytic system with the aqueous acidic media. A monophasic system was initially developed, but with little substrate generality. Further analysis of the mechanism and careful optimization allowed the development of a much more general and robust biphasic system that exhibited multiple advantages over chemical oxidation, including broader scope, less waste, milder conditions, and better enantioselectivity. It is also the first demonstration of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis in cooperation with H3PO4 in acidic aqueous media.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Ammonia Synthesis via Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Using Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Atomic Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism shown in nitrite reductase with dual&#8208;atomic Cu sites, a PCN&#8208;Cu&#8208;DAC catalyst specifically engineered for gram&#8208;scale ammonia production was designed. The Cu dual&#8208;atomic sites facilitate the rapid transfer of *H, thus diminishing the protonation energy barrier of *NO intermediate species and consequently resulting in considerable ammonia production.








Abstract
The potential application prospects of green electricity&#8208;driven electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO&#8323;RR) technology for the production of valuable ammonia have garnered widespread attention. However, designing electrocatalysts with remarkable activity and stability for the NO&#8323;RR to realize gram&#8208;level ammonia production remains a significant hurdle in terms of practical application. In nature, the synergistic effect of the dual&#8208;site copper of nitrite reductase promotes the substrate adsorption and protonation, achieving efficient conversion of nitrite. Herein, enzyme&#8208;inspired Cu dual&#8208;atomic sites are constructed on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN&#8208;Cu&#8208;DAC). Systematic investigations indicate the dual&#8208;atomic Cu sites in the catalyst exhibit stronger proton transfer and synergistic nitrate adsorption interaction, thereby reducing the energy barrier for *NO protonation. Studies have shown that the PCN&#8208;Cu&#8208;DAC catalyst presents a remarkable ammonia (NH&#8323;) yield (467&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 cat. and 102&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and achieves 11&#160;g d&#8722;1 NH&#8323; yield at 6 A of current for 360&#160;h. This work demonstrates the concept of mimicking natural nitrite reductase toward the continuous reduction of nitrate wastewater and promotes the production of NH3.

     alt="Gram-Scale Ammonia Synthesis via Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Using Enzyme-Inspired Dual-Atomic Cu Catalyst"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism shown in nitrite reductase with dual-atomic Cu sites, a PCN-Cu-DAC catalyst specifically engineered for gram-scale ammonia production was designed. The Cu dual-atomic sites facilitate the rapid transfer of *H, thus diminishing the protonation energy barrier of *NO intermediate species and consequently resulting in considerable ammonia production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential application prospects of green electricity-driven electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO&#8323;RR) technology for the production of valuable ammonia have garnered widespread attention. However, designing electrocatalysts with remarkable activity and stability for the NO&#8323;RR to realize gram-level ammonia production remains a significant hurdle in terms of practical application. In nature, the synergistic effect of the dual-site copper of nitrite reductase promotes the substrate adsorption and protonation, achieving efficient conversion of nitrite. Herein, enzyme-inspired Cu dual-atomic sites are constructed on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN-Cu-DAC). Systematic investigations indicate the dual-atomic Cu sites in the catalyst exhibit stronger proton transfer and synergistic nitrate adsorption interaction, thereby reducing the energy barrier for *NO protonation. Studies have shown that the PCN-Cu-DAC catalyst presents a remarkable ammonia (NH&#8323;) yield (467&#160;mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cat. and 102&#160;mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and achieves 11&#160;g d&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; NH&#8323; yield at 6 A of current for 360&#160;h. This work demonstrates the concept of mimicking natural nitrite reductase toward the continuous reduction of nitrate wastewater and promotes the production of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Induced C&#9472;C Cleavage and Site&#8208;Specific Hydrogenation of a Highly Strained Bilayer Spironanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a reduction&#8208;induced ring cleavage with subsequent hydrogenation of a bilayer spironanographene upon treatment with alkali metals. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggested localized spin density on the C&#8208;atom at the central spirocycle upon one&#8208;fold reduction, facilitating a site&#8208;specific hydrogenation. The pronounced gain in aromaticity of the system also favored the formation of the hydrogenated product.








Abstract
The chemical reduction of a bilayer spironanographene, spiro&#8208;NG (C137H120), with Na and K metals in the presence of [2.2.2]cryptand to yield [Na+(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)](C137H121&#8722;) (1) and [K+(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)](C137H121&#8722;) (2), respectively, is reported. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals the formation of a new &#8220;naked&#8221; anion (spiro&#8208;NGH&#8722;), in which spirocyclic ring cleavage and subsequent hydrogenation have occurred. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the generation of the radical anion of the parent nanographene (spiro&#8208;NG&#8226;&#8722;), upon electron acceptance from Na and K metals, induces the cleavage of the strained spirobifluorene core. The resulting spin density localizes on a particular carbon atom, previously attached to the spiranic sp3 carbon atom, facilitating a site&#8208;specific hydrogenation to afford (spiro&#8208;NGH&#8722;). The electrostatic potential map of this anion reveals electron density concentrated at the five&#8208;membered ring of the readily formed indenyl fragment, thus enhancing the aromaticity of the system. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy experiments allowed to follow the in situ reduction and hydrogenation processes in detail.

         <title>Rationally Designed Asymmetric Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu Ligand to Stabilize Active Sites Towards Superior Industrial&#8208;Standard Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu ligand located in PtCu2(111)/CuO(002) heterojunction interface effectively balance the adsorption and dissociation of reaction intermediates at different active sites, and simultaneously prevent the dissolution or agglomeration of Pt and Cu atoms. 








Abstract
Developing efficient and durable Pt&#8208;based catalysts via interface engineering remains a critical yet challenging task for water electrolysis under high&#8208;pH conditions. Herein, we design a unique asymmetric Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu ligand at the PtCu2(111)/CuO(002) heterojunction interface to promote alkaline HER kinetics. This ligand balances the adsorption and desorption of H* on the Pt site by accelerating electron transfer at the interface while enhancing the adsorption of H2O on the Cu site. Moreover, the strong d&#8208;d/sp hybridization and more delocalized d&#8208;DOS located at the Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu ligand enhance the interatomic interactions, which helps alleviate the dissolution and agglomeration of Pt and Cu atoms. As anticipated, the PtCu2/CuO requires ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 10, 14 and 47&#160;mV in, respectively, alkaline, acidic and neutral electrolytes to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Even more surprising is that the PtCu2/CuO||RuO2 dual&#8208;electrode hydrolysis cell can stably operate at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 for more than 500&#160;h in a simulated industrial environment, demonstrating significant potential for industrial applications. This work provides a new paradigm for the design of industrially relevant high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based alkaline hydrogen evolution catalytic materials.

         <title>Development of a Vinylated Cyclic Allene: A Fleeting Strained Diene for the Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain&#8208;promoted Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the vinylated cyclic allene, a highly reactive strained all&#8208;carbon diene, was developed. Activation of the Kobayashi&#8208;type precursor with fluoride ion generated the vinyl cyclic allene, which was trapped by dienophiles to produce decalin derivatives under mild conditions. This method would provide an efficient route to synthesize natural product&#8208;relevant multicyclic skeletons in a convergent fashion.








Abstract
Fleeting molecules possessing strained multiple bonds are important components in organic synthesis due to their ability to undergo various chemical reactions driven by the release of strain energy. Although the use of strained &#960;&#8208;bonds as 2&#960; components, represented by dienophiles in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, has been well studied, &#8220;the strained diene (4&#960; component) approach&#8221; for molecular construction remains underexplored. Herein, we report the design of a vinyl cyclic allene (1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexadiene) as a highly reactive strained diene and the development of its Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. Experimental and computational studies of vinyl cyclic allenes revealed that this diene system undergoes cycloaddition with dienophiles regio&#8208; and stereoselectively under mild reaction conditions. These studies also provide insight into the reactivity and selectivity of the system. The strained diene approach enables the convergent construction of polycyclic molecules through bond disconnections distinct from conventional retrosynthetic analysis, thus offering an efficient strategy for the assembly of functional molecules.

         <title>Controlling the Helicity and Handedness of Polyaromatics with Isobenzofuranophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isobenzofuranophanes are introduced as helical synthons that enable late&#8208;stage helicity induction and control in polyaromatics. This remote tethering approach allows precise control over the handedness and pitch of [5]helicenes via the tether length, inducing significant molecular distortion and affecting chiroptical properties.








Abstract
The extent of helicity in nonplanar polyaromatic materials affects their electronic, optical and chiroptical properties. However, controlling helicity in different systems typically requires different multistep synthetic approaches for each target compound, often with significant complexity, thereby limiting its applicability. Here, we introduce a helical synthon, isobenzofuranophane, with either a short or long tether, which enables late&#8208;stage helicity induction and control in aromatic frameworks. We demonstrate the applicability of this synthon by reacting it with a [5]helicene aryne precursor, where both the handedness and helicene pitch are remotely&#8208;controlled by the tether length, directly affecting the (chiro)optical properties of the helicene. The X&#8208;ray structures support these findings with up to 35&#176; torsion for a single benzene ring, demonstrating the potential of isobenzofuranophane to induce significant curvature to polyaromatic molecules.

However, controlling helicity in different systems typically requires different multistep synthetic approaches for each target compound, often with significant complexity, thereby limiting its applicability. Here, we introduce a helical synthon, isobenzofuranophane, with either a short or long tether, which enables late-stage helicity induction and control in aromatic frameworks. We demonstrate the applicability of this synthon by reacting it with a [5]helicene aryne precursor, where both the handedness and helicene pitch are remotely-controlled by the tether length, directly affecting the (chiro)optical properties of the helicene. The X-ray structures support these findings with up to 35&#176; torsion for a single benzene ring, demonstrating the potential of isobenzofuranophane to induce significant curvature to polyaromatic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbocation&#8208;Based Multiresonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters with Efficient Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbocation&#8208;based multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters featuring small energy gaps of less than 2.20&#160;eV have been developed by doping positively charged carbenium ions as strong electron&#8208;deficient groups and nitrogen as an electron&#8208;rich atom into a polycyclic aromatic skeleton. The resulting solution&#8208;processed OLEDs showed a yellow narrowband emission with an external quantum efficiency of 29.4%.








Abstract
Multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters hold great promise for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, but are fundamentally restricted to wide&#8208;energy&#8208;gap heteropolycyclic systems typically with blue&#8208;to&#8208;green emissions, while their yellow&#8208;to&#8208;red emissions remain a major challenge. Here we propose a strategy for developing MR&#8208;TADF emitters with narrow energy gaps (less than 2.20&#160;eV) by doping positively&#8208;charged carbenium ion (C+) into polycyclic skeletons to create strong short&#8208;range charge transfer with electron&#8208;rich nitrogen atoms, achieving a significant 160&#160;nm emission redshift compared to the benchmark neutral boron&#8208;based counterpart. Furthermore, steric isopropyl groups and bulky tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate counter ions are synergistically integrated to suppress intermolecular aggregation, yielding high solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum efficiencies up to 90%. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the emitters exhibit promising external quantum efficiency of 29.4% with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 0.17&#160;eV, opening the way for development of ion&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters toward efficient long&#8208;wavelength narrowband electroluminescence.

&lt;p&gt;Multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR-TADF) emitters hold great promise for ultrahigh-definition displays, but are fundamentally restricted to wide-energy-gap heteropolycyclic systems typically with blue-to-green emissions, while their yellow-to-red emissions remain a major challenge.

         <title>Trigonal Planar Bis(carbene)Cu(I) Complexes Enable Divergent H2 Activation with H2O for Accelerated Olefin Hydrogenation</title>

Trigonal planar naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene)Cu(I) alkyl, hydroxide, and ethoxide complexes promote a divergent mechanism of H2 activation for the rare catalytic hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes at mild conditions at copper. 








Abstract
CuH&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydrogenation is rare compared to those of carbonyl&#8208;derived substrates. Olefin insertion into Cu&#8211;H to form Cu&#8208;alkyl is ubiquitous; however, subsequent H2 activation remains unknown to our knowledge. Herein, we investigated the transformations of &#946;&#8208;H elimination, H2 cleavage, and catalytic olefin hydrogenation in a series of linear and trigonal planar Cu(I)&#8208;alkyl complexes supported by monodentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and bidentate naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene) ligands, respectively. Contrary to unreactive linear species, trigonal planar variants promote &#946;&#8208;H elimination, hydrogenolysis, and catalytic hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes at mild temperatures and H2 pressure. The rare isolation of a naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene)CuH monomer further affirms two predominant competing pathways for H2 cleavage of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity at Cu(I)&#8208;alkyl or internal electrophilic substitution at Cu(I)&#8208;OH. Employing either isolated or in situ generated Cu(I)&#8208;OH complex, via protonolysis of alkyl precatalyst by adventitious water, significantly accelerated catalysis compared to that operating primarily by the metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity pathway. DFT calculations and energy decomposition analysis on the disparate &#946;&#8208;H elimination reactivity between linear and trigonal planar tert&#8208;butyl complexes and the mechanism of H2 activation at a hydroxide complex, indicate that coordination geometry at Cu(I) and properties of the naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene) ligand are integral to the transformations reported here.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Adapted Active Site Self&#8208;Evolving Reconfiguration Boosting Catalytic Effect on Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active site self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration strategy for spontaneous construction of an adaptive multimolecular activation catalyst such as for acetylene semihydrogenation was presented. This self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration creates cooperative Cu1 and Cu nanocluster (Cun) ensemble sites with a dynamic active configuration, enabling adaptive multisubstrate H2 and acetylene activation.








Abstract
The facile synthesis of highly substrate&#8208;adapted catalysts with dynamic active site adaptability remains a persistent challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, breaking through conventional catalyst preparation route of design&#8211;synthesis&#8211;evaluation iteration, we demonstrate an active site self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration strategy for spontaneous construction of an adaptive multimolecular activation catalyst, such as for acetylene semihydrogenation. Specifically, a metastable Cu single atom (Cu1) precursor as structural seed reconstructs to an exceptional acetylene semihydrogenation catalyst under moderate operational conditions, which undergoes a copper active site reconfiguration employing reactants themselves as inducing medium. This self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration creates cooperative Cu1 and Cu nanocluster (Cun) ensemble sites with a dynamic active configuration, which is unavailable by conventional thermal reduction methodology, for adaptive multisubstrate H2 and acetylene activation. Hence, the resulting catalyst achieves full acetylene conversion with 96% ethylene selectivity and robust durability (&gt;30&#160;h) at a record&#8208;low temperature of 120 &#176;C, superior to reported copper&#8208;based analogues. Such spontaneous active site self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration offers a new possibility for intelligent catalyst engineering.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Electron Donation at the Sulfoximidoyl Nitrogen Atom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;based evidence for a strong positive mesomeric effect (+M&#8208;effect) of the sulfoximidoyl group at N is presented. Our findings contrast with common characterizations of the sulfoximidoyl group as an exclusively electron&#8208;withdrawing moiety. The implications for reactivity are discussed, and it is demonstrated that the +M&#8208;effect explains experimental observations in the field of sulfoximine chemistry.








Abstract
Knowledge of the physicochemical properties and the reactivity of functional groups is invaluable in organic chemistry. Although substantial understanding of properties/reactivities exists for standard functional groups, moieties which have entered the chemist's toolbox more recently are often not as well characterized. Sulfoximines constitute such a class of recently strongly promoted compounds, which nowadays have emerged as relevant molecules in an industrial context and in academic research. However, theoretical studies on the properties of the sulfoximidoyl group remain sparse. The aim of the present work was to investigate the interactions of the sulfoximidoyl nitrogen lone pairs with adjacent &#960;&#8208;acceptor orbitals. Density functional theory&#8208;based (DFT&#8208;based) methods were employed throughout the investigation to quantify the strength of these interactions and to characterize their influence on the properties/reactivities of N&#8208;functionalized sulfoximines. Although sulfoximines are commonly characterized as electron&#8208;withdrawing, our analysis suggests a strong positive mesomeric effect of the sulfoximidoyl group at nitrogen. This effect increases the basicity and nucleophilicity of conjugated substituents at the sulfoximidoyl nitrogen atom.

         <title>Desolvation&#8208;Induced Network Reformation and Cracking in the Single Crystals of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Composed of Tetraazaanthraquinone and Anthraquinone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two solvated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) based on tetraazaanthraquinone and anthraquinone were found to undergo quasi single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations through hydrogen&#8208;bond cleavage and re&#8208;formation. These transformations induced crystal crack propagations, and molecular&#8208;level correlations between the structural transformations and crack propagations were proposed for both HOFs.








Abstract
A molecular&#8208;level understanding of how structural transformations induce morphological changes in organic crystals is essential for developing flexible crystalline materials. Herein, we report that two solvated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) undergo structural transformations, giving rise to crystal crack propagation in the directions corresponding to their molecular displacements. The HOFs are composed of the tetracarboxylic acids, 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(5,10&#8208;dioxo&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydropyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,7,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzoic acid (TAAQ) and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(9,10&#8208;dioxo&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene&#8208;2,3,6,7&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzoic acid (AQ), incorporating tetraazaanthraquinone and anthraquinone cores, respectively. Although TAAQ and AQ have closely similar molecular geometries, their HOFs have entirely different hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. In both HOFs, we found that specific directional hydrogen bonds cleaved, and new hydrogen bonds re&#8208;formed, resulting in quasi single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations. The direction of molecular displacement and crystal cell shrinkage were aligned parallel to the crack propagation. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying micro&#8211;macro property correlations induced by hydrogen&#8208;bond cleavage and re&#8208;formation.

         <title>Chlorine Radical&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic C&#9472;C Coupling of Methanol to Ethylene Glycol with Near&#8208;Unity Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>

A Z&#8208;scheme ZnIn2S4/TiO2&#8208;Cl photocatalyst pioneers selective methanol C&#9472;H bond activation under mild conditions, achieving 96.7% ethylene glycol selectivity. By leveraging photogenerated holes to cycle Cl&#8722;/Cl&#8226;, the system drives hydrogen abstraction for C&#9472;H cleavage and suppresses overoxidation, steering methanol valorization from traditional C1 pathways to sustainable C2 chemistry.








Abstract
The selective activation of inert C&#9472;H bonds in methanol under mild conditions to synthesize high&#8208;value C2 products remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the competing high reactivity of O&#9472;H bonds. Herein, we pioneer a chlorine radical&#8208;mediated strategy to redirect the photocatalytic reaction pathway for methanol conversion toward ethylene glycol (EG). Efficient C&#9472;H bond activation is achieved by constructing a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst (ZnIn2S4/TiO2&#8208;Cl) composed of chlorinated TiO2 (TiO2&#8208;Cl) and ZnIn2S4 with efficient charge separation. Photogenerated holes in this system preferentially oxidize surface&#8208;adsorbed Cl&#8722; to chlorine radicals (Cl&#8226;). These radicals drive a thermodynamically favorable hydrogen atom transfer via hydrogen abstraction, cleaving the C&#9472;H bond of methanol to form hydroxymethyl radicals (&#8226;CH2OH). Subsequent C&#9472;C coupling of &#8226;CH2OH intermediates, synergistically combined with a self&#8208;sustaining Cl&#8722;/Cl&#8226; cycle, produces EG with exceptional selectivity (96.7%) and yield (21.6&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) while suppressing overoxidation. In contrast, nonchlorinated catalysts predominantly utilize photogenerated holes for O&#9472;H bond cleavage under identical conditions, yielding only C1 products (HCHO, HCOOH). This work not only establishes a solar&#8208;driven approach for methanol valorization but also advances mechanistic insights into radical&#8208;mediated pathway control in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Electronic Structure Modulation of Nb2O5 by Ru Single Atoms Enabling Efficient Hydrogen Storage of Magnesium Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer and transport capacities of catalyst were improved by modulating the electronic structure, thereby significantly reducing the desorption and adsorption temperature of MgH2, enhancing the kinetics, and improving the cyclic stability. This provides a new direction for the design of efficient catalysts for hydrogen storage materials.








Abstract
Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage material due to its high capacity and low cost, but its high dehydrogenation temperature and poor kinetic limit its applications. Although catalytic modification of MgH2 has been extensively studied, existing efforts focus on optimizing hydrogen transfer, with limited exploration of electron transfer and transport. This study investigated the enhancement of electron transfer and transport rates during MgH2 de/hydrogenation by introducing a single&#8208;atom catalyst composed of Ru single atoms on a Nb2O5 substrate. The Ru0.028@Nb2O5 single&#8208;atom catalyst reduced the peak dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2 from 429&#176;C to 214&#160;&#176;C, and the activation energies for de/hydrogenation were reduced by 53.7% and 83.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the 15&#160;wt.%&#8208;Ru0.028@Nb2O5&#8208;MgH2 composite maintained 97.4% capacity after 100 cycles. Based on excellent performance and theoretical calculations, it was demonstrated that the electronic structure modulation of Nb2O5 by Ru single atoms enhanced the electron transfer and transport capacities, and the synergistic effects of single&#8208;atom Ru (dominant role), multivalent Nb, and oxygen vacancies resulted in remarkable catalytic activity. This study offers a new strategy for improving electron transfer and transport by modulating the electronic structure of catalysts, thereby increasing catalytic activity during the solid&#8208;state pyrolysis reaction of hydrogen storage materials.

         <title>SPLICEIT Fluorescent Sensor for Integrating Dopamine Release with Cellular Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Single&#8208;chain protein&#8208;based ligand indication through a chimerically&#8208;engineered integrator tool&#8221; (SPLICEIT) is a G&#8208;protein coupled receptor&#8208;based sensor design that leaves a permanent fluorescent mark. We show dopamine detection in primary cultured neurons with a fourfold signal increase normalized to an mCherry (mCh) marker. The SPLICEIT design is generalizable and paves the way for further studies into neuromodulator release across the brain.








Abstract
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter essential for motor control, reward processing, and motivation through G&#8208;protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Recent GPCR&#8208;based real&#8208;time sensors allow for optical monitoring of dopamine release in behaving animals. However, there is still a need for high resolution mapping of dopamine release across large mouse brain volume for systemic studies. To fill this need, we have developed a new chimeric GPCR&#8208;based sensor to detect dopamine with a permanent green fluorescent mark through a combination of computational modeling and rational design. This new sensor, named &#8220;Single&#8208;chain Protein&#8208;based Ligand Indication through a Chimerically&#8208;Engineered Integrator Tool&#8221; (SPLICEIT), detects dopamine at cellular&#8208;resolution with high specificity and a fourfold signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. We also developed a version of SPLICEIT whose signal can be normalized for varying sensor expression in cell culture and in vivo. This paves the way for further studies into dopamine release across the brain and enables the possibility of whole&#8208;brain dopamine mapping.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Persistent Radicals Catalyze Redox&#8208;Neutral C&#9472;C Bond Forming Reactions</title>

Kuhn verdazyls, discovered over 60 years ago, are shown as effective catalysts for the first time. Their tunable redox properties enable organocatalytic redox&#8208;neutral C&#9472;H arylation and C&#9472;H trifluoromethylation reactions without light activation. In these reactions, verdazyl radicals mimic transition metals and photoredox catalysts in emulating catalytic single&#8208;electron shuttling. The reactions are practical and require low catalyst loadings.








Abstract
We report that nitrogen&#8208;centered persistent radicals, Kuhn verdazyls, are effective, tunable ground&#8208;state redox organocatalysts for single electron transfer (SET)&#8208;initiated radical transformations. Verdazyls uniquely emulate catalytic single&#8208;electron shuttling, a hallmark of redox catalysis, without light or external stimuli. They enable redox&#8208;neutral C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming reactions, such as C&#9472;H arylation and C&#9472;H trifluoromethylation, typically driven by transition metals, photoredox catalysts, or mechanoredox mediators, while avoiding the self&#8208;inhibition that limits organic super electron donors and nitroxides in such applications.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Mn&#8208;based Catalyst for Durable Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction in Acid at High Current Densities</title>

Diatomic Mn catalyst with high&#8208;spin MnII centers unlock 2e&#8722; ORR pathway and exhibit outstanding stability (240&#160;h at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) for H2O2 electrosynthesis under acidic conditions.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 by two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) often shows limited stability at high current densities in acidic media. Mn&#8208;based catalysts have been demonstrated highly stable for four&#8208;electron ORR thanks to their intrinsically low rate constant for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, their activity toward acidic 2e&#8722; ORR remains low because of too strong adsorption to *OOH. Here, we report a diatomic Mn catalyst with high&#8208;spin MnII centers to enable high onset potential (0.69&#160;V), high selectivity (&gt;90%), and outstanding stability (240&#160;h under 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) toward H2O2 electrosynthesis in acid. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopies reveal that the diatomic Mn sites have downshifted d&#8208;band center and thus weakened adsorption strength for *OOH. Moreover, the inertia of the MnII sites toward the troublesome Fenton&#8208;like reactions leads to the long&#8208;term stability at high current densities. We further demonstrate the functionalization of waste polyethylene (PE) using the high&#8208;concentration H2O2 as produced, which provides a sustainable route toward on&#8208;site upcycling of plastic waste.

         <title>Modular Synchronous Synthesis of Amides and &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides Realized by Matching Electrolysis&#8208;Paired Tandems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing a metalloenzyme&#8208;like bifunctional molecular&#8208;based electrocatalyst, electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem offers a strategic approach to advancing multifunctional synthesis that integrates environmental management, renewable energy optimization, and value&#8208;added chemical production. 








Abstract
Feasible electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem synthesis represents an elaborately organized and high&#8208;efficiency strategy balancing energy consumption and value&#8208;added synthesis. Herein, we developed an exotic electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem synthesis system driven by a metalloenzyme&#8208;like bifunctional single&#8208;molecular heterostructure catalyst (MimNiPc/CNT), which enables the modular synchronous synthesis of amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides through cathodic CO&#8208;relayed aminocarbonylation and anodic iodine (I2)&#8208;mediated keto&#8208;amidation tandem reactions, respectively. Notably, the established MimNiPc/CNT is not only effective for parallel electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem reactions with various substrates but also adaptable for both divergent and sequential electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem reactions, producing value&#8208;added amide and &#945;&#8208;ketoamide compounds with isolated yields up to &#8764;90%. Detailed isotope labeling and mass spectrometry tracking experiments meticulously unveiled the reaction mechanisms, the processes at both electrodes can be refined into sequential electrocatalysis and chemocatalysis steps. Our work also demonstrates the flexibility and scalability of this &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; synthetic protocol, providing an experimental reference for precise synthesis.

         <title>Efficient Harvesting of Triplet Excitons via a T1&#8208;Blocked TADF Mechanism in Series MOFs for Optimal X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>

The discovery of a T1&#8208;blocked TADF mechanism within an AIE&#8208;active molecule not only broadens the scope of available TADF materials but also pioneers the incorporation of the TADF effect in metal&#8208;organic frameworks.








Abstract
Scintillators play vital roles in fields such as medical imaging, high&#8208;energy physics, astronomy, and radiation monitoring. Their operational principle, rooted in the excitation of high&#8208;energy radiation, underscores that luminescence efficiency in scintillators is fundamentally limited by their capacity to harness triplet excitons. In this context, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules present a promising avenue, enabling the efficient utilization of triplet excitons through thermally activated up&#8208;conversion, thereby advancing the development of superior scintillators. Our investigation reveals a T1&#8208;blocked TADF mechanism in H4TCPE, where efficient singlet&#8208;triplet exciton transfer arises from the minimized S1&#8208;T2 energy gap (0.18&#160;eV). Unlike conventional TADF molecules, H4TCPE features carboxylic acid groups that enable heavy metal coordination to enhance X&#8208;ray attenuation. Using tetravalent metals (Zr, Hf, and Th) as nodes and H4TCPE as linkers, we fabricated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that synergize H4TCPE's TADF properties with metal&#8208;enhanced radiation absorption. The resulting MOFs show X&#8208;ray detection and imaging performances superior to pure H4TCPE (20.0 lp mm&#8722;1 and 1.15 &#181;Gy s&#8722;1 for Th&#8208;TCPE vs. &lt;14.3 lp mm&#8722;1 and 5.01 &#181;Gy s&#8722;1 for H4TCPE), with efficacy correlating to metal atomic number. This work not only broadens TADF molecular diversity through a new energy transfer mechanism and pioneers TADF&#8208;MOF integration for advanced radiation detection.

The integrated tandem&#8208;structured ISO&#160;+&#160;Co@CNF separator is designed to enable dual&#8208;enhanced stable interfaces in high&#8208;capacity AZIBs. The anode&#8208;side ISO layer works based on the buffer&#8208;release&#8208;repair mechanism, simultaneously neutralizing OH&#8722; from HER and dynamically releasing soluble indium species to repair interface environment. Meanwhile, the cathode&#8208;side Co@CNF layer effectively anchors polyiodide and catalyzes conversion kinetics. Consequently, zinc&#8211;iodine batteries with the ISO&#160;+&#160;Co@CNF separator achieve a high areal capacity of 2.97 mAh cm&#8722;2 and remarkable cycling stability over 20&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (AZIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies due to their inherent safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. However, unstable interfacial chemistry manifested as polyiodide formation and accumulation at the cathode, alongside dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the anode results in capacity loss. Moreover, polyiodide migration toward the anode further triggers severe Zn corrosion, exacerbating interfacial instability. Herein, we design an integrated tandem&#8208;structured separator comprising an In2O3&#8208;SiO2 (ISO) layer with a buffer&#8208;release&#8208;repair mechanism and a polyiodide adsorption&#8211;catalysis layer featuring Co nanoparticles&#8208;encapsulated carbon nanofiber (Co@CNF) to achieve dual&#8208;enhanced stable interfaces. Specifically, amphoteric In2O3 within the ISO layer effectively neutralizes OH&#8315; generated by localized HER, concurrently releasing soluble indium species. These indium species subsequently electrodeposit to form zincophilic and HER&#8208;inhibiting sites on the affected regions, restoring interfacial environment and mitigating Zn anode degradation. Meanwhile, the Co@CNF layer anchors polyiodides and significantly catalyzes conversion kinetics, suppressing the shuttle effect and preventing polyiodide&#8208;induced anode corrosion. Benefiting from the synergistic stabilization of both electrode interfaces, the as&#8208;fabricated Zn||ISO&#160;+&#160;Co@CNF||I2 full cells achieve a high areal capacity of 2.97 mAh cm&#8722;2 and remarkable cycling stability over 20&#160;000 cycles. This work provides valuable insights into designing functional separators for practical AZIBs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Amphiphilic Antimicrobial Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely non&#8208;amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers (APs) that possess significant bioactivity and excellent selectivity are presented. The importance of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions is highlighted by segregation of APs on bacterial membrane models and bacteria, a behavior absent in amphiphilic polymers. A supramolecular multivalence is proposed that leads to increased membrane activity without the necessity for hydrophobicity.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a severe threat to modern healthcare and must be addressed to prevent millions of deaths in the coming decades. Antimicrobial polymers (APs) do not provoke resistance and are promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Classic APs possess an amphiphilic structure (cationic and hydrophobic). Herein, we question the necessity of amphiphilicity in APs and find that hydrophobicity is not an essential quality in these polymers. Combining cationic monomers with hydrophilic subunits containing hydrogen bond donors results in excellent antibacterial activity and concurrently low unspecific toxicity. Non&#8208;amphiphilic APs have the unique ability to cluster in isolated membrane regions, creating a supramolecular multivalence that enhances their membrane activity and aggregates bacterial cells. This effect, which only unfolds in the absence of hydrophobicity, opens new possibilities in the design of antimicrobial materials.

         <title>Nature of Anti&#8208;Dissipative High&#8208;Energy Excited States in Quaterpyridine&#8208;Bridged Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon photoexcitation, meta&#8208;connected quaterpyridine&#8208;bridged Ru complexes undergo fast inter&#8208;ligand electron transfer like typical chromophores, but unusually slow intra&#8208;ligand electron transfer within bridge&#8208;centered MLCT states. The energy saved was exploited for photoreductions and photooxidations with model electron donors and acceptors, respectively. Design guidelines involving ancillary&#8208;ligand substitution and bridge topology were derived.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy excited states with slow rates for internal conversion to the lowest&#8208;energy excited state are prone to be intercepted before they dissipate energy to the medium. In a previous report, oligomeric Ru(II) photosensitizers bearing a bridging 2,2&#8242;:5&#8242;,3&#8243;:6&#8243;,2&#8244;&#8211;quaterpyridine scaffold showed promising anti&#8208;dissipative behavior in photoinduced electron transfer reactivity. In here, a range of electron accepting and electron donating substituents were incorporated on the ancillary 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands to modulate the excited&#8208;state dynamics. This allowed to unambiguously identify the nature of high&#8208;energy excited states and derive design guidelines for the achievement of anti&#8208;dissipative behavior in oligomeric Ru(II) polypyridines relevant for solar fuels production and photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Constructing Supported Metallic Pt Single Atoms in Molten NaAlCl4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of molten salts as reaction media to construct metallic platinum (Pt&#8304;) single atoms (SAs) anchored on CeO2. The molten NaAlCl4 weakens Pt&#9472;O and Ce&#9472;O bonds, and enables the formation of interfacial Pt&#9472;Ce bonds to stabilize isolated Pt&#8304; atoms. This work provides a novel strategy for designing metallic SAs and advancing supported metal catalysts.








Abstract
Supported platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered widespread attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their theoretical 100% atomic utilization efficiency. Isolated metal atoms usually exhibit high oxidation states rather than metallic states owing to the coordination with nonmetal atoms in the supports. Despite recent advances in modulating the coordination environments of SACs, achieving metallic state&#8208;dominated SACs remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a new configuration of metallic Pt single atoms (Pt0) anchored on the CeO2 support is constructed by introducing a localized Pt&#8211;Ce metal&#8211;metal coordination at the interface in a molten NaAlCl4 environment. The extensive Pt&#9472;Ce bonding and electron transfer from the support to the Pt atoms ensure the metallic nature of isolated Pt atoms. This work opens up a new avenue for constructing metallic single atoms and enriches the SACs chemistry.

         <title>Overcoming Photochemical Limitations in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Low&#8208;Energy Light Driven Selective 1O2 Generation Achieved by Donor&#8211;Acceptor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate for the first time that a novel donor&#8211;acceptor strategy in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been developed to regulate the localized electronic state structures for efficient and selective 1O2 generation under low&#8208;energy light. The engineered COF selectively produced 1O2 under red light through a coupled charge transfer mechanism and exhibited exceptional photocatalytic performance in 1O2 driven advanced oxidation, achieving gram&#8208;scale production under red light, even when operating through translucent barriers.








Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a crucial role in various photocatalytic oxidation reactions; however, achieving high&#8208;efficiency and selective 1O2 production under low&#8208;energy light remains a challenge. Herein, we present a novel donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) strategy in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate the localized electronic state structures for efficient and selective 1O2 generation under low&#8208;energy light. Notably, the rationally incorporation of the negatively charged carbonyl groups into the basal plane of the COF strengthens the D&#8211;A interaction, improves light harvesting in the lower&#8208;energy region, and facilitates highly selective 1O2 generation through a coupled charge&#8208;transfer mechanism. As a result, the engineered COF demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic performance in 1O2 driven advanced oxidation, enabling gram&#8208;scale production under red light, even when operating through translucent barriers. A mechanistic study revealed that the distinct 1O2 production under low&#8208;energy light is attributed to the spatially locked structure and charge localization around active centers. These features enhance strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction, promote effective charge separation and transport properties, and ultimately facilitate the activation of O2 to 1O2.

     alt="Overcoming Photochemical Limitations in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Low-Energy Light Driven Selective 1O2 Generation Achieved by Donor&#8211;Acceptor Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate for the first time that a novel donor&#8211;acceptor strategy in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been developed to regulate the localized electronic state structures for efficient and selective &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation under low-energy light. The engineered COF selectively produced &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under red light through a coupled charge transfer mechanism and exhibited exceptional photocatalytic performance in &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; driven advanced oxidation, achieving gram-scale production under red light, even when operating through translucent barriers.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) plays a crucial role in various photocatalytic oxidation reactions; however, achieving high-efficiency and selective &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production under low-energy light remains a challenge. Herein, we present a novel donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) strategy in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate the localized electronic state structures for efficient and selective &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation under low-energy light. Notably, the rationally incorporation of the negatively charged carbonyl groups into the basal plane of the COF strengthens the D&#8211;A interaction, improves light harvesting in the lower-energy region, and facilitates highly selective &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation through a coupled charge-transfer mechanism. As a result, the engineered COF demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic performance in &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; driven advanced oxidation, enabling gram-scale production under red light, even when operating through translucent barriers. A mechanistic study revealed that the distinct &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production under low-energy light is attributed to the spatially locked structure and charge localization around active centers. These features enhance strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction, promote effective charge separation and transport properties, and ultimately facilitate the activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This study paves the way for the development of high-performance COF photocatalysts for low-energy light-driven reactive oxygen species generation in advanced oxidation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational Engineering of Solvent Molecules for High&#8208;Voltage and Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>

This study proposes a conformation engineering strategy with unique chair conformation and perfluorinated substitution, thus realizing the dual advantages of low&#8208;polar solvation environments and anion&#8208;rich solvent sheaths to effectively reduce the dissolution energy and enhance the interfacial stability of Li+ solvation energy and interfacial stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are crucial for overcoming electric vehicle range and charging limitations. However, conventional carbonate electrolytes face intrinsic limitations in simultaneously achieving compatibility with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and lithium metal anodes. These limitations arise from sluggish Li+ transport kinetics and parasitic side reactions, both largely driven by excessive Li+ solvation energy inherent to carbonates. To address these challenges, we propose a conformational engineering strategy of fluorinated solvent molecules by developing a 2,2,3,3,4,4&#8208;hexafluoropentanedioic&#183;anhydride (HFPA)&#8208;derived electrolyte (HFPE). The chair conformation of HFPA synergizes with its high F/C ratio to establish a low&#8208;polarity solvation environment, effectively reducing desolvation energy barriers. In addition, the HFPA&#8208;induced ligand preference for anion aggregation contributes to the formation of anion&#8208;rich dissolved sheaths while stabilizing the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases. The engineered HFPE demonstrates accelerated interfacial ion transport kinetics with an enhanced Li+ transference number of 0.64. When paired with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes under stringent operating conditions (4.5&#160;V cut&#8208;off voltage, 10 C&#8208;rate), HFPE&#8208;enabled cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability. Notably, industrial&#8208;scale 5.6 Ah lithium metal pouch cells employing HFPE maintain stable operation at 4.5&#160;V, underscoring the practical viability of this conformation modulation approach. This work establishes a paradigm&#8208;shifting strategy for next&#8208;generation electrolyte design in practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Dictating Zn2+ Transport Kinetics via Versatile Ionic Covalent Organic Framework for Robust Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 33, August 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;crystallinity ionic covalent organic framework membrane has been directly grown on Zn foil in a scalable manner. With the help of the guanidinium moiety to immobilize water molecules and the charged framework to manage coulombic interactions, durable Zn anodes could be realized by suppressing side reactions and stabilizing ion transport.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a promising platform in regulating ion transport and stabilizing electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces owing to their tailorable porosity and versatile moiety. Compared to widely employed neutral COFs, ionic COFs (iCOFs) harness strong electrostatic interactions to selectively interact with target ions, thereby helping accelerate ion&#8208;pair dissociation. Furthermore, the charged backbones of iCOFs induce interlayer electrostatic repulsion, driving spontaneous exfoliation and hence promoting ion transport kinetics. Capitalizing upon these advantages, we in situ engineer a low&#8208;crystallinity iCOF interfacial membrane over Zn anode. The guanidinium moieties within the framework immobilize water molecules through H&#8208;bond interactions, effectively suppressing parasitic side reactions. Concurrently, coulombic interactions between the positively charged backbone and SO42&#8722; facilitate Zn2+ dissociation, enabling stable ion transport and uniform Zn deposition. Benefiting from the improved electrochemical stability of modified Zn anode, the as&#8208;assembled Zn metal pouch cell delivers a reversible capacity of &#8764;0.35 Ah g&#8722;1 with a 98.72% capacity retention over prolonged cycling. This work establishes a paradigm for leveraging iCOFs to regulate Zn2+ transport kinetics toward next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>Dual Co sites in n&#8208;n type heterojunction enable selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C n&#8208;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12 V (vs. RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#8208;hour continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#8208;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#8208;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst, containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities, to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>SmI2&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Housane Ketones and Alkenes in an Approach to Norbornanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling strategies involving strain&#8208;release have gained significant recent attention for the construction of complex molecular frameworks, particularly in the context of preparing bioisosteres for medicinal chemistry. While the reactivity of cyclopropanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been extensively studied, higher homologues are emerging as valuable substrates for synthesis. For example, methods for the fragmentation and coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones show promise, but are currently limited in substrate scope. Here, we describe a mild, atom&#8208;economical, samarium diiodide (SmI2) catalyzed fragmentation and coupling of alkyl and aryl housane ketones with alkenes that grants access to functionalized norbornane structural motifs, not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches, and with considerable potential for further manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis through d&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by Finite&#8208;Different&#8208;Time&#8208;Domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropyl Diboronates via 1,2&#8208;Boronate Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of polysubstituted cyclopropanes has garnered considerable attention in the field of synthetic chemistry in recent years. The introduction of boron groups into cyclopropane structures enables efficient functional modification of cyclopropane frameworks through downstream derivatization of carbon&#8208;boron bonds. Herein, we report an efficient method for the rapid construction of cyclopropyl diboronates from&#160;gem&#8208;bis(boronates) and thianthrenium (TT) salts. This transformation proceeds through a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement of&#160;tetra&#8208;coordinated boron species, delivering 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropane diboronates in high efficiency. Subsequent borate derivatization provides access to highly diastereoselective polysubstituted cyclopropanes. This method offers a scalable and stereocontrolled approach to cyclopropane synthesis and functional diversification, expanding opportunities for the design of complex cyclopropyl architectures in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Indolocarbazole&#8208;Bridged Multiple Resonance Emitter through Steric Pre&#8208;Substitution for Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE over 40%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric pre&#8208;substitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W&#8208;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2 and 5,000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively. This work establishes a pre&#8208;substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.</dc:description>

Here, a steric pre-substitution strategy is devised using tert-butylphenyl-functionalized indolo[3,2-b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora-Friedel-Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W-1. The efficiency roll-off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m-2 and 5,000 cd m-2, respectively. This work establishes a pre-substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid-state emission for high-performance MR emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Strategies Applied to the Late&#8208;Stage Modifications of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review explores the potential of mechanochemistry in the late&#8208;stage modification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), offering a comprehensive analysis of methods designed to transform structurally complex molecular scaffolds. By examining the scope, efficiency, and mechanistic aspects of these approaches, the review highlights protocols capable of effectively modifying structurally complex molecular scaffolds. To further assist researchers, we provide a detailed table summarizing the discussed APIs, their respective modifications, and any necessary pre&#8208;functionalizations. This resource should provide a practical guide for selecting suitable substrates to evaluate the pharmaceutical relevance of existing and novel (mechano)chemical methods.</dc:description>
