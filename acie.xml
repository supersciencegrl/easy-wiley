         <title>Manipulating Selective Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Electron Transfer to Achieve Multi&#8208;Phase Transitions in an Asymmetric [Fe2Co]&#8208;Assembled Mixed&#8208;Valence Chain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulation of multi&#8208;functions in molecular materials is promising for future switching and memory devices, although is currently difficult. Herein, we assembled the asymmetric {Fe2Co} unit into a cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed&#8208;valence chain {[(Tp)Fe(CN)3]2Co(BIT)}&#183;2CH3OH (1) (Tp = hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate and BIT = 3,4&#8211;bis&#8211;(1H&#8211;imidazol&#8211;1&#8211;yl)thiophen), which showed reversible multi&#8208;phase transitions accompanied by the photo&#8208;switchable single&#8208;chain magnet property and dielectric anomalies. Variable temperature X&#8208;ray structural studies revealed thermo&#8208;and photo&#8208;induced selective electron transfer (ET) between the Co and one of the Fe ions. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility studies revealed that  1  displayed on and off of the single&#8208;chain magnet behavior by alternating 946&#8208;nm and 532&#8208;nm light irradiations. A substantial anomaly in dielectric constant was discovered during the electron transfer process, which is uncommon in similar ET complexes. These findings illustrate that  1  provided a new platform for multi&#8208;phase transitions and multi&#8208;switches adjusted by selective metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal ET.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Tuning Induced d&#8208;Band Center Modulation on Co&#8208;based Spinel Oxide for Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomic substitutions at the tetrahedral site (A Td ) could theoretically achieve an efficient optimization of the charge at the octahedral site (B Oh ) through the A Td &#8208;O&#8208;B Oh  interactions in the spinel oxides (AB2O4). However, the precise control and adjustment of the spinel oxides are still challenging owing to the complexity of their crystal structure. In this work, we demonstrate a simple solvent method to tailor the structures of spinel oxides and further use the spinel oxide composites (ACo2O4/NCNTs, A = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) for oxygen electrocatalysis. And the optimized MnCo2O4/NCNTs exhibit high activity and excellent durability for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Remarkably, the rechargeable liquid Zn&#8211;air battery equipped the MnCo2O4/NCNTs cathode affords a specific capacity of 827 mAh gZn&#8208;1 with high power density of 74.63 mW cm&#8208;2 and no voltage degradation after 300 cycles at a high charging&#8208;discharging rate (5 mA cm&#8208;2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the substitution could regulate the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and thereby lead to the electronic structure modulated accompanied with the movement of d&#8208;band center. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites interact through the Mn&#8722;O&#8722;Co, the Co3+ Oh  of MnCo2O4 with the optimal charge structure allows more suitable binding interaction between the active center and the oxygenated species, resulting in superior oxygen electrocatalytic performance. This work not only proves the influence of the charge modulation mechanism on the oxygen catalysis process but also provides novel strategies for the subsequent design of other oxygen catalysis materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Liquid Crystalline Networks with Hydrogel&#8208;Like Actuation and Reconfigurable Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A porous liquid crystalline network (LCN), prepared using a template method, was found to exhibit peculiar actuation functions. The creation of porosity makes the initially hydrophobic LCN behave like a hydrogel, capable of absorbing a large volume of water (up to ten times the sample size of LCN). When the amount of absorbed water is relatively small (about 100% swelling ratio), the porous LCN displays anisotropic swelling in water and, in the same time, the retained uniaxial alignment of mesogens ensures thermally induced shape change associated with LC&#8208;isotropic phase transition. Combining the characteristic actuation mechanisms of LCN (order&#8208;disorder transition of mesogens) and hydrogel (water absorption), such porous LCN can be explored for versatile stimuli&#8208;triggered shape transformations. Moreover, the porosity enables loading/removal/reloading of functional fillers such as ionic liquid, photothermal dye and fluorophore, which imparts a same porous LCN actuator with reconfigurable functions such as ionic conductivity, light&#8208;driven locomotion, and emissive color.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Cell Tagging for Spatially Resolved Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OpTAG (optical cell tagging) is a novel chemical platform for attaching functional tags onto cell surfaces in a spatially resolved manner. In combination with cell sorting and single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq), OpTAG&#8208;seq enables spatially resolved scRNA&#8208;seq.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for profiling gene expression of distinct cell populations at the single&#8208;cell level. However, the information of the positions of cells within the multicellular samples is missing in scRNA&#8208;seq datasets. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop OpTAG (optical cell tagging) as a new chemical platform for attaching functional tags onto cell surfaces in a spatially resolved manner. With OpTAG, we establish OpTAG&#8208;seq, which enables spatially resolved scRNA&#8208;seq. We apply OpTAG&#8208;seq to investigate the spatially defined transcriptional program in migrating cancer cells and identified a list of genes that are potential regulators for cancer cell migration and invasion. OpTAG&#8208;seq provides a convenient method for mapping cellular heterogeneity with spatial information within multicellular biological systems.

         <title>Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;Coordinated Perovskite Solar Cell with Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Exceeding 1.23&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyacrylonitrile which has C&#8801;N groups was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in perovskite films. The coordination of C&#8801;N with the lead cation was much stronger than that of the normally used C=O group. It could also reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. The device efficiency was improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;%, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage enhanced from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V.







Abstract
In solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite films, halide&#8208;anion related defects including halide vacancies and interstitial defects can easily form at the surfaces and grain boundaries. The uncoordinated lead cations produce defect levels within the band gap, and the excess iodides disturb the interfacial carrier transport. Thus these defects lead to severe nonradiative recombination, hysteresis, and large energy loss in the device. Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in the perovskite films. The coordinating ability of cyano group was found to be stronger than that of the normally used carbonyl groups, and the strong coordination could reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. With the PAN perovskite film, the device efficiency improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;% and the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V, the ion migration activation energy increased, and operational stability improved.

         <title>Regeneration of Phytochemicals by Structure&#8208;Driven Organization of Microbial Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable access to hypericin, a phytochemical with promising medicinal properties but low natural abundance, a strategy involving structure&#8208;based modification and organization of the microbial biosynthetic steps was developed without knowing its biosynthetic pathway in native plants. The designed consecutive reactions (see scheme) occurred in repurposed cells, thus circumventing the complex plant secondary metabolism.







Abstract
Medicinal phytochemicals, such as artemisinin and taxol, have impacted the world, and hypericin might do so if its availability issue could be addressed. Hypericin is the hallmark component of Saint John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), an approved depression alleviator documented in the US, European, and British pharmacopoeias with its additional effectiveness against diverse cancers and viruses. However, the academia&#8208;to&#8208;industry transition of hypericin remain hampered by its low in planta abundance, unfeasible bulk chemical synthesis, and unclear biosynthetic mechanism. Here, we present a strategy consisting of the hypericin&#8208;structure&#8208;centered modification and reorganization of microbial biosynthetic steps in the repurposed cells that have been tamed to enable the designed consecutive reactions to afford hypericin (43.1&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1), without acquiring its biosynthetic knowledge in native plants. The study provides a synthetic biology route to hypericin and establishes a platform for biosustainable access to medicinal phytochemicals.

         <title>Preparation of Potassium Acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from Carboxylic Acids by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Mixed Anhydrides**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids are rapidly converted into potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) by copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of their mixed anhydrides. This scalable method is compatible with a broad range of functional groups and allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic and aromatic KATs, including KATs derived from Fmoc&#8208; and Boc&#8208;protected amino acids.







Abstract
We report the preparation of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from widely available carboxylic acids. Mixed anhydrides of carboxylic acids were prepared using isobutyl chloroformate and transformed to the corresponding KATs using a commercial copper catalyst, B2(pin)2, and aqueous KHF2. This method allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic, aromatic, and amino acid&#8208;derived KATs and is compatible with a variety of functional groups including alkenes, esters, halides, nitriles, and protected amines.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation of ionic hypervalent complexes, representatively alkyltrifluoroborates (Alkyl&#8210;BF3&#8208;) and alkylbis(catecholato)silicates (Alkyl&#8210;Si(cat)2&#8208;), have contributed substantially to alkyl radical generation compared to alkali or alkaline earth organometallics because of their excellent activity&#8211;stability balance. Herein, we report another proposal using neutral metalloid compounds, Alkyl&#8210;GeMe3, as radical precursors. Compared to Alkyl&#8210;BF3&#8208; and Alkyl&#8210;Si(cat)2&#8208;, Alkyl&#8210;GeMe3 show comparable activity in radical addition reactions. Moreover, Alkyl&#8210;GeMe3 gives the first success of group 14 tetraalkyl nucleophiles in nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Meanwhile, the neutral nature of these organogermanes supplemented the limination of ionic precursors in purification and derivatization. A preliminary mechanism study corresponds to the procedure that alkyl radical generates from tetraalkylgermane radical cation with the assistance of a nucleophile, which may also enlighten the development of more non&#8208;ionic alkyl radical precursors with metalloid center.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional&#8208;Polycyclic&#160;Photovoltaic Molecule with Low Trap Density for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Typical organic semiconductors show a high trap density of states (1016&#8208;1018 cm&#8208;3), providing a large number of centers for charge&#8208;carrier recombination, thus hindering the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Here, we introduce a strategy of designing and synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;polycyclic photovoltaic material, named as TPP, to reduce the trap density as low as 2.3&#215;1015 cm&#8208;3, which is 1&#8208;3 orders&#160;of&#160;magnitudes lower than those of typical organic photovoltaic semiconductors. Moreover, TPP exhibited broad and strong absorption, ordered molecular packing with large crystalline coherence length and enhanced electron mobility. Then, the bulk heterojunction nanoparticles (BHJ&#8208;NPs) based on the blend of polymer donor (PM6) and TPP, exhibited an average hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 72.75 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, which is higher than that of the control NPs based on typical PM6:Y6 (62.67 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1) tested under 330&#8208;1100 nm illumination with light intensity of 198 mW cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Hindered Tetraphenylethylene Helicates: Chiral Fluorophores with Deep&#8208;Blue Emission, Multiple&#8208;Color CPL, and Chiral Recognition Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates, with a completely immobilized propeller&#8208;like conformation through substitution at the 2,6&#8208;positions of the phenyl rings, were prepared by a short synthetic route. These helicates, with their many modification positions, show deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) that can be tuned over a wide range, and highly enantioselective chiral recognition.







Abstract
New hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates with substitution at 2,6&#8208;position of phenyl rings were designed and synthesized. Due to the increased hindrance, the TPE helicates emit strong deep&#8208;blue to violet fluorescence both in the solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possess amino groups with an unpredented planar structure and sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and high chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates with substitution at 2,6-position of phenyl rings were designed and synthesized. Due to the increased hindrance, the TPE helicates emit strong deep-blue to violet fluorescence both in the solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possess amino groups with an unpredented planar structure and sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized nitrogen, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep-blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and high chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Living Insertion and Controlled Radical Polymerization for Polyolefin&#8208;Polyvinyl Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Practical synthesis of polyolefin&#8208;polyvinyl block copolymers remains a challenge for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed polymerizations. Common approaches functionalize polyolefins for post&#8208;radical polymerization  via  insertion methods, yet sacrifice the livingness of the olefin polymerization. This work identifies an orthogonal radical/spin coupling technique which affords tandem living insertion and controlled radical polymerization. The broad tolerance of this coupling technique has been demonstrated for diverse radical/spin traps such as 2,2,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;azahexane&#8208;3&#8208;nitroxide (TIPNO), 1&#8208;oxyl&#8208; (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine) &#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bromoisobutyrate (TEMPO&#8208;Br), and  N&#8208;tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylnitrone (PBN). Subsequent controlled radical polymerization is demonstrated with NMP and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), yielding polyolefin&#8208;polyvinyl di&#8208; and triblock copolymers (  &#272;  &lt;1.3) with acrylic, vinylic and styrenic segments. These findings highlight radical trapping as an approach to expand the scope of polyolefin functionalization techniques to access polyolefin macroinitiators.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combination photoimmunotherapy holds promise for tumor suppression; however, smart phototherapeutic agents that only activate their immunotherapeutic action in tumor have been rarely developed, which have the potential advantage of reduced side effect. Herein, we report a semiconducting polymer nano&#8208;regulator (SPN  T  ) with cascading activation for combinational photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPN  T  &#160;comprises an immunoregulator (M&#8208;Trp:&#160; 1&#8208;methyltryptophan ) conjugating to the side chain of semiconducting polymer backbone using an apoptotic biomarker&#8208;cleavable linker. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, SPN  T  &#160;produces singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) to cause&#160; immunogenic apoptosis . Concurrently, the upregulation of apoptotic biomarker triggers the specific cleavage of M&#8208;Trp from SPN  T  , leading to specific intratumoral immunotherapeutic activation. Released M&#8208;Trp inhibits&#160; indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) activity, and thus decreases regulatory T cells (Tregs) formation and drives cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) infiltration. SPN  T  &#8208;mediated combination photodynamic immunotherapy thus reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), resulting in efficient suppression of both primary and distant tumors, and inhibition of lung metastasis.</dc:description>

         <title>Initiating Electron Transfer in Doubly Curved Nanographene Upon Supramolecular Complexation of C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave&#8211;convex interactions between of negatively and positively curved molecular nanographene with C60 allow the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. Theoretical calculations predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor C60. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms solvent dependent electron transfer after photo&#8208;excitation.







Abstract
The formation of supramolecular complexes between C60 and a molecular nanographene endowed with both positive and negative curvatures is described. The presence of a corannulene moiety and the saddle shape of the molecular nanographene allows the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. The association constants for the three possible supramolecular complexes were determined by 1H&#8197;NMR titration. Furthermore, the stability of the three complexes was calculated by theoretical methods that also predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor C60. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption measurements on the ns&#8208;time scale showed that the addition of C60 to NG&#8208;1 solutions and photo&#8208;exciting them at 460&#8197;nm leads to the solvent&#8208;dependent formation of new species, in particular the formation of the one&#8208;electron reduced form of C60 in benzonitrile was observed.

         <title>Cyclodextrins with Multiple Pyrenyl Groups: An Approach to Organic Molecules Exhibiting Bright Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrins with multiple pyrene units exhibited bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Owing to their good molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105&#8197;M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8208;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5), the CPL brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1.







Abstract
We report a simple and effective approach to organic molecules exhibiting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by combining a chiral cyclic molecular scaffold and multiple excimer&#8208;enabling moieties. An &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CyD) scaffold was modified with six pyrenyl groups to obtain pyrene&#8211;cyclodextrins (PCDs) in a one&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available compounds. The PCDs exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8722;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5). Owing to the excellent photophysical properties of the PCDs, the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Photophysical and chiroptical studies of the PCDs with only five pyrene units and with linkers of various lengths connecting the CyD with the pyrene units revealed that the formation of a pyrene excimer in a spatially crowded environment is crucial for CPL anisotropy. This study paves the way for the development of bright CPL organic molecules.

         <title>Generation of Oxyphosphonium Ions by Photoredox/Cobaloxime Catalysis for Scalable Amide and Peptide Synthesis in Batch and Continuous&#8208;Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic method for the synthesis of amides and peptides is reported. Synergistic cooperation between a cobaloxime and a photoredox catalyst removes the elements of H2O through the use of PPh3 as a gentle organic reductant. The deoxygenative method is compatible with gram&#8208;scale peptide synthesis and applicable to peptide fragment condensation and SPPS, which may find applications in both organic synthesis and pharmaceutical production.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenative nucleophilic substitutions, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, are of great importance in organic synthesis. However, the conventional protocols require stoichiometric oxidants to trigger the formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediates for the subsequent nucleophilic additions. Through dual catalysis of photoredox and cobaloxime, we realized a radical strategy for the catalytic formation of acyloxyphosphonium ions that enables direct amidation. The deoxygenative protocol exhibits a broad scope and has been used in the late&#8208;stage amidation of drug molecules. In addition to batch reactions, a continuous&#8208;flow reactor was developed, enabling rapid peptide synthesis on gram scale. The successful assembly of a tetrapeptide on the solid support further demonstrated the versatility of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, experimental and computational studies are consistent with the hypothesis of acyloxyphosphonium ions being formed as the key intermediates.

     alt="Generation of Oxyphosphonium Ions by Photoredox/Cobaloxime Catalysis for Scalable Amide and Peptide Synthesis in Batch and Continuous-Flow"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photocatalytic method for the synthesis of amides and peptides is reported. Synergistic cooperation between a cobaloxime and a photoredox catalyst removes the elements of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O through the use of PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a gentle organic reductant. The deoxygenative method is compatible with gram-scale peptide synthesis and applicable to peptide fragment condensation and SPPS, which may find applications in both organic synthesis and pharmaceutical production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphine-mediated deoxygenative nucleophilic substitutions, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, are of great importance in organic synthesis. However, the conventional protocols require stoichiometric oxidants to trigger the formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediates for the subsequent nucleophilic additions. Through dual catalysis of photoredox and cobaloxime, we realized a radical strategy for the catalytic formation of acyloxyphosphonium ions that enables direct amidation. The deoxygenative protocol exhibits a broad scope and has been used in the late-stage amidation of drug molecules. In addition to batch reactions, a continuous-flow reactor was developed, enabling rapid peptide synthesis on gram scale. The successful assembly of a tetrapeptide on the solid support further demonstrated the versatility of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, experimental and computational studies are consistent with the hypothesis of acyloxyphosphonium ions being formed as the key intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimized Synthesis of Solution&#8208;Processable Crystalline Poly(Triazine Imide) with Minimized Defects for OLED Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(triazine imide) is a member of the family of graphitic carbon nitrides and its graphitic morphology allows exfoliation of the material into thin, solution&#8208;processable layers, while at the same time reducing migration and drift of chemically bonded dopants. A team of researchers from King's College London, Humboldt&#8208;Universit&#228;t zu Berlin, Carl von Ossietzky Universit&#228;t Oldenburg, and Helmholtz&#8208;Zentrum Berlin (HZB) constructed the first thin layer, organic light emitting device (OLED) with a solution&#8208;processed graphitic organic material as a metal&#8208;free emission layer. For details see the Research Article by Michael&#8197;J. Bojdys et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111749).

         <dc:description>
The synergetic binary phosphazene/TEB system is highly active and selective toward ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxides to prepare diverse CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates (CO2&#8208;PCs).

         <title>Refining of Particulates at Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Interfaces: Label&#8208;Free Sorting and Isolation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity&#8208;to&#8208;adsorbent&#8208;based sorting of fine particles, including cells, is engineered by minimizing the masking effect of non&#8208;specific interactions. Due to a high contact area and hence high detachment energy, even non&#8208;specifically and weakly interacting particulates are quasi&#8208;irreversibly bound to adsorbents. Microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive dynamic interfaces provide a solution for sorting highly asymmetric cell and particle mixtures.







Abstract
The mechanism of separation methods, for example, liquid chromatography, is realized through rapid multiple adsorption&#8208;desorption steps leading to the dynamic equilibrium state in a mixture of molecules with different partition coefficients. Sorting of colloidal particles, including protein complexes, cells, and viruses, is limited due to a high energy barrier, up to millions kT, required to detach particles from the interface, which is in dramatic contrast to a few kT for small molecules. Such a strong interaction renders particle adsorption quasi&#8208;irreversible. The dynamic adsorption&#8208;desorption equilibrium is approached very slowly, if ever attainable. This limitation is alleviated with a local oscillating repulsive mechanical force generated at the microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer interface to switch between adsorption and mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;facilitated desorption of the particles. Such a dynamic regime enables the separation of colloidal mixtures based on the particle&#8208;polymer interface affinity, and it could find use in research, diagnostics, and industrial&#8208;scale label&#8208;free sorting of highly asymmetric mixtures of colloids and cells.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Structured Upconversion/Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanoparticles for Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An up&#8208;conversion nanoparticles and MnII&#8208;based perovskite core&#8211;shell heterostructures nanocomposite was successfully synthesized for the first time, which showed dual&#8208;color emissions under the excitation of UV light and IR laser. This work suggests its potential in high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting.







Abstract
In view of their excellent luminescence properties, nanocrystalline metal halide perovskites have diverse optoelectronic applications, including those related to anticounterfeiting. However, high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting typically requires multiple encryptions relying on several optical modes to ensure information security. Herein, an efficient anticounterfeiting strategy based on dual optical encryption is realized by combining up&#8208; and downconversion luminescence in a nanocomposite with NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+,Yb3+ as core and a CsMnCl3 as shell. The emission color of this nanocomposite depends on the penetration depth of incident radiation and can be changed by varying the excitation source (980&#8197;nm laser or UV light) to produce different luminescent patterns. This feature allows one to effectively improve the anticounterfeiting index and fabricate professional anticounterfeiting materials.

         <title>Ferroptosis&#8208;Enhanced Cancer Immunity by a Ferrocene&#8208;Appended Iridium(III) Diphosphine Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis is a programmed cell death pathway discovered in recent years, and ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agents have great potential as new antitumor candidates. Here, we report a Ir(III) complex (Ir1) containing a ferrocene&#8208;modified diphosphine ligand that localizes in lysosomes. Under the acidic environments of lysosomes,  Ir1  can effectively catalyze Fenton reaction, produce hydroxyl radicals, induce lipid peroxidation, down&#8208;regulate glutathione peroxidase 4, and induce ferroptosis. RNA sequencing analysis shows that  Ir1  can significantly affect pathways related to ferroptosis and cancer immunity. Accordingly,  Ir1  can induce immunogenic cells death and suppress tumor growth  in vitro, regulate T cell activity and immune microenvironments  in vivo. In conclusion, we show the potential of small molecules with ferroptosis&#8208;inducing capabilities for effective cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lignin&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers as High&#8208;Temperature and UV&#8208;Blocking Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;initiating frustrated Lewis pairs promoted compounded sequence control to achieve one&#8208;step synthesis of the well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit much superior mechanical properties to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs and maintain TPEs properties at temperatures as high as 180&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
This work utilizes frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of tethered bis&#8208;organophosphorus superbases and a bulky organoaluminum to furnish the highly efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers via one&#8208;step block copolymerization of lignin&#8208;based syringyl methacrylate and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, through di&#8208;initiation and compounded sequence control. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit microphase separation and much superior mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 2091&#8201;%, tensile strength up to 11.5&#8197;MPa, and elastic recovery up to 95&#8201;% after 10 cycles) to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs. More impressively, lignin&#8208;based tri&#8208;BCPs can maintain TPEs properties up to 180&#8201;&#176;C, exhibit high transparency and nearly 100&#8201;% UV shield, suggesting potential applications in temperature&#8208;resistant and optical devices.

         <title>Watching Microwave&#8208;Induced Microscopic Hot Spots via the Thermosensitive Fluorescence of Europium/Terbium Mixed&#8208;Metal Organic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave&#8208;induced micro&#8208;hot spots were detected in liquid solutions through fluorescence thermometers attached on microwave&#8208;absorbing carbon particles. The fluorescent experiments confirmed the established microwave&#8208;irradiated energy&#8208;transfer model, whose results can guide precise control and optimization of conditions in microwave chemistry.







Abstract
The hypothesis of microscopic hot spots is widely used to explain the unique microwave (MW) effect in materials science and chemical engineering, but it has not yet been directly measured. Herein we use Eu/Tb mixed&#8208;metal organic complexes as nano thermometers to probe the intrinsic temperature of MW&#8208;absorbing particles in MW fields based on the thermosensitive fluorescent spectra. According to the measurements of the temperature gradient at the solid/liquid interphase, we derive an MW&#8208;irradiated energy transfer model to predict the extent of microscopic hot spots. The fluorescence results agree with the model predictions that the MW&#8208;induced temperature gradient can be enlarged by increasing MW intensity, as well as the dielectric loss and size of particles. Conversely, the increase in the thermal conductivity and the dielectric loss of the liquid lowers the temperature gradient. This study enables control of MW&#8208;assisted synthesis and MW&#8208;responsive techniques.

High&#8208;performance asymmetric supercapacitors based on hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx core&#8211;sheath fibers have been developed by microfluidic assembly and microchannel reaction methods. Due to an in situ Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn bonding bridge, well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity and fast interfacial charge transfer, supercapacitors deliver high energy density, large capacitance, long&#8208;term stability and natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications.







Abstract
We report hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx MXene core&#8211;sheath fibers, in which a ZIF&#8722;L(Zn) nanowall array sheath is grown vertically on an anisotropic Ti3C2Tx core by Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn chemical bonds. Through highly efficient microfluidic assembly and microchannel reactions, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx exhibits well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity, ordered ionic pathways, fast interfacial electron conduction and large&#8208;scale fabrication, significantly boosting charges dynamic transport and intercalation. The resultant ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber presents large capacitance (1700&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and outstanding rate performance in a 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;based solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitors deliver high energy density (19.0&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), excellent capacitance (854&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3), large deformable/wearable capabilities and long&#8208;time cyclic stability (20&#8201;000 cycles), which realize natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications to drive water level/earthquake alarm devices.

         <title>TMSCF2Br&#8208;Enabled Fluorination&#8211;Aminocarbonylation of Aldehydes: Modular Access to &#945;&#8208;Fluoroamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines has been developed, in which the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl) is the key to the success of this multicomponent process.







Abstract
A protocol for the modular assembly of the &#945;&#8208;fluoroamide motif has been developed, which provides a practical method for the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines through a three&#8208;component fluorination&#8211;aminocarbonylation process. The key to the success of this process is taking advantage of the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl). The mechanism of the process involves the 1,2&#8208;fluorine and oxygen migrations of the in situ formed TMS&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;aminodifluoromethyl carbinol intermediates, which represents a new type of deoxyfluorination reaction.

         <title>A Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Proton Battery in Mild Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is developed in mild ZnSO4 electrolyte, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and broadens proton&#8208;based battery chemistry.







Abstract
All&#8208;organic proton batteries are attracting extensive attention due to their sustainability merits and excellent rate capability. Generally, strong acids (e.g. H2SO4) have to be employed as the electrolytes to provide H+ for all&#8208;organic proton batteries due to the high H+ intercalation energy barrier. Until now, the design of all&#8208;organic proton batteries in mild electrolytes is still a challenge. Herein, a poly(2,9&#8208;dihydroquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine) (PO) molecule was designed and synthesized, where the adjacent C=N groups show two different chemical environments, resulting in two&#8208;step redox reactions. Moreover, the two reactions possess considerable voltage difference because of the large LUMO energy gap between PO and its reduction product. More impressively, the C=N groups endow the &#960;&#8208;conjugated PO molecule with H+ uptake/removal in the ZnSO4 electrolyte. As a result, a symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is achieved in a mild electrolyte for the first time, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and also broadens the chemistry of proton&#8208;based batteries.

Generally, strong acids (e.g. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) have to be employed as the electrolytes to provide H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for all-organic proton batteries due to the high H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation energy barrier. Until now, the design of all-organic proton batteries in mild electrolytes is still a challenge. Herein, a poly(2,9-dihydroquinoxalino[2,3-b]phenazine) (PO) molecule was designed and synthesized, where the adjacent C=N groups show two different chemical environments, resulting in two-step redox reactions. Moreover, the two reactions possess considerable voltage difference because of the large LUMO energy gap between PO and its reduction product. More impressively, the C=N groups endow the &#960;-conjugated PO molecule with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake/removal in the ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte. As a result, a symmetric all-organic proton battery is achieved in a mild electrolyte for the first time, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and also broadens the chemistry of proton-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity and Stability of Finned Ferrierite Catalysts in Butene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of finned ferrierite produces a zeolite with reduced mass transport limitations, thereby enhancing its catalyst lifetime and increasing its selectivity to isobutene in tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.







Abstract
Designing zeolite catalysts with improved mass transport properties is crucial for restrictive networks of either one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional pore topologies. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of finned ferrierite (FER), a commercial zeolite with two&#8208;dimensional pores, where protrusions on crystal surfaces behave as pseudo nanoparticles. Catalytic tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization reveal a 3&#8208;fold enhancement of catalyst lifetime and an increase of 12&#8201;% selectivity to isobutene for finned samples compared to corresponding seeds. Electron tomography was used to confirm the identical crystallographic registry of fins and seeds. Time&#8208;resolved titration of Br&#248;nsted acid sites confirmed the improved mass transport properties of finned ferrierite compared to conventional analogues. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.

         <title>Smart Nano&#8208;PROTACs Reprogram Tumor Microenvironment for Activatable Photo&#8208;metabolic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) are developed for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. SPNCOX&#8208;mediated therapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity but also induce targeted intratumoral degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system, leading to the depletion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME to inhibit tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence.







Abstract
Protease inhibitors can modulate intratumoral metabolic processes to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which however suffer from the limited efficacy and off&#8208;targeted side effects. We report smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) with phototherapeutic ablation and cancer&#8208;specific protein degradation to reprogram the TME for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. This nano&#8208;PROTAC has a semiconducting polymer backbone linked with a cyclooxygenase 1/2 (COX&#8208;1/2)&#8208;targeting PROTAC peptide (CPP) via a cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable segment. CPP can be activated by the tumor&#8208;overexpressed CatB to induce the degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The persistent degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 depletes their metabolite prostaglandin E2 which is responsible for activation of immune suppressor cells. Such a smart PROTAC strategy synergized with phototherapy specifically reprograms the immunosuppressive TME and reinvigorates antitumor immunity.

         <title>Collateral Damage Occurs When Using Photosensitizer Probes to Detect or Modulate Nucleic Acid Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of DNA/RNA impact their properties including susceptibility to oxidation. 5&#8208;Methylcytosine and N6&#8208;methyladenine were competed for photooxidation by riboflavin, anthraquinone, or Rose Bengal against dA, dG, dC, and dT in DNA. This confirmed dG is more oxidation prone, representing collateral damage during photosensitized probing for the base methylations.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are chemically modified to fine&#8208;tune their properties for biological function. Chemical tools for selective tagging of base modifications enables new approaches; the photosensitizers riboflavin and anthraquinone were previously proposed to oxidize N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A) or 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mdC) selectively. Herein, riboflavin, anthraquinone, or Rose Bengal were allowed to react with the canonical nucleosides dA, dC, dG, and dT, and the modified bases 5mdC, m6A, 8&#8208;oxoguanine (dOG), and 8&#8208;oxoadenine (dOA) to rank their reactivities. The nucleoside studies reveal that dOG is the most reactive and that the native nucleoside dG is higher or similar in reactivity to 5mdC or m6A; competition in both single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded DNA of dG vs. 5mdC or 6mdA for oxidant confirmed that dG is favorably oxidized. Thus, photosensitizers are promiscuous nucleic acid oxidants with poor chemoselectivity that will negatively impact attempts at targeted oxidation of modified nucleotides in cells.

         <dc:description>
We characterized the first plant cycloartane glycosyltransferase AmGT8 from A. membranaceus. Its mutants A394F, A394D, and T131V were discovered using semi&#8208;rational design, which showed specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O, and 2&#8242;&#8208;O glycosylation activities, respectively. This study uncovered a conserved residue critical for the regiospecificity of plant glycosyltransferases.







Abstract
Engineering the function of triterpene glucosyltransferases (GTs) is challenging due to the large size of the sugar acceptors. In this work, we identified a multifunctional glycosyltransferase AmGT8 catalyzing triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation from the medicinal plant Astragalus membranaceus. To engineer its regiospecificity, a small mutant library was built based on semi&#8208;rational design. Variants A394F, A394D, and T131V were found to catalyze specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O, and 2&#8242;&#8208;O glycosylation, respectively. The origin of regioselectivity of AmGT8 and its A394F variant was studied by molecular dynamics and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Residue 394 is highly conserved as A/G and is critical for the regiospecificity of the C&#8208; and O&#8208;GTs TcCGT1 and GuGT10/14. Finally, astragalosides III and IV were synthesized by mutants A394F, T131V and P192E. This work reports biocatalysts for saponin synthesis and gives new insights into protein engineering of regioselectivity in plant GTs.

Calixarene&#8208;like polyoxoniobates: Two unprecedented giant calixarene&#8208;like polyoxoniobate (PONb) nanocups based on multiple macrocyclic clusters have been made, showing the fusion of two areas of metallacalixarene and PONb chemistry. The two molecular nanocups are by far the largest two inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONbs and hold promise for developing largely unexplored inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONb chemistry.







Abstract
Cup&#8208;shaped molecules are of great interest due to their appealing architectures and properties. Compared with widely studied calixarenes, polyoxometalate&#8208;based cup&#8208;shaped molecules currently remain a virgin land waiting for exploration. In this work, we report the first discovery of two giant cup&#8208;shaped inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid polyoxoniobates (PONbs) of {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128}. The former integrates three tricyclic Nb24 clusters and a hexacyclic Nb48 cluster into a cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a Cu12 metallacalixarene, while the latter unifies two tricyclic Nb24 clusters and a brand&#8208;new pentacyclic Nb40 cluster into another cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a hybrid Cd16 unit. With 132 and 144 metal centers, {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128} show the largest two inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONbs known to date.

         <title>Thermal Dynamic Self&#8208;healing Supramolecular Dopant Towards Efficient and Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible perovskite solar cells draw great attention due to their likeable traits like low cost, portability, light&#8208;weight, et al. However, mechanical stability is still the weak point in their practical application. Herein, we prepared efficient FPSC with remarkable mechanical stability by dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect, which can be realized by the usage of supramolecular adhesive. The colloidal adhesive was obtained by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, which is amphiphilic, has a proper glass transition temperature and high density of hydrogen bond donors and receptors, providing the possibility of thermal dynamic repair of stress damage in FPSCs. The adhesive also greatly improves the leveling property of the precursor solution on the hydrophobic poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)]amine (PTAA) surface. PSCs containing this adhesive achieves more than 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE) on flexible substrates and 21.99% PCE on rigid substrates (certified PCE of 21.27%), with improved electron mobility and reduced defect concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>Modification of Multi&#8208;Component Building Blocks for Assembling Giant Chiral Lanthanide&#8208;Titanium Molecular Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modification procedure on a 15&#8208;component building block of achiral Ln24Ti8 wheel&#8208;like assemblies has been developed to obtain new accessible building blocks, resulting in a pair of new chiral enantiomers in elusive Ln&#8211;Ti systems.







Abstract
Building blocks with multiple components are promising for the synthesis of complex molecular assemblies, but are rarely available. Herein, we report a modification procedure for a multi&#8208;component building block [Ln3Ti(HSA)6(SA)4(H2O)]&#8722; ({Ln3Ti&#8208;SA}, H2SA=salicylic acid, Ln=Eu/Gd) to form new building blocks {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} (H2MSA=5&#8208;methoxysalicylic acid, x=1, 2, 3) by constructing [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8722; units. The obtained {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} can further assemble into a chiral Ln22Ti14 ring with the formulae [Eu22Ti14(MSA)48(HMSA)22(CH3COO)4(H2O)10(iPrOH)] and [Gd22Ti14(MSA)46(HMSA)26(CH3COO)4(H2O)8]. Parallel experiments without Ti4+ result in linear Ln chains. Detailed analysis shows that the [Ti(MSA)4]4&#8722; unit makes the originally variable Ln chains become available building blocks and the modified [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8722; further triggers interesting chiral&#8208;sorting behavior. Finally, the electronic adsorption and magneto&#8208;optic responses of these molecular rings are investigated.

         <title>Mechanochemical Solvent&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amides via Highly Chemoselective N&#8722;C Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first mechanochemical strategy for highly chemoselective, solvent&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides by N&#8722;C bond activation is reported. The protocol advances the biorelevant amide bond cross&#8208;coupling manifold to solid&#8208;state solventless cross&#8208;coupling methods.







Abstract
Although cross&#8208;coupling reactions of amides by selective N&#8722;C cleavage are one of the most powerful and burgeoning areas in organic synthesis due to the ubiquity of amide bonds, the development of mechanochemical, solid&#8208;state methods remains a major challenge. Herein, we report the first mechanochemical strategy for highly chemoselective, solvent&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides by N&#8722;C bond activation. The method is conducted in the absence of external heating, for short reaction time and shows excellent chemoselectivity for &#963; N&#8722;C bond activation. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance and can be applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs and sequential orthogonal cross&#8208;couplings exploiting double solventless solid&#8208;state methods. The results extend mechanochemical reaction environments to advance the chemical repertoire of N&#8722;C bond interconversions to solid&#8208;state environmentally friendly mechanochemical methods.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Oxazaborolidines by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H Double Activation of 1,2&#8208;Azaborines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H double activation of 1,2&#8208;azaborines has been demonstrated. A wide variety of 1,2&#8208;azaborines underwent cycloaddition with vinylethylene carbonate through N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H bond cleavage to produce unique polycyclic oxazaborolidines under mild conditions. Furthermore, highly enantioselective direct functionalization of 1,2&#8208;azaborines afforded chiral tricyclic oxazaborolidines.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H double activation of 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines proceeded via cycloaddition with vinyl ethylene carbonate to produce polycyclic oxazaborolidines in 31&#8211;96&#8201;% yield. The key step in this process is the release of molecular hydrogen from a borate intermediate. Using a SPINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidite as a chiral ligand, chiral oxazaborolidines were synthesized in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% ee). The vinyl group of the resulting oxazaborolidine underwent metathesis, Heck reaction, and Wacker oxidation without affecting the oxazaborolidine framework.

         <title>Surface Engineering Assisted Size and Structure Modulation of Gold Nanoclusters by Ionic Liquid Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the &#960;&#8211;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid cations are deployed to regulate the size and structure of AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes. Upon mild reduction, such AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes can be easily converted into desired AuI&#8208;thiolate protecting motifs, selectively producing atomically precise gold nanoclusters with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry.







Abstract
Surface modification induced core size/structure change is a recent discovery in inorganic nanoparticles research, and has rarely been revealed at the molecular level. Here, we exemplify with atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) that proper surface modification can selectively stabilize the desired Au0 core, conducive to the formation of size/structure&#8208;controlled Au NCs. Leveraging &#960;&#8211;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, ionic liquid (IL) cations are bonded to AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes. The hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic interactions between IL cations subsequently provide a good mechanism to prolong the size of the AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes, selectively producing small&#8208;sized Au NCs upon reduction. Through combined control over the structure and concentration of IL cations, pH and solvent polarity, we are able to produce atomically precise Au NCs with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry. This work also provides a facile means to integrate/synergize the materials functionalities of Au NCs and ILs, increasing their acceptance in diverse fields.

         <title>Relating Conformational Equilibria to Conformer&#8208;Specific Lipophilicities: New Opportunities in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catching conformations: Lipophilicity (logP) is a molecular property which is nevertheless the weighted average of the lipophilicities of the individual conformers. The first direct measurement of conformer&#8208;specific lipophilicity values is presented, together with the introduction of a new avenue for rational lipophilicity optimization of drug candidates which is focused on modification of conformational equilibria in water and in octanol.







Abstract
Efficient drug discovery is based on a concerted effort in optimizing bioactivity and compound properties such as lipophilicity, and is guided by efficiency metrics that reflect both aspects. While conformation&#8211;activity relationships and ligand conformational control are known strategies to improve bioactivity, the use of conformer&#8208;specific lipophilicities (logp) is much less explored. Here we show how conformer&#8208;specific logp values can be obtained from knowledge of the macroscopic logP value, and of the equilibrium constants between the individual species in water and in octanol. This is illustrated with fluorinated amide rotamers, with integration of rotamer 19F NMR signals as a facile, direct method to obtain logp values. The difference between logp and logP optimization is highlighted, giving rise to a novel avenue for lipophilicity control in drug discovery.

         <title>Ordered PtFeIr Intermetallic Nanowires Prepared through a Silica&#8208;Protection Strategy for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowires supported on commercial carbon were synthesized. Coating with SiO2 and the addition of Ir enabled the integrity of the nanowire structure to be maintained during their transformation from a disordered fcc&#8208;phase to an ordered fct&#8208;phase. The fct&#8208;phase nanowires exhibited much better ORR activity and structural and electrochemical stability than the fcc&#8208;phase ones.







Abstract
Developing efficient and stable Pt&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is a way to promote the large&#8208;scale application of fuel cells. Pt&#8208;based alloy nanowires are promising ORR catalysts, but their application is hampered by activity loss caused by structural destruction during long&#8208;term cycling. Herein, the preparation of ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowire catalysts with an average diameter of 2.6&#8197;nm and face&#8208;centered tetragonal structure (fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C) is reported. A silica&#8208;protected strategy prevents the deformation of PtFeIr nanowires during the phase transition at high temperature. The as&#8208;prepared fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C exhibited superior mass activity for ORR (2.03&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) than disordered PtFeIr nanowires with face&#8208;centered cubic structure (1.11&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and commercial Pt/C (0.21&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1). Importantly, the structure and electrochemical performance of fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C were maintained after stability tests, showing the advantages of the ordered structure.

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion Lithium Conducting Polymers with High Ionic Conductivity Based on Borate Pendant Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of lithium&#8208;conducting methacrylic polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is discussed. The optimized borate homopolymer shows the highest ionic conductivity reported for a single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte for lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
A family of single&#8208;ion lithium conducting polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is reported. The effect of the nature of the substituents on the boron atom on the ionic conductivity of the resultant methacrylic polymers was analyzed. To the best of our knowledge the lithium borate polymers endowed with flexible and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents presents the highest ionic conductivity reported for a lithium single&#8208;ion conducting homopolymer (1.65&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C). This together with its high lithium transference number t
=0.93 and electrochemical stability window of 4.2&#8197;V vs Li0/Li+ show promise for application in lithium batteries. To illustrate this, a lithium borate monomer was integrated into a single&#8208;ion gel polymer electrolyte which showed good performance on lithium symmetrical cells (&lt;0.85&#8197;V at &#177;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 175&#8197;h).

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Step Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Switching in BiOIO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Materials with multi&#8208;stabilities controllable by external stimuli are potential for high&#8208;capacity information storage and switch devices. Herein, we report the observation of pressure&#8208;driven two&#8208;step second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) switching in polar BiOIO  3  for the first time. Structure analyses reveal two pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions in BiOIO  3  from the ambient noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;high) to an intermediate noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;intermediate) and then to a centrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;off). The three&#8208;state SHG switching is inspected by  in&#8208;situ  high&#8208;pressure powder SHG and polarization&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal SHG measurements. Local structure analyses based on the  in&#8208;situ  Raman spectra and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal that the SHG switching are caused by the step&#8208;wise suppression of lone&#8208;pair electrons on the [IO  3  ]  &#8208;  units. The dramatic evolution of the functional units under compression also leads to subtle changes of the optical absorption edge of BiOIO  3  . Materials with switchable multiple stabilities provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;art platform for next&#8208;generation switch and information storage devices.</dc:description>

Structure analyses reveal two pressure-induced phase transitions in BiOIO  3  from the ambient noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG-high) to an intermediate noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG-intermediate) and then to a centrosymmetric phase (SHG-off). The three-state SHG switching is inspected by  in-situ  high-pressure powder SHG and polarization-dependent single-crystal SHG measurements. Local structure analyses based on the  in-situ  Raman spectra and X-ray absorption spectra reveal that the SHG switching are caused by the step-wise suppression of lone-pair electrons on the [IO  3  ]  -  units. The dramatic evolution of the functional units under compression also leads to subtle changes of the optical absorption edge of BiOIO  3  . Materials with switchable multiple stabilities provide a state-of-art platform for next-generation switch and information storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aquimarins, Peptide Antibiotics with Amino&#8208;Modified C&#8208;Termini from a Sponge&#8208;Derived Aquimarina sp. Bacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potion from the ocean: New peptide antibiotics from a sponge&#8208;derived bacterium are reported, featuring chlorination and an unusual amino&#8208;capped C&#8208;terminus. Studies on isolation, structure elucidation, biosynthesis, total synthesis, and structure&#8211;activity relationships are presented.







Abstract
Genome mining and bioactivity studies suggested the sponge&#8208;derived bacterium Aquimarina sp. Aq135 as a producer of new antibiotics. Activity&#8208;guided isolation identified antibacterial peptides, named aquimarins, featuring a new scaffold with an unusual C&#8208;terminal amino group and chlorine moieties. Responsible for the halogenation is the FeII/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent chlorinase AqmA that halogenates up to two isoleucine residues in a carrier protein&#8208;dependent fashion. Total syntheses of two natural aquimarins and eight non&#8208;natural variants were developed. Structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies with these compounds showed that the synthetically more laborious chlorinations are not required for antibacterial activity but enhance cytotoxicity. In contrast, variants lacking the C&#8208;terminal amine were virtually inactive, suggesting diamines similar to the terminal aquimarin residue as candidate building blocks for new peptidomimetic antibiotics.

         <title>Thermo&#8208; and Mechanochromic Camouflage and Self&#8208;Healing in Biomimetic Soft Actuators Based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore is chemically introduced into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape&#8208;morphing and reversible color&#8208;changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also have excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics.







Abstract
In nature, many mysterious creatures capable of deformation camouflage, color camouflage, and self&#8208;healing have inspired scientists to develop various biomimetic soft robots. However, the systematic integration of all the above functionalities into a single soft actuator system still remains a challenge. Here we chemically introduce a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape&#8208;morphing and reversible color&#8208;changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also show excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics. We hope that such a TASN&#8208;LCE actuator system endowed with dynamic distortion, thermo&#8208; and mechano&#8208;chromic camouflage, and self&#8208;healing functionalities would pave the way for further development of multifunctional biomimetic soft robotic devices.

         <title>K&#8208;Chabazite Zeolite Nanocrystal Aggregates for Highly Efficient Methane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seed iteration method to synthesis macro&#8211;meso&#8211;micro hierarchical K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal (&#8776;50&#8197;nm) aggregates with enhanced mass transfer rate and adsorption capacity of CH4 to effectively separate CH4/N2 is reported, which has significant potential for low&#8208;concentrated coalbed methane enrichment.







Abstract
Methane (CH4) enrichment and purification is of great significance for increasing the heating value of unconventional natural gas sources and curtailing its effect on global warming. For a long time, commercial adsorbents for CH4 separation have been hampered by low adsorption capacities, sub&#8208;optimal adsorption selectivities, or slow diffusion rates, which have significantly restricted separation productivity. Herein, we report a facile and green seed&#8208;passaging method to fabricate donut&#8208;like macro&#8211;meso&#8211;micro hierarchical zeolite K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal aggregates. This consecutive seed&#8208;inducing method requires no organic template. By utilizing this unique nanocrystallization technique, the CH4 adsorption capacity, gas diffusion rate, and separation productivity of the resultant material are dramatically increased compared with those of commercially available adsorbents, thus setting a new benchmark in CH4/N2 separation. More importantly, production of this adsorbent can be easily scaled&#8208;up to the order of 100&#8197;kg using readily available raw materials in this environmentally friendly synthetic route, enabling potential industrial implementation.

         <title>Unraveling the Function of Metal&#8208;Amorphous Support Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amorphization of support in single&#8208;atoms catalysts is a less researched concept for promoting catalytic kinetics through modulating the metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI). We modeled single&#8208;atom ruthenium (Ru  SAs  ) supported on amorphous cobalt/nickel (oxy)hydroxide (Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi) to explore the favorable MSI between Ru  SAs  and amorphous skeleton for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Differing from the usual crystal counterpart (Ru&#8208;c&#8208;CoNi), the electrons on Ru  SAs  are facilitated to exchange among local configurations (Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Co/Ni) of Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi since flexibly amorphous configuration induces the possible d&#8208;d electrons transfer and   medium&#8208;to&#8208;long  range p&#8208;&#960; orbitals coupling, further intensifying the MSI. It enables Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi with enhanced water dissociation, alleviated oxophilicity, and rapid hydrogen migration, which results in superior durability and HER activity of Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi, wherein only 15 mV can deliver 10 mA cm  &#8722;  2  , significantly lower than 58 mV of Ru&#8208;c&#8208;CoNi.</dc:description>

         <title>The Assembly and Jamming of Nanoparticle Surfactants at Liquid&#8208;Liquid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and polymeric ligands to generate nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface, the binding energy of the NP to the interface can be significantly increased, irreversibly binding the NPSs to the interface. By designing a simplified NPS model, where the NP size can be precisely controlled and the characteristic fluorescence of the NPs be used as a direct probe of their spatial distribution, we provide new insights into the attachment mechanism of NPSs at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface. We find that the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be reduced by competitive ligands, resulting in the dissociation and disassembly of NPSs at the interface, and allowing the construction of responsive, reconfigurable all&#8208;liquid systems. Smaller NPSs that are loosely packed (unjammed) and irreversibly bound to the interface can be displaced by larger NPSs, giving rise to a size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface. However, when the smaller size NPSs are densely packed and jam at the interface, the size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface can be completely suppressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonylative Polymerization of Epoxides Mediated by Tri&#8208;metallic Complexes: A Dual Catalysis Strategy for Synthesis of Biodegradable Polyhydroxyalkanoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a unique class of commercially manufactured biodegradable polyesters with properties suitable for partially substituting petroleum&#8208;based plastics. However, high costs and low volumes of production have restricted their application as commodity materials.&#160;In this study, tri&#8208;metallic complexes were developed for carbonylative polymerization of epoxides  via  a dual catalysis strategy, affording 17 products of novel PHAs with up to 38.2 kg/mol  M  n  values. The polymerization&#160;proceeds in a sequential fashion, which entails the carbonylative ring expansion of epoxide to  &#946;  &#8208;lactone and its subsequent ring&#8208;opening polymerization that occurs selectively at the  O&#8208;  alkyl bond  via  carboxylate species. The wide availability and structural diversity of epoxide monomers provide PHAs with various structures, excellent functionalities, and tunable properties. This study represents a rare example of the preparation of PHAs using epoxides and carbon monoxide as raw materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of an Ultra&#8208;rapid and Sensitive Lysosomal Fluorescence Lipophagy Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;invasive dynamic tracking of lysosomes and their interactions with other organelles is important for the study of lysosomal function and related diseases. However, many fluorescent dyes developed so far to target lysosomes cannot be used to monitor these processes due to the high concentrations required for imaging, long cell penetration times, and non&#8208;ideal photostability. In this regard, we synthesized three lysosomal targeting probes with large Stokes shifts, good stability, and high brightness. The  Q&#8208;P&#8208;ARh  , developed by us for the first time, can stain lysosomes at ultra&#8208;low concentrations (1.0 nM) without affecting the physiological functions of the lysosomes. More importantly, its excellent anti&#8208;interference ability and ultrafast lysosomal staining ability (within 1.0 min) clearly monitored the entire dynamic process of lipophagy. Ultimately, this method can greatly contribute to the study of autophagy pathways. This novel fluorescence platform shows great promise for the development of biological probes for application in pathological environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Chirality Drives Separation by Differential Ion Mobility Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon development of a workflow to analyze (&#177;)&#8208;Verapamil and its metabolites using differential mobility spectrometry (DMS), we noticed that the ionogram of protonated Verapamil consisted of two peaks. This was inconsistent with its metabolites, as each exhibited only a single peak in the respective ionograms. The unique behaviour of Verapamil was attributed to protonation at its tertiary amino moiety, which generated a stereogenic quaternary amine. The introduction of additional chirality upon N&#8208;protonation of Verapamil renders four possible stereochemical configurations for the protonated ion: (  R,R  ), (  S,S  ), (  R,S  ), or (  S,R  ). The (  R,R  )/(  S,S  ) and (  R,S  )/(  S,R  ) enantiomeric pairs are diastereomeric and thus exhibit unique conformations that are resolvable by linear and differential ion mobility techniques.&#160; Protonation&#8208;induced chirality appears to be a general phenomenon, as  N  &#8208;protonation of 12 additional chiral amines generated diastereomers that were readily resolved by DMS.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Access to Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Imidazol(in)ium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazolium salts have ubiquitous applications in energy research, catalysis, materials and medicinal sciences. Here, we report a new strategy for the synthesis of diverse heteroatom&#8208;functionalized imidazolium and imidazolinium salts from easily available 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes in one step. The strategy relies on a discovered family of unprecedented nucleophilic addition/cyclization reactions with trialkyl orthoformates and heteroatomic nucleophiles. To probe general areas of application, synthesized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors were feasible for direct metallation to give functionalized M/carbene complexes (M = Pd, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au), which were isolated in individual form. The utility of chloromethyl function for the postmodification of the synthesized salts and Pd/carbene complexes was demonstrated. The obtained complexes and imidazolium salts demonstrated good activities in Pd&#8208; or Ni&#8208;catalyzed model cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8208;H activation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Supramolecular Zippers with Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence by a Dexter Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials glow persistently in the dark, which offers new exciting possibilities in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting, photoelectric device and biological imaging. However, development of single component UOP materials remains great challenge. Herein, we firstly develop a single component organic supramolecular zipper system with lifetime up to 0.77 s. Owing to introduction of pyrazol ring into diphenylsulfone group, the &#8216;V&#8217; shape molecules were artfully self&#8208;assembled into supramolecular zippers via &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; interactions, that are not only of significance in highly efficient generation of triplet excitons, but also facilitate Dexter energy transfer process within supramolecular zippers, that are responsible for the alleviating radiative and non&#8208;radiative deactivation decay of triplet excitons, to finally boost the UOP. This finding not only gives a new set of guidelines for the design of single component UOP molecules, but also reveals the UOP mechanism from a new perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Multiphoton Absorption of Zn&#8208;AIEgen Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of luminescent frameworks were synthesized from the selective combination of AIE&#8208;linker tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H  4  TCPE) and Zn  2+  . Complex  1  was formed by the close packing of Zn&#8208;TCPE hinge, and isostructural complexes  2  &#8208;  5  were constructed by the linkage of Zn&#8208;TCPE layer and pillar ligand. These complexes exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). Interestingly, multiphoton apparent parameters of  1  are far superior to some excellent multiphoton emission materials, even the perovskite nanocrystal. The incorporation of pillar linkers slows down the charge transfer between layers of Zn&#8208;TCPE, and the aromatic core of pillar linkers has a great influence on the MEA performance of corresponding frameworks. The unprecedented structural and optical tuning of high performance MPA crystalline materials provides efficient suggestion for the design of next generation multiphoton absorption materials.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Encoded Integration of Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating dissimilar materials at the nanoscale is crucial for modern electronics and optoelectronics. The structural DNA nanotechnology provides a universal platform for precision assembly of materials; nevertheless, heterogeneous integration of dissimilar materials with DNA nanostructures has yet to be explored. Here we report a DNA origami&#8208;encoded strategy for integrating silica&#8208;metal heterostructures. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal distinctive mechanisms for the binding and aggregation of silica and metal clusters on protruding double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) strands that are prescribed on the DNA origami template. In particular, the binding energy differences of silica/metal clusters and DNA molecules underlies the accessibilities of dissimilar material areas on DNA origami. We find that, by programming the densities and lengths of protruding dsDNA strands on DNA origami, silica and metal materials can be independently deposited at their predefined areas with a high vertical precision of 2 nm. We demonstrate the integration of silica&#8208;gold and silica&#8208;silver heterostructures with high site addressability. This DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy is thus applicable for integrating various types of dissimilar materials, which opens new routes for bottom&#8208;up electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembling Metal Organic Layer Composites for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) based composites have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis due to their high structural flexibility and fully exposed active sites. Herein, a freestanding metal organic layer (MOL) with a 2D  kgd  (kagome dual) lattice was constructed with abundant surface oxygenate groups serving as anchoring sites to immobilize diverse guests. Taking Bi as an example, tetragonal Bi  2  O  3  nanowires can be uniformly grown on MOLs after solvothermal treatment, the structural evolution of which was followed by  ex&#8208;situ  electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Bi  2  O  3  /MOL exhibits excellent CO  2  electroreduction activity towards formate reaching a specific current of 2.3 A&#183;mg  Bi  &#8208;1  and Faradaic efficiencies of over 85% with a wide potential range from &#8208;0.87 to &#8208;1.17 V, far surpassing Bi  2  O  3  /UiO (a 3D Zr  6  &#8208;oxo based MOF) and Bi  2  O  3  /AB (Acetylene Black). Such a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy can be flexibly extended to develop versatile MOL composites, highlighting the superiority of optimizing MOL based composites for electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Circular Permutated PQQ&#8208;Glucose Dehydrogenase as an Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circular permutation of PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase creates an artificial allosteric enzyme controlled by ligand binding to N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal domains. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays.







Abstract
Protein biosensors play an increasingly important role as reporters for research and clinical applications. Here we present an approach for the construction of fully integrated but modular electrochemical biosensors based on the principal component of glucose monitors PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ&#8208;GDH). We designed allosterically regulated circular permutated variants of PQQ&#8208;GDH that show large (&gt;10&#8208;fold) changes in enzymatic activity following intramolecular scaffolding of the newly generated N&#8208; and C termini by ligand binding domain/ligand complexes. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays. For instance, the concentration of Cyclosporine&#8197;A could be measured in 1&#8197;&#956;L of undiluted blood with the same accuracy as the leading diagnostic technique that uses 50 times more sample. We further used this biosensor to construct highly porous gold bioelectrodes capable of robustly detecting concentrations of Cyclosporine&#8197;A as low as 20&#8197;pM and retained functionality in samples containing at least 60&#8201;% human serum.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Reliant Dynamic Properties and Elasto&#8208;Plastic to Plastic Crystal (Rotator) Phase Transition in a Metal Oxyacid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical mechanical responses, from elastic and elasto&#8208;plastic bending to exceptional malleability, have been realized at different stress and temperature conditions in crystals of a rhenium oxyacid salt. The extent of the molecular rotations/translations in the mechanism is governed by the crystal structure.







Abstract
Although, dynamic crystals are attractive for use in many technologies, molecular level mechanisms of various solid&#8208;state dynamic processes and their interdependence, remain poorly understood. Here, we report a rare example of a dynamic crystal (1), involving a heavy transition metal, rhenium, with an initial two&#8208;face elasticity (within &#8776;1&#8201;% strain), followed by elasto&#8208;plastic deformation, at room temperature. Further, these crystals transform to a rotator (plastic) crystal phase at &#8776;105&#8201;&#176;C, displaying exceptional malleability. Qualitative and quantitative mechanical tests, X&#8208;ray diffraction, &#956;&#8208;Raman and polarized light microscopy experiments reveal that the elasto&#8208;plastic deformation involves both partial molecular rotations and slip, while malleability in the rotator phase is facilitated by reorientational motions and increased symmetry (slip planes). Our work, connecting the plastically bendable (1D or 2D) crystals with the rotator phases (3D), is important for designing multi&#8208;functional dynamic crystals.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe here a Ni&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and fluoromethyl halides (BrCF  2  H and ICH  2  F) in the presence of zinc, enabling the facile and selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF  2  H/CH  2  F&#8208;incorporated alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Notably, merging intramolecular radical cyclization with fluoromethyl coupling enables the expedient constructions of CF  2  H/CH  2  F&#8208;incorporated lactones and lactams with high efficiency and selectivity. Mechanistic studies disclose that this catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical addition to an alkyne followed by selective coupling with the fluoromethyl unit.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Due to the highly symmetrical structures generated from one&#8208;pot syntheses, the partial functionalization of macrocycles is usually beset with low yields and onerous purifications of the target multifunctional macrocycles. To improve this circumstance, taking pillar[6]arenes as an example, a two&#8208;step fragment coupling method is developed for synthesizing symmetrically tetra&#8208;functionalized pillar[6]arenes, namely X&#8208;pillar[6]arenes. This method is simple and versatile, which makes hetero&#8208;fragment coupling and pre&#8208;functionalization available. Nine new macrocycles and a pillar[6]arene&#8208;based cage are prepared. In addition, one of the newly synthesized macrocycles,  COOEtEtXP[6]  , exhibits a strong cyan luminescence in the solid state under irradiation by 365 nm UV light. This emission originates from intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation. Meanwhile, formation of a supramolecular polymer by multiple non&#8208;covalent intra/intermolecular interactions help rigidify the structure and make  COOEtEtXP[6]  an efficient solid&#8208;state emitter. It is believed that this fragment coupling can also be used to realize the multi&#8208;functionalization of other macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Near&#8208;Infrared Nonfullerene Acceptor with Ultralow Nonradiative Voltage Loss for High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) are considered&#160;as&#160;one of the most valuable applications of OSCs&#160;and&#160;a&#160;strong&#160;contender&#160;in the market. However, the&#160;optical&#160;bandgap of&#160;current&#160;high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OSCs is still not low enough to achieve the optimal balance between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). An&#160;  N&#8208;  substituted asymmetric nonfullerene acceptor SN with over 40 nm bathochromically shifted absorption compared to Y6 was designed and synthesized, based on which the device with&#160;PM6 as donor obtained a PCE of 14.3%, accompanied with a nonradiative voltage loss as low as 0.15 eV. Meanwhile, ternary devices with the addition of SN into PM6:Y6 can&#160;achieve a PCE of 17.5% with an unchanged open&#8208;circuit voltage and improved short&#8208;circuit current. Benefiting from extended NIR absorption and lowered voltage loss,&#160;ST&#8208;OSCs based on&#160;PM6:SN:Y6 were fabricated and the optimized device demonstrated a PCE of 14.0% at an AVT of 20.2%, which is the highest PCE at an AVT over 20%.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochromic, Shape&#8208;Programmable and Self&#8208;Healable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Boronic Ester Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endowing a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE) exhibiting helicoidal nanostructure with dynamically tailorable functionalities is of paramount significance for its emerging applications in diverse fields such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. Here, a mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable CLCE is judiciously designed and synthesized through integrating dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer network. The circularly polarized reflection of CLCEs can be reversibly and dynamically tuned across the entire visible spectrum by mechanical stretching. Thanks to the introduction of dynamic boronic ester bonds, the CLCEs were found to show robust reprogrammable and self&#8208;healing capabilities. The research disclosed herein can provide new insights into the development of 4D (color and 3D shape) programmable photonic actuators towards bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optical systems, and next&#8208;generation intelligent machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformation of Covalent Organic Frameworks from N&#8208;Acylhydrazone to Oxadiazole Linkages for Smooth Electron Transfer in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are regarded as new platforms for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion due to their tailor&#8208;made functions and pre&#8208;designable structures. Their intrinsic reversibility and high polarization of organic linkages inevitably result in poor chemical stability and weak optoelectronic properties. Herein, one  N  &#8208;acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COF (H&#8208;COF) was converted into stable and &#960;&#8208;conjugated oxadiazole&#8208;linked COF  via  post&#8208;oxidative cyclization. Both chemical stability and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization throughout the reticular framework are significantly improved, leading to high hydrogen evolution amount of 13075 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  in 5 h upon visible&#8208;light irradiation, which is over four times higher than that of H&#8208;COF. This work provides a facile protocol for the fabrication of p&#8208;conjugated COFs and the modulation of photophysical properties for photocatalytic application.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Perovskite Solar Cells: A New Tool for Improving Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites (HOIHPs) have recently emerged as a flourishing area of research. Their easy and low&#8208;cost production and their unique optoelectronic properties make them promising materials for many applications. In particular, HOIHPs hold great potential for next&#8208;generation solar cells. However, their practical implementation is still hindered by their poor stability in air and moisture, which is responsible for their short lifetime. Optimising the chemical composition of materials and exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions for interfacial and defects engineering, as well as defect passivation, are efficient routes towards enhancing the overall efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Due to the rich halogen chemistry of HOIHPs, exploiting halogen bonding, in particular, may pave the way towards the development of highly stable PSCs. Improved crystallisation and stability, reduction of the surface trap states, and the possibility of forming ordered structures have already been preliminarily demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete Stacked Dimers of Aromatic Oligoamide Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tight binding was observed between the C&#8208;terminal cross section of aromatic oligoamide helices in aqueous solution, leading to the formation of discrete head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimers in slow exchange on the NMR timescale with the corresponding monomers. The nature and structure of the dimers was evidenced by 2D NOESY and DOSY spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and x&#8208;ray crystallography. The binding interface involves a large hydrophobic aromatic surface and hydrogen bonding. Dimerization requires that helices have the same handedness and the presence of a C&#8208;terminal carboxy function. The protonation state of the carboxy group plays a crucial role, resulting in pH dependence of the association. Dimerization is also influenced by neighboring side chains and can be programmed to selectively produce heteromeric aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Nanocomposite as Early Evaluation System of Therapy Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8197;vivo &#8220;Turn&#8208;On&#8221; NIR&#8208;II FL and NIR&#8208;II PA signals by using activated caspases&#8208;3 after radiotherapy to proteolytically cleave the peptide sequence of an AuNNP@DEVD&#8208;IR1048 nanoprobe, in addition to integrating living imaging information with a radiotherapy effect using the caspase&#8208;3 enzyme as &#8220;matchmaker&#8221; and developing the relationship between each other, achieves real&#8208;time evaluation and early prediction of radiotherapy effects.







Abstract
Delays in evaluating cancer response to radiotherapy (RT) usually reduce therapy effect or miss the right time for treatment optimization. Hence, exploring timely and accurate methods enabling one to gain insights of RT response are highly desirable. In this study, we have developed an apoptosis enzyme (caspase&#8208;3) activated nanoprobe for early evaluation of RT efficacy. The nanoprobe bridged the nanogapped gold nanoparticles (AuNNPs) and the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent (FL) molecules (IR&#8208;1048) through a caspase&#8208;3 specific peptide sequence (DEVD) (AuNNP@DEVD&#8208;IR1048). After X&#8208;ray irradiation, caspase&#8208;3 was activated to cut DEVD, turning on both NIR&#8208;II FL and PA imaging signals. The increased NIR&#8208;II FL/PA signals exhibited a positive correlation with the content of caspase&#8208;3. Moreover, the amount of the activated caspase&#8208;3 was negatively correlated with the tumor size. The results underscore the role of the caspase&#8208;3 activated by X&#8208;ray irradiation in bridging the imaging signals variation and tumor inhibition rate. Overall, activatable NIR&#8208;II FL/PA imaging was successfully used to timely predict and evaluate the RT efficacy.

&lt;p&gt;In&#8197;vivo &#8220;Turn-On&#8221; NIR-II FL and NIR-II PA signals by using activated caspases-3 after radiotherapy to proteolytically cleave the peptide sequence of an AuNNP@DEVD-IR1048 nanoprobe, in addition to integrating living imaging information with a radiotherapy effect using the caspase-3 enzyme as &#8220;matchmaker&#8221; and developing the relationship between each other, achieves real-time evaluation and early prediction of radiotherapy effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delays in evaluating cancer response to radiotherapy (RT) usually reduce therapy effect or miss the right time for treatment optimization. Hence, exploring timely and accurate methods enabling one to gain insights of RT response are highly desirable. In this study, we have developed an apoptosis enzyme (caspase-3) activated nanoprobe for early evaluation of RT efficacy. The nanoprobe bridged the nanogapped gold nanoparticles (AuNNPs) and the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) fluorescent (FL) molecules (IR-1048) through a caspase-3 specific peptide sequence (DEVD) (AuNNP@DEVD-IR1048). After X-ray irradiation, caspase-3 was activated to cut DEVD, turning on both NIR-II FL and PA imaging signals. The increased NIR-II FL/PA signals exhibited a positive correlation with the content of caspase-3. Moreover, the amount of the activated caspase-3 was negatively correlated with the tumor size. The results underscore the role of the caspase-3 activated by X-ray irradiation in bridging the imaging signals variation and tumor inhibition rate. Overall, activatable NIR-II FL/PA imaging was successfully used to timely predict and evaluate the RT efficacy. The evaluation system based on biomarker-triggered living imaging has the capacity to guide treatment decisions for numerous cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective [3+2] Annulation of Aliphatic Aldimines with Alkenes by Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>

Half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts serve as a unique platform for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3+2] annulation of aliphatic aldimines with alkenes via &#946;&#8722;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation, affording a new family of multi&#8208;substituted aminocyclopentane derivatives from easily accessible aldimines and alkenes with broad substrate scope, high regio&#8208;, diastereoselectivity and 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency.







Abstract
Here we report for the first time the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3+2] annulation of a wide range of aliphatic aldimines with alkenes via the activation of an unactivated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond by half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts. This protocol offers a straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of multi&#8208;substituted aminocyclopentane derivatives from easily accessible aliphatic aldimines and alkenes. The annulation of aldimines with styrenes exclusively afforded the 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminocyclopentane derivatives with excellent diastereoselectivity through the 2,1&#8208;insertion of a styrene unit. The annulation of aldimines with aliphatic alkenes selectively gave the 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminocyclopentane products in a 1,2&#8208;insertion fashion. A catalytic amount of an appropriate amine such as adamantylamine (AdNH2) or dibenzylamine (Bn2NH) showed significant effects on the catalyst activity and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Identification of Cyclopropane Formation in the Biosyntheses of Hormaomycins and Belactosins: Sequential Nitration and Cyclopropanation by Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of amino/nitro&#8208;cyclopropylalanine moieties in hormaomycin and belactosin was fully elucidated. The pathway involves six&#8208;electron oxidation of the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine by heme oxygenase&#8208;like dinuclear iron enzymes (HrmI/BelK) and C&#8722;C bond formation by iron&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases (HrmJ/BelL). This is the first example of Fe/&#945;&#8208;KG oxygenase&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropane formation.







Abstract
Hormaomycins and belactosins are peptide natural products that contain unusual cyclopropane moieties. Bioinformatics analysis of the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters showed that two conserved genes, hrmI/belK and hrmJ/belL, were potential candidates for catalyzing cyclopropanation. Using in vivo and in vitro assays, the functions of HrmI/BelK and HrmJ/BelL were established. HrmI and BelK, which are heme oxygenase&#8208;like dinuclear iron enzymes, catalyze oxidation of the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine to afford l&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine. Subsequently, HrmJ and BelL, which are iron&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases, effectively convert l&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine into 3&#8208;(trans&#8208;2&#8208;nitrocyclopropyl)&#8208;alanine through C4&#8722;C6 bond installation. These observations disclose a novel pathway of cyclopropane ring construction and exemplify the new chemistry involving metalloenzymes in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>A General Approach to Design Dual Ratiometric Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Probes for Quantitatively Visualizing Tumor Hypoxia Levels In&#8197;Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have described a general energy balance approach by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized platform, the first dual&#8208;ratio NIRF/PA response probe AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2 was designed for quantitatively and precisely monitoring of tumor hypoxia levels in vivo.







Abstract
Herein, we describe an energy balance strategy between fluorescence and photoacoustic effects by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized scaffold, we reported the first dual&#8208;ratio response of nitroreductase probe AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2, which allows quantitative visualization of tumor hypoxia in&#8197;vivo. AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2, composed of a new NIRF/PA scaffold thioxanthene&#8208;hemicyanine (AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;1) and a 4&#8208;nitrobenzene moiety, showed a 10&#8208;fold ratiometric NIRF enhancement (I773/I733) and 2.4&#8208;fold ratiometric PA enhancement (PA730/PA670) upon activation by a biomarker (nitroreductase, NTR) associated with tumor hypoxia. Moreover, the dual ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging accurately quantified the hypoxia extent with high sensitivity and high imaging depth in xenograft breast cancer models. More importantly, the 3D maximal intensity projection (MIP) PA images of the probe can precisely differentiate the highly heterogeneous oxygen distribution in solid tumor. Thus, this study provides a promising NIRF/PA scaffold that may be generalized for the dual ratiometric imaging of other disease&#8208;relevant biomarkers.

         <title>Atomic Bridging Structure of Nickel&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic bridging structure of nickel&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon active sites confined in channel&#8208;rich porous carbon fibers enables the highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.







Abstract
To meet strategic applications, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemical molecules would be improved by the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed active sites. Herein an electrospun&#8208;pyrolysis cooperative strategy is presented to not only modulate the porous structure of the carbon support for favorable charge and mass transfer, but also adjust the bridging structure of atomically dispersed metal species. Typically, the experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the unique chemical structure of binuclear nickel bridging with nitrogen and carbon atoms (namely Ni2&#8722;N4&#8722;C2) tunes the electronic nature of the d&#8208;states for the optimal adsorption of carbon dioxide and intermediates, thus inducing the substantial enhancement of CO2 reduction via the thermodynamically more favorable pathway. The identification of such a structure demonstrates the large space to modulate the atomic bridging status for optimizing electrocatalysis.

         <title>The Crystal Plane is not the Key Factor for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methane Electrosynthesis on Reconstructed Cu2O Microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;depth mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on in&#8197;situ reconstructed Cu2O microparticles is still ambiguous. Now strong evidence shows that the Cu2O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane production rather than the initial crystal planes of the Cu2O microparticles.







Abstract
Cu2O microparticles with controllable crystal planes and relatively high stability have been recognized as a good platform to understand the mechanism of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we demonstrate that the in&#8197;situ generated Cu2O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane formation, rather than the initial crystal plane of the reconstructed Cu2O microparticles. Experimental results indicate that the methane evolution is dominated on all three different crystal planes with similar Tafel slopes and long&#8208;term stabilities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that *CO is protonated via a similar bridge configuration at the Cu2O/Cu interface, regardless of the initial crystal planes of Cu2O. The Gibbs free energy changes (&#916;G) of *CHO on different reconstructed Cu2O planes are close and more negative than that of *OCCOH, indicating the methane formation is more favorable than ethylene on all Cu2O crystal planes.

         <title>Formation of Super&#8208;Assembled TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Inverse Opal Towards Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon inverse opal (TZNC IO) structure is designed through a multi&#8208;step method to regulate Zn deposition for Zn metal anodes. Benefitting from the ordered open structure with abundant zincophilic sites, the TZNC host can realize a preferential Zn nucleation and growth in the confined space. As expected, the dendrite&#8208;free TZNC@Zn composite anode enables long&#8208;term cycling in both symmetric and full cells.







Abstract
Uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions are the major restrictions for the commercialization of Zn metal anodes. Herein, we develop a TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon inverse opal (denoted as TZNC IO) host to regulate the Zn deposition. Amorphous TiOx and Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon can serve as the zincophilic nucleation sites to prevent the parasitic reactions. More importantly, the highly ordered IO host homogenizes the local current density and electric field to stabilize Zn deposition. Furthermore, the three&#8208;dimensional open networks could regulate Zn ion flux to enable stable cycling performance at large current densities. Owing to the abundant zincophilic sites and the open structure, granular Zn deposits could be realized. As expected, the TZNC IO host guarantees the steady Zn plating/stripping with a long&#8208;term stability over 450&#8197;h at the current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a TZNC@Zn||V2O5 full cell shows long lifespan over 2000&#8197;cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Branched Poly(Aryl Piperidinium) Membranes for Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched poly(aryl piperidinium) membranes with high conductivity (147&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent mechanical (26&#8201;% swelling ratio) and chemical stability have been prepared. Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) using these membranes exhibit high peak power density (2.3&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and durability (500&#8197;h).







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a promising, next&#8208;generation fuel cell technology. AEMFCs require highly conductive and robust anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs), which are challenging to develop due to the tradeoff between conductivity and water uptake. Here we report a method to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched poly(aryl piperidinium) AEMs. We show that branching reduces water uptake, leading to improved dimensional stability. The optimized membrane, b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5, exhibits simultaneously high OH&#8722; conductivity (&gt;145&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C), high mechanical strength and dimensional stability, good processability, and excellent alkaline stability (&gt;1500&#8197;h) in 1&#8197;M KOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C. AEMFCs based on b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5 reached peak power densities of 2.3&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8722;O2 and 1.3&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;air at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The AEMFCs can run stably under a constant current of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 500&#8197;h, during which the b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5 membrane remains stable.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Regulation of Defect Sites and Vertical Conduction by Spiral Domain for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we proposed a structural model of a spiral MoTe2 domain to optimize collectively active site and vertical conduction. A single spiral MoTe2&#8208;based electrocatalytic microdevice was fabricated to extract HER activity and displayed exceptional activity with an ultrahigh current density of 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 0.4&#8197;V.







Abstract
Insufficient active sites and weak vertical conduction are the intrinsic factors that restrict the electrocatalytic HER for transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides. As a prototype, we proposed a model of spiral MoTe2 to optimize collectively the above issues. The conductive atomic force microscopy of an individual spiral reveals that the retentive vertical conduction irrespective of layer thickness benefits from the connected screw dislocation lines between interlayers. Theoretical calculations uncover that the regions near the edge step of the spiral structures more easily form Te vacancies and have lower &#916;GH* as extra active sites. A single spiral MoTe2&#8208;based on&#8208;chip microcell was fabricated to extract HER activity and achieved an ultrahigh current density of 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 0.4&#8197;V, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than the exfoliated counterpart. Profoundly, this unusual spiral model will initiate a new pathway for triggering other inert catalytic reactions.

         <title>Gene Fusion and Directed Evolution to Break Structural Symmetry and Boost Catalysis by an Oligomeric C&#8722;C Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less symmetry, more diversity: Here we show that gene duplication and fusion to break structural symmetry, allowing independent sequence diversification of neighboring subunits by directed evolution, is a powerful strategy to boost catalysis by a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT), enabling efficient asymmetric Michael additions.







Abstract
Gene duplication and fusion are among the primary natural processes that generate new proteins from simpler ancestors. Here we adopted this strategy to evolve a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an efficient biocatalyst for enantioselective Michael reactions. We first designed a tandem&#8208;fused 4&#8208;OT to allow independent sequence diversification of adjacent subunits by directed evolution. This fused 4&#8208;OT was then subjected to eleven rounds of directed evolution to give variant 4&#8208;OT(F11), which showed an up to 320&#8208;fold enhanced activity for the Michael addition of nitromethane to cinnamaldehydes. Crystallographic analysis revealed that 4&#8208;OT(F11) has an unusual asymmetric trimeric architecture in which one of the monomers is flipped 180&#176; relative to the others. This gene duplication and fusion strategy to break structural symmetry is likely to become an indispensable asset of the enzyme engineering toolbox, finding wide use in engineering oligomeric proteins.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Ligation&#8208;Activated Fluorogenic FRET Dyads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept for the transformation of the excellent tetrazine&#8208;ligation dependent fluorogenicity of blue&#8208;excitable cores to biologically preferable emission ranges is presented herein. Such relay mechanism resulted in improved yellow/red fluorogenicities together with increased photostabilities and large apparent Stokes&#8208;shifts. The presented fluorogenic dyads were utilized in multicolor single excitation imaging schemes and STED imaging as well.







Abstract
An energy transfer&#8208;based signal amplification relay concept enabling transmission of bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenicity of blue&#8208;excitable coumarins to yellow/red emitting cyanine frames is presented. Such relay mechanism resulted in improved cyanine fluorogenicities together with increased photostabilities and large apparent Stokes&#8208;shifts allowing lower background fluorescence even in no&#8208;wash bioorthogonal fluorogenic labeling schemes of intracellular structures in live cells. These energy transfer dyads sharing the same donor moiety together with their parent donor molecule allowed three&#8208;color imaging of intracellular targets using one single excitation source with separate emission windows. Sub&#8208;diffraction imaging of intracellular structures using the bioorthogonally activatable FRET dyads by STED microscopy is also presented.

         <title>An Unusual Pair: Facile Formation and In Vivo Validation of Robust Sc&#8211;18F Ternary Complexes for Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot water&#8208;compatible and high&#8208;yielding radiofluorination approach by the displacement of a labile, inner&#8208;sphere water of a seven&#8208;coordinate Sc chelate with a 18F&#8722; ion to form the first fully inert and water&#8208;compatible Sc&#8211;18F ternary coordination complex. The corresponding complex is fully in vivo compatible and can be the diagnostic PET imaging partner to the corresponding 47Sc&#8208;labeled endoradiotherapeutic.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;18 remains the most widely clinically utilized radionuclide globally for positron emission tomography (PET). The emergence of therapeutic isotopes for the management of disease has produced a pronounced interest in matched, theranostic isotope pairs that can be employed in tandem for the diagnosis and stratification of patients for subsequent radiotherapy. 18F, however, does not have a suitable therapeutic isotopologue. Here, we demonstrate that the formation of [18F][Sc&#8722;F] ternary complexes is feasible under mild, aqueous conditions, producing chemically robust radiopharmaceuticals in high radiochemical yield and specific activity. A corresponding in vivo study with a cancer&#8208;targeting [18F][Sc&#8722;F] tracer indicates excellent in vivo stability and produces exquisite PET image quality, rendering the 18F/47Sc isotope pair an unusual, yet chemically matched theranostic pair with excellent potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Synthetic Silica Nano&#8208;Organelles for Regulation of Cascade Reactions in Multi&#8208;Compartmentalized Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic silica nano&#8208;organelles designed to regulate kinetics and pathway selection in enzymatic cascade reactions are reported. Like cell organelles, synthetic nano&#8208;organelles can be combined to create integrated systems. Multicompartmentalized synthetic cells were built using synthetic nano&#8208;organelles and giant polymeric vesicles.







Abstract
In eukaryotic cells, enzymes are compartmentalized into specific organelles so that different reactions and processes can be performed efficiently and with a high degree of control. In this work, we show that these features can be artificially emulated in robust synthetic organelles constructed using an enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization strategy. We describe an in&#8197;situ encapsulation approach that allows enzymes to be loaded into silica nanoreactors in well&#8208;defined compositions. The nanoreactors can be combined into integrated systems to produce a desired reaction outcome. We used the selective enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization and nanoreactor integration to regulate competitive cascade reactions and to modulate the kinetics of sequential reactions involving multiple nanoreactors. Furthermore, we show that the nanoreactors can be efficiently loaded into giant polymer vesicles, resulting in multi&#8208;compartmentalized microreactors.

         <title>Stereoselective O&#8208;Glycosylations by Pyrylium Salt Organocatalysis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycosylation method for non&#8208;specialists: Commercially available pyrylium salts catalyze stereoselective glycosylation reactions with trichloroacetimidate electrophiles. A wide range of phenolic nucleophiles are compatible with the procedure. The standard conditions involve mixing three components at ambient conditions and proceed with minimal formation of undesired by&#8208;products.







Abstract
Despite many years of invention, the field of carbohydrate chemistry remains rather inaccessible to non&#8208;specialists, which limits the scientific impact and reach of the discoveries made in the field. Aiming to increase the availability of stereoselective glycosylation chemistry for non&#8208;specialists, we have discovered that several commercially available pyrylium salts catalyze stereoselective O&#8208;glycosylations of a wide range of phenols and alkyl alcohols. This catalytic reaction utilizes trichloroacetimidates, an easily accessible and synthetically proven electrophile, takes place under air and only initiates when all three reagents are mixed, which should provide better reproducibility by non&#8208;specialists. The reaction exhibits varying degrees of stereospecificity, resulting in &#946;&#8208;selective glycosylations from &#945;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates, whilst an &#945;&#8208;selective glycosylation proceeds from &#946;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates. A mechanistic study revealed that the reaction likely proceeds via an SN2&#8208;like substitution on the protonated electrophile.

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction Kinetics on Atomically Dispersed Monovalent ZnI Sites by Rationally Engineering Proton&#8208;Feeding Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed twisted ZnI&#8208;N3+1 structure was developed to accelerate a proton&#8208;feeding process that reduces the energy barrier of, and thereby promotes, the kinetics of the CO2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for CO2 utilization, however the CO2RR process involving multi&#8208;electron and proton transfer is greatly limited by poor selectivity and low yield. Herein, We have developed an atomically dispersed monovalent zinc catalyst anchored on nitrogenated carbon nanosheets (Zn/NC NSs). Benefiting from the unique coordination environment and atomic dispersion, the Zn/NC NSs exhibit a superior CO2RR performance, featuring a high current density up to 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;95&#8201;%. The center ZnI atom coordinated with three N atoms and one N atom that bridges over two adjacent graphitic edges (Zn&#8208;N3+1) is identified as the catalytically active site. Experimental results reveal that the twisted Zn&#8208;N3+1 structure accelerates CO2 activation and protonation in the rate&#8208;determining step of *CO2 to *COOH, while theoretical calculations elucidate that atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N3+1 moieties decrease the potential barriers for intermediate COOH* formation, promoting the proton&#8208;coupled CO2RR kinetics and boosting the overall catalytic performance.

Making the invisible visible. Reactive glycosylation intermediates are identified using chemical exchange saturation transfer NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The stereoselective introduction of the glycosidic bond remains one of the main challenges in carbohydrate synthesis. Characterizing the reactive intermediates of this reaction is key to develop stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Herein we report the characterization of low&#8208;populated, rapidly equilibrating mannosyl dioxanium ions that arise from participation of a C&#8208;3 acyl group using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR spectroscopy. Dioxanium ion structure and equilibration kinetics were measured under relevant glycosylation conditions and highly &#945;&#8208;selective couplings were observed suggesting glycosylation took place via this elusive intermediate.

         <title>Highly Durable and Fully Dispersed Cobalt Diatomic Site Catalysts for CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co dual&#8208;atom catalysts were used for CO2 reduction with superior CH4 selectivity. The charge at the inserted Co2 active sites in tri&#8208;3s&#8208;triazine was enriched as compared to that at Co single sites, thus promoting a lower activation energy barrier by stabilizing the rate&#8208;limiting COOH* and CHO* intermediates.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (DACs) have emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis because the synergistic effect between adjacent metal atoms can promote their catalytic activity while maintaining the advantages of single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts, such as almost 100&#8201;% atomic efficiency and excellent hydrocarbon selectivity. In this study, cobalt&#8208;based atom site catalysts with a Co2&#8211;N coordination structure were synthesized and used for photodriven CO2 reduction. The resulting CoDAC containing 3.5&#8201;% Co atoms demonstrated a superior atom ratio for CO2 reduction catalytic performance, with 65.0&#8201;% CH4 selectivity, which far exceeds that of cobalt&#8208;based single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (CoSACs). The intrinsic reason for the superior activity of CoDACs is the excellent adsorption strength of CO2 and CO* intermediates at dimeric Co active sites.

         <title>Transformation Pathways in Colloidal CdTeSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ternary magic&#8208;size cluster (MSC), CdTeSe MSC&#8208;422 evolved at room temperature while CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399 decreased in a mixture of toluene (Tol) and octylamine (OTA). The transformation goes through corresponding precursor compounds (PCs), with step&#8197;1 transforming PC&#8208;399 to PC&#8208;422, which is rate&#8208;determining and features first&#8208;order reaction kinetics.







Abstract
A rarely studied transformation in colloidal ternary magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) is addressed. We report the first observation of the transformation from ternary CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399 to MSC&#8208;422, which occurs at room temperature. These two MSC types display sharp optical absorption resonances at 399 and 422&#8197;nm, respectively, and are related in that they are quasi isomers, together with their counterpart precursor compounds (PCs). Binary CdTe and CdSe samples were prepared in the prenucleation stage also called the induction period (IP). After they were mixed and placed in a mixture of toluene and octylamine, the transformation was found to take place and to be assisted by the addition of the CdSe IP sample. A binary IP sample contains corresponding binary PCs and monomers (Mo) and fragments (Fr). We argue that the transformation pathway is enabled by the corresponding ternary PCs, involving the substitution reaction, namely CdTeSe PC&#8208;399 + CdSe (Mo/Fr)&#8208;1 &#8658; CdTeSe PC&#8208;422 + CdSe (Mo/Fr)&#8208;2. The present study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the formation characteristics of the MSCs.

         <title>Optical Control of Mitosis with a Photoswitchable Eg5 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eg5 is a kinesin motor protein that is responsible for bipolar spindle formation and plays a crucial role during mitosis. Loss of Eg5 function leads to the formation of monopolar spindles, followed by mitotic arrest, and subsequent cell death. Several cell&#8208;permeable small molecules have been reported to inhibit Eg5 and some have been evaluated as anticancer agents. We now describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of photoswitchable variants with five different pharmacophores. Our lead compound is a cell permeable azobenzene that inhibits Eg5 more potently in its light&#8208;induced cis form. This activity decreased movement in microtubule gliding assays, promoted formation of monopolar spindles, and led to mitotic arrest in a light dependent way.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Monohydrosilanes by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular hydrosilylation strategy was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral monohydrosilanes. This protocol is suitable for the synthesis of dihydrobenzosilole&#8208;, tetrahydrobenzosiline&#8208; and oxatetrahydrobenzosiline&#8208;based monohydrosilanes with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Notably, the catalyst loading could be reduced to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%.







Abstract
Enantiopure monohydrosilanes are versatile chiral reagents for alcohol resolution and mechanistic investigation. Herein, we have demonstrated the asymmetric synthesis of monohydrosilanes via an intramolecular hydrosilylation strategy. This protocol is suitable for the synthesis of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered cyclic monohydrosilanes, including a class of chiral oxasilacycles, with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Notably, the catalyst loading could be reduced to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% which makes this one of the most efficient methods to access chiral monohydrosilanes. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate this Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation reaction might proceed via a Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism, and the enantio&#8208;determining step was predicted to be oxidative addition of Si&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced C4&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Pyridinium Salts with Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;carbonyl alkylation of pyridines was developed by employing various cyclopropanols and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts under mild conditions. This method provides an effective tool for the synthesis of valuable &#946;&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;functionalized carbonyl frameworks with excellent C4 selectivity and the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex and medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization of heteroarenes is of considerable importance for streamlining the rapid modification of bioactive molecules. Herein, we report a general strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;carbonyl alkylation at the C4 position of pyridines with high site selectivity using various cyclopropanols and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. In this process, hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer between the generated sulfonamidyl radicals and O&#8722;H bonds of cyclopropanols generates &#946;&#8208;carbonyl radicals, providing efficient access to synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;pyridylated (aryl)ketones, aldehydes, and esters with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. In addition, the mild method serves as an effective tool for the site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex and medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Selective Benzylic CH&#8208;Borylations by Tandem Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inexpensive cobalt catalyst enables the combination of benzylic CH&#8208;borylation and dehydrocoupling to an overall acceptorless dehydrogenative functionalization of hydrocarbons at mild conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate a tandem catalysis via molecular CoI catalysts.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activations are environmentally and economically attractive synthetic strategies for the construction of functional molecules as they obviate the need for pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and minimize waste generation. Great challenges reside in the control of selectivities, the utilization of unbiased hydrocarbons, and the operation of atom&#8208;economical dehydrocoupling mechanisms. An especially mild borylation of benzylic CH bonds was developed with the ligand&#8208;free pre&#8208;catalyst Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 and the bench&#8208;stable and inexpensive borylation reagent B2pin2 that produces H2 as the only by&#8208;product. A full set of kinetic, spectroscopic, and preparative mechanistic studies are indicative of a tandem catalysis mechanism of CH&#8208;borylation and dehydrocoupling via molecular CoI catalysts.

Phosphines turned to be powerful directing groups for the electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation of arenes. The reaction involves P&#8208;stabilized boreniums as key intermediates. It provides a direct, efficient, and general way of preparing phosphine&#8211;boranes.







Abstract
Spectacular progress has recently been achieved in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines as well as directed electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation. As shown here, P&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation provides a new, straightforward, and efficient access to phosphine&#8211;boranes. It operates under metal&#8208;free conditions and leverages simple, readily available substrates. It is applicable to a broad range of backbones (naphthyl, biphenyl, N&#8208;phenylpyrrole, binaphthyl, benzyl, naphthylmethyl) and gives facile access to various substitution patterns at boron (by varying the boron electrophile or post&#8208;derivatizing the borane moiety). NMR monitoring supports the involvement of P&#8208;stabilized borenium cations as key intermediates. DFT calculations reveal the existence and stabilizing effect of &#960;&#8208;arene/boron interactions in the (biphenyl)(i&#8208;Pr)2P&#8594;BBr2+ species.

         <title>Enhancing Dye&#8208;Triplet&#8208;Sensitized Upconversion Emission Through the Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in CsLu2F7:Yb/Er Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of upconversion (UC) nanocrystals of CsLu2F7:Yb/Er are developed to achieve efficient UC through triplet sensitization of NIR dye IR808, resulting in a 1309&#8208;fold enhancement in UC luminescence intensity and a more than 180&#8208;fold improvement of the absolute UC quantum yield over bare counterparts. Sensitive detection of intracellular ClO&#8722; is demonstrated by virtue of the 808&#8208;nm/980&#8208;nm dual excited ratiometric UC luminescence.







Abstract
Lanthanide (Ln3+)&#8208;doped upconversion (UC) nanoprobes, which have drawn extensive attention for various bioapplications, usually suffer from small absorption cross&#8208;sections and weak luminescence intensity of Ln3+ ions. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of a new class of Ln3+&#8208;doped UC nanoprobes based on CsLu2F7:Yb/Er nanocrystals (NCs), which can effectively increase the intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency from singlet excited state to triplet excited state of IR808 up to 99.3&#8201;% through the heavy atom effect. By virtue of the efficient triplet sensitization of IR808, the optimal UC luminescence (UCL) intensity of IR808&#8208;modified CsLu2F7:Yb/Er NCs is enhanced by 1309 times upon excitation at 808&#8197;nm. Benefiting from the intense dye&#8208;triplet&#8208;sensitized UCL, the nanoprobes are demonstrated for sensitive assay of extracellular and intracellular hypochlorite with an 808&#8208;nm/980&#8208;nm dual excited ratiometric strategy.

Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of a new class of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped UC nanoprobes based on CsLu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;:Yb/Er nanocrystals (NCs), which can effectively increase the intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency from singlet excited state to triplet excited state of IR808 up to 99.3&#8201;% through the heavy atom effect. By virtue of the efficient triplet sensitization of IR808, the optimal UC luminescence (UCL) intensity of IR808-modified CsLu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;:Yb/Er NCs is enhanced by 1309 times upon excitation at 808&#8197;nm. Benefiting from the intense dye-triplet-sensitized UCL, the nanoprobes are demonstrated for sensitive assay of extracellular and intracellular hypochlorite with an 808-nm/980-nm dual excited ratiometric strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An N&#8208;Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization Strategy for Accessing Diverse N&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Azoles from Nitriles and 1,3&#8208;Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable N&#8208;trifluoromethylative cyclization strategy is reported to construct N&#8208;CF3 tetrazoles/imidazoles/1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. N&#8208;CF3 nitrilium derivatives are obtained via the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of nitriles and well used as NCF3&#8208;containing synthons in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cyclizations for the first time. A generic platform for accessing diverse N&#8208;CF3 azoles is thus provided.







Abstract
N&#8208;Trifluoromethyl azoles are valuable targets in medicinal chemistry, but their synthesis is challenging. Classical preparation of N&#8208;CF3 azoles relies on the functional group interconversions but suffers from tedious N&#8208;pre&#8208;functionalization and unfriendly agents. Introduction of the CF3 onto the nitrogen of heterocycles provides a direct route to such motifs, but the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation remains underdeveloped. Reported here is an alternative and scalable cyclization strategy based on NCF3&#8208;containing synthons for constructing N&#8208;CF3 azoles. The approach involves the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of nitriles followed by a [3+2] cyclization between resulting N&#8208;CF3 nitrilium derivatives and 1,3&#8208;dipoles. PhICF3Cl was an effective CF3 source for the transformation. As a result, a generic platform is established to divergently synthesize N&#8208;trifluoromethylated tetrazoles, imidazoles, and 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles by using sodium azide, activated methylene isocyanides, and diazo compounds as dipoles.

         <title>Density&#8208;Dependent Emission Colors from a Conformation&#8208;Switching Chromophore in Polyurethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color emission is achieved from a single fluorescent component by incorporating it into polyurethane matrices. Facilitated by the chemical structure of polyurethanes, the emission color could be modulated from blue to red by simply tuning the density of the chromophores, via either synthetic or physical approaches.







Abstract
Achieving full&#8208;color emission from a single chromophore is not only highly desirable from practical considerations, but also greatly challenging for fundamental research. Herein, we demonstrated the density&#8208;dependent emission colors from a single boron&#8208;containing chromophore, from which multi&#8208;color fluorescent polyurethanes were prepared as well. Originating from its switchable molecular conformations, the emission color of the chromophore was found to be governed by the packing density and strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding interactions. The chromophore was incorporated into polyurethanes to achieve full&#8208;color emitting materials; the emission color was only dependent on the chromophore density and could be tuned via synthetic approach by controlling the compositions. The emission colors could also be modulated by physical approaches, including by swelling/deswelling process, compression under high pressure, and even blending the fluorescent polyurethane with non&#8208;emitting ones.

         <title>Photoinitiated anti&#8208;Hydropentafluorosulfanylation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of new (Z)&#8208;(1&#8208;alken&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanes was performed via the photoinitiated anti&#8208;hydropentafluorosulfanylation of terminal alkynes. The reaction of SF5Cl with 24 substrates in the presence of (TMS)3SiH as a H&#8208;atom donor gave access to the undocumented Z&#8208;isomer. The origins of this unusual selectivity were investigated by DFT calculations, which provide a better understanding of the geometry and reactivity of SF5&#8208;substituted vinylic radicals.







Abstract
A photoinitiated anti&#8208;hydropentafluorosulfanylation of terminal alkynes using SF5Cl and (TMS)3SiH as the hydrogen atom donor is reported. This transformation generates selectively (Z)&#8208;(1&#8208;alken&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanes (Z:E : &gt;85:15), thus allowing the preparation of this previously unknown geometrical isomer. DFT calculations highlight that the selectivity is due to the intrinsic preference of SF5&#8208;substituted vinylic radicals to adopt a cis geometry, and to increased steric contacts during the transition structures leading to the minor (E)&#8208;products.

         <title>Unlocking the Stereoselectivity and Substrate Acceptance of Enzymes: Proline&#8208;Induced Loop Engineering Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>

We report the use of interfaced proline residues as the &#8220;key&#8221; to unlock enzyme evolvability and thus access biocatalysts with highly improved catalytic performance.







Abstract
Protein stability and evolvability influence each other. Although protein dynamics play essential roles in various catalytically important properties, their high flexibility and diversity makes it difficult to incorporate such properties into rational engineering. Therefore, how to unlock the potential evolvability in a user&#8208;friendly rational design process remains a challenge. In this endeavor, we describe a method for engineering an enantioselective alcohol dehydrogenase. It enables synthetically important substrate acceptance for 4&#8208;chlorophenyl pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl ketone, and perfect stereocontrol of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configured products. Thermodynamic analysis unveiled the subtle interaction between enzyme stability and evolvability, while computational studies provided insights into the origin of selectivity and substrate recognition. Preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of the (S)&#8208;product (73&#8201;% yield; &gt;99&#8201;% ee) was performed on a gram&#8208;scale. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates that interfaced proline residues can be rationally engineered to unlock evolvability and thus provide access to new biocatalysts with highly improved catalytic performance.

         <title>Chemoselective and Diastereoselective Synthesis of C&#8208;Aryl Nucleoside Analogues by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Furanosyl Acetates with Aryl Iodides</title>

         <dc:description>
The facile synthesis of C&#8208;aryl nucleoside analogues from readily available furanose acetates and aryl iodides is disclosed. This nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling showed good functional&#8208;group compatibility and excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity. The high chemoselectivity with respect to aryl iodides enabled the efficient preparation of a variety of C&#8208;aryl halide furanosides suitable for various post&#8208;functionalization reactions.







Abstract
Canonical nucleosides are vulnerable to enzymatic and chemical degradation, yet their stable mimics&#8212;C&#8208;aryl nucleosides&#8212;have demonstrated potential utility in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and synthetic biology, although current synthetic methods remain limited in terms of scope and selectivity. Herein, we report a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling to prepare C&#8208;aryl nucleoside analogues from readily available furanosyl acetates and aryl iodides. This nickel&#8208;catalyzed modular approach is characterized by mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity, and high functional&#8208;group compatibility. The exclusive chemoselectivity with respect to the aryl iodide enables efficient preparation of a variety of C&#8208;aryl halide furanosides suitable for various downstream transformations. The practicality of this transformation is demonstrated through the synthesis of a potent analogue of a naturally occurring NF&#8208;&#954;B activator.

         <title>A Biomimetic Approach for Spatially Controlled Cell Membrane Engineering Using Fusogenic Spherical Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural extracellular vesicle&#8208;cell fusion process, we introduced the fusogenic spherical nucleic acid (fuso&#8208;SNA) to achieve spatially controlled cell membrane engineering with DNA by using a liposome fusion&#8208;based transport (LiFT) approach. We demonstrated asymmetric DNA modifications on the cell membrane with orthogonal functionalities on each side, realizing applications such as heterotypic cell assembly and intracellular metabolites detection.







Abstract
Engineering of the cell plasma membrane using functional DNA is important for studying and controlling cellular behaviors. However, most efforts to apply artificial DNA interactions on cells are limited to external membrane surface due to the lack of suitable synthetic tools to engineer the intracellular side, which impedes many applications in cell biology. Inspired by the natural extracellular vesicle&#8208;cell fusion process, we have developed a fusogenic spherical nucleic acid construct to realize robust DNA functionalization on both external and internal cell surfaces via liposome fusion&#8208;based transport (LiFT) strategy, which enables applications including the construction of heterotypic cell assembly for programmed signaling pathway and detection of intracellular metabolites. This approach can engineer cell membranes in a highly efficient and spatially controlled manner, allowing one to build anisotropic membrane structures with two orthogonal DNA functionalities.

         <title>Tetraaryldiborane(4) Can Emit Dual Fluorescence Responding to the Structural Change around the B&#8211;B Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Newly synthesized tetramesityldiborane(4) shows exceptional chemical stability and blue/orange dual fluorescence capability associated with the B&#8722;B bond rotation in the excited state. The relative intensity of the dual fluorescence is sensitive to the viscosity of the medium, highlighting the potential of this diborane(4) as a ratiometric viscosity sensor.







Abstract
We report the successful synthesis of tetramesityldiborane(4) (Mes4B2) through the reductive coupling of a dimesitylborinium ion. Owing to the steric protection conferred by the mesityl groups, Mes4B2 shows exceptional chemical stability and remains intact in water. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that Mes4B2 has an orthogonal geometry, where the B&#8211;B center is completely hidden by the mesityl groups. Remarkably, Mes4B2 emits dual fluorescence at 460 and 620&#8197;nm, both in solution and in the solid state. Theoretical calculations showed that Mes4B2 in the excited S1 state adopts a twisted or planar geometry, which is responsible for the shorter&#8208; or longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence, respectively. The intensity ratio of the dual fluorescence is sensitive to the viscosity of the medium, which suggests that Mes4B2 has potential as a ratiometric viscosity sensor.

         <title>Concurrent Prebiotic Formation of Nucleoside&#8208;Amidophosphates and Nucleoside&#8208;Triphosphates Potentiates Transition from Abiotic to Biotic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DAP mediated prebiotic phosphorylation of nucleosides/nucleotides/oligonucleotides produces a spectrum of the corresponding mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri(amido)phosphorylated derivatives which are substrates for both prebiotic&#8208;oligomerization and biotic&#8208;polymerization/ligation. The compatibility of the phosphorylation and activation chemistry across a broad spectrum of (oligo)nucleos(t)ide structures suggests a smoother transition from chemistry to biology.







Abstract
Polymerization of nucleic acids in biology utilizes 5&#8242;&#8208;nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) as substrates. The prebiotic availability of NTPs has been unresolved and other derivatives of nucleoside&#8208;monophosphates (NMPs) have been studied. However, this latter approach necessitates a change in chemistries when transitioning to biology. Herein we show that diamidophosphate (DAP), in a one&#8208;pot amidophosphorylation&#8208;hydrolysis setting converts NMPs into the corresponding NTPs via 5&#8242;&#8208;nucleoside amidophosphates (NaPs). The resulting crude mixture of NTPs are accepted by proteinaceous&#8208; and ribozyme&#8208;polymerases as substrates for nucleic acid polymerization. This phosphorylation also operates at the level of oligonucleotides enabling ribozyme&#8208;mediated ligation. This one&#8208;pot protocol for simultaneous generation of NaPs and NTPs suggests that the transition from prebiotic&#8208;phosphorylation and oligomerization to an enzymatic processive&#8208;polymerization can be more continuous than previously anticipated.

         <title>Druggable Allosteric Sites in &#946;&#8208;Propeller Lectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug&#8208;like inhibitors for bacterial carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins called lectins are challenging. Computational and experimental analyses (NMR and SPR) of related &#946;&#8208;propeller lectins from Burkholderia ambifaria (BambL), Ralstonia solanacearum (RSL), and Aspergillus fumigatus (AFL) identified druggable secondary pockets, which will support the design of allosteric inhibitors as new therapeutics against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.







Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins (lectins) are auspicious targets in drug discovery to combat antimicrobial resistance; however, their non&#8208;carbohydrate drug&#8208;like inhibitors are still unavailable. Here, we present a druggable pocket in a &#946;&#8208;propeller lectin BambL from Burkholderia ambifaria as a potential target for allosteric inhibitors. This site was identified employing 19F&#8197;NMR fragment screening and a computational pocket prediction algorithm SiteMap. The structure&#8211;activity relationship study revealed the most promising fragment with a dissociation constant of 0.3&#177;0.1&#8197;mM and a ligand efficiency of 0.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;HA&#8722;1 that affected the orthosteric site. This effect was substantiated by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis in the orthosteric and secondary pockets. Future drug&#8208;discovery campaigns that aim to develop small molecule inhibitors can benefit from allosteric sites in lectins as a new therapeutic approach against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.

         <title>Selective 1H&#945; NMR Methods Reveal Functionally Relevant Proline cis/trans Isomers in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins: Characterization of Minor Forms, Effects of Phosphorylation, and Occurrence in Proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective 1H&#945;&#8208;detected NMR methods were developed to study cis/trans isomerization in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) under physiological conditions. Using p53TAD1&#8211;60 proline (Pro) isomers with low population were identified and the variation of the cis/trans&#8208;Pro equilibrium was monitored upon phosphorylation. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate how the amino acid type influences Pro isomer formation.







Abstract
It is important to identify proline cis/trans isomers that appear in several regulatory mechanisms of proteins, and to characterize minor species that are present due to the conformational heterogeneity in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). To obtain residue level information on these mobile systems we introduce two 1H&#945;&#8208;detected, proline selective, real&#8208;time homodecoupled NMR experiments and analyze the proline abundant transactivation domain of p53. The measurements are sensitive enough to identify minor conformers present in 4&#8211;15&#8201;% amounts; moreover, we show the consequences of CK2 phosphorylation on the cis/trans&#8208;proline equilibrium. Using our results and available literature data we perform a statistical analysis on how the amino acid type effects the cis/trans&#8208;proline distribution. The methods are applicable under physiological conditions, they can contribute to find key proline isomers in proteins, and statistical analysis results may help in amino acid sequence optimization for biotechnological purposes.

         <title>Conformational Adaptation of &#946;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers for the Formation of Metal&#8211;Peptide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag+&#8208;coordination&#8208;mediated assembly of &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers led to the formation of distinctive metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with unique interwoven topologies. Formation of the network structures was accompanied by unusual conformational distortions of the foldamer ligands. These new metal&#8211;peptide frameworks built from modular foldamers may provide useful molecular platforms for further structural evolution and mechanistic investigation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;coordinated frameworks derived from small peptidic ligands have received much attention thanks to peptides&#8217; vast structural and functional diversity. Various peptides with partial conformational preferences have been used to build metal&#8211;peptide frameworks, however, the use of conformationally constrained &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers has not been explored yet. Herein we report the first metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;mediated assembly of &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers with 12&#8208;helical folding propensity. The coordination of Ag+ to the terminal pyridyl moieties afforded a set of metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with unique entangled topologies. Interestingly, formation of the network structures was accompanied by notable conformational distortions of the foldamer ligands. As the first demonstration of new metal&#8211;peptide frameworks built from modular &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers, we anticipate that this work will be an important benchmark for further structural evolution and mechanistic investigation.

         <title>Macrocyclic Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads Composed of a Perylene Bisimide Dye Surrounded by Oligothiophene Bridges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of a perylene bisimide dye bridged by one or two quinquethiophene units are described. The compounds show panchromatic light absorption in the UV/Vis spectrum, multiple reversible redox processes, and a highly efficient charge separation by photoinduced electron transfer.







Abstract
Two macrocyclic architectures comprising oligothiophene strands that connect the imide positions of a perylene bisimide (PBI) dye have been synthesized via a platinum&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling strategy. The crystal structure of the double bridged PBI reveals all syn&#8208;arranged thiophene units that completely enclose the planar PBI chromophore via a 12&#8208;membered macrocycle. The target structures were characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy, as well as cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry. Both donor&#8211;acceptor dyads show ultrafast F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer and photoinduced electron transfer, thereby leading to extremely low fluorescence quantum yields even in the lowest polarity cyclohexane solvent.

         <title>Installing a Green Engine To Drive an Enzyme Cascade: A Light&#8208;Powered In Vitro Biosystem for Poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thylakoid membranes were introduced into an in vitro biosystem for the synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate to enable the conversion of light energy into biological energy through the regeneration of NADPH and ATP (see picture). The use of thylakoid membranes as a green engine in this way is a promising strategy for light&#8208;powered cell&#8208;free biomanufacturing.







Abstract
Many existing in vitro biosystems harness power from the chemical energy contained in substrates and co&#8208;substrates, and light or electric energy provided from abiotic parts, leading to a compromise in atom economy, incompatibility between biological and abiotic parts, and most importantly, incapability to spatiotemporally co&#8208;regenerate ATP and NADPH. In this study, we developed a light&#8208;powered in vitro biosystem for poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) synthesis using natural thylakoid membranes (TMs) to regenerate ATP and NADPH for a five&#8208;enzyme cascade. Through effective coupling of cofactor regeneration and mass conversion, 20&#8197;mM PHB was yielded from 50&#8197;mM sodium acetate with a molar conversion efficiency of carbon of 80.0&#8201;% and a light&#8208;energy conversion efficiency of 3.04&#8201;%, which are much higher than the efficiencies of similar in vitro PHB synthesis biosystems. This suggests the promise of installing TMs as a green engine to drive more enzyme cascades.

         <title>Active Exsolved Metal&#8211;Oxide Interfaces in Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline Ceria Monoliths for Efficient and Durable CH4/CO2 Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we created active metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths with in situ exsolved single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles and show efficient and durable CH4/CO2 reforming at a relatively low temperature of 450&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 provides an attractive route to convert greenhouse gas into syngas; however, the resistance to sintering and coking of catalyst remains a fundamental challenge at high operation temperatures. Here we create active and durable metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) CeO2 monoliths with in situ exsolved single&#8208;crystalline (SC) Ni particles and show efficient dry reforming of CH4/CO2 at temperatures as low as 450&#8201;&#176;C. We show the excellent and durable performance with &#8776;20&#8201;% of CH4 conversion and &#8776;30&#8201;% of CO2 conversion even in a continuous operation of 240&#8197;hours. The well&#8208;defined active metal&#8211;oxide interfaces, created by exsolving SC Ni nanoparticles from PSC NixCe1&#8722;xO2 to anchor them on PSC CeO2 scaffolds, prevent nanoparticle sintering and enhance the coking resistance due to the stronger metal&#8211;support interactions. Our work would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the technique of creating active and durable metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in PSC monoliths could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dry reforming of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; provides an attractive route to convert greenhouse gas into syngas; however, the resistance to sintering and coking of catalyst remains a fundamental challenge at high operation temperatures. Here we create active and durable metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in porous single-crystalline (PSC) CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monoliths with in situ exsolved single-crystalline (SC) Ni particles and show efficient dry reforming of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at temperatures as low as 450&#8201;&#176;C. We show the excellent and durable performance with &#8776;20&#8201;% of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and &#8776;30&#8201;% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion even in a continuous operation of 240&#8197;hours. The well-defined active metal&#8211;oxide interfaces, created by exsolving SC Ni nanoparticles from PSC Ni&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ce&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to anchor them on PSC CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scaffolds, prevent nanoparticle sintering and enhance the coking resistance due to the stronger metal&#8211;support interactions. Our work would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the technique of creating active and durable metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in PSC monoliths could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Maximizing Electroactive Sites in a Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Significantly Improved Carbon Dioxide Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D imide&#8208;bonded covalent organic framework (COF) composed of cobalt&#8208;phthalocyanine subunits has been prepared and used in CO2 reduction reaction electrocatalysis, showing the high CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion Faradaic efficiency. In particular, the active electrocatalytic centers and current density (jCO) of this 3D COF have been significantly improved in comparison to that of the 2D COF electrocatalyst with the same phthalocyanine subunits.







Abstract
Synthesis of functional 3D COFs with irreversible bond is challenging. Herein, 3D imide&#8208;bonded COFs were constructed via the imidization reaction between phthalocyanine&#8208;based tetraanhydride and 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)adamantine. These two 3D COFs are made up of interpenetrated pts networks according to powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas adsorption analyses. CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;3 doped with carbon black has been employed to fabricate the electrocatalytic cathode towards CO2 reduction reaction within KHCO3 aqueous solution, displaying the Faradaic efficiency of 88&#8211;96&#8201;% for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at the voltage range of ca. &#8722;0.60 to &#8722;1.00&#8197;V (vs. RHE). In particular, the 3D porous structure of CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;3 enables the active electrocatalytic centers occupying 32.7&#8201;% of total cobalt&#8208;phthalocyanine subunits, thus giving a large current density (jCO) of &#8722;31.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.90&#8197;V. These two parameters are significantly improved than the excellent 2D COF analogue (CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;1, 5.1&#8201;% and &#8722;21.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>The Aryne Phosphate Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of phosphates to act as efficient arynophiles is demonstrated. The resulting aryne phosphate reaction is a versatile tool for arene phosphorylation or phosphate arylation. A broad scope of variously arylated phosphate products is culminating in novel nucleotide analogues and a benchmarking octaphosphorylation.







Abstract
Condensed phosphates are a critically important class of molecules in biochemistry. Non&#8208;natural analogues are important for various applications, such as single&#8208;molecule real&#8208;time DNA sequencing. Often, such analogues contain more than three phosphate units in their oligophosphate chain. Consequently, investigations into phosphate reactivity enabling new ways of phosphate functionalization and oligophosphorylation are essential. Here, we scrutinize the potential of phosphates to act as arynophiles, paving the way for follow&#8208;up oligophosphorylation reactions. The aryne phosphate reaction is a powerful tool to&#8212;depending on the perspective&#8212;(oligo)phosphorylate arenes or arylate (oligo&#8208;cyclo)phosphates. Based on Kobayashi&#8208;type o&#8208;silylaryltriflates, the aryne phosphate reaction enables rapid entry into a broad spectrum of arylated products, like monophosphates, diphosphates, phosphodiesters and polyphosphates. The synthetic potential of these new transformations is demonstrated by efficient syntheses of nucleotide analogues and an unprecedented one&#8208;flask octaphosphorylation.

         <title>Selective Approaches to &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Arylated Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzyl vinyl ethers have selectively been arylated at either &#945; or &#946; position by fine&#8208;tuned Heck&#8208;type palladium catalyses. In contrast to previous protocols, no excess of arylating reagent or substrate chelation is necessary. For achieving good yields and high &#945;/&#946;&#8208;selectivities various factors determining the catalytic system had to be optimized. The results of DFT computational studies correlate selectivity with electron richness on the Pd center.







Abstract
We developed simple and efficient protocols for palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;arylations of structurally diverse vinyl ethers. Both catalytic methods proceed under relatively mild reactions conditions applying to a broad substrate range including more complex compounds providing arylated glucal or isochromene. Lacking the common requirement of a large reagent excess, the transformations are highly economic and limiting the waste production. Results from computational studies (DFT) provided insight into the key factors determining the pronounced regioselectivities of the investigated reactions.

         <title>Structural and Molecular Basis of the Catalytic Mechanism of Geranyl Pyrophosphate C6&#8208;Methyltransferase: Creation of an Unprecedented Farnesyl Pyrophosphate C6&#8208;Methyltransferase</title>

         <dc:description>
The structures of a geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) C6&#8208;methyltransferase, BezA, and its complex with S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine were solved by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Further analysis based on site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and computational calculations provided the molecular basis of the methylation reaction. Furthermore, an unprecedented farnesyl pyrophosphate C6&#8208;methyltransferase was created by introducing a W210A substitution.







Abstract
Prenyl pyrophosphate methyltransferases enhance the structural diversity of terpenoids. However, the molecular basis of their catalytic mechanisms is poorly understood. In this study, using multiple strategies, we characterized a geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) C6&#8208;methyltransferase, BezA. Biochemical analysis revealed that BezA requires Mg2+ and solely methylates GPP. The crystal structures of BezA and its complex with S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine were solved at 2.10 and 2.56&#8197;&#197;, respectively. Further analyses using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations revealed the molecular basis of the methylation reaction. Importantly, the function of E170 as a catalytic base to complete the methylation reaction was established. We also succeeded in switching the substrate specificity by introducing a W210A substitution, resulting in an unprecedented farnesyl pyrophosphate C6&#8208;methyltransferase.

         <title>Five&#8208;Fold Symmetric Pentaindolo&#8208; and Pentakis(benzoindolo)Corannulenes: Unique Structural Dynamics Derived from the Combination of Helical and Bowl Inversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peripherally &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes with five azahelicene units were prepared and their structural dynamics were studied experimentally and theoretically. This motif contains many conformational isomers owing to the helical and bowl chiralities. The interconversion networks were explored by using GRRM17 program, which revealed that the co&#8208;existing corannulene and azahelicene moieties lower the activation energy barriers for some isomerization processes.







Abstract
Peripherally &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes bearing quintuple azahelicene units, 10 and 11, were prepared and their dynamic behaviors were studied experimentally and theoretically. The fused corannulenes were synthesized from sym&#8208;pentabromocorannulene in three steps. X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis for 10 displayed a conformer possessing a P(M) bowl chirality and a PPMPM (PMPMM) helical chirality, which was found to be the most stable conformer(s). Variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements of 10 and 11 revealed that their structural isomers can be interconvertible in solution, depending on the steric congestion around the helical scaffolds. Automated search for conformers in the equilibrium and transition states by Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method revealed their interconversion networks, including bowl&#8208;inversion and helical&#8208;inversion. This analysis indicated that the co&#8208;existing corannulene and azahelicene moieties influence the conformational dynamics, which leads to mitigation of the activation energy barriers for isomerization.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Specific Targeting of Ibrutinib: Introducing Electrostatic Antibody&#8208;Inhibitor Conjugates (AiCs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo evaluation of a vesicular ibrutinib&#8208;Cy3.5 hosting nanocarrier is reported. In&#8197;vivo, it shows a significant enrichment of the drug in xenograft lymphoma tumors in immune&#8208;compromised mice and gave a significantly better response at much lower dosage than the original untargeted drug.







Abstract
Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase that has been approved for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and is connected with toxicities. To minimize its toxicities, we linked ibrutinib to a cell&#8208;targeted, internalizing antibody. To this end, we synthesized a poly&#8208;anionic derivate, ibrutinib&#8208;Cy3.5, that retains full functionality. This anionic inhibitor is complexed by our anti&#8208;CD20&#8208;protamine targeting conjugate and free protamine, and thereby spontaneously assembles into an electrostatically stabilized vesicular nanocarrier. The complexation led to an accumulation of the drug driven by the CD20 antigen internalization to the intended cells and an amplification of its pharmacological effectivity. In&#8197;vivo, we observed a significant enrichment of the drug in xenograft lymphoma tumors in immune&#8208;compromised mice and a significantly better response to lower doses compared to the original drug.

         <title>Macrocycle Dynamics in a Branched [8]Catenane Controlled by Three Different Stimuli in Three Different Regions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A branched [8]catenane was synthesized from a one&#8208;pot procedure with good efficiency. Rigidifying/loosening the mechanical bond in the core, middle or periphery of the [8]catenane resulted in, respectively a large, middle and small degree of change in the catenane dynamics and flexibility.







Abstract
A branched [8]catenane from an efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis (72&#8201;% HPLC yield, 59&#8201;% isolated yield) featuring the simultaneous use of three kinds of templates and cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;mediated azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CBAAC) for ring&#8208;closing is reported. Design and assembly of the [8]catenane precursors are unexpectedly complex that can involve cooperating, competing and non&#8208;influencing interactions. Due to the branched structure, dynamics of the [8]catenane can be modulated in different extent by rigidifying/loosening the mechanical bonds at different regions by using solvent polarity, acid&#8208;base and metal ions as the stimuli. This work not only highlights the importance of understanding the delicate interplay of the weak and non&#8208;obvious supramolecular interactions in the synthesis of high&#8208;order [n]catenane, but also demonstrates a complex control of dynamics and flexibility for exploiting [n]catenanes applications.

         <title>Synthesis, Aromaticity, and Application of peri&#8208;Pentacenopentacene: Localized Representation of Benzenoid Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acenes and peri&#8208;acenoacenes should be seen as &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems containing one and two localized aromatic sextets, respectively, flanked with ortho&#8208;fused diene fragments. The vertical extension of TIPS&#8208;PEN, TIPS&#8208;PPP, has been prepared from a dione precursor and absorbs at longer wavelengths, is 16 times more stable, exhibits a 2D brickwall motif in crystals with stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and a smaller reorganization energy.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of TIPS&#8208;peri&#8208;pentacenopentacene (TIPS&#8208;PPP), a vertical extension of TIPS&#8208;pentacene (TIPS&#8208;PEN) and a low&#8208;band&#8208;gap material with remarkable stability. We found the synthetic conditions to avoid the competition between 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;addition of lithium acetylide on the large aromatic dione. The high stability of TIPS&#8208;PPP is due to the peri&#8208;fusion which increases the aromaticity by generating two localized aromatic sextets that are flanked with 2 diene fragments, similar to two fused&#8208;anthracenes. Like TIPS&#8208;PEN, TIPS&#8208;PPP shows the archetypal 2D brickwall motif in crystals with a larger transfer integral and smaller reorganization energy. The high mobility of up to 1&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was obtained in an organic field&#8208;effect transistor fabricated by a wet process. Also, TIPS&#8208;PPP was used as a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitter for NIR organic&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode devices resulting in a high external quantum efficiency at 800&#8197;nm.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Access to Axially Chiral Olefins via C&#8722;H Bond Activation and Directing Group Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two classes of tetrasubstituted axially chiral olefins have been accessed in excellent enantioselectivity via RhIII&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation assisted by a migratable directing group.







Abstract
Axially chiral open&#8208;chain olefins represent an underexplored class of chiral platform. In this report, two classes of tetrasubstituted axially chiral acyclic olefins have been accessed in excellent enantioselectivity and regioselectivity via C&#8722;H activation of (hetero)arenes assisted by a migratable directing group en route to coupling with sterically hindered alkynes. The coupling of indoles bearing an N&#8208;aminocarbonyl directing group afforded C&#8211;N axially chiral acrylamides with the assistance of a racemic zinc carboxylate additive. DFT studies suggest a &#946;&#8208;nitrogen elimination&#8211;reinsertion pathway for the directing group migration. Meanwhile, the employment of N&#8208;phenoxycarboxamide delivered C&#8722;C axially chiral enamides via migration of the oxidizing directing group. Experiments suggest that in both cases the (hetero)arene substrate adopts a well&#8208;defined orientation during the C&#8722;H activation, which in turn determines the disposition of the alkyne in migratory insertion. Synthetic applications of representative chiral olefins are demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Two classes of tetrasubstituted axially chiral olefins have been accessed in excellent enantioselectivity via Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation assisted by a migratable directing group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axially chiral open-chain olefins represent an underexplored class of chiral platform. In this report, two classes of tetrasubstituted axially chiral acyclic olefins have been accessed in excellent enantioselectivity and regioselectivity via C&#8722;H activation of (hetero)arenes assisted by a migratable directing group en route to coupling with sterically hindered alkynes. The coupling of indoles bearing an N-aminocarbonyl directing group afforded C&#8211;N axially chiral acrylamides with the assistance of a racemic zinc carboxylate additive. DFT studies suggest a &#946;-nitrogen elimination&#8211;reinsertion pathway for the directing group migration. Meanwhile, the employment of N-phenoxycarboxamide delivered C&#8722;C axially chiral enamides via migration of the oxidizing directing group. Experiments suggest that in both cases the (hetero)arene substrate adopts a well-defined orientation during the C&#8722;H activation, which in turn determines the disposition of the alkyne in migratory insertion. Synthetic applications of representative chiral olefins are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Porous Aromatic Framework Membranes with Modifiable Sites for Optimized Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) with stable carbon&#8211;carbon linkages and chemically modifiable pores were shaped into continuous membranes, which are capable of separating industrially valuable gas mixtures, including H2/N2 and CO2/N2. With modulation of the pore structure or chemical environment, the separation performance of continuous PAF membranes exceeded their corresponding Robeson's upper bounds.







Abstract
Continuous microporous membranes are widely studied for gas separation, due to their low energy premium and strong molecular specificity. Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) with their exceptional stability and structural flexibility are suited to a wide range of separations. Main&#8208;stream PAF&#8208;based membranes are usually prepared with polymeric matrices, but their discrete entities and boundary defects weaken their selectivity and permeability. The synthesis of continuous PAF membranes is still a major challenge because PAFs are insoluble. Herein, we successfully synthesized a continuous PAF membrane for gas separation. Both pore size and chemistry of the PAF membrane were modified by ion&#8208;exchange, resulting in good selectivity and permeance for the gas mixtures H2/N2 and CO2/N2. The membrane with Br&#8722; as a counter ion in the framework exhibited a H2/N2 selectivity of 72.7 with a H2 permeance of 51844 gas permeation units (GPU). When the counter ions were replaced by BF4&#8722;, the membrane showed a CO2 permeance of 23058&#8197;GPU, and an optimized CO2/N2 selectivity of 60.0. Our results show that continuous PAF membranes with modifiable pores are promising for various gas separation situations.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based Crosslinked Polymer Networks for Highly Effective Iodine Adsorption from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based crosslinked polymer networks was synthesized via Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara polycondensation. One system, C[4]P&#8208;BTP, was found to be highly effective for iodine capture from water with an uptake capacity of 3.24&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 and quick kinetics (kobs=7.814&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8197;min&#8722;1). Flow&#8208;through adsorption experiments revealed that C[4]P&#8208;BTP was able to remove 93.2&#8201;% of iodine from an aqueous phase with a flow rate of 1&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1.







Abstract
A series of calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based crosslinked polymer networks designed for iodine capture is reported. These materials were prepared by Sonogashira coupling of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;alkynylphenyl)calix[4]pyrrole with bishalide building blocks with different electronic properties and molecular sizes. Despite their low Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas, iodine vapor adsorption capacities of up to 3.38&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 were seen, a finding ascribed to the presence of a large number of effective sorption sites including macrocyclic &#960;&#8208;rich cavities, aryl units, and alkyne groups within the material. One particular system, C[4]P&#8208;BTP, was found to be highly effective at iodine capture from water (uptake capacity of 3.24&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 from a concentrated aqueous KI/I2 solution at ambient temperature). Fast capture kinetics (kobs=7.814&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1) were seen. Flow&#8208;through adsorption experiments revealed that C[4]P&#8208;BTP is able to remove 93.2&#8201;% of iodine from an aqueous source phase at a flow rate of 1&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1.

         <title>Divergent and Modular Synthesis of Terpenoid Scaffolds via a AuI Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot sequence involving an exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a Lewis acid gold(I) catalyzed cyclization has allowed access to three complex polycyclic scaffolds. Structural diversity is obtained by varying solvent and the ligand of the gold(I) catalyst. An additional Diels&#8211;Alder step generates tetracyclic cores possessing up to 5 stereocenters.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot cascade sequence to generate synthetically challenging polycyclic scaffolds is reported utilizing a novel Lewis acid gold catalyst for the key cyclization step, enabling the divergent synthesis of both 6,6,5&#8208;tricyclic and 6,6,6,5&#8208;tetracyclic cores through both ligand and reaction condition control. We have combined the intrinsic complexity and stereoselectivity of cycloadditions with the electronic and steric properties of gold complexes to selectively generate complex polycyclic scaffolds in a single operation.

         <title>Energy Band Alignment and Redox&#8208;Active Sites in Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Spaced Metal&#8208;Catechol Frameworks for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of hydro&#8208;stable metalloporphyrin&#8208;bridged metal&#8208;phenate frameworks are constructed, which exhibit artificial photosynthetic activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation without photosensitizer or sacrificial agent. Activity is boosted by substitution of the Fe&#8208;oxo chain for an In&#8208;oxo chain, and further enhanced by addition of the uncoordinated hydroxyl groups of catechol into the scaffold.







Abstract
Two new chemically stable metalloporphyrin&#8208;bridged metal&#8208;catechol frameworks, InTCP&#8208;Co and FeTCP&#8208;Co, were constructed to achieve artificial photosynthesis without additional sacrificial agents and photosensitizers. The CO2 photoreduction rate over FeTCP&#8208;Co considerably exceeds that obtained over InTCP&#8208;Co, and the incorporation of uncoordinated hydroxyl groups, associated with catechol, into the network further promotes the photocatalytic activity. The iron&#8208;oxo coordination chain assists energy band alignment and provides a redox&#8208;active site, and the uncoordinated hydroxyl group contributes to the visible&#8208;light absorptance, charge&#8208;carrier transfer, and CO2&#8208;scaffold affinity. With a formic acid selectivity of 97.8&#8201;%, FeTCP&#8208;OH&#8208;Co affords CO2 photoconversion with a reaction rate 4.3 and 15.7 times higher than those of FeTCP&#8208; Co and InTCP&#8208;Co, respectively. These findings are also consistent with the spectroscopic study and DFT calculation.

         <title>Mo3S132&#8722; Intercalated Layered Double Hydroxide: Highly Selective Removal of Heavy Metals and Simultaneous Reduction of Ag+ Ions to Metallic Ag0 Ribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation of Mo3S132&#8722; into MgAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) gives a new material, Mo3S13&#8208;LDH, which exhibits enormous adsorption capacities of noble metal silver (qmAg=1073&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and toxic Hg2+ (qmHg=594&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) as well as high uptake selectivity for Ag+ and Cu2+. Both S22&#8722; and Mo4+ in Mo3S13&#8208;LDH contribute to the reduction of Ag+ to metallic Ag0.







Abstract
We demonstrate a new material by intercalating Mo3S132&#8722; into Mg/Al layered double hydroxide (abbr. Mo3S13&#8208;LDH), exhibiting excellent capture capability for toxic Hg2+ and noble metal silver (Ag). The as&#8208;prepared Mo3S13&#8208;LDH displays ultra&#8208;high selectivity of Ag+, Hg2+ and Cu2+ in the presence of various competitive ions, with the order of Ag+&gt;Hg2+&gt;Cu2+&gt;Pb2+&#8805;Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+. For Ag+ and Hg2+, extremely fast adsorption rates (&#8776;90&#8201;% within 10&#8197;min, &gt;99&#8201;% in 1&#8197;h) are observed. Much high selectivity is present for Ag+ and Cu2+, especially for trace amounts of Ag+ (&#8776;1&#8197;ppm), achieving a large separation factor (SFAg/Cu) of &#8776;8000 at the large Cu/Ag ratio of 520. The overwhelming adsorption capacities for Ag+ (qmAg=1073&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Hg2+ (qmHg=594&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) place the Mo3S13&#8208;LDH at the top of performing sorbent materials. Most importantly, Mo3S13&#8208;LDH captures Ag+ via two paths: a) formation of Ag2S due to Ag&#8208;S complexation and precipitation, and b) reduction of Ag+ to metallic silver (Ag0). The Mo3S13&#8208;LDH is a promising material to extract low&#8208;grade silver from copper&#8208;rich minerals and trap highly toxic Hg2+ from polluted water.

         <dc:description>
Fusion of extracellular vesicles to cells contributes to many critical biological pathways. Inspired by the natural fusion process, Hang Xing and co&#8208;workers developed a liposome fusion&#8208;based transport strategy, termed LiFT, that enables the incorporation of a variety of functional moieties onto both external and internal cell membrane surfaces with precise orientation control (e202111647). By using LiFT, asymmetric DNA modifications with orthogonal functionalities on each side of the cell membrane were achieved, realizing applications such as heterotypic cell assembly and intracellular metabolite detection.

         <title>Inside Cover: Continuous Porous Aromatic Framework Membranes with Modifiable Sites for Optimized Gas Separation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous aromatic framework (PAF) membranes with modifiable channels were synthesized by Yuyang Tian, Guangshan Zhu, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202113682). The pore size and chemistry of the membranes were readily modified by ion exchange, resulting in suitable membranes for the separation of different gas mixtures. With Br&#8722; in the framework, the membrane exhibited a H2/N2 selectivity of 72.7 with a H2 permeance of 51844 gas permeation units (GPU). With BF4&#8722;, the membrane showed a CO2 permeance of 23058&#8197;GPU, and an optimized CO2/N2 selectivity of 60.0 was achieved.

Diamidophosphate enabled phosphorylation chemistry facilitates the synthesis of closely related nucleotides and nucleoside triphosphates that are compatible with abiotic oligomerization, and ribozyme&#8208;mediated polymerization and ligation processes. The one&#8208;pot protocol spans nucleosides, nucleotides, and oligonucleotides, implying that the progression from prebiotic chemistry to those conducive for emergence of life's biochemistry could be a more continuous process than previously assumed. Details are discussed in the Research Article by Ulrich&#8197;F. M&#252;ller, Ramanarayanan Krishnamurthy, and co&#8208;workers (e202113625).

         <title>Cover Picture: Tetraaryldiborane(4) Can Emit Dual Fluorescence Responding to the Structural Change around the B&#8211;B Bond (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The blue/orange dual fluorescence properties of tetramesityldiborane(4) are reported by Yoshiaki Shoji, Yasuhiro Ikabata et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202113549). Theoretical calculations showed that the diborane(4) in the S1 state adopts a twisted or planar geometry, which is responsible for the blue or orange fluorescence, respectively. The relative intensity of the dual fluorescence is sensitive to the viscosity of the medium, highlighting the potential of the diborane(4) as a ratiometric viscosity sensor.

         <title>Principles of Water Electrolysis and Recent Progress in Cobalt&#8208;, Nickel&#8208;, and Iron&#8208;Based Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review describes the basic principles of water electrolysis, key aspects of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and significant criteria for the development of new catalysts. Recent advances in catalysts based on Co, Ni, and Fe oxides are described, and a brief perspective is given on green hydrogen production and the challenges of water electrolysis.







Abstract
Water electrolysis that results in green hydrogen is the key process towards a circular economy. The supply of sustainable electricity and availability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are the main bottlenecks of the process for large&#8208;scale production of green hydrogen. A broad range of OER electrocatalysts have been explored to decrease the overpotential and boost the kinetics of this sluggish half&#8208;reaction. Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, and Fe&#8208;based catalysts have been considered to be potential candidates to replace noble metals due to their tunable 3d electron configuration and spin state, versatility in terms of crystal and electronic structures, as well as abundance in nature. This Review provides some basic principles of water electrolysis, key aspects of OER, and significant criteria for the development of the catalysts. It provides also some insights on recent advances of Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, and Fe&#8208;based oxides and a brief perspective on green hydrogen production and the challenges of water electrolysis.

         <title>Organic Matrix Assisted Low&#8208;temperature Crystallization of Black Phase Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic matrix can assist the crystallization of all&#8208;organic perovskites at temperatures lower than the phase transition point of black phase CsPbX3 perovskite. This low&#8208;temperature crystallization takes place through the formation and decomposition of an intermediate state which is reminiscent of an organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite matrix.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic perovskites have attracted increasing attention for applications in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and optoelectronics, including light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs). Cesium lead halide perovskites with tunable I/Br ratios and a band gap aligning with the sunlight region are promising candidates for PSCs. Although impressive progress has been made to improve device efficiency from the initial 2.9&#8201;% with low phase stability to over 20&#8201;% with high stability, there are still questions regarding the perovskite crystal growth mechanism, especially at low temperatures. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments in using an organic matrix, including the addition and use of organic ions, polymers, and solvent molecules, for the crystallization of black phase inorganic perovskites at temperatures lower than the phase transition point. We also discuss possible mechanisms for this low&#8208;temperature crystallization and their effect on the stability of black phase perovskites. We conclude with an outlook and perspective for further fabrication of large&#8208;scale inorganic perovskites for optoelectronic applications.

Although impressive progress has been made to improve device efficiency from the initial 2.9&#8201;% with low phase stability to over 20&#8201;% with high stability, there are still questions regarding the perovskite crystal growth mechanism, especially at low temperatures. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments in using an organic matrix, including the addition and use of organic ions, polymers, and solvent molecules, for the crystallization of black phase inorganic perovskites at temperatures lower than the phase transition point. We also discuss possible mechanisms for this low-temperature crystallization and their effect on the stability of black phase perovskites. We conclude with an outlook and perspective for further fabrication of large-scale inorganic perovskites for optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterocycle/Heteroallene Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerization: Selective Catalysis Delivering Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) is a powerful living polymerisation that yields numerous alternating copolymers with precisely placed heteroatoms in the polymer backbones. This Review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of this important method, describes the principles of the catalysis, and illustrates the potential of the different monomer combinations and resulting polymers. Trends and future challenges of this approach and the resulting materials are highlighted.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;containing polymers have strong potential as sustainable replacements for petrochemicals, show controllable monomer&#8211;polymer equilibria and properties spanning plastics, elastomers, fibres, resins, foams, coatings, adhesives, and self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Their current and future applications span packaging, house&#8208;hold goods, clothing, automotive components, electronics, optical materials, sensors, and medical products. An interesting route to these polymers is the catalysed ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) of heterocycles and heteroallenes. It is a living polymerization, occurs with high atom economy, and creates precise, new polymer structures inaccessible by traditional methods. In the last decade there has been a renaissance in research and increasing examples of commercial products made using ROCOP. It is better known in the production of polycarbonates and polyesters, but is also a powerful route to make N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and other heteroatom&#8208;containing polymers, including polyamides, polycarbamates, and polythioesters. This Review presents an overview of the different catalysts, monomer combinations, and polymer classes that can be accessed by heterocycle/heteroallene ROCOP.

         <title>Accessing Unsymmetrically Linked Heterocycles through Stereoselective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>

Solving alkynes of problems with palladium. A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides and aryl iodides with alkyne&#8208;tethered aryl nucleophiles is reported. This methodology unsymmetrically links heterocycles along a tetrasubstituted olefin with &gt;20:1 E/Z selectivity and up to 96&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy is presented to synthesize unsymmetrically linked heterocycles within stereoselective tetrasubstituted olefins. This reaction is proposed to occur via a vinyl&#8208;PdII intermediate capable of initiating the cyclization of various alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles. Products are formed in up to 96&#8201;% yield and excellent stereoselectivities are obtained using low catalyst loadings. This transformation was scalable up to 1&#8197;mmol and mechanistic studies suggest a syn&#8208;carbopalladation of the carbamoyl chloride followed by PdII&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles.

         <title>Stacked but not Stuck: Unveiling the Role of &#960;&#8594;&#960;* Interactions with the Help of the Benzofuran&#8211;Formaldehyde Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8594;&#960;* interaction is discovered to be by far the main stabilizing contribution in the benzofuran&#8211;formaldehyde adduct, resulting in an interaction energy of &#8722;16.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The characterization of eleven singly&#8208;substituted isotopologues allowed for an accurate semi&#8208;experimental equilibrium structure determination, which points out a carbon&#8211;carbon distance (3.2257&#177;0.0006&#8197;&#197;) between formaldehyde and benzofuran shorter than the sum of the carbon van der Waals radii.







Abstract
The 1:1 benzofuran&#8211;formaldehyde complex has been chosen as model system for analyzing &#960;&#8594;&#960;* interactions in supramolecular organizations involving heteroaromatic rings and carbonyl groups. A joint &#8220;rotational spectroscopy&#8211;quantum chemistry&#8221; strategy unveiled the dominant role of &#960;&#8594;&#960;* interactions in tuning the intermolecular interactions of such adduct. The exploration of the intermolecular potential energy surface led to the identification of 14 low&#8208;energy minima, with 4 stacked isomers being more stable than those linked by hydrogen bond or lone&#8208;pair&#8594;&#960; interactions. All energy minima are separated by loose transition states, thus suggesting an effective relaxation to the global minimum under the experimental conditions. This expectation has been confirmed by the experimental detection of only one species, which was unambiguously assigned owing to the computation of accurate spectroscopic parameters and the characterization of 11 isotopologues. The large number of isotopic species opened the way to the determination of the first semi&#8208;experimental equilibrium structure for a molecular complex of such a dimension.

         <title>Photocatalytic Sulfonylcarbocyclization of Alkynes Using SEt as a Traceless Directing Group: Access to Cyclopentenes and Indenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic sulfonylcarbocyclization of terminal alkynes using SEt as a traceless directing group is developed, providing a facile access to highly substituted cyclopentenes and indenes from readily available starting materials. It represents a new advance on anti&#8208;Baldwin 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization of all&#8208;carbon systems, which may be valuable for the fast construction of five&#8208;membered carbocycles.







Abstract
Cyclopentenes and indenes are important structural scaffolds in synthetic, medical, and material chemistry. Cyclization of alkynes via remote C&#8722;H functionalization is an appealing approach to construct these motifs due to its high efficiency and step&#8208;economy. Herein, a traceless directing group strategy was designed to reverse the regioselectivity of radical addition which enabled an unprecedented photocatalytic sulfonylcarbocyclization of terminal alkynes by forming C&#8722;C bond on inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond. It offers a facile access to decorated cyclopentenes and indenes under mild conditions. The resultant products could be converted into a set of valuable molecular scaffolds, including a key intermediate of AM&#8208;6226. Mechanistic experiments suggest a radical cascade pathway comprising a Markovnikov&#8208;type sulfonylation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization, and &#946;&#8208;elimination. This study lays further groundwork for the use of anti&#8208;Baldwin 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization in rapidly assembling five&#8208;membered carbocycles.

         <title>A Defective Nanotube Molecule of C552H496N24 with Pyridinic and Pyrrolic Nitrogen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gigantic molecule composed of 1072 atoms was designed and synthesized to install two types of nitrogen dopants in a defective nanotube molecule. Charge&#8208;transfer interactions originating from the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen dopants were disclosed by solution&#8208;phase analyses, and 3&#8208;nm molecular structures and a unique helical assembly were revealed by crystallographic analyses.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A gigantic molecule composed of 1072 atoms was designed and synthesized to install two types of nitrogen dopants in a defective nanotube molecule. Charge-transfer interactions originating from the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen dopants were disclosed by solution-phase analyses, and 3-nm molecular structures and a unique helical assembly were revealed by crystallographic analyses.

         <title>Athermal, Chemically Triggered Release of RNA from Thioester Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioester linked oligo(T) nucleic acids are utilized for an efficient enrichment of mRNA from total RNA under ambient temperature. The selective binding of uncharged oT TENA to the poly(A) tail of the mRNA and release via a self&#8208;immolative degradation of thioester backbone under ambient temperature were the key features that enabled this approach.







Abstract
An athermal approach to mRNA enrichment from total RNA using a self&#8208;immolative thioester linked nucleic acids (TENA) is described. Oligo(thymine) (oT) TENA has a six&#8208;atom spacing between bases which allowed TENA to selectively base&#8208;pair with polyadenine RNA. As a result of the neutral backbone of TENA and the hydrophobicity of the octanethiol end group, oT TENA is water insoluble and efficiently pulled down 93&#177;2&#8201;% of EGFP mRNA at a concentration of 10&#8197;ng&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1. Self&#8208;immolative degradation of TENA upon ambient temperature exposure to nucleophilic buffer components (Tris, DTT) allowed recovery of 55&#177;27&#8197;ng of mRNA from 3.1 &#956;g of total RNA, which was not statistically different from the amount recovered using Dynabeads&#174; mRNA DIRECT Kit (89&#177;24&#8197;ng). Gene expression as measured by RT&#8208;qPCR was comparable for both enrichment methods, suggesting that the mild conditions required for enrichment of mRNA using oT TENA are compatible with RT&#8208;qPCR and other downstream molecular biology applications.

         <title>Layered Double Hydroxide&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Prussian Blue Membranes for Precise Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we prepared continuous polycrystalline Prussian blue (PB) membrane showing precise dye rejection and monovalent ion discrimination ability. The introduction of a calcined NiFe&#8208;CO3 layered double hydroxide buffer layer on the substrate was found to play a paramount role in the formation of PB membrane with desirable microstructure and performance.







Abstract
Prussian Blue (PB), which was first discovered as robust blue&#8208;colored pigment in the year 1706, has shown promising prospects in disease treatment, energy conversion, water splitting, and sensing. Relying on the uniform 3.2&#8197;&#197;&#8208;sized pore channels as well as high stability in aqueous environments, in this study, we pioneered in situ preparation of polycrystalline PB membranes to justify their dye rejection and metal ion discrimination ability in aqueous environments. Among various factors, the introduction of calcined NiFe layered double hydroxide buffer layers on porous &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 substrates was found to play a paramount role in the formation of continuous polycrystalline PB membranes, thereby leading to excellent dye rejection efficiency (&gt;99.0&#8201;%). Moreover, prepared PB membranes enabled discriminating different monovalent metal ions (e.g., Li+, Na+, and K+) depending on their discrepancy in Stokes diameters, showing great promise for lithium extraction from smaller&#8208;sized metal ions.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable PdI Dimer Enabled Remote Functionalization: Access to Fluorinated 1,1&#8208;Diaryl Alkanes with Unprecedented Speed</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a remote arylation in less than 10&#8197;min reaction time at room temperature over a distance of up to 11 carbons. The unprecedented speed is enabled by the air&#8208;stable PdI dimer [Pd(&#956;&#8208;I)(PCy2tBu)]2.







Abstract
While remote functionalization via chain walking has the potential to enable access to molecules via novel disconnections, such processes require relatively long reaction times and can be in need of elevated temperatures. This work features a remote arylation in less than 10&#8197;min reaction time at room temperature over a distance of up to 11 carbons. The unprecedented speed is enabled by the air&#8208;stable PdI dimer [Pd(&#956;&#8208;I)(PCy2tBu)]2, which in contrast to its PtBu3 counterpart does not trigger direct coupling at the initiation site, but regioconvergent and chemoselective remote functionalization to yield valuable fluorinated 1,1&#8208;diaryl alkanes. Our combined experimental and computational studies rationalize the origins of switchability, which are primarily due to differences in dispersion interactions.

         <title>Configurational Lability at Tetrahedral Phosphorus: syn/anti&#8208;Isomerization of a P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphiranium Cation by Intramolecular Epimerization at Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahedral carbon and analogous four&#8208;coordinate main&#8208;group compounds are configurationally stable, but we report intramolecular P&#8208;epimerization of chiral phosphiranium cations under mild conditions. How? In the proposed mechanism, P&#8208;C cleavage yields an intermediate pendant &#946;&#8208;carbocation which promotes low&#8208;barrier pyramidal inversion at phosphorus, while hyperconjugative stabilization from a P&#8208;C &#963;&#8208;bond preserves the cation's C&#8208;chirality.







Abstract
Tetrahedral main&#8208;group compounds are normally configurationally stable, but P&#8208;epimerization of the chiral phosphiranium cations syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;[Mes*P(Me)CH2CHPh][OTf] (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;(t&#8208;Bu)3C6H2) occurred under mild conditions at 60&#8201;&#176;C in CD2Cl2, resulting in isomerization to give a syn&#8208;enriched equilibrium mixture. Ion exchange with excess [NBu4][&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT] (&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT=&#916;&#8208;P(o&#8208;C6Cl4O2)3) followed by chromatography on silica removed [NBu4][OTf] and gave mixtures of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;[Mes*P(Me)CH2CHPh][&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT]&#8901;x[NBu4][&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT]. NMR spectroscopy showed that isomerization proceeded with epimerization at P and retention at C. DFT calculations are consistent with a mechanism involving P&#8208;C cleavage to yield a hyperconjugation&#8208;stabilized carbocation, pyramidal inversion promoted by &#963;&#8208;interaction of the P lone pair with the neighboring &#946;&#8208;carbocation, and ring closure with inversion of configuration at P.

         <title>Solar Urea: Towards a Sustainable Fertilizer Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct urea synthesis from NH3 and CO2 was achieved over Pd/LTA&#8208;3A powered solely by solar energy. Pd nanoparticles serve the dual function of catalyzing the dissociation of NH3 and providing the photothermal driving force for reaction with CO2, while the absorption capacity of LTA&#8208;3A removes by&#8208;product H2O, shifting the equilibrium towards urea production.







Abstract
Urea, an agricultural fertilizer, nourishes humanity. The century&#8208;old Bosch&#8211;Meiser process provides the world's urea. It is multi&#8208;step, consumes enormous amounts of non&#8208;renewable energy, and has a large CO2 footprint. Thus, developing an eco&#8208;friendly synthesis for urea is a priority. Herein we report a single&#8208;step Pd/LTA&#8208;3A catalyzed synthesis of urea from CO2 and NH3 under ambient conditions powered solely by solar energy. Pd nanoparticles serve the dual function of catalyzing the dissociation of NH3 and providing the photothermal driving force for urea formation, while the absorption capacity of LTA&#8208;3A removes by&#8208;product H2O to shift the equilibrium towards urea production. The solar urea conversion rate from NH3 and CO2 is 87&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This advance represents a first step towards the use of solar energy in urea production. It provides insights into green fertilizer production, and inspires the vision of sustainable, modular plants for distributed production of urea on farms.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Induced Mechanical Bending and Reversible Fluorescence Switching in a Single Organic Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slender single crystal based on azine exhibits controllable plastic bending and fluorescence enhancement upon UV light irradiation or acid vapor fuming, as well as elastic bending under external force and mechanoresponsive fluorescence. This is the first smart single crystal exhibiting fluorescence lit up upon bending triggered by UV light irradiation and exposure to acid.







Abstract
Fluorescent single crystals that respond to multiple external stimuli are of great interest in molecular machines, sensors, and displays. The integration of photo&#8208; or acid&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and bending in one organic crystal, however, has not been reported yet. Herein, we report the interesting plastic photomechanical bending and switching on of the fluorescence of an azine crystal in a single&#8208;crystal transformation, due to extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and molecular slippage. Moreover, the fluorescent plastic bending driven by multiple volatile acid vapors was firstly observed, and attributed to the synergistic effect of push&#8211;pull electronic structure and hydrogen bonding. The single crystal also shows high elasticity under external force. In addition, reversible fluorescence switching can be triggered by grinding and solvent fuming, as well as by the adsorption and desorption of HCl vapor. The integration of plastic, elastic bending and switch&#8208;on fluorescence into one single crystal provides a new strategy for next&#8208;generation smart materials.

         <title>Mediated Inner&#8208;Sphere Electron Transfer Induces Homogeneous Reduction of CO2 via Through&#8208;Space Electronic Conjugation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space electronic conjugation between a redox mediator and molecular Cr complex enables emergent co&#8208;electrocatalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. In the reduced forms, the aromatic portions interact through a combination of dispersion forces, &#960; conjugation, and weak coordination of the sulfone to Cr.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 is an appealing method for converting renewable energy sources into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. We report a co&#8208;electrocatalytic system for the reduction of CO2 to CO comprised of a molecular Cr complex and dibenzothiophene&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (DBTD) as a redox mediator, which achieves high activity (TOF=1.51&#8211;2.84&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) and quantitative selectivity. Under aprotic or protic conditions, DBTD produces a co&#8208;electrocatalytic response with 1 by coordinating trans to the site of CO2 binding and mediating electron transfer from the electrode with quantitative efficiency for CO. This assembly is reliant on through&#8208;space electronic conjugation between the &#960; frameworks of DBTD and the bpy fragment of the catalyst ligand, with contributions from dispersive interactions and weak sulfone coordination.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase&#8208;Supported Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of a Light&#8208;Activatable tRNA Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic access to modified RNA is of high importance. Both the gold standard&#8212;chemical solid&#8208;phase synthesis&#8212;and enzymatic methods have limitations. The present study offers a best&#8208;of&#8208;both&#8208;worlds approach and enabled the synthesis of a tRNA derivative with four modifications. This approach is compatible with a whole toolbox of light&#8208;reactive and other modifications.







Abstract
Herein, we present a multi&#8208;cycle chemoenzymatic synthesis of modified RNA with simplified solid&#8208;phase handling to overcome size limitations of RNA synthesis. It combines the advantages of classical chemical solid&#8208;phase synthesis and enzymatic synthesis using magnetic streptavidin beads and biotinylated RNA. Successful introduction of light&#8208;controllable RNA nucleotides into the tRNAMet sequence was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The methods tolerate modifications in the RNA phosphodiester backbone and allow introductions of photocaged and photoswitchable nucleotides as well as photocleavable strand breaks and fluorophores.

Crack the code of egg&#8208;tempera paints: The macroscopic and microscopic properties of egg&#8208;tempera paint prepared with green earth are highlighted via rheology and NMR relaxometry.







Abstract
Egg&#8208;tempera painting is a pictorial technique widely used in the Middle Ages, although poorly studied in its physico&#8208;chemical aspects until now. Here we show how NMR relaxometry and rheology can be combined to probe egg&#8208;tempera paints and shed new light on their structure and behavior. Based on recipes of the 15th century, model formulations with egg yolk and green earth have been reproduced to characterize the physicochemical properties of this paint at the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales. The rheological measurements highlight a synergetic effect between green earth and egg yolk, induced by the interactions between them and the structural organisation of the system. 1H&#8197;NMR relaxometry emphasizes the presence and the structure of a network formed by the yolk and the pigment.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Carboxylic Acids from Alkynes and Formic Acid by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reactions: Facile Synthesis of Profens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple nickel catalyst converts terminal alkynes and formic acid to &#945;&#8208;chiral carboxylic acids in high enantioselectivity. The reaction proceeds via the hydrocarboxylation of alkynes and enantioselective transfer hydrogenation of acrylic acids.







Abstract
We report a stereoselective conversion of terminal alkynes to &#945;&#8208;chiral carboxylic acids using a nickel&#8208;catalyzed domino hydrocarboxylation&#8208;transfer hydrogenation reaction. A simple nickel/BenzP* catalyst displayed high activity in both steps of regioselective hydrocarboxylation of alkynes and subsequent asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The reaction was successfully applied in enantioselective preparation of three nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory profens (&gt;90&#8201;% ees) and the chiral fragment of AZD2716.

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Tardigrade Proteins Self&#8208;Assemble into Fibrous Gels in Response to Environmental Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational behaviour of an intrinsically disordered protein responsible for protecting tardigrades against extreme stress has been characterized. The protein assembles into fibres and fibrillar gels as a function of temperature and concentration. The disordered tails remain flexible within the gel cavities, which can encapsulate client proteins in their native state.







Abstract
Tardigrades are remarkable for their ability to survive harsh stress conditions as diverse as extreme temperature and desiccation. The molecular mechanisms that confer this unusual resistance to physical stress remain unknown. Recently, tardigrade&#8208;unique intrinsically disordered proteins have been shown to play an essential role in tardigrade anhydrobiosis. Here, we characterize the conformational and physical behaviour of CAHS&#8208;8 from Hypsibius&#8197;exemplaris. NMR spectroscopy reveals that the protein comprises an extended central helical domain flanked by disordered termini. Upon concentration, the protein is shown to successively form oligomers, long fibres, and finally gels constituted of fibres in a strongly temperature&#8208;dependent manner. The helical domain forms the core of the fibrillar structure, with the disordered termini remaining highly dynamic within the gel. Soluble proteins can be encapsulated within cavities in the gel, maintaining their functional form. The ability to reversibly form fibrous gels may be associated with the enhanced protective properties of these proteins.

         <title>Vitamin D Inhibits the Early Aggregation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and Modulates Exocytosis Revealed by Electrochemical Measurements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical measurement of the early aggregation of &#945;&#8208;Syn and exocytosis event of PC12 revealed a new neuroprotective role of VD that can inhibit the &#945;&#8208;Syn monomers aggregation into &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers and modulate exocytosis. This research provides an efficient strategy for early treatment and prevention of the neurodegenerative diseases associated with &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) localizes at presynaptic terminal and modulates synaptic functions. Increasing evidence demonstrate that &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers, forming at the early of aggregation, are cytotoxic and is thus related to brain neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we find that vitamin D (VD) can reduce neurocytotoxicity. The reduced neurocytotoxicity might be attributed to the less amount of large&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers inhibited by VD, measured by electrochemical collision at single particle level, which are not observable with traditionally ensembled method. Single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA) results show that VD can recover the amount of neurotransmitter release during exocytosis induced by &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers, further verifying the neuroprotection of VD. Our study reveals the neuroprotective role of VD through inhibiting &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation, which is envisioned to be of great importance in treatment and prevention of the neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Rigid Bridge&#8208;Confined Double&#8208;Decker Platinum(II) Complexes Towards High&#8208;Performance Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong intramolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt/&#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions confined by rigid bridges lead to fast radiative decay and high&#8208;efficiency red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence from triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) excited states. Together with short emission lifetimes, high&#8208;performance red and NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A molecular design to high&#8208;performance red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) emitters remains demanding. Herein a series of dinuclear platinum(II) complexes featuring strong intramolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions has been developed by using N&#8208;deprotonated &#945;&#8208;carboline as a bridging ligand. The complexes in doped thin films exhibit efficient red to NIR emission from short&#8208;lived (&#964;=0.9&#8211;2.1&#8197;&#956;s) triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) excited states. Red OLEDs demonstrate high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 23.3&#8201;% among the best PtII&#8208;complex&#8208;doped devices. The maximum EQE of 15.0&#8201;% and radiance of 285&#8197;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 for NIR OLEDs (&#955;EL=725&#8197;nm) are unprecedented for devices based on discrete molecular emitters. Both red and NIR devices show very small efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness. Appealing operational lifetimes have also been revealed for the devices. This work sheds light on the potential of intramolecular metallophilicity for long&#8208;wavelength molecular emitters and electroluminescence.

A mild visible light&#8208;induced palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkyl Heck reaction of diazo compounds and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is reported. This method features Br&#248;nsted acid assisted generation of hybrid palladium C(sp3)&#8208;centered radical intermediate and broad reaction scope, highlighting the diverse applicability and the potential utility of this protocol in late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
A mild visible light&#8208;induced palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkyl Heck reaction of diazo compounds and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is reported. A broad range of vinyl arenes and heteroarenes with high functional group tolerance, as well as a range of different diazo compounds, can efficiently undergo this transformation. This method features Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;assisted generation of hybrid palladium C(sp3)&#8208;centered radical intermediate, which allowed for new selective C&#8722;H functionalization protocol.

         <title>Truly&#8208;Biocompatible Gold Catalysis Enables Vivo&#8208;Orthogonal Intra&#8208;CNS Release of Anxiolytics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>

Making drugs in the brain! Fully&#8208;biocompatible Au catalysis enables for the first time the localized uncaging of a neuroactive agent, the anxiolytic drug fluoxetine, directly in the head of zebrafish by using catalytically&#8208;enhanced Au&#8208;polymer composites as safe catalytic reactors.







Abstract
Being recognized as the best&#8208;tolerated of all metals, the catalytic potential of gold (Au) has thus far been hindered by the ubiquitous presence of thiols in organisms. Herein we report the development of a truly&#8208;catalytic Au&#8208;polymer composite by assembling ultrasmall Au&#8208;nanoparticles at the protein&#8208;repelling outer layer of a co&#8208;polymer scaffold via electrostatic loading. Illustrating the in vivo&#8208;compatibility of the novel catalysts, we show their capacity to uncage the anxiolytic agent fluoxetine at the central nervous system (CNS) of developing zebrafish, influencing their swim pattern. This bioorthogonal strategy has enabled &#8208;for the first time&#8208; modification of cognitive activity by releasing a neuroactive agent directly in the brain of an animal.

         <title>Photocleavable Fluorescent Membrane Tension Probes: Fast Release with Spatiotemporal Control in Inner Leaflets of Plasma Membrane, Nuclear Envelope, and Secretory Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open, dynamic, and elusive membrane motifs are labeled without chemical or physical interference to image their order and tension in living cells: Fast release with light from specific targets liberates the original small&#8208;molecule flipper probe in the innermost leaflet of the nuclear envelope, the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, or along the secretory pathway to address current questions of biological significance.







Abstract
Mechanosensitive flipper probes are attracting interest as fluorescent reporters of membrane order and tension in biological systems. We introduce PhotoFlippers, which contain a photocleavable linker and an ultralong tether between mechanophore and various targeting motifs. Upon irradiation, the original probe is released and labels the most ordered membrane that is accessible by intermembrane transfer. Spatiotemporal control from photocleavable flippers is essential to access open, dynamic or elusive membrane motifs without chemical or physical interference. For instance, fast release with light is shown to place the original small&#8208;molecule probes into the innermost leaflet of the nuclear envelope to image changes in membrane tension, at specific points in time of membrane trafficking along the secretory pathway, or in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to explore membrane asymmetry. These results identify PhotoFlippers as useful chemistry tools to enable research in biology.

         <title>Quantifying Intracellular Single Vesicular Catecholamine Concentration with Open Carbon Nanopipettes to Unveil the Effect of L&#8208;DOPA on Vesicular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single vesicular catecholamine concentrations in the intracellular environment were calculated based on the narrowed distributions of vesicular content and size obtained with 100&#8197;nm open CNPs. We have shown that vesicular dense core size and content increase while catecholamine concentrations are essentially unchanged after exposure to L&#8208;DOPA.







Abstract
Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of exocytosis is essential for uncovering the pathologies of neuronal disorders and developing related pharmaceuticals. In this work intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC) measurements with different&#8208;sized (50&#8211;500&#8197;nm radius) open carbon nanopipettes (CNPs) were performed to quantify the vesicular content and release kinetics of specific vesicle populations grouped by orifice sizes. Intracellular vesicles with radius below 100&#8197;nm were captured and narrowed between 50 and 100&#8197;nm. On the basis of this, single vesicular catecholamine concentrations in the intracellular environment were quantified as 0.23&#8211;1.1&#8197;M. Our results with L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA)&#8208;exposure indicate that L&#8208;DOPA regulates exocytosis by increasing the dense core size and vesicular content while catecholamine concentrations did not show obvious alterations. These were all achieved simultaneously and relatively noninvasively with open CNPs.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Silsesquioxane Nanomaterials by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbene Insertion into Si&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene insertion into Si&#8722;H bonds of silsesquioxane silanes was accomplished using RhII catalysis and diazo compounds as carbene precursors. Silsesquioxanes with up to eight Si&#8722;H bonds were functionalized up to gram&#8208;scale. Diazo compounds with a fluorinated octyl group and BODIPY fluorophore were accessed to highlight the utility of diazo chemistry. Further transformations including a cross&#8208;coupling and ester deprotection are demonstrated.







Abstract
We report carbene insertion into Si&#8722;H bonds of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) for the synthesis of highly functionalized siloxane nanomaterials. Dirhodium(II) carboxylates catalyze insertion of aryl&#8208;diazoacetates as carbene precursors to afford POSS structures containing both ester and aryl groups as orthogonal functional handles for further derivatization of POSS materials. Four diverse and structurally varied silsesquioxane core scaffolds with one, three, or eight Si&#8722;H bonds were evaluated with diazo reactants to produce a total of 20 new POSS compounds. Novel diazo compounds containing a fluorinated octyl group and boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore demonstrate the use of highly functionalized substrates. Transformations of aryl(ester)&#8208;functionalized POSS compounds derived from this method are demonstrated, including ester hydrolysis and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfonyl fluorides have found widespread use in chemical biology and drug discovery. The development of synthetic methods for the introduction of the sulfonyl fluoride moiety is therefore of importance. In this communication, a transition metal&#8208;free radical 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes  via  FSO  2  &#8208;radical addition with subsequent vicinal alkynylation to access &#946;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;fluorosulfonylalkanes is presented. Alkynyl sulfonyl fluorides are introduced as highly valuable bifunctional radical trapping reagents that also serve as FSO  2  &#8208;radical precursors. The &#946;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;fluorosulfonylalkanes obtained in these transformations can be readily diversified by using SuFEx click chemistry to obtain sulfonates and sulfonamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Complexity and Interconversion Mechanisms in Self&#8208;Assembled [Fe2L3]4+ Helicates and [Fe4L6]8+ Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic system of interconverting helicates and cages was prepared and characterized. The presence of steric bulk on the central ring of the ligand was found to control both the complexity and interconversion mechanism.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled coordination cages and metal&#8211;organic frameworks have relied extensively on symmetric ligands in their formation. Here we have prepared a relatively simple system employing an unsymmetric ligand that results in two distinct self&#8208;assembled structures, a [Fe2L3]4+ helicate and a [Fe4L6]8+ cage composed of 10 interconverting diastereomers and their enantiomers. We show that the steric profile of the ligand controls the complexity, thermodynamics and kinetics of interconversion of the system.

         <title>Clusters Induced Electron Redistribution to Tune Oxygen Reduction Activity of Transition Metal Single&#8208;Atom for Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity can be effectively tuned by modulating the electron configuration and optimizing the chemical bonds. Herein, a general strategy to optimize the activity of metal single&#8208;atom is achieved by the decoration of metal clusters via a coating&#8208;pyrolysis&#8208;etching route. In this unique structure, the metal clusters are able to induce electron redistribution and modulate M&#8208;N species bond lengths. As a result, the M&#8208;ACSA@NC exhibits superior ORR activity compared with the nanoparticles&#8208;decorated counterparts. The performance enhancement is attributed to the optimized intermediates desorption benefiting from the unique electronic configuration. Theoretical analysis reinforces the significant roles of metal clusters by correlating the ORR activity with clusters induced charge transfer. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, various metal&#8208;air batteries assembled with the Fe&#8208;ACSA@NC deliver remarkable power densities and capacities. This strategy is an effective and universal technique for electron modulation of M&#8208;N&#8208;C, which shows great potential in application of energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of small organic molecules with a difluoromethylated stereocenter is particularly attractive in drug discovery. Herein, we developed an efficient method for the direct generation of difluoromethylated stereocenters through Ni(0)&#8208;catalyzed  regio  &#8208; and enantioselective hydrosilylation of  gem  &#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction also represents the enantioselective construction of carbon(sp  3  )&#8208;silicon bonds with nickel catalysis, which provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical synthesis route of high&#8208;value optically active &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes. This protocol features with readily available starting materials and commercial chiral catalysis, broad substrates spanning a range of functional groups with high yield (up to 99% yield) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). The enantioenriched products undergo a variety of stereospecific transformations. Preliminary mechanistic studies were performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Observation of Structural Dynamics Triggering Excimer Formation in a Perylene Bisimide Folda&#8208;dimer by Ultrafast Time&#8208;domain Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic photovoltaic materials, an excimer state has been generally regarded as a trap state which hinders efficient excitation energy transport. But despite wide investigations of the excimer for overcoming the undesirable energy loss, the understanding of the relationship between the structure of the excimer in the stacked organic compounds and its properties remains elusive. Here, we present the landscape of structural dynamics from the excimer formation to its relaxation in a co&#8208;facially stacked archetypical perylene bisimide folda&#8208;dimer using ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. We directly captured vibrational snapshots illustrating the ultrafast structural evolution triggering the excimer formation along the interchromophore coordinate on the complex excited&#8208;state potential surfaces and following evolution into a relaxed excimer state. Not only does this work showcase the ultrafast structural dynamics necessary for the excimer formation and control of excimer characteristics but also provides important criteria for designing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering the Glycerol Electro&#8208;Reforming Selectivity via Cation&#8208;Intermediate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electro&#8208;reforming of renewable biomass resources is an alternative technology for sustainable pure H2 production. Herein, we discovered an unconventional cation effect on the concurrent formate and H2 production via glycerol electro&#8208;reforming. In stark contrast to the cation effect via forming the double layers in cathodic reactions, the presence of residual cations at the anode were discovered to interact with the glycerol oxidation intermediates to steer its product selectivity. Through a combination of product analysis, transient kinetics, crown ether trapping experiments, in situ IRRAS spectroscopy and DFT calculation, the aldehyde intermediates were discovered to be stabilized by the Li+ cations to favor the non&#8208;oxidative C&#8208;C cleavage for formate production. The maximal formate efficiency could reach 81.3% under ~ 60 mA/cm2 in LiOH. This work emphasizes the significance of engineering the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for efficient electrolytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Oligonucleotides by Automated Solid&#8208;Phase Incorporation of Cathepsin B Sensitive Dipeptide Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligonucleotides containing cleavable linkers have emerged as versatile tools to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA. However, the limitations of previously reported cleavable linkers including photolabile and disulfide linkers have restricted their applications  in vivo  . Inspired by the cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide linkers in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) such as Adcetris, we have developed Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone phosphoramidites for the automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. Cathepsin B digests Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone linkers efficiently, enabling cleavage of oligonucleotides into two components or release of small&#8208;molecule payloads. Based on the prior success of dipeptide linkers in ADCs, we believe that these dipeptide linker phosphoramidites will promote new clinical applications of therapeutic oligonucleotides.</dc:description>

         <title>Sn7Br10S2: The First Ternary Halogen&#8208;Rich Chalcohalide Exhibiting A Chiral Structure and Pronounced Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared nonliear optical (IR NLO) materials are significant in laser technology for civil and military uses. Here, we report the synthesis, structural chemistry and NLO properties of a halogen&#8208;rich chalcohalide Sn7Br10S2. Its noncentrosymmetric (NCS, P63) structure can be considered as partially aliovalent anion substitution of SnBr2 (P63/m) induced centrosymmetric (CS) to NCS structural transformation. The 3D &#8734;[Sn(1)6Sn(2)6Br6X6]6&#8722; (X = Br/S) channel framework is consisting of Sn(1)BrX2 and Sn(2)X3 trigonal pyramids. It exhibits excellent NLO performances, including strong phase&#8208;matchable NLO response 1.5 &#215; AgGaS2 and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold 6.3 &#215; AgGaS2. Structure&#8208;NLO performance relationship investigation confirm that the effective arrangement of Sn(1)BrX2 and Sn(2)X3 units predominantly contribute to the large SHG response. These results indicate Sn7Br10S2 is a potential IR NLO candidate, and provide a new feasible system as promising NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of the Dynamic Interface Evolution in High&#8208;Efficiency Working Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal has been considered a promising anode for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the low reversibility and intricate Li loss hinder the widespread implement of Li metal batteries. Herein, we quantitatively differentiate the dynamic evolution of inactive Li, and decipher the fundamental interplay among dynamic Li loss, electrolyte chemistry, and the structure of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The actual domination form in inactive Li loss is practically determined by the relative growth rates of dead Li0 and SEI Li+ because of the persistent evolving of Li metal interface during cycling. Distinct inactive Li evolution scenarios are disclosed when ingeniously tuning the inorganic anion&#8208;derived SEI chemistry with low amount of film&#8208;forming additive. An optimal polymeric film enabler of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is demonstrated to derive a highly uniform multilayer SEI and declined SEI Li+/dead Li0 growth rates, thus achieving enhanced Li cycling reversibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Interrelations of Oxygen Evolution and Iridium Dissolution Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Widespread utilization of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers is currently still uncertain, as it inevitably relies on the use of highly scarce iridium as the only viable catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is known to present the major energy losses of the process. The understanding of the mechanistic origin of different activities and stabilities of Ir&#8208;based catalysts is therefore crucial for a scale&#8208;up of green hydrogen production. It is known that structure importantly influences the dissolution, which is the main degradation mechanism and shares common intermediates with the OER. In this mini&#8208;review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of the dissolution phenomenon and its relationship with the structure of different iridium catalysts is gathered and correlated to different mechanisms of OER. In conclusion, the perspective on future investigation directions is given.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Covalent Headpiece Enables Interconversion between Double&#8208; and Single&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) encoding method featuring a &#8220;reversible covalently headpiece (RCHP)&#8221; is described, which allows efficient interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DNA forms. Hybridization and covalent crosslinking of ssDEL with diversified complementary functionalized DNAs enables multiple DEL applications.







Abstract
The use of a proper encoding methodology is one of the most important aspects when practicing DEL technology. A &#8220;headpiece&#8221;&#8208;based double&#8208;stranded DEL encoding method is currently the most widely used for productive DEL. However, the robustness of double&#8208;stranded DEL construction conflicts with the versatility presented by single&#8208;stranded DEL applications. We here report a novel encoding method, which is based on a &#8220;reversible covalent headpiece (RCHP)&#8221;. The RCHP allows reversible interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DNA formats, providing an avenue to robust synthesis and allowing for the applications in distinct setups. We have validated the versatility of this encoding method with encoded self&#8208;assembled chemical library and DNA&#8208;encoded dynamic library technology. Notably, based on the RCHP&#8208;settled library construction, a unique &#8220;ternary covalent complex&#8221; mediating ligand isolation methodology against non&#8208;immobilized targets was developed.

Amino acid supramolecular recognition in the 2nd coordination sphere of a bioinspired manganese catalyst allows efficient enzyme&#8208;like activation of H2O2 by locating the carboxylic acid moiety in proper position to access the 1st coordination sphere of the metal.







Abstract
Precise delivery of a proton plays a key role in O2 activation at iron oxygenases, enabling the crucial O&#8722;O cleavage step that generates the oxidizing high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species. Such a proton is delivered by acidic residues that may either directly bind the iron center or lie in its second coordination sphere. Herein, a supramolecular strategy for enzyme&#8208;like H2O2 activation at a biologically inspired manganese catalyst, with a nearly stoichiometric amount (1&#8211;1.5&#8197;equiv) of a carboxylic acid is disclosed. Key for this strategy is the incorporation of an &#945;,&#969;&#8208;amino acid in the second coordination sphere of a chiral catalyst via remote ammonium&#8208;crown ether recognition. The properly positioned carboxylic acid function enables effective activation of hydrogen peroxide, leading to catalytic asymmetric epoxidation. Modulation of both amino acid and catalyst structure can tune the efficiency and the enantioselectivity of the reaction, and a study on the oxidative degradation pathway of the system is presented.

Herein, we observed that PtII and PdII organometallic nanowires exhibit long&#8208;range anisotropic triplet exciton LD of 5&#8208;7 &#956;m along the M&#8208;M direction using direct photoluminescence (PL) imaging technique by low&#8208;power continuous wave (CW) laser excitation. At room temperature, via a combined triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) analysis and spatial PL imaging, an efficient triplet exciton diffusion was observed for the PtII and PdII nanowires with extended close M&#8208;M contact, while is absent in nanowires without close M&#8208;M contact. Two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and calculations revealed a significant contribution of the delocalized 1/3[d&#963;*(M&#8208;M)&#8594;&#960;*] excited state during the exciton diffusion modulated by the M&#8208;M distance.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Sulfur&#8208;Rich Thermoplastic Elastomers Enabled by Metal&#8208;Free Self&#8208;Switchable Catalysis and Air&#8208;Assisted Coupling</title>

Episulfide&#8208;involved self&#8208;switchable polymerization to produce well&#8208;defined sulfur&#8208;rich triblock thermoplastic elastomers has been achieved via an ammonium salt mediated copolymerization of episulfide/isothiocyanate together with an air&#8208;assisted oxidative coupling strategy.







Abstract
Construction of well&#8208;defined sulfur&#8208;rich macromolecules in a facile manner is an interesting but challenging topic. Herein, we disclose how to readily construct well&#8208;defined triblock sulfur&#8208;rich thermoplastic elastomers via a self&#8208;switchable isothiocyanate/episulfide copolymerization and air&#8208;assisted oxidative coupling strategy. During self&#8208;switchable polymerization, alternating copolymerization of isothiocyanate and episulfide occurs initially due to the lower energy barrier for isothiocyanate insertion with respect to successive episulfide ring&#8208;opening. After exhaustion of isothiocyanate, ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfide begins, providing diblock polymers. Subsequent exposure of the reaction to air leads to a transformation of diblock copolymers into triblock thermoplastic elastomers. This protocol can be extended to diverse isothiocyanates and episulfides, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of the performance of the produced sulfur&#8208;rich thermoplastic elastomers.

         <title>Highly Efficient Synthesis of Poly(silylether)s: Access to Degradable Polymers from Renewable Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of renewable polymers has been synthesized from easily accessible biobased hydroxyaldehydes and dihydrosilanes. Using low catalyst loadings of platinum complexes, different polymer architectures were obtained, from random to alternated copolymers. The intrinsic chemical recyclability of these poly(silylether)s is also highlighted.







Abstract
The design of new materials with tunable properties and intrinsic recyclability, derived from biomass under mild conditions, stands as a gold standard in polymer chemistry. Reported herein are platinum complexes which catalyze the formation of poly(silylether)s (PSEs) at low catalyst loadings. These polymers are directly obtained from dual&#8208;functional biobased building blocks such as 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) or vanillin, coupled with various dihydrosilanes. Access to different types of copolymer architectures (statistical or alternating) is highlighted by several synthetic strategies. The materials obtained were then characterized as low Tg materials (ranging from &#8722;60 to 29&#8201;&#176;C), stable upon heating (T&#8722;5% up to 301&#8201;&#176;C) and resistant towards uncatalyzed methanolysis. Additionally, quantitative chemical recycling of several PSEs could be triggered by acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis or methanolysis. These results emphasize the interest of biobased poly(silylether)s as sustainable materials with high recycling potential.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed ring expansion procedure for a two&#8208;carbon homologation of cyclic carbonyl compounds, towards medium&#8208;sized ring systems, is introduced. Key to success is the catalyst fac&#8208;[Ir(CF3&#8208;pmb)3] (ET=73.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), which allows for selective activation of the substochiometric enol species. The mechanism has been corroborated by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy and enabled a full kinetic analysis of the dynamic kinetic sensitization scenario.







Abstract
Herein, we present a photocatalyzed two&#8208;carbon ring expansion of &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with unactivated olefins that provides facile access to medium&#8208;sized rings. Selective sensitization of the substoichiometric enol tautomer enables reactivity of substrates incompatible with the classical De&#8197;Mayo reaction conditions. Key to success is the identification of the metal&#8208;based sensitizer fac&#8208;[Ir(CF3&#8208;pmb)3], which can be excited using common near&#8208;visible LEDs, and possesses a high triplet excited state energy of 73.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This exactly falls in the range between the triplet energies of the enol and keto tautomer, thereby enabling a dynamic kinetic sensitization. Demonstrating the applicability of fac&#8208;[Ir(CF3&#8208;pmb)3] as a photocatalyst in organic synthesis for the first time, we describe a two&#8208;step photocycloaddition&#8208;ring&#8208;opening cascade with &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, &#8208;diketones, and &#8208;ketoamides. The mechanism has been corroborated by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, as well as further experimental and computational studies.

         <title>WSe2 Flakelets on N&#8208;Doped Graphene for Accelerating Polysulfide Redox and Regulating Li Plating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elaborately designed WSe2 flakelets decorated on the N&#8208;doped graphene (WSe2/NG) with an abundant active site can not only act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and significantly alleviate the shuttling effect, but also as a regulator for enabling uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries is still limited by the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling effect on the S cathode and uncontrollable Li&#8208;dendrite growth on the Li anode. Herein, elaborately designed WSe2 flakelets immobilized on N&#8208;doped graphene (WSe2/NG) with abundant active sites are employed to be a dual&#8208;functional host for satisfying both the S cathode and Li anode synchronously. On the S cathode, the WSe2/NG with a strong interaction towards LiPSs can act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of LiPSs. On the Li anode, the WSe2/NG with excellent lithiophilic features can regulate the uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite. Taking advantage of these merits, the assembled Li&#8722;S full batteries exhibit remarkable rate performance and stable cycling stability even at a higher sulfur loading of 10.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a negative to positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio of 1.4&#8201;:&#8201;1.

         <title>Catalytic Substrate&#8208;Selective Silylation of Primary Alcohols via Remote Functional&#8208;Group Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silylation of alcohols has generally been known to take place at the sterically most accessible less&#8208;hindered hydroxy group. However, we report here the catalyst&#8208;controlled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of primary alcohols, where the selectivity was controlled independent of the innate reactivity of the hydroxy group based on the steric environment. The chain&#8208;length&#8208;selective silylation of 1,  n&#8208;  amino alcohol derivatives was achieved, where 1,5&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives showed outstanding high reactivity in the presence of analogues with a shorter or longer chain length under catalyst&#8208;controlled conditions. A highly substrate&#8208;selective catalytic silylation of pentanol analogues was also developed, in which the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting hydroxy groups was effectively discriminated on silylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear PtII Complexes with Strong Blue Phosphorescence for Operational Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with EQE up to&#160;23% at 1000 cd m&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new class of dinuclear PtII complexes with blue phosphorescence. Bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and tethered bridging ligands were employed to suppress photo&#8208;induced structural changes and to improve thermal stability of the complexes. These complexes show mixed 3IL/3MLCT blue emission (~460 nm) with emission quantum yields of up to 0.95, emission lifetimes of as low as 1.3 &#181;s and radiative decay rate constants of up to 7.3 &#215; 105 s&#8208;1 in 4 wt% doped PMMA films; the latter is attributed to a 1MLCT excited state having high metal character (resulting in large SOC) and a large transition dipole moment, based on DFT calculations. Phosphor&#8208;sensitized blue hyperOLEDs with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.13, 0.12) showed maximum EQE of 23.4% with full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 18 nm and LT50 &gt; 250 h at an L0 of 1000 cd m&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>E  ven a well&#8208;designed system can only control stem cell adhesion, release, and differentiation, while other cell manipulations such as in situ labeling and retention in target tissues, are difficult to achieve in the same system. Herein, native ligand cluster&#8208;mimicking islands, composed of topologically engineered ligand, anchoring point AuNP, nuclease mimetics Ce  IV  complexes and magnetic core Fe  3  O  4  , are designed to facilitate comprehensive cell manipulations in a programmable manner. Three islands with different amounts of AuNPs are constructed, which means tunable interligand spacing within a cluster. These nanostructures are chemically coupled to a substrate using DNA tethers. Under tissue&#8208;penetrative magnetic field, this integrated system promotes stem cell adhesion, proliferation, mechanosensing, differentiation, detachment, in situ effective magnetic labeling and retention both  in vitro  and  in vivo  , offering fascinating opportunities for biomimetic matrix in regenerative medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Hetero&#8208;lattice intergrown and robust MOF membranes for polyol upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework membranes are frequently used in gas separations, but rare in pervaporation for liquid chemical upgrading, especially for separating water from polyols, due to lack of highly compact and robust micro&#8208;architecture. Here, we report hetero&#8208;lattice intergrown membranes in which&#160;amino&#8208;MIL&#8208;101 (Cr) particles embedded into the micro&#8208;gaps of MIL&#8208;53 (Al) rod arrays after secondary growth. By means of high&#8208;resolution TEM and two&#8208;dimensional topologic simulation, the connection between these two distinct MOF lattices at molecular&#8208;level and their crystallographic geometry harmony is identified, which leads to a close&#8208;knit structure at crystal boundaries of membranes. Typically, the membrane shows a separation factor as high as 13,000 for 90/10 ethanediol/water solution in pervaporation, yields polymer&#8208;grade ethanediol, and saves ca. 32% of energy consumption vs. vacuum distillation. It has a highly robust micro&#8208;architecture, with great tolerance to high pressure, durability against ultrasonic therapy and long&#8208;term separation stability over 600 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Transform electrocatalytic biomass upgrading and hydrogen production from electricity input to electricity output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating biomass upgrading and hydrogen production in an electrocatalytic system is attractive both environmentally and sustainably. Conventional electrolyzer systems coupling anodic bio&#8208;substrate electrooxidation with hydrogen evolution reaction usually require electricity input. In this work, we develop a fuel cell electrocatalytic system achieve the biomass upgrading and hydrogen production as well as electricity generation. Different with conventional furfural electrooxidation, the employed low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation enables the hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group to be released as gaseous hydrogen at the anode under a low potential of ~0 VRHE (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The integrated fuel cell system could generate electricity of ~2 kWh for per cubic meter of hydrogen produced. This work may provide a transformative technology that turns the electrocatalytic biomass upgrading and hydrogen production from electricity input to electricity output.</dc:description>

Different with conventional furfural electrooxidation, the employed low-potential furfural oxidation enables the hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group to be released as gaseous hydrogen at the anode under a low potential of ~0 VRHE (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The integrated fuel cell system could generate electricity of ~2 kWh for per cubic meter of hydrogen produced. This work may provide a transformative technology that turns the electrocatalytic biomass upgrading and hydrogen production from electricity input to electricity output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Zinc Electrodeposition Enabled by a Self&#8208;Healable and Desolvation Shield for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial interfaces can alleviate the side reactions and the formation of the metallic (e.g.  , Li, Na, and Zn) dendrites. However, the traditional ones always break down during the repeated plating/stripping and fail to regulate the electrodeposition behaviors of the electrodes. Herein, a self&#8208;healable ion regulator (SIR) is designed as a desolvation shield to protect the Zn electrodes and guide the Zn electrodeposition. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, SIR shows a superb capability to  in&#8208;situ  repair the plating/stripping&#8208;induced creaks. Besides, the results of theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterizations show that the coating reduces water molecules in the solvated sheath of hydrated Zn2+  and restrains the random Zn2+  diffusion on the Zn surface. Even with a coating layer of only 360 nm, the SIR&#8208;modified Zn electrode exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability for &gt; 3500 h at 2 mAh cm&#8722;2  and &gt; 950 h at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 20 mAh cm&#8722;2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Charge&#8208;Switchable Zwitterionic Peptide for Rapid Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 coronavirus has led to the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Nucleic acid testing while specific has limitations for mass surveillance. One alternative is the main protease (Mpro) due to its functional importance in mediating the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a combination of modular substrate and gold colloids to detect Mpro via visual readout. The strategy involves zwitterionic peptide that carries opposite charges at the C&#8208;/N&#8208;terminus to exploit the specific recognition by Mpro. Autolytic cleavage releases positively&#8208;charged moiety that assembles the nanoparticles with rapid color changes (t &lt;10 min). We determine a limit of detection for Mpro in breath condensate matrices &lt;10 nM. We further assayed ten COVID&#8208;negative subjects and found no false&#8208;positive result. In the light of simplicity, our test for viral protease is not limited to an equipped laboratory, but also is amenable to integrating as portable point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices including those on face&#8208;coverings.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Mediated Enantioselective Photoredox Allylation of Aldehydes with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a practical, highly enantioselective photoredox allylation of aldehydes mediated by chiral nickel complexes with commercially available allyl acetate as the allylating agent. The methodology allows the clean stereoselective allylation of aldehydes in good to excellent yields and up to 93% e.e. using a catalytic amount of NiCl  2  (glyme) in the presence of the chiral aminoindanol&#8208;derived bis(oxazoline) as the chiral ligand. The photoredox system is constituted by the organic dye 3DPAFIPN and a Hantzsch&#8217;s ester as the sacrificial reductant. The reaction proceeds under visible light irradiation (blue LEDs, 456 nm) at 8&#8211;12 &#176;C with excellent stereoselectivities. Compared to other published procedures, no metal reductants (such as Zn or Mn), additives (e.g. CuI) or air&#8208;sensitive Ni(COD)  2  are necessary for this reaction. Accurate DFT calculations and photophysical experiments have clarified the mechanistic picture of this stereoselective allylation reaction showing a key role played by Hantzsch&#8217;s ester for the turnover of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Superhydrophobic Surface with Tunable Nanoscale Hydrophilicity for Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fog collection can be a sustainable solution to water scarcity in many regions around the world. Recently, great efforts have been undertaken to develop low&#8208;cost and highly efficient water collectors to address water shortages, especially in arid regions. However, the design of a scalable water harvesting surface remains elusive to the trade&#8208;off between water deposition and transport. Herein, we developed a hydrophilic/superhydrophobic surface using a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; facile approach to enable an efficient water deposition and transport process. Preferential exposure of hydrophilic cellulose nanocrystal outer surface could be used to accelerate droplet deposition, coupled with wax microspheres with distinct wetting features for the manipulation of the droplet mobility. Appropriate tuning of the wetting characteristics of the surfaces, optimizing the hydrophobicity and density of the water affinity nanodomains allowed us to enhance the water deposition rate without the sacrifice of water transport. An optimal hydrophilic/superhydrophobic topography through the control of nanoscale hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains yielded a water harvesting flux of 3.402 L/m  2  /h for a plate and 5.02 L/m  2  /h for a mesh. This strategy of decorating a superhydrophobic surface with moderately hydrophilic nanodomains allows the manipulation of droplet nucleation and removal to enhance the water collection efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic chiral hybrid nanostructures embedding chirality within distinct material compositions can create novel chiral properties and functionalities absent from achiral ones, but remain largely unexplored. We report for the first time a class of chiral plasmonic metal&#8208;semiconductor core&#8208;shell nanostructures by employing structurally chiral nanoparticles as chirality inducing templates to grow functional shell materials, which allows us to independently control material parameters including core geometry and shell thickness, as well as handedness of the system. We experimentally and theoretically achieve enhanced and tunable chiroptical activity of the hetero&#8208;structures as a result of the core&#8208;shell strong coupling effect. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we show the chiral hybrid nanostructures can drive chirality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic hydrogen generation under circularly polarized light. This study enables rational design and functionalization of chiral hybrid nanomaterials towards enhanced chiral light&#8208;matter interactions and chiral device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet Dynamic Nuclear Polarization of Guest Molecules through Induced Fit in a Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization utilizing photoexcited triplet electrons (triplet&#8208;DNP) has great potential for room&#8208;temperature hyperpolarization of nuclear spins. However, the polarization transfer to molecules of interest remains a challenge due to the fast spin relaxation and weak interaction with target molecules at room temperature in conventional host materials. Here, we demonstrate the first example of DNP of guest molecules in a porous material at around room temperature by utilizing the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;type structural transformation of a crystalline yet flexible metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). In contrast to the usual hosts,  1  H spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time becomes longer by accommodating a pharmaceutical model target 5&#8208;fluorouracil  as the flexible MOF changes its structure upon guest accommodation to maximize the host&#8208;guest interactions. Combined with triplet&#8208;DNP and cross&#8208;polarization (CP), this system realizes an enhanced  19  F&#8208;NMR signal of guest target molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Access Route to High&#8208;Nuclearity, Metal&#8208;Functionalized Molecular Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular metal oxides are key materials in diverse fields like energy storage and conversion, molecular magnetism and as model systems for solid&#8208;state metal oxides. To improve their performance and increase the variety of accessible motifs, new synthetic approaches are necessary. Herein, we report a universal, new precursor to access different metal&#8208;functionalized polyoxovanadate (POV) clusters. The precursor is synthesized by a novel solid&#8208;state thermal treatment procedure. Solution&#8208;phase test reactions at room temperature and pressure show that reaction of the precursor with various metal nitrate salts gives access to a range of metal&#8208;functionalized POVs. The first nitrate&#8208;templated molecular calcium vanadate cluster is reported. We show that this precursor could open new access routes to POV components for molecular magnetism, energy technologies or catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning exciton coupling of merocyanine nucleoside dimers by RNA, DNA and GNA double helix conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exciton coupling between two or more chromophores in a specific environment is a key mechanism associated with color tuning and modulation of absorption energies. This concept is well exemplified by natural photosynthetic proteins, and can also be achieved in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures. Here we report the coupling of barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) nucleoside analogues and show that exciton coupling can be tuned by the double helix conformation. BAM is a nucleobase mimic that was incorporated in the phosphodiester backbone of RNA, DNA and GNA oligo&#173;nucleo&#173;tides. Duplexes with different backbone constitutions and geometries afforded different mutual dye arrangements, leading to distinct optical signatures due to competing modes of chromo&#173;phore organization via electro&#173;static, dipolar, &#960;&#8722;&#960;&#8208;stack&#173;ing and hydrogen bonding inter&#173;actions. The realized supra&#173;molecular motifs include hydrogen&#8208;bonded BAM&#8208;adenine base pairs and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked BAM dimer aggregates with distinct absorption, CD and fluorescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Atom&#8208;Substitution Engineered Transition&#8208;Metal Hydroxide Nanofibers with High&#8208;Valence Fe for Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts for efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key for scalable water electrolysis, for instance, the NiFe&#8208;based materials. Decorating NiFe catalysts with other transition metals offers a new path to boost their catalytic activities but often suffers from low controllability on electronic structures of NiFe catalytic centers. Here, we report an interfacial atom&#8208;substitution strategy to synthesize an electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving NiFeV nanofiber to boost the activity of NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high&#8208;valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The NiFeV nanofiber supported on carbon cloth shows a low overpotential of 181 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  , along with long&#8208;term stability (&gt; 20 h) at 100 mA cm  &#8722;2  . The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemical Biology Toolbox Targeting the Intracellular Binding Site of CCR9: Fluorescent Ligands, New Drug Leads and PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Starting from vercirnon, an intracellular C&#8208;C chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) antagonist and previous phase III clinical candidate for the treatment of Crohn&#8217;s disease, we developed a chemical biology toolbox targeting the IABS of CCR9. We first synthesized a fluorescent ligand enabling equilibrium and kinetic binding studies via NanoBRET as well as fluorescence microscopy. Applying this molecular tool in a membrane&#8208;based setup and in living cells, we discovered a 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine analogue as a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To chemically induce CCR9 degradation, we then developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we succeeded in showing that our CCR9&#8208;PROTAC is able to reduce CCR9 levels, thereby offering an unprecedented approach to modulate GPCR activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing an Effective Glycan&#8208;based Vaccine for Streptococcus Pyogenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptococcus pyogenes is a primary infective agent that causes approximately 700 million human infections each year, resulting in more than 500,000 deaths. Carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccines are proven to be one of the most promising subunit vaccine candidates, as the bacterial glycan pattern(s) are different from mammalian cells and show increased pathogen serotype conservancy than the protein components. In this review we highlight reverse vaccinology for use in the development of subunit vaccines against S. pyogenes, and report reproducible methods of carbohydrate antigen production, in addition to the structure&#8208;immunogenicity correlation between group A carbohydrate epitopes and alternative vaccine antigen carrier systems. We also report recent advances used to overcome hurdles in carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine development.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescent Sensor for Quantitative Super&#8208;resolution Imaging of Amyloid Fibril Assembly.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many soluble proteins can self&#8208;assemble into macromolecular structures called amyloids, a subset of which are implicated in a range of neurodegenerative disorders. The nanoscale size and structural heterogeneity of prefibrillar and early aggregates, as well as mature amyloid fibrils, pose significant challenges for the quantification of amyloid species, identification of their cellular interaction partners and for elucidation of the molecular basis for cytotoxicity. We report a fluorescent amyloid sensor  AmyBlink&#8208;1  and its application in super&#8208;resolution imaging of amyloid structures.  AmyBlink&#8208;1  exhibits a 5&#8208;fold increase in ratio of the green (thioflavin T) to red (Alexa Fluor 647) emission intensities upon interaction with amyloid fibrils. Using  AmyBlink&#8208;1  , we performed nanoscale imaging of four different types of amyloid fibrils, achieving a resolution of ~30 nm.  AmyBlink&#8208;1  enables nanoscale visualization and subsequent quantification of morphological features, such as the length and skew of individual amyloid aggregates formed at different times along the amyloid assembly pathway.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many soluble proteins can self-assemble into macromolecular structures called amyloids, a subset of which are implicated in a range of neurodegenerative disorders. The nanoscale size and structural heterogeneity of prefibrillar and early aggregates, as well as mature amyloid fibrils, pose significant challenges for the quantification of amyloid species, identification of their cellular interaction partners and for elucidation of the molecular basis for cytotoxicity. We report a fluorescent amyloid sensor  AmyBlink-1  and its application in super-resolution imaging of amyloid structures.  AmyBlink-1  exhibits a 5-fold increase in ratio of the green (thioflavin T) to red (Alexa Fluor 647) emission intensities upon interaction with amyloid fibrils. Using  AmyBlink-1  , we performed nanoscale imaging of four different types of amyloid fibrils, achieving a resolution of ~30 nm.  AmyBlink-1  enables nanoscale visualization and subsequent quantification of morphological features, such as the length and skew of individual amyloid aggregates formed at different times along the amyloid assembly pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
