         <title>Biphasic Electrolyte Inhibiting the Shuttle Effect&#160;of Redox Molecules in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox molecules (RMs) as the electron carriers have been widely used in electrochemical energy storage devices (ESDs), such as lithium&#8208;redox flow batteries and lithium&#8208;O  2  &#160;batteries. Unfortunately,&#160;the migration of RMs to Li anode&#160;leads to the side reaction between them, resulting in the reduced coulombic efficiency and early cell death. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study that a biphasic organic electrolyte is constructed to settle down this issue, in&#160;which nonafluoro&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrahydrohexyl&#8208;trimethoxysilane&#160;(NFTOS) and ether (or sulfone) with LiTFSI can be separated to form the immiscible anolyte and catholyte. RMs are extracted to&#160;the catholyte&#160;due to the enormous solubility coefficients in the biphasic electrolyte with high and low polarity, resulting in the inhibition of shuttle effect. When coupling with lithium anode, the Li&#8208;Li symmetric, Li&#8208;redox flow and Li&#8208;O  2  &#160;batteries can achieve&#160;considerably prolonged cycle life with the biphasic electrolytes. This&#160;concept provides a promising strategy to suppress&#160;the shuttle effect of&#160;RMs in their wide application in ESDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Conformer&#8208;Induced Formation of&#160; Zirconium&#8208;Organic Framework&#160; for Methane Storage and MTO Product Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In pursuit of novel adsorbents with efficient adsorptive gas storage and separation capabilities remains highly desired and challenging. Although the documented zirconium&#8208;tricarboxylate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have displayed a variety of topologies encompassing underlying and geometry mismatch ones, the employed organic linkers are exclusively rigid and poorly presenting one type of conformation in the resultant structures. Herein, a used and semirigid tricarboxylate ligand of H3TATAB was judiciously selected to isolate a zirconium&#8208;based  spe&#8208;MOF after   the preliminary discovery of  srl&#8208;MOF. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the fully deprotonated TATAB linker in  spe&#8208;MOF exhibits two distinct conformers, concomitant with popular Oh  and rare S6  symmetrical Zr6  molecular building blocks, generating an unprecedented (3,3,12,12)&#8208;c nondefault topology. Specifically, the  spe&#8208;MOF exhibits structurally higher complexity, hierarchical micropores, open metal sites free and rich electronegative groups on the pore surfaces, leading to relatively high methane storage capacity without considering the missing&#8208;linker defects and efficient MTO product separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) for Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Has Anti&#8208;proliferative Activity in Lung Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in protein&#8208;protein interactions that play key roles in inflammation and cancer. Current strategies to develop small molecule modulators of MIF functions are mainly restricted to MIF tautomerase active site. Here, we use this site to develop proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) in order to eliminate MIF from its protein&#8208;protein interaction network. We report the first potent MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC, denoted  MD13  , which induced almost complete MIF degradation at low micromolar concentrations with a DC  50  around 100 nM in A549.  MD13  suppresses the proliferation of A549 cells, which can be explained by deactivation of the MAPK pathway and subsequent induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.  MD13  also exhibits antiproliferative effect in a 3D tumor spheroid model. In conclusion, we describe the first MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC (  MD13  ) as a research tool, which also demonstrates the potential of PROTACs in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Reactive Oxygen Species Generation by Chiral Co3O4 Supraparticles under Electromagnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation and development of venous thromboembolism accounts for considerable morbidity and mortality.  One of the most common methods to treat thromboembolism is the use of thrombolytic drugs to activate fibrinolytic protease. The aim of this treatment was to initiate the lysis of fibrin; however, there are many side&#8208;effects associated with this form of treatment.  Herein, we fabricated chiral Co  3  O  4  supraparticles (SPs) with a  g  &#8208;factor of up to 0.02 at 550 nm and paramagnetic performance applied in the treatment of thromboembolism under an electromagnetic field (MF).  In vitro  experiments showed that  d  &#8208;SPs degraded blood clot within 8 hours under MF. Compared to  l  &#8208;SPs,  d  &#8208;SPs exhibited much stronger thrombolytic ability and effectively enhanced the survival rate of thrombosis model mice more than 70% in the 25 d of observation. The results of mechanism study showed that under MF, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by  d  &#8208;SPs were 1.5 times higher than that of  l  &#8208;SPs, which might be attributed to the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effects. This discovery paves an inspired pathway to develop chiral nanomaterials for the efficient treatment of thrombosis under MF.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Azaylide&#8208;Based Amphiphiles by Staudinger Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208; and regent&#8208;free reactions are powerful tools creating various functional molecules and materials. However, such chemical bonds are usually hydrolysable or require specific functional groups, which limits their use in aqueous media. Here we report that the development of new amphiphiles through the Staudinger reaction. Simple mixing of chlorinated aryl azide with a hydrophilic moiety and various triarylphosphines (  PAr3  ) gave rise to azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles  NPAr3  , rapidly and quantitatively. The obtained  NPAr3  formed  ca  . 2 nm&#8208;sized spherical aggregates (  NPAr3  )  n  in water. The hydrolysis of  NPAr3  was significantly suppressed as compared with those of non&#8208;chlorinated amphiphiles  nNPAr3  . Computational study revealed the stability is mainly governed by the LUMO modulation around phosphorus atom due to the  o  &#8208;substituted halogen groups. Furthermore, hydrophobic dyes such as Nile red and BODIPY were encapsulated by the spherical aggregates (  NPAr3  )  n  in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanine&#8208;Dyad Molecular Probe for Simultaneous Profiling of Multiple Radical Species Evolution in Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Real&#8208;time sensing the evolution of bacterial infection&#8208;associated multiple radical species is critical to accurately profile the pathogenesis and host&#8208;defense mechanisms, however, only a few currently existing techniques are capable of fully achieving the demanded accuracy in complex living conditions. Here, we present a unique dual wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) cyanine&#8208;dyad molecular probe (HCy5&#8208;Cy7) for simultaneous monitoring of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) variations both in vitro and in vivo. HCy5&#8208;Cy7 specifically turns on its fluorescence at 660 nm via superoxide or hydroxyl radical (O  2  &#8226;     &#8208;    , &#8226;OH)&#8208;mediated oxidation of reduced HCy5 moiety to Cy5, while peroxynitrite or hypochlorous species (ONOO  &#8208;  , ClO  &#8208;  )&#8208;induced Cy7 structural degradation causes the emission turn&#8208;off at 800 nm. Such multispectral but reverse signal responses allow multiplex manifestation of in situ oxidative and nitrosative stress events during the pathogenic and defensive processes in both bacteria&#8208;infected macrophage cells and living mice. Most importantly, this study may also provide new perspectives for understanding the bacterial pathogenesis and advancing the precision medicine against infectious diseases   .</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Loss Management by Molecularly Manipulating Dopant&#8208;free Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) towards 16.93% CsPbI2Br Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites offer a pathway towards thermally stable photovoltaics. However, moisture&#8208;induced phase degradation restricts the application of hole transport layers (HTLs) with hygroscopic dopants. Dopant&#8208;free HTLs fail to realize efficient photovoltaics due to severe electrical loss. Herein, we developed an electrical loss management strategy by manipulating poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) with a small molecule, i.e., SMe&#8208;TATPyr. The developed P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr HTL shows a three&#8208;time increase of carrier mobility owing to breaking the long&#8208;range ordering of &#8220;edge&#8208;on&#8221; P3HT and inducing the formation of &#8220;face&#8208;on&#8221; clusters, over 50% decrease of the perovskite surface defect density, and a reduced voltage loss at the perovskite/HTL interface because of favorable energy level alignment. The CsPbI  2  Br perovskite solar cell demonstrates a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.93% for dopant&#8208;free HTL, and superior moisture and thermal stability by maintaining 96% efficiency at low&#8208;humidity condition (10%&#8208;25% R. H.) for 1500 hours and over 95% efficiency after annealing at 85  o  C for 1000 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Double ionic&#8208;electronic transfer interface layers for all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interface between electrode and solid electrolyte concerning the high resistance and poor stability as well as poor compatibility against the Li+ migration is impeding the large&#8208;scale employment of all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here, we report double ionic&#8208;electronic transfer interface layers at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces by in situ polymerization of 2, 2'&#8208;bithiophene in polyethylene oxide (PEO) electrolyte. For all solid&#8208;state LiFePO4||PT&#8208;PEO&#8208;PT||Li cells, the formation of conductive polythiophene (PT) layer at cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface resulted in at least 7&#8208;fold decrease in interface resistance, and realized capacity retention of about 94% after 1000 cycles along with lower polarization voltage under 2 C rate. The mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductive layers imparted superior interface stability and contact while keeping good compatibility with Li anode.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;driven Oxygen Vacancies Extends Charge Carrier Lifetime for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excessive surface oxygen vacancies would decrease the charge carrier lifetime and cause the serious recombination at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. In this context, a&#8220;photocharge/discharge&#8221;strategy exposure to AM 1.5G sunlight is proposed to initiate the WO  3  photoelectrode and suppress the main charge recombination, which remarkably improves the photoelectrochemical (PEC) perormance. The photocharged WO  3  surrounded by a 8&#8208;10 nm overlayer and oxygen vacancies could be operated more than 25 cycles with 50 h durability without significant decay on PEC activity. Further heterojuncted with the CuO, the photocharged WO  3  /CuO photpanode exhibits an outstanding photocurrent of 3.2 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.23 V  RHE  with a low onset potential of 0.6 V  RHE  , which is one of the best performance of  p&#8208;n  heterojunction structure. Importantly, using the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time&#8208;domain density functional theory, we clarify the prolonged charge carrier lifetime of photocharged WO  3  , as well as how electronic systems of photocharged WO  3  /CuO semiconductors enable the effective photoinduced electrons transfer from WO  3  into CuO. This work provides a feasible route to address excessive defects existed &#160;in photoelectrodes whilst without causing the extra recombination, further enhancing the carrier lifetime and boosting PEC water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Clinical Technologies for Hyperpolarized Xenon&#8208;129 MRI and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarization is a technique that can increase nuclear spin polarization with the corresponding gains in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal by 4&#8208;8 orders of magnitude. By applying this process to biologically relevant samples, they can be used as exogenous MRI contrast agents. A technique called Spin Exchange Optical Pumping (SEOP) can be applied to hyperpolarize noble gases such as 129Xe. Hyperpolarized 129Xe is poised to revolutionize clinical lung imaging, offering a non&#8208;ionizing, high contrast alternative to CT imaging and conventional proton MRI. Moreover, CT and conventional proton MRI report on lung tissue structure but provide no functional information although substantial progress has been made recently using ultrashort (UTE) TE MRI to obtain surrogate ventilation metrics. On the other hand, by breathing hyperpolarized 129Xe gas, strong MRI signal can be obtained to produce functional lung images reporting on lung ventilation, perfusion and diffusion with 3D readout in seconds. In this Review, the physics of SEOP is discussed and the different production modalities are explained in the context of their clinical application. We also briefly compare SEOP to other hyperpolarization methods and conclude this paper with the biomedical outlook for hyperpolarized 129Xe applications to lung imaging and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Particle&#8208;by&#8208;particle in situ characterization of the protein corona via real&#8208;time 3D single&#8208;particle tracking spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when exposed to biological fluids, forming a dynamic protein corona that affects their fate in biological environments. A comprehensive understanding of the protein corona is lacking due to the inability of current techniques to precisely measure the full corona in situ at the single particle level. Herein, we introduce a 3D real&#8208;time single&#8208;particle tracking spectroscopy to "lock&#8208;on" to single freely diffusing polystyrene NPs and probe their individual protein coronas, primarily using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions as a model system. The fluorescence signals and diffusive motions of the tracked NPs enable quantification of the "hard corona" using mean&#8208;squared displacement analysis. Critically, this method's particle&#8208;by&#8208;particle nature enabled a lock&#8208;in&#8208;type frequency filtering approach to extract the full protein corona, despite the typically confounding effect of high background signal from unbound proteins. From these results, the dynamic in situ full protein corona is observed to contain double the number of proteins than are observed in the ex situ measured "hard" protein corona.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective N&#8208;Arylation of p&#8208;Aminophenylalanine in Unprotected Peptides with Organometallic Palladium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective N&#8208;arylation of p&#8208;aminophenylalanine in polypeptides with pre&#8208;formed palladium oxidative addition complexes is described. The depressed pKa of the aniline NH2 group enables chemoselective C&#8722;N bond formation on peptides containing multiple other aliphatic amino groups at lysines or the N&#8208;terminus via Curtin&#8208;Hammett control under mild conditions. Using palladium complexes derived from electron&#8208;poor aryl halides, p&#8208;aminophenylalanine is fully arylated in aqueous buffer in as little as one hour at micromolar concentrations. A complementary protocol using the non&#8208;nucleophilic, organic base 1,5&#8208;diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non&#8208;5&#8208;ene (DBN), expands the substrate scope to tolerate electron&#8208;rich functional groups provides up to 97% conversion. These procedures enable the chemoselective conjugation of functionally diverse small molecule pharmaceuticals to p&#8208;aminophenylalanine containing derivatives of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocycle/Heteroallene Ring Opening Copolymerisation: Selective Catalysis Delivering Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom containing polymers have strong potential as sustainable replacements for petrochemicals, show controllable monomer&#8208;polymer equilibria and properties spanning plastics, elastomers, fibres, resins, foams, coatings, adhesives and self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Their current and future applications span packaging, house&#8208;hold goods, clothing, automotive components, electronics, optical materials, sensors and medical products. An interesting route to these polymers is the catalysed ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) of heterocycles and heteroallenes. It is a living polymerization, occurs with high atom economy and creates precise, new polymer structures inaccessible by traditional methods. In the last decade there has been renaissance in research and increasing examples of commercial products made using ROCOP. It is better known in the production of polycarbonates and polyesters but is also a powerful route to make N&#8208;, S&#8208; and other heteroatom containing polymers, including polyamides, polycarbamates, polythioesters and others. This review presents an overview of the different catalysts, monomer combinations and polymer classes accessed by heterocycle/heteroallene ROCOP. It aims to provide a guide for users both to the catalysis and the resulting materials properties as well as highlighting opportunities for future research and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of First Magnesium Fluorooxoborate with Stable Fluorine Terminated Framework for Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first magnesium fluorooxoborate MgB5O7F3 was synthesized as a new competitive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO application. More importantly, we demonstrated that fluorooxoborate system with the general formula of MB5O7F3 (M=divalent metal) possesses stable fluorine terminated framework, which makes them tend to retain their crystallized space groups unchanged.







Abstract
The generated light can be tuned to cover almost the entire spectral range from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to terahertz wavelengths by utilizing the nonlinear optical crystals with a simple frequency doubling process. Among them, the discovery of novel candidates for the production of deep&#8208;ultraviolet light is by extension a great challenge toward realizing the vast potential. Actually, the availability for this process mainly depends on whether the critical performance can be well coexisted in one practical crystal. Herein, the first magnesium fluorooxoborate MgB5O7F3 was synthesized as a new competitive candidate for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical application. It has a sufficiently large nonlinearity and a deep&#8208;ultraviolet phase matching wavelength, indicating that it holds great potential for the production of coherent light below 200&#8197;nm. The critical performance enhancement of MgB5O7F3 when compared with its isomorphic phases was demonstrated and discussed. More importantly, we proposed that fluorooxoborate system with the general formula of MB5O7F3 (M=divalent metal) possesses stable fluorine terminated framework, which makes them tend to retain their crystallized space groups unchanged.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electro&#8208;reforming of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural on Vertically Oriented Nickel Nanosheet/Carbon Hybrid Catalysts: Structure&#8211;Function Relationships</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stable electro&#8208;reforming of HMF into FDCA on a Ni nanosheet/carbon paper electrode is achieved at a potential of 1.36&#8197;VRHE with 99.7&#8201;% conversion. A precursor&#8208;limiting electrodeposition method creates a unique Ni nanosheet forest structure with vastly different physical appearance and catalytic activity comparing with conventional Ni catalysts.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;promoted electrocatalytic biomass reforming has shown promising prospect in enabling high value&#8208;added product synthesis. Here, we developed a novel hybrid catalyst with Ni nanosheet forests anchored on carbon paper. The hybrid catalyst exhibits high efficiency in electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA coupling with H2 production in high purity. The Ni nanosheets have small crystal grain sizes with abundant edges, which is able to deliver an efficient HMF oxidation to FDCA (selectivity &gt;99&#8201;%) at low potential of 1.36&#8197;VRHE with high stability. The post&#8208;reaction structure analysis reveals the Ni nanosheets would transfer electrons to carbon and readily turn into NiOx and Ni(OH)x during the reaction. DFT results suggest high valence Ni species would facilitate the chemical adsorption (activation) of HMF revealing the reaction pathway. This work emphasizes the importance of the precise control of Ni activity via atomic structure engineering.

         <title>Heterometallic Coinage Metal Acetylenediide Clusters Showing Tailored Thermochromic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of heterometallic coinage metal acetylenediide clusters (C2)3&#8208;Au6AgM6 (M=Ag/Cu) were prepared via a heterometallic precursor approach. They are isostructural but display different thermochromic luminescence. The replacement of silver with copper changes the HOMO character to induce dual&#8208;emission in (C2)3&#8208;Au6AgCu6, and this dual&#8208;emission is associated from two emissive states favored at different temperatures.







Abstract
Acetelyenediide (C22&#8722;) species have been encapsulated in bimetallic and trimetallic clusters: [(AuL)6Ag7(C&#8801;C)3](BF4)7 (2) and [(AuL)6AgCu6(C&#8801;C)3](BF4)7 (3), L=phenylbis(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine (PPhpy2). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that they are isostructural and six silver atoms in 2 are replaced with copper in 3. Both clusters have a trefoil skeleton, which can be viewed as three trigonal bipyramidal (LAu&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;AuL)M2Ag (M=Ag/Cu) motifs sharing a common silver atom. TDDFT calculations showed Cu&#8208;doping significantly increases the energy level of (C2&#8208;Cu)&#8208;involved occupied orbital, thus inducing interesting transition coupling of dual&#8208;emission at low temperature. This work not only provides a strategy for constructing heterometallic clusters, but also shows the prospect for pursuing novel thermochromic luminescent materials by incorporating multi&#8208;congeneric metal components.

         <title>Enhancing Rechargeable Persistent Luminescence via Organic Dye Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was discovered to boost the rechargeable persistent luminescence performance of the persistent luminescence nanoparticles. The dye sensitized nanoparticles are used for PersL imaging guided tumorectomy. They provide simultaneous enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;background afterglow intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and simple microscopic fluorescent cellular imaging.







Abstract
Owing to their unique afterglow ability, long&#8208;wavelength light activatable persistent luminescence (PersL) nanoparticles (PLNPs) have been emerging as an important category of imaging probes. Long&#8208;wavelength LED light has been shown to be effective in recharging these nanoparticles. However, finding a simple and effective method to amplify such renewable PersL signals under long&#8208;wavelength light is still a key challenge. Herein, we discovered that a dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was able to effectively boost the renewable PersL signals of the NIR emitting ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ (ZGC)) under long&#8208;wavelength LED light. Moreover, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle tumorectomy demonstration, this new class of dye sensitized ZGC enabled simultaneous intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and effective microscopic detection of tumor cells in pathological diagnosis.

         <title>Consecutive ligand&#8208;based electron transfer in new molecular Cu&#8208;based water oxidation catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water oxidation to dioxygen is one of the key reactions that need to be mastered for the design of practical devices based on water splitting with sunlight. In this context, water oxidation catalysts based on first&#8208;row transition metal complexes are highly desirable due to their low cost and their synthetic versatility and tunability through rational ligand design. A new family of dianionic bpy&#8208;amidate ligands of general formula H  2  LN  n&#8208;  (LN is [2,2'&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6'&#8208;dicarboxamide) substituted with phenyl or naphthyl redox non&#8208;innocent moieties is described. A detailed electrochemical analysis of  [(L4)Cu]  2&#8208;  (L4 = 4,4'&#8208;(([2,2'&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6'&#8208;dicarbonyl)bis(azanediyl))dibenzenesulfonate) at pH = 11.6 shows the presence of a large electrocatalytic wave for water oxidation catalysis at an &#951; = 830 mV. Combined experimental and computational evidences, support an all ligand&#8208;based process with redox events taking place at the aryl&#8208;amide groups and at the hydroxido ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Zippers as an Enabling Tool for Engineering of Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are the origin of a wide range of natural products, including many clinically used drugs. Efficient engineering of these often&#8208;giant biosynthetic machineries to produce novel non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) is an ongoing challenge. Here we describe a cloning and co&#8208;expression strategy to functionally combine NRPS fragments of Gram&#8208;negative and &#8208;positive origin, synthesising novel peptides at titres up to 220 mg l  &#8208;1  . Extending from the recently introduced definition of e  X  change&#160;  U  nits (XUs),&#160;we inserted synthetic zippers (SZs) to split single protein NRPSs into independently expressed and translated polypeptide chains. These synthetic type of NRPS (type S) enables easier access to engineering, overcomes cloning limitations, and provides a simple and rapid approach to building peptide libraries via the combination of different NRPS subunits.</dc:description>

         <title>Loading linear arrays of Cu(II) inside aromatic amide helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The very stable helices of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid oligoamides are shown to uptake Cu(II) ions in their cavity through deprotonation of their amide functions with minimal alteration of their shape, unlike most metallo&#8208;organic structures which generally much differ from their organic precursors. The outcome is the formation of intramolecular linear arrays of a defined number of Cu(II) centers (up to sixteen in this study) at a 3 &#197; distance, forming a molecular mimic of a metal wire completely surrounded by an organic sheath. The helices pack in the solid state so that the arrays of Cu(II) extend intermolecularly. Conductive&#8208;AFM and cyclic voltammetry suggest that electrons are transported throughout the metal&#8208;loaded helices in contrast with hole transport observed for analogous foldamers devoid of metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>A family of superhelicenes &#8211; Easily tunable, chiral nanographenes by merging helicity with planar &#960;&#8208;systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating helicity into large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitutes a new field of research at the interface between chemistry and material sciences. Lately, interest in the design of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes has surged. This new class of twisted, chiral nanographenes not only reveals unique characteristics but also finds its way into emerging applications such as spintronics. Insights into their structure&#8208;property relationships and on&#8208;demand tuning are scarce. To close these knowledge gaps, we designed a straightforward synthetic route towards a full&#8208;fledged family of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes: superhelicenes. Common are two hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) connected via a central 5&#8208;membered ring. By means of structurally altering this 5&#8208;membered ring, we realized a versatile library of molecular building blocks. Not only the superhelicene structure, but also their features are tuned with ease. In&#8208;depth physico&#8208;chemical characterizations served as a proof of concept thereof. The superhelicene enantiomers were separated, their circular dichroism was measured in preliminary studies and concluded with an enantiomeric assignment. Our work was rounded&#8208;off by crystal structure analyses. Mixed stacks of M&#8208; and P&#8208;isomers led to twisted molecular wires. Using such stacks, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities were calculated, giving reason to expect outstanding hole transporting properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Sanglifehrin A and B and Analogs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sanglifehrin A and B are immunosuppressive macrocyclic natural products endowed with and differentiated by a unique spirocyclic lactam. Here, we report an enantioselective total synthesis and biological evaluation of sanglifehrin A and B and analogs. Access to the spirocyclic lactam was achieved via convergent assembly of a key pyranone intermediate followed by a stereo&#8208;controlled spirocyclization. The 22&#8208;membered macrocyclic core was synthesized by ring&#8208;closing metathesis in the presence of 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl) benzeneboronic acid (BFBB). The spirocyclic lactam and macrocycle fragments were united by a Stille coupling to furnish sanglifehrin A and B. Additional sanglifehrin B analogs with variation at the C40 position were additionally prepared. Biological evaluation revealed that the 2&#8208;CF3 analog of sanglifehrin B exhibited higher anti&#8208;proliferative activity than the natural products sanglifehrin A and B in Jurkat cells. Both natural products induced higher&#8208;order homodimerization of cyclophilin A (CypA), but only sanglifehrin A promoted CypA complexation with inosine&#8208;5'&#8208;monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2). The synthesis reported here will enable further evaluation of the spirolactam and its contribution to sanglifehrin&#8208;dependent immunosuppressive activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report facile synthesis and multiple inherent properties of low&#8208;bandgap mesoporous C  4  N particles and showcase its previously&#8208;unexplored use as universal responsive bifunctional oxygen catalysts for constructing visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive (VLS) rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (RZAB) and polymer&#8208;air battery (RPAB) towards solar energy conversion/storage. Compared to widely&#8208;studied g&#8208;C  3  N  4  , as&#8208;obtained C  4  N shows a smaller bandgap of 1.99 eV with larger photocurrent response and can function simultaneously as visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna and bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution (ORR/OER) catalyst, enabling effective photo&#8208;coupling to tune oxygen catalysis. In addition to good energy storage performance, the C  4  N&#8208;enabled VLS&#8208;RZAB displays a low charge voltage of 1.35 V under visible light &#8211; below the theoretical RZAB voltage of 1.65 V, corresponding to a high energy efficiency of 97.78 %. Pairing C  4  N cathode with polymer anode also endows an entirely&#8208;new all&#8208;polymer VLS&#8208;RPAB with light&#8208;boosted charge performance, implying the generality of our strategy. Combined theoretical and experimental studies unveil that the ORR and OER active sites in C  4  N are separate carbon sites near pyrazine&#8208;nitrogen atoms and photo&#8208;generated energetic holes can activate OER for improved reaction kinetics. This study not only highlights a rarely&#8208;explored carbon nitride polymer and its new property and application but also opens new opportunities to develop organic semiconductors for photo&#8208;coupled rechargeable batteries towards solar energy utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Interactions in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Isoreticular Series for Molecular Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to improve homogeneous molecular catalyst stability, efficiency, and selectivity is immobilization on supporting surfaces or within host matrices. Here, we examine the immobilization of CO2  reduction catalyst [ReBr(CO)3(4,4&#8217;&#8208;dcbpy)] and photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)2(5,5&#8217;&#8208;dcbpy)]Cl2  using the isoreticular series of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) UiO&#8208;66, &#8208;67, and &#8208;68. Specific host pore size choice enables distinct catalyst and photosensitizer spatial location &#8211; either at the outer MOF particle surface or inside the MOF cavities &#8211; affecting catalyst stability, electronic communication between reaction centre and photosensitizer, and consequently the apparent catalytic rates. These results allow for a rational understanding of optimized supramolecular layout of catalyst, photosensitizer, and host matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled peptide nano&#8208;superstructure towards enzyme mimicking hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural arrangement of amino acid residues in native enzymes underlies their remarkable catalytic properties, thus providing a notable point of reference for designing potent yet simple biomimetic catalysts. Herein, we describe a minimalistic approach to construct a dipeptide&#8208;based nano&#8208;superstructure with enzyme&#8208;like activity. The self&#8208;assembled biocatalyst comprises one peptide as a single building block, readily synthesized from histidine. Through coordination with zinc ion, the peptide self&#8208;assembly procedure allows the formation of supramolecular &#946;&#8208;sheet ordered nanocrystals, which can be used as basic units to further construct higher&#8208;order superstructure. As a result, remarkable hydrolysis activity and enduring stability are demonstrated. Our work exemplifies the use of a bioinspired supramolecular assembly approach to develop next&#8208;generation biocatalysts for biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report an efficient and broadly applicable palladium&#8208;catalyzed iodination of inexpensive and abundant aryl and vinyl carboxylic acids via  in situ  activation to the acid chloride and formation of a phosphonium salt. The use of 1&#8208;iodobutane as iodide source in combination with a base and a deoxychlorinating reagent gives access to a wide range of aryl and vinyl iodides under Pd/Xantphos catalysis, including complex drug&#8208;like scaffolds. Stoichiometric experiments and kinetic analysis suggest a unique mechanism involving C&#8211;P reductive elimination to form the Xantphos phosphonium chloride which subsequently initiates an unusual halogen exchange by outer sphere nucleophilic substitution.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Switchable Catalysis for One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Cyclic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the temporal/spatial control over reactions, switchable catalysis is emerging as a powerful tool to regulate polymer sequence and architecture directly from monomer mixtures.  Herein,  a cobalt salen pentenoate complex [salen = (  R,R  )&#8208;  N,N&#8242;  &#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutylsalicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine  ] is rationally designed as the catalyst for the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides/CO  2  . Via the migratory insertion of carbon monoxide (CO) into the Co&#8208;O bonds, the ROCOP active species  &#945;  &#8208;alkene&#8208;  &#969;  &#8208;O&#8208;Co  III  (salen) can be rapidly and quantitatively transformed into  &#945;  &#8208;alkene&#8208;  &#969;  &#8208;O  2  C&#8208;Co  III  (salen) telechelic linear precursors. Upon dilution of reaction mixtures, the homolytic cleavage of Co&#8208;C bonds induced by visible light generates  &#945;  &#8208;alkene acyl radicals that spontaneously undergo intramolecular radical addition to afford organocobalt functionalized cyclic polyesters and CO  2  &#8208;based polycarbonates with excellent regioselectivity. The cyclic products can either react with radical scavengers to generate metal&#8208;free cyclic polymers or serve as the photo initiators for  organometallic mediated radical polymerization (OMRP)  to produce tadpole&#8208;shaped copolymers. This work opens a new avenue for the direct synthesis of cyclic polymers from monomer mixtures via switchable catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of Magnesium&#8208;Doped Lithium Metal Anode for High Performance Lithium Metal Batteries through Modeling and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li)&#8208;magnesium (Mg) alloy with limited Mg amount, which can also be called Mg&#8208;doped Li (Li&#8208;Mg), has been considered as a potential alternative anode for high energy density rechargeable Li metal batteries. However, the optimum doping&#8208;content of Mg in Li&#8208;Mg anode and the mechanism of the improved performance are not well understood. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the effect of Mg amount in Li&#8208;Mg anode. The Li&#8208;Mg with about 5 wt.% Mg (abbreviated as Li&#8208;Mg5) has the lowest absorption energy of Li, thus all the surface area can be &#8220;controlled&#8221; by Mg atoms, leading to the smooth and continuous deposition of Li on the surface around the Mg center. A localized high concentration electrolyte enables Li&#8208;Mg5 to exhibit the best cycling stability in Li metal batteries with high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte under 4.4 V high&#8208;voltage, which is approaching the demand of practical application.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li)-magnesium (Mg) alloy with limited Mg amount, which can also be called Mg-doped Li (Li-Mg), has been considered as a potential alternative anode for high energy density rechargeable Li metal batteries. However, the optimum doping-content of Mg in Li-Mg anode and the mechanism of the improved performance are not well understood. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the effect of Mg amount in Li-Mg anode. The Li-Mg with about 5 wt.% Mg (abbreviated as Li-Mg5) has the lowest absorption energy of Li, thus all the surface area can be &#8220;controlled&#8221; by Mg atoms, leading to the smooth and continuous deposition of Li on the surface around the Mg center. A localized high concentration electrolyte enables Li-Mg5 to exhibit the best cycling stability in Li metal batteries with high-loading cathode and lean electrolyte under 4.4 V high-voltage, which is approaching the demand of practical application. This electrolyte also helps generate an inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase, which leads to smooth, compact and less corrosion layer on the Li-Mg5 surface. Both theoretical simulations and experimental results prove that Li-Mg5 has optimum Mg content and gives best battery cycling performance. This work also provides an effective approach to identify optimal alloy-type Li metal anodes for improving long-term cycling stability of high-energy-density Li metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene/Carboxylic Acid Co&#8208;Catalysis Enables Oxidative Esterification of Demanding Aldehydes/Enals,

at Low Catalyst Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the discovery that simple carboxylic acids, such as benzoic acid, boost the activity of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts in the oxidative esterification of aldehydes. A simple and efficient protocol for the transformation of a wide range of sterically hindered alpha&#8208; and beta&#8208;substituted aliphatic aldehydes/enals, catalyzed by a novel and readily accessible N&#8208;Mes&#8208;/N&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt, and benzoic acid as co&#8208;catalyst, was developed. A whole series of a/b&#8208;substituted aliphatic aldehydes/enals hitherto not amenable to NHC&#8208;catalyzed esterification could be reacted at typical catalyst loadings of 0.02 &#8208; 1.0 mol %. For benzaldehyde, even 0.005 mol % of NHC catalyst proved sufficient &#8208; the lowest value ever achieved in NHC catalysis. Preliminary studies point to carbox&#173;ylic acid&#8208;induced acceleration of acyl transfer from azolium enolate intermediates as the mechanistic basis of the observed effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Human Oxygenase Variants Employing a Single Protein FeII Ligand Are Catalytically Active</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A human 2&#8208;oxoglutarate and FeII dependent oxygenase was engineered to possess only one protein FeII binding ligand. The resultant variants retained significant levels of catalytic activity. Biomimetic catalysts containing only one metal binding site are therefore of interest.







Abstract
Aspartate/asparagine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase (AspH) is a human 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) and FeII oxygenase that catalyses C3 hydroxylations of aspartate/asparagine residues of epidermal growth factor&#8208;like domains (EGFDs). Unusually, AspH employs two histidine residues to chelate FeII rather than the typical triad of two histidine and one glutamate/aspartate residue. We report kinetic, inhibition, and crystallographic studies concerning human AspH variants in which either of its FeII binding histidine residues are substituted for alanine. Both the H725A and, in particular, the H679A AspH variants retain substantial catalytic activity. Crystal structures clearly reveal metal&#8208;ligation by only a single protein histidine ligand. The results have implications for the functional assignment of 2OG oxygenases and for the design of non&#8208;protein biomimetic catalysts.

         <title>Semiconductor Bow&#8208;Tie Nanoantenna from Coupled Colloidal Quantum Dot Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip fusion of two tetrahedral nanocrystal quantum dots yielded the smallest bow&#8208;tie nanoantenna architecture, which manifests an electromagnetic&#8208;photocatalyitic hotspot at its epicenter.







Abstract
Top&#8208;down fabricated nanoantenna architectures of both metallic and dielectric materials show powerful functionalities for Raman and fluorescence enhancement with relevance to single molecule sensing while inducing directionality of chromophore emission with implications for single photon sources. We synthesize the smallest bow&#8208;tie nanoantenna by selective tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip fusion of two tetrahedral colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) forming a dimer. While the tetrahedral monomers emit non&#8208;polarized light, the bow&#8208;tie architecture manifests nanoantenna functionality of enhanced emission polarization along the bow&#8208;tie axis, as predicted theoretically and revealed by single&#8208;particle spectroscopy. Theory also predicts the formation of an electric&#8208;field hotspot at the bow&#8208;tie epicenter. This is utilized for selective light&#8208;induced photocatalytic metal growth at that location, unlike growth on the free tips in dark conditions, thus demonstrating bow&#8208;tie dimer functionality as a photochemical reaction center.

         <title>Discovery of Oligosaccharide Antigens for Semi&#8208;Synthetic Glycoconjugate Vaccine Leads against Streptococcus suis Serotypes 2, 3, 9 and&#8197;14**
</title>

         <dc:description>
30 novel oligosaccharides resembling the capsular polysaccharides related to four major serotypes (2, 3, 9, 14) of Streptococcus suis (S.&#8197;suis) were synthesized. The conjugation&#8208;ready glycans were used to screen the sera of pigs and rabbits. With a glycan array study, glycan epitopes of lead antigens for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines to protect from S.&#8197;suis serotypes 2 and 9 were identified.







Abstract
Streptococcus suis bacteria are one of the most serious health problems for pigs and an emerging zoonotic agent in humans working in the swine industry. S.&#8197;suis bacteria express capsular polysaccharides (CPS) a major bacterial virulence factor that define the serotypes. Oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of S. suis serotypes 2, 3, 9, and 14 have been synthesized, glycans related to serotypes 2 and 9 were placed on glycan array surfaces to screen blood from infected pigs. Lead antigens for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic S. suis serotypes 2 and 9 glycoconjugate veterinary vaccines were identified in this way.

         <title>XFEL Crystal Structures of Peroxidase Compound II</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic fine&#8208;tuning of heme reactivity: Free&#8208;electron laser crystal structures of two different heme&#8208;containing peroxidases&#8212;cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase&#8212;show differences in the nature of the ferryl species. Precise enzymatic fine&#8208;tuning within structurally similar heme active sites is implicated.







Abstract
Oxygen activation in all heme enzymes requires the formation of high oxidation states of iron, usually referred to as ferryl heme. There are two known intermediates: Compound I and Compound II. The nature of the ferryl heme&#8212;and whether it is an FeIV=O or FeIV&#8208;OH species&#8212;is important for controlling reactivity across groups of heme enzymes. The most recent evidence for Compound I indicates that the ferryl heme is an unprotonated FeIV=O species. For Compound II, the nature of the ferryl heme is not unambiguously established. Here, we report 1.06&#8197;&#197; and 1.50&#8197;&#197; crystal structures for Compound II intermediates in cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), collected using the X&#8208;ray free electron laser at SACLA. The structures reveal differences between the two peroxidases. The iron&#8208;oxygen bond length in CcP (1.76&#8197;&#197;) is notably shorter than in APX (1.87&#8197;&#197;). The results indicate that the ferryl species is finely tuned across Compound I and Compound II species in closely related peroxidase enzymes. We propose that this fine&#8208;tuning is linked to the functional need for proton delivery to the heme.

         <title>Simultaneous Broadening and Enhancement of Cr3+ Photoluminescence in LiIn2SbO6 by Chemical Unit Cosubstitution: Night&#8208;Vision and Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy Detection Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable photoluminescence tuning of ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr3+ phosphor is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+] for [Li+&#8211;In3+], and its potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopic applications is demonstrated.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting phosphor materials have been extensively developed for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. Although Cr3+&#8208;activated phosphors have been widely reported, it is challenging to achieve ultra&#8208;broad and tunable NIR emission. Here, a new ultra&#8208;broadband NIR&#8208;emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr3+ phosphor with emission peak at 965&#8197;nm and a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 217&#8197;nm is reported. Controllable emission tuning from 965 to 892&#8197;nm is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+] for [Li+&#8211;In3+], which can be ascribed to the upshift of 4T2g energy level due to the strengthened crystal field. Moreover, the emission is greatly enhanced, and the FWHM reaches 235&#8197;nm. The as&#8208;prepared luminescent tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors have demonstrated the potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopy techniques. This work proves the feasibility of chemical unit cosubstitution strategy in emission tuning of Cr3+&#8208;doped phosphors, which can stimulate further studies on the emission&#8208;tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphor materials.

         <title>Activation of the Catalytic Activity of Thrombin for Fibrin Formation by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise regulation of protein activity is important to understand complex biological signaling networks and to devise new therapeutic approaches. Here, we use either polyaptamers or split aptamer&#8208;conjugated AuNPs to inhibit the activity of thrombin. Mechanical force generated by ultrasound is exploited to activate thrombin, thereby catalyzing the formation of fibrin from fibrinogen.







Abstract
The regulation of enzyme activity is a method to control biological function. We report two systems enabling the ultrasound&#8208;induced activation of thrombin, which is vital for secondary hemostasis. First, we designed polyaptamers, which can specifically bind to thrombin, inhibiting its catalytic activity. With ultrasound generating inertial cavitation and therapeutic medical focused ultrasound, the interactions between polyaptamer and enzyme are cleaved, restoring the activity to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Second, we used split aptamers conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of thrombin, these assemble into an aptamer tertiary structure, induce AuNP aggregation, and deactivate the enzyme. By ultrasonication, the AuNP aggregates reversibly disassemble releasing and activating the enzyme. We envision that this approach will be a blueprint to control the function of other proteins by mechanical stimuli in the sonogenetics field.

         <title>Introduction of Photolatent Bases for Locally Controlling Dynamic Exchange Reactions in Thermo&#8208;Activated Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vitrimers are covalently crosslinked polymers capable of rearranging their network topology through thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions. However, a locally controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions at elevated temperatures is a major challenge. A fundamental concept is demonstrated that enables controlled and, moreover, spatially resolved topology rearrangements triggerable by UV irradiation.







Abstract
Vitrimers exhibit a covalently crosslinked network structure, as is characteristic of classic thermosetting polymers. However, they are capable of rearranging their network topology by thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions when the topology freezing transition temperature (Tv) is exceeded. Despite the vast number of developed vitrimers, there is a serious lack of methods that enable a (spatially) controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions above Tv. Herein, we highlight the localized release of the efficient transesterification catalyst 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) by the UV&#8208;induced cleavage of a photolatent base within a covalently crosslinked thiol&#8211;epoxy network. Demonstrated with stress relaxation measurements conducted well above the network's Tv, only the controlled release of TBD facilitates the immediate onset of transesterification in terms of a viscoelastic flow. Moreover, the spatially resolved UV&#8208;mediated photoactivation of vitrimeric properties is confirmed by permanent shape changes induced locally in the material.

         <title>Interfacial Polymerization at the Alkane/Ionic Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial polymerization at the alkane/ionic liquid interface has been designed. The extendibility, designability, and controllability brought by the ionic liquid replace the instability and low solubility caused by water in conventional polymerization. The polyamide nanofilms synthesized at the new delicate water&#8208;insoluble monomer interfaces possess adjustable pore size and exhibit unprecedented performance in various separation applications.







Abstract
Polymerization at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface has attracted much attention for synthesizing ultrathin polymer films for molecular sieving. However, it remains a major challenge to conduct this process outside the alkane&#8211;water interface since it not only suffers water&#8208;caused side reactions but also is limited to water&#8208;soluble monomers. Here, we report the interfacial polymerization at the alkane/ionic liquid interface (IP@AILI) where the ionic liquid acts as the universal solvent for diversified amines to synthesize task&#8208;specific polyamide nanofilms. We propose that IP@AILI occurs when acyl chloride diffuses from the alkane into the ionic liquid instead of being triggered by the diffusion of amines as in the conventional alkane&#8211;water system, which is demonstrated by thermodynamic partitioning and kinetic monitoring. The prepared polyamide nanofilms with precisely adjustable pore sizes display unprecedented permeability and selectivity in various separation processes.

         <title>pH&#8208;Amplified CRET Nanoparticles for In Vivo Imaging of Tumor Metastatic Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pH&#8208;amplified self&#8208;illuminating nanoprobes dually respond to acidity and myeloperoxidase of phagosome in inflammatory macrophages were synthesized. The nanoparticles exhibit excellent imaging capability for identification of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes in diverse animal tumor models.







Abstract
Noninvasive imaging strategies have been extensively investigated for in vivo mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, the current imaging strategies fail to accurately assess tumor metastatic status in SLNs with high sensitivity. Here we report pH&#8208;amplified self&#8208;illuminating near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles, which integrate chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) and signal amplification strategy, enabling accurate identification of metastatic SLNs. After draining into lymph nodes, the nanoparticles were phagocytosed and dissociated in acidic phagosomes of inflammatory macrophages to emit near&#8208;infrared luminescent light. Using these nanoparticles, we successfully differentiated tumor metastatic lymph nodes from benign ones. These nanoparticles also exhibited excellent imaging capability for early detection of metastatic SLNs in diverse animal tumor models with small tumor volume (100&#8211;200&#8197;mm3).

         <title>Off&#8208;Set Interactions of Ruthenium&#8211;bda Type Catalysts for Promoting Water&#8208;Splitting Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the position of substituents on the axial ligand of the popular Ru(bda)L2 water&#8208;splitting catalyst can enable catalysis at low concentrations with high turnover frequencies. Kinetic results indicate superiority of asymmetric catalysts and DFT studies show that this is through positioning of two catalytic units in parallel planes minimizing the X&#8211;&#960; distance and optimizing stacking.







Abstract
O&#8722;O bond formation with Ru(bda)L2&#8208;type catalysts is well&#8208;known to proceed through a bimolecular reaction pathway, limiting the potential application of these catalysts at low concentrations. Herein, we achieved high efficiencies with mononuclear catalysts, with TOFs of 460&#177;32&#8197;s&#8722;1 at high catalyst loading and 31&#177;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 at only 1&#8197;&#956;M catalyst concentration, by simple structural considerations on the axial ligands. Kinetic and DFT studies show that introduction of an off&#8208;set in the interaction between the two catalytic units reduces the kinetic barrier of the second&#8208;order O&#8722;O bond formation, maintaining high catalytic activity even at low catalyst concentrations. The results herein furthermore suggest that &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions may only play a minor role in the observed catalytic activity, and that asymmetry can also rationalize high activity observed for Ru(bda)(isoq)2 type catalysts and offer inspiration to overcome the limitations of 2nd order catalysis.

         <title>Development of Continuous Flow Systems to Access Secondary Amines Through Previously Incompatible Biocatalytic Cascades**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of continuous flow reactors enabled previously inaccessible enzyme combinations in multi&#8208;enzyme cascade reactions. This included combination of oxidases with aminating biocatalysts (transaminase/reductive aminase) and was extended to the continuous in situ biocatalytic generation of amino donors for the reductive aminase.







Abstract
A key aim of biocatalysis is to mimic the ability of eukaryotic cells to carry out multistep cascades in a controlled and selective way. As biocatalytic cascades get more complex, reactions become unattainable under typical batch conditions. Here a number of continuous flow systems were used to overcome batch incompatibility, thus allowing for successful biocatalytic cascades. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, reactive carbonyl intermediates were generated in situ using alcohol oxidases, then passed directly to a series of packed&#8208;bed modules containing different aminating biocatalysts which accordingly produced a range of structurally distinct amines. The method was expanded to employ a batch incompatible sequential amination cascade via an oxidase/transaminase/imine reductase sequence, introducing different amine reagents at each step without cross&#8208;reactivity. The combined approaches allowed for the biocatalytic synthesis of the natural product 4O&#8208;methylnorbelladine.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Aminoarylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenes by Merging Photoredox with Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of vinyl ethers, enamides, ene&#8208;carbamates and vinyl thioethers by synergistic photoredox and nickel catalysis is reported. The radical cascade features high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation is achieved as well as 1,2&#8208;aminoacylation of vinyl ethers.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of vinyl ethers, enamides, ene&#8208;carbamates and vinyl thioethers by synergistic photoredox and nickel catalysis is reported. 2,2,2&#8208;Trifluoroethoxy carbonyl protected &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;oxy acids are used as amidyl radical precursors. anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of the amidyl radical to the alkene and Ni&#8208;mediated radical/transition metal cross over lead to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation product. The radical cascade, which can be conducted under practical and mild conditions, features high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation is achieved using a L&#8208;(+)&#8208;lactic acid derived vinyl ether as the substrate, offering a novel route for the preparation of protected enantiopure &#945;&#8208;arylated &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. In addition, 1,2&#8208;aminoacylation of vinyl ethers is achieved by using an acyl succinimide as the electrophile for the Ni&#8208;mediated radical coupling.

         <title>Observation of Borane&#8211;Olefin Proximity Interaction Governing the Structure and Reactivity of Boron&#8208;Containing Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With borane&#8208;containing macrocyclic polyenes obtained by multi&#8208;step insertion of a strained alkyne into 9&#8208;borafluorene, the first direct crystallographic evidence of attractive borane&#8211;olefin interaction, which is beyond van der Waals force and governs the reactivity of the molecules, is provided.







Abstract
While attractive interactions between borane and olefin have been postulated to trigger various boron&#8208;mediated organic transformations, proximity structures of these functional groups, other than the formation of weak van der Waals complexes, have never been directly observed. Here we show that a close intramolecular borane&#8211;olefin interaction operates in macrocyclic systems containing borane and olefinic groups obtained by multi&#8208;step 1,2&#8208;carboboration between a strained alkyne and 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives. Depending on Lewis acidity of the borane moiety and the size of the macrocycles, the magnitude of interaction changes, resulting in different reaction modes. The whole picture of the multi&#8208;step reactions has been revealed experimentally with theoretical supports. The present finding may not only provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental boron&#8208;mediated interaction but also lead to the development of new organic transformations involving molecular activation by boranes.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Alkene Hydromethylation via Protonolysis of Titanacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the direct Markovnikov hydromethylation of unactivated alkenes by protonolysis of titanacyclobutanes has been developed. This approach enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of a methyl group into complex, polyfunctional molecules and has been demonstrated with a series of mono&#8208; and disubstituted alkenes containing pendant alcohols, ethers, amides, carbamates, and basic amines.







Abstract
Methyl groups are ubiquitous in biologically active molecules. Thus, new tactics to introduce this alkyl fragment into polyfunctional structures are of significant interest. With this goal in mind, a direct method for the Markovnikov hydromethylation of alkenes is reported. This method exploits the degenerate metathesis reaction between the titanium methylidene unveiled from Cp2Ti(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(&#956;&#8208;CH2)AlMe2 (Tebbe's reagent) and unactivated alkenes. Protonolysis of the resulting titanacyclobutanes in&#8197;situ effects hydromethylation in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and site&#8208;selective manner. The broad utility of this method is demonstrated across a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted alkenes containing pendant alcohols, ethers, amides, carbamates, and basic amines.

         <title>Anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Anion Coinage Bonds: The Case of Tetrachloridoaurate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gold atom of the AuCl4&#8722; moiety forms attractive anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion and anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;neutral electron&#8211;donor interactions. These interactions are rationalized as &#960;&#8208;hole coinage bonds and give rise to robust and reliable supramolecular synthons which control recognition and organization phenomena in the solid state. Hence, they might be considered for tuning structural and functional features in materials and biosystems.







Abstract
Interactions in crystalline tetrachloridoaurates of acetylcholine and dimethylpropiothetine are characterized by Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl and Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O short contacts. The former interactions assemble the AuCl4&#8722; units into supramolecular anionic polymers, while the latter interactions append the acetylcholine and propiothetine units to the polymer. The distorted octahedral geometry of the bonding pattern around the gold center is rationalized on the basis of the anisotropic distribution of the electron density, which enables gold to behave as an electrophile (&#960;&#8208;hole coinage&#8208;bond donor). Computational studies prove that gold atoms in negatively charged species can function as acceptors of electron density. The attractive nature of the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl/O interactions described here complement the known aurophilic bonds involved in gold&#8208;centered interactions.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; moiety forms attractive anion&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;anion and anion&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;neutral electron&#8211;donor interactions. These interactions are rationalized as &#960;-hole coinage bonds and give rise to robust and reliable supramolecular synthons which control recognition and organization phenomena in the solid state. Hence, they might be considered for tuning structural and functional features in materials and biosystems.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Cyclization for the Synthesis of Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quinazolinone motif is an important feature in natural products and drug candidates although enantioselective approaches to such scaffolds remain rare. An enantioselective Cu&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization delivers pyrroloquinazolines, featuring quaternary stereocenters and synthetic handles for further derivatization, with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol.







Abstract
Quinazolinones are common substructures in molecules of medicinal importance. We report an enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization for the assembly of privileged pyrroloquinazolinone motifs. The reaction proceeds with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol, and can deliver products containing quaternary stereocenters. The utility of the products is demonstrated through further manipulations.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Topological Transformation of a Molecular Borromean Ring via Controlled Oxidation of Thioether Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled oxidation from thioether to sulfoxide and sulfone groups is a new post&#8208;synthetic modification to achieve the stimuli&#8208;responsive structural transformation from the molecular Borromean ring to tetranuclear metallacycles.







Abstract
A Cp*&#8208;Rh based D&#8208;shaped binuclear metallacycle and a template&#8208;free molecular Borromean ring (BR) were obtained in high yield using the semi&#8208;rigid thioether dipyridyl ligand 1,4&#8208;bis[(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylthio)methyl]benzene (Bptmb). The topological transformation from a binuclear metallacycle and a BR to tetranuclear metallacycles was realized via the controlled oxidation of thioethers. The strategy used in this work can be regarded as a new form of stimuli&#8208;responsive post&#8208;synthesis modification (PSM).

         <title>Exploiting Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Conditions to Trigger Pathway Complexity in the Growth of a MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that human&#8208;made self&#8208;assembled materials, such as porous coordination polymers, can follow distinct growth pathways in a given energy landscape in response to a controlled diffusion of reagents.







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), are crystalline materials with promising applications in electronics, magnetism, catalysis, and gas storage/separation. However, the mechanisms and pathways underlying their formation remain largely undisclosed. Herein, we demonstrate that diffusion&#8208;controlled mixing of reagents at the very early stages of the crystallization process (i.e., within &#8776;40&#8197;ms), achieved by using continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic devices, can be used to enable novel crystallization pathways of a prototypical spin&#8208;crossover MOF towards its thermodynamic product. In particular, two distinct and unprecedented nucleation&#8208;growth pathways were experimentally observed when crystallization was triggered under microfluidic mixing. Full&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations also confirm the occurrence of these two distinct pathways during crystal growth. In sharp contrast, a crystallization by particle attachment was observed under bulk (turbulent) mixing. These unprecedented results provide a sound basis for understanding the growth of CPs and open up new avenues for the engineering of porous materials by using out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trifluoromethoxy group has elicited much interest among drug and agrochemical discovery teams because of its unique properties. We developed trifluoromethyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate (nonaflate), TFNf, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, bench&#8208;stable, reactive, and scalable trifluoromethoxylating reagent. TFNf is easily and safely prepared in a simple process in large scale and the nonaflyl part of TFNf can easily be recovered as nonaflyl fluoride after usage and recycled. The synthetic potency of TFNf was showcased with the underexplored synthesis of various trifluoromethoxylated alkenes, through a high regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydro(halo)trifluoromethoxylation of alkyne derivatives such as haloalkynes, alkynyl esters and alkynyl sulfones. The synthetic merits of TFNf were further underscored with a high yielding and smooth nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation of alkyl triflates/bromides and primary/secondary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Pincer Motifs and Potential Metal&#8211;Metal Cooperativity in Cobalt Dinitrogen Chemistry: Efficient Catalytic Silylation of N2 to N(SiMe3)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand scaffold with two fused PNN pincer compartments combines two beneficial features for N2 fixation with molecular catalysts, viz. a bimetallic pocket and ligand&#8208;based protonation sites. Its cobalt(I) dinitrogen complexes are shown to efficiently mediate the reductive silylation of N2.







Abstract
Using a pyrazolate&#8208;bridged dinucleating ligand that provides two proximate pincer&#8208;type PNN binding sites (&#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one pincer&#8221;), different synthetic routes have been developed towards its dicobalt(I) complex 2 that features a twice deprotonated ligand backbone and two weakly activated terminal N2 substrate ligands directed into the bimetallic pocket. Protonation of 2 is shown to occur at the ligand scaffold and to trigger conversion to a tetracobalt(I) complex 4 with two end&#8208;on &#956;1,2&#8208;bridging N2; in THF 4 is labile and undergoes temperature&#8208;dependent N2/triflate ligand exchange. These pyrazolate&#8208;based systems combine the potential of exhibiting both metal&#8211;metal and metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity, viz. two concepts that have emerged as promising design motifs for molecular N2 fixation catalysts. Complex 2 serves as an efficient (pre)catalyst for the reductive silylation of N2 into N(SiMe3)3 (using KC8 and Me3SiCl), yielding up to 240&#8197;equiv N(SiMe3)3 per catalyst.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;mediated in situ self&#8208;assembly promotes in vivo bioorthogonal reaction for pretargeted multimodality imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pretargeted imaging has emerged as a promising approach to advance nuclear imaging of malignant tumors, however, the application of pretargeted strategy for multimodality imaging of enzyme activity in vivo is challenging. Herein, we combine the enzyme&#8208;mediated fluorogenic reaction and in situ self&#8208;assembly with the inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction to develop an activatable pretargeted strategy for multimodality imaging. The  trans  &#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing small&#8208;molecule probe,  P&#8208;FFGd&#8208;TCO  , can be activated by alkaline phosphatase and in situ self&#8208;assembles into nanoaggregates (  FMNPs&#8208;TCO  ) retained on the membranes, permitting to (1) amplify near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals, and (2) enrich TCOs to promote IEDDA ligation. The Gallium&#8208;68 (  68  Ga) labeled tetrazine can readily conjugate the tumor&#8208;retained  FMNPs&#8208;TCO  to enhance radioactivity uptake in tumors. Hence, strong NIR FL, MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) signals are concomitantly achieved, allowing for pretargeted multimodality imaging of ALP activity in HeLa tumor&#8208;bearing mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical van der Waals Beryllium Borates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Van der Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials hold great potentials to extend the DUV NLO applications to two&#8208;dimension, but they are rare in nature. In this study, we have proposed a design principle to realize vdW DUV NLO materials via structural evolution from the non&#8208;vdW (BO3)&#8208;(BeO3F) layers in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) to the vdW (BO3)&#8208;(BeO4H) layers in berborite Be2BO5H3 (BBH) and the vdW (BO4)&#8208;(BeO4) layers in beryllium metaborate BeB2O4 (BEBO). Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, the fundamental NLO properties of BBH and BEBO demonstrate that the balanced DUV NLO performance can be achieved in these two systems. Importantly, the BBH, an existing layered material in nature, can achieve available DUV phase&#8208;matched output with strong second harmonic generation (SHG) effect for the 177.3/193.7 nm DUV lasers, which is almost identical to that of KBBF. Remarkably, the BEBO shows excellent DUV SHG capacity and even shorter phase&#8208;matching wavelength than KBBF. Therefore, the newly discovered vdW BBH and BEBO, once verified by experiments, could provide an ideal platform to study the DUV NLO effects from three&#8208;dimension to two&#8208;dimension.</dc:description>

         <title>Gausemycins A,B &#8211; cyclic lipoglycopeptides from Streptomyces sp.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel family of natural lipoglycopeptides produced by  Streptomyces  sp. INA&#8208;Ac&#8208;5812. Two major components of the mixture, named gausemycins A and B, were isolated, and their structures were elucidated. The compounds are cyclic peptides with a unique peptide core and several remarkable structural features, including unusual positions of D&#8208;amino acids, lack of the Ca  2+  &#8208;binding Asp&#8208;X&#8208;Asp&#8208;Gly (DXDG) motif, tyrosine glycosylation with arabinose, presence of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyric acid (Ahpb) and chlorinated kynurenine (ClKyn),  N  &#8208;acylation of the ornithine side chain. Gausemycins have pronounced activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Mechanistic studies highlight significant differences compared to known glyco&#8208; and lipopeptides. Gausemycins exhibit only slight Ca  2+  &#8208;dependence of activity and induce no pore formation at low concentrations. Moreover, there is no detectable accumulation of cell wall biosynthesis precursors under treatment with gausemycins.</dc:description>

         <title>Void Space vs. Surface Functionalization for Proton Conduction in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Void space and functionality of pore surface are important structural factors for proton&#8208;conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with the impregnation of conducting media. However, there is no clear study that compare their priority factors, which need to be considered when designing proton&#8208;conductive MOFs. Here, we first demonstrate the effect of void space and pore surface modification on proton conduction in MOFs through the surface&#8208;modified isoreticular MOF&#8208;74(Ni) series [Ni  2  (dobdc or dobpdc), dobdc = 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate and dobpdc = 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;(1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate]. The MOF with lower porosity with the same surface functionality shows a higher proton conductivity than that of higher porosity despite including a smaller amount of conducting media. The density functional theory calculations suggest that strong hydrogen bonding between conducting media under high porosity is inefficient for realizing high proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategic Design of Catalytic Lysine&#8208;Targeting Reversible Covalent BCR&#8208;ABL Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted covalent inhibitors have re&#8208;emerged as validated drugs to overcome acquired resistance in cancer treatment. Herein, by using a carbonyl boronic acid (CBA) warhead, we report the structure&#8208;based design of BCR&#8208;ABL inhibitors via reversible covalent targeting of the catalytic lysine with improved potency against both wild&#8208;type and mutant ABL kinases, especially ABLT315I bearing the gatekeeper residue mutation. We show the evolutionarily conserved lysine can be targeted selectively, and the selectivity depends largely on molecular recognition of the non&#8208;covalent pharmacophore in this class of inhibitors, probably due to the moderate reactivity of the warhead. We report the first co&#8208;crystal structures of covalent inhibitor&#8208;ABL kinase domain complexes, providing insights into the interaction of this warhead with the catalytic lysine. We also employed label&#8208;free mass spectrometry to evaluate off&#8208;targets of our compounds at proteome&#8208;wide level in different mammalian cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Control Viscoelasticity of Polymer Networks with Crosslinks of Superposed Fast and Slow Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depending on the dynamics of the crosslinks, polymer networks can have distinct bulk mechanical behaviors, from viscous liquids to tough solids. Here, by means of designing a crosslink with variable molecular dynamics, we show the control of viscoelasticity of polymer networks in a broad range quantitatively. The hexanoate&#8208;isoquinoline@cucurbit[7]uril (HIQ@CB[7]) crosslink exhibits in a combination of protonated and deprotonated states of similar association affinity but distinct molecular dynamics. The molecular property of this crosslink is contributed by linear combination of the parameters at the two states, which is precisely tuned by pH. Using this crosslink, we achieve the quantitative control of viscoelasticity of quasi&#8208;ideal networks in 5 orders of magnitude, and we show the reversible control of mechanical response, such as stiffness, strength and extensibility, of tough random polymer networks. This strategy offers a way to tailor the mechanical properties of polymer networks at the molecular level and paves the way for engineering &#8220;smart&#8221; responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Ligand&#8208;Directed Heterogeneous Catalysis: When the Dynamically Changing Nature of the Ligand Layer Controls the Hydrogenation Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a mechanistic study on formation and dynamic changes of a ligand&#8208;based heterogeneous Pd catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Deposition of allyl cyanide as a precursor of a ligand layer renders Pd highly active and nearly 100% selective toward propenol formation by promoting acrolein adsorption in a desired configuration via the C=O end. Employing a combination of real space microscopic and  in operando  spectroscopic surface sensitive techniques, we show that an ordered active ligand layer is formed under operational conditions, consisting of stable butylimin species. In a competing process, unstable amine species evolve on the surface, which desorb in the course of the reaction. Obtained atomistic&#8208;level insights into the formation and dynamic evolution of the active ligand layer under operational conditions provide important input required for controlling chemoselectivity by purposeful surface functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Getting Ready for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: The Infrared Spectrum of Hydrated Aluminum Hydride&#8208;Hydroxide HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8208;1, n = 9&#8211;14</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrated singly charged aluminum ions eliminate molecular hydrogen in a size regime from 11 to 24 water molecules. Here we probe the structure of HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8208;1, n = 9&#8211;14, by infrared multiple photon spectroscopy in the region of 1400&#8211;2250 cm&#8208;1. Based on quantum chemical calculations, we assign the features at 1940&#160;cm&#8209;1 and 1850 cm&#8208;1 to the Al&#8208;H stretch in five&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinate aluminum(III) complexes, respectively. Hydrogen bonding towards the hydride is observed, starting at n = 12. The frequency of the Al&#8208;H stretch is very sensitive to the structure of the hydrogen bonding network, and the large number of isomers leads to significant broadening and red&#8208;shifting of the absorption of the hydrogen bonded Al&#8208;H stretch. The hydride can even act as a double hydrogen bond acceptor, shifting the Al&#8208;H stretch to frequencies below those of the water bending mode. The onset of hydrogen bonding and disappearance of the free Al&#8208;H stretch coincides with the onset of hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3D Anionic Metal Covalent Organic Framework with soc Topology Built from Octahedral Ti(IV) Complex for Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains challenging due to the limited types of organic building blocks. With octahedral Ti(IV) complex as the building unit, this study reports on the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (  Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1  ) with an edge&#8208;transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected  soc  topology.  Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1  exhibits high crystallinity, superior stability, and large specific surface area (1000.4 m  2  g  &#8722;1  ). Moreover,  Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1  has a broad absorption band in the UV spectrum with an optical energy gap of 1.86 eV, and exhibits high photocatalytic activity toward Meerwein addition reactions. This research demonstrates an attractive strategy for the design of 3D functional COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Aglacins A, B and E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) reaction, between electron&#8208;rich 2&#8208;methylbenzaldehydes and unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactones, was developed to directly construct the basic tricyclic core of aryltetralin lactone lignans. The first asymmetric total synthesis of aglacins A, B and E was achieved based on this newly developed methodology, which enable us to revise the absolute configuration of these natural lignans. This strategy was also used to efficiently prepare naturally occurring aryl&#8211;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;type lignans (&#8211;)&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroisojusticidine B and (+)&#8208;linoxepin in four and six steps, as well as 27 members of natural product&#8208;like molecules bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center at C&#8208;8&#8217;. We believe that the synthetic aglacins and small&#8208;molecule library provide new opportunities to carry out the SAR studies of podophyllotoxin&#8208;family natural products.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is asymmetric [3+2] annulation of arylnitrones with different classes of alkynes catalyzed by chiral rhodium(III) complexes, with the nitrone acting as an electrophilic directing group. Three classes of chiral indenes/indenones have been effectively constructed, depending on the nature of the substrates. The coupling system features mild reaction conditions, excellent enantioselectivity, and high atom&#8208;economy. In particular, the coupling of  N  &#8208;benzylnitrones and different classes of sterically hindered alkynes afforded C&#8208;C or C&#8208;N atropochiral pentatomic biaryls with a C&#8208;centered point&#8208;chirality in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (45 examples, average 95.6% ee). These chiral center and axis are disposed in a distal fashion and they are constructed via two distinct migratory insertions that are stereo&#8208;determining.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile synthesis of cyanide and isocyanides from CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of K[N(SiMe  3  )  2  ] with  13  CO is shown to proceed in C  6  D  6  or THF affording K  13  CN and O(SiMe  3  )  2  under mild conditions. This was confirmed by the isolation and crystallographic characterization of K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)CN. In an analogous fashion, reaction of the alkali metal amides, M[N(SiR  3  )R&#8242;] (M= Li, K; R = Ph, Me; R&#8242; = alkyl, aryl) afford a facile route to the corresponding  13  C labeled isocyanide RN  13  C and MOSiR  3  generally in high yields. In some instances, the use of the sterically bulky Ph  3  Si&#8208;substituent is required to preclude 1,2&#8208;silyl migration affording the silylcarbamoyl salt M[Me  3  SiC(O)NR&#8242;]. These reactions have been used to obtain 19 examples of  13  C labelled isocyanides, and several examples of gram scale reactions are reported. The mechanism of the reactions is probed via reliable DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Scholl Reaction of Perylene&#8208;Based Polyphenylene Precursors under Different Conditions: Formation of Hexagon or Octagon?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scholl reaction is a classic method for the synthesis of various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the fundamental reaction mechanisms remain unclear and the products sometimes are unpredictable. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a planar dibenzo&#8208;peri&#8208;hexacene derivative (  2  ) via FeCl  3  &#8208;mediated Scholl reaction from a cyclopenta&#8208;fused perylene (CP) based polyphenylene precursor (  1  ). However, an unexpected octagon&#8208;containing, negatively curved molecule (  3  ) was obtained in nearly quantitative yield when 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) and methanesulfonic acid (MeSO  3  H) were used.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scholl reaction is a classic method for the synthesis of various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the fundamental reaction mechanisms remain unclear and the products sometimes are unpredictable. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a planar dibenzo-peri-hexacene derivative (  2  ) via FeCl  3  -mediated Scholl reaction from a cyclopenta-fused perylene (CP) based polyphenylene precursor (  1  ). However, an unexpected octagon-containing, negatively curved molecule (  3  ) was obtained in nearly quantitative yield when 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) and methanesulfonic acid (MeSO  3  H) were used. Similar results were observed when two smaller-sized precursors containing one (  4  ) or two CP units (  5  ) were tested. The structures of the final products were confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis, which also reveal that there is no close p-p stacking between neighbouring p-conjugated skeletons. DFT calculations suggest a radical cation mechanism in the presence of FeCl  3  while an arenium ion pathway for the DDQ/MeSO  3  H mediated Scholl reaction, which can well explain the selective formation of hexagons and octagons under different conditions. The obtained compounds showed tunable optical and electrochemical properties. In particular, their non-aggregative feature endows them moderate-to-high photoluminescence quantum yields, which are desirable for solid-state luminescence devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Endocircular Li Carbon Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By employing accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many&#8208;electron quantum chemistry methods, we establish that carbon monocyclic rings can accommodate Li guest atoms. The low&#8208;lying electronic states of these endocircular systems are analyzed and found to include both charge&#8208;separated states where the guest Li atom appears as a cation and the ring as an anion and encircled&#8208;electron states where Li and the ring are neutral. The electron binding energies of the encircled&#8208;electron states increase dramatically&#160;at their highly&#8208;symmetric equilibrium geometries with increasing size of rings, and in Li@C  24  , such a state becomes the ground state. Li is very weakly bound vertical to the rings in the low&#8208;lying encircled&#8208;electron states hinting to van der Waals binding. Applcations are mentioned.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversed Charge Transfer and Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover in Pt Nanoclusters Anchored on Titanium Oxide with Rich Oxygen Vacancies Boost Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic activity of metal clusters is closely related with the support, while the knowledge about the influence of support on the catalytic activity is scarce. Herein, we show that, Pt nanoclusters (NCs) anchored on porous TiO  2  nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies (  V  O  &#8208;rich Pt/TiO  2  ) and deficient oxygen vacancies (  V  O  &#8208;deficient Pt/TiO  2  ), display significantly different catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which  V  O  &#8208;rich Pt/TiO  2  shows a mass activity of 45.28 A mg  Pt  &#8211;1  at &#8211;0.1 V  vs.  RHE, 16.7 and 58.8 times higher than those of  V  O  &#8208;deficient Pt/TiO  2  and commercial Pt/C, respectively. DFT calculations and  in&#8208;situ  Raman spectra suggest that porous TiO  2  with rich oxygen vacancies can simultaneously achieve the reversed charge transfer (electrons transfer from TiO  2  to Pt NCs) and enhanced hydrogen spillover from Pt NCs to TiO  2  support, which bring to electron&#8208;rich Pt NCs being favorable for proton reduction to absorbed H*, as well as the acceleration of hydrogen desorption at Pt catalytic sites, both promoting the HER. Our work provides a new strategy for rational design of highly efficient HER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials with photophysical properties sensitive to external stimulus are highly attractive for advanced applications. However, most OURTP molecules are in crystal and OURTP materials with good practicability and stimulus&#8208;responsive character are hard to be achieved. Here, we report, for the first time, the highly efficient, ultralong&#8208;lived and deep&#8208;blue OURTP materials by simply doping boron phosphor into cyanuric acid host. Thus constructed host&#8208;guest OURTP composites with abundant and tunable H&#8208;bond network are highly stable in air with ultralong lifetime of 5.08 s at room temperature, and more interestingly, are sensitive to water, which can strength the H&#8208;bond network to significantly enhance OURTP quantum yield from 16.1% to 37.6%. With the extraordinary water&#8208;responsive OURTP, anti&#8208;counterfeiting paper was facilely prepared for water&#8208;jet printing and the jet&#8208;printed high&#8208;resolution OURTP patterns can be easily erased by solvent fuming for another printing/erasing cycle with high reversibility.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Cage for Wide&#8208;Scope Chiral Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an anionic homochiral octahedral cage, by condensing six Ga  3+  cations and four trisacylhydrazone ligands. The robust nature of hydrazone bond renders the cage stability in water, where the cage can take advantage of hydrophobic effect for host&#8208;guest recognition. In addition to the internal binding site namely the inner cavity, the octahedral cage possesses four &#8220;windows&#8221;, each of which represents an external binding station allowing peripheral complexation. These internal and external binding sites endow the cage with capability of binding a broad range of guests whose sizes could either be smaller than, or exceed the volume of the cage inner cavity. Upon accommodation of a chiral guest, one of the two cage enantiomers becomes more favored than the other, producing CD signals. The CD signal intensity of the cage is observed proportional to the ee values of the chiral guest, allowing quantitative determination of the latter.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Singlet diradicaloids hold great potential as semiconductors for organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). However, their relative low material and device stabilities impede the practical applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Vinylogous Addition Reactions Initiated by Meinwald Rearrangement of Vinyl Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric multiple vinylogous addition reactions initiated by Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides were realized by employing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complexes as catalysts. Direct vinylogous additions via dienolates of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes were realized. A series of chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and spiro&#8208;cyclohexene indolinones were synthesized in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The first catalytic asymmetric multiple vinylogous addition reactions initiated by Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides were realized by employing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complex catalysts. The vinyl epoxides, as masked &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, via direct vinylogous additions with isatins, 2&#8208;alkenoylpyridines or methyleneindolinones, provided a facile and efficient way for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and spiro&#8208;cyclohexene indolinones, respectively with high efficiency and stereoselectivity. The control experiments and kinetic studies revealed that the Lewis acid acted as dual&#8208;tasking catalyst, controlling the initial rearrangement to match subsequent enantioselective vinylogous addition reactions. A catalytic cycle with a possible transition model was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.

The control experiments and kinetic studies revealed that the Lewis acid acted as dual-tasking catalyst, controlling the initial rearrangement to match subsequent enantioselective vinylogous addition reactions. A catalytic cycle with a possible transition model was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fabrication of Gradient and Patterned Organic Thin Films by Bipolar Electrolytic Micelle Disruption Using Redox&#8208;Active Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar electrolytic micelle disruption (BEMD) system is established by integrating bipolar electrochemistry with a redox&#8208;controlled micelle disruption process. Using the BEMD approach, gradient and patterned organic films with a wide range of a polymerizable monomer, an organic pigment and aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecules, were successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Bipolar electrochemistry could be regarded as a powerful approach for selective surface modification due to the beneficial feature that a wirelessly controllable potential distribution on bipolar electrodes (BPEs). Herein we report a bipolar electrolytic micelle disruption (BEMD) system for the preparation of shaped organic films. A U&#8208;shaped bipolar electrolytic system with a sigmoidal potential gradient on the BPE gave gradient&#8208;thin films including various interesting organic compounds, such as a polymerizable monomer, an organic pigment and aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecules. The gradient feature was characterized by UV&#8211;Vis absorption, thickness measurements and surface morphology analysis. Corresponding patterned films were also fabricated using a cylindrical bipolar electrolytic setup that enables site&#8208;selective application of the potential on the BPE. Such a facile BEMD approach will open a long&#8208;term perspective with respect to organic film preparation.

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interactions in Supported Atomically Dispersed Gold Catalysts for Efficient Fenton&#8208;like Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substituted solid solution was used to achieve self&#8208;exfoliation of synthetic materials and optimize electronic metal&#8211;carrier interactions to increase the material's high efficiency and stable water treatment catalytic performance.







Abstract
The atomically dispersed metal is expected as one of the most promising Fenton&#8208;like catalysts for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants (ROPs) by the strong &#8220;electronic metal&#8211;support interactions&#8221; (EMSIs). Here, we develop an atomically dispersed metal&#8211;atom alloy made by guest Au atoms substitute host V atoms in the two&#8208;dimensional VO2(B) nanobelt support (Au/VO2) to activate Fenton&#8208;like oxidation for elimination of ROPs. The 2D nanobelt structure enlarges the exposure of atomically Au thus increasing the number of active sites to absorb more S2O82&#8722; ions. And the EMSIs regulate the charge density in Au atoms to present positive charge Au+, lowering the energy barrier of S2O82&#8722; decomposition to produce SO4.&#8722;. The Au/VO2 catalyst possesses excellent durable and reliable characteristics and exhibits record&#8208;breaking efficiency with TOF as high as 21.42&#8197;min&#8722;1, 16.19&#8197;min&#8722;1, and 80.89&#8197;min&#8722;1 for rhodamine, phenol, and bisphenol&#8197;A degradation, respectively.

         <title>Chiral Metal Nanoparticle Superlattices Enabled by Porphyrin&#8208;Based Supramolecular Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral metal nanoparticle superlattices with diverse structures were engineered by templating from porphyrin based supramolecular structures. The chirality transfer from molecular systems to colloidal systems is on the basis of weak chain&#8208;chain van der Waals forces.







Abstract
Herein, we show that chiral metal nanoparticle superlattices can be produced through coassembly of achiral metal nanoparticles and porphyrin&#8208;based organic molecules. This chirality transfer from molecules to nanoparticle superstructures across three orders of magnitude in length scale is enabled by the hetero chain&#8208;chain van der Waals interactions. As far as we know, these are the first chiral nanoparticle assemblies based on chirality transfer through weak van der Waals forces. The dimensionality of the nanoparticle superlattices (1D chiral chains, 2D chiral sheets (cones), and 3D chiral particles) can be controlled based on a same synthetic chiral porphyrin molecule. Metalation of these porphyrin molecules with zinc cations results in the switching of molecular packing from J&#8208;type to H&#8208;type, which thereby produces 1D chiral nanoparticle chains. Functionalization of these zinc porphyrins with oleylamine can induce the assembly of nanoparticles into 2D chiral nanoparticle sheets.

         <title>Correlation between Oxygen Vacancies and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity for a Model Electrode: PrBaCo2O5+&#948;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies content and ordering are influencing the oxygen evolution reaction activity of one of the most active perovskite electrocatalyst, PrBaCo2O5+d. It is suggested that a high oxygen vacancy content in the perovskite lattice is beneficial for the activity, while lattice oxygen ordering leads to a drop in the OER activity.







Abstract
The role of the perovskite lattice oxygen in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically studied in the PrBaCo2O5+&#948; family. The reduced number of physical/chemical variables combined with in&#8208;depth characterizations such as neutron dif&#8208;fraction, O K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), magnetization and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies, helps investigating the complex correlation between OER activity and a single perovskite property, such as the oxygen content. Larger amount of oxygen vacancies appears to facilitate the OER, possibly contributing to the mechanism involving the oxidation of lattice oxygen, i.e., the lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER). Furthermore, not only the number of vacancies but also their local arrangement in the perovskite lattice influences the OER activity, with a clear drop for the more stable, ordered stoichiometry.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Photocatalyzed Hydroboration of Alkynes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein the photocatalytic hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes using newly&#8208;designed copper photocatalysts with B2Pin2. The hydroborated products were obtained under mild conditions in high yields, excellent diastereoselectivities, a high functional group tolerance and developed under continuous flow conditions to demonstrate their synthetic utility. Finally, the reaction mechanism was also studied.







Abstract
The photocatalytic hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes is reported. The use of newly&#8208;designed copper photocatalysts with B2Pin2 permits the formation a boryl radical, which is used for hydroboration of a large panel of alkenes and alkynes. The hydroborated products were isolated in high yields, with excellent diastereoselectivities and a high functional group tolerance under mild conditions. The hydroboration reactions were developed under continuous flow conditions to demonstrate their synthetic utility. The reaction mechanism was studied and suggested an oxidation reaction between an in situ formed borate and the Cu&#8208;photocatalyst in its excited state for the boryl radical formation.

         <title>Structural and Functional Analyses of the Tridomain&#8208;Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase FmoA3 for 4&#8208;Methyloxazoline Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimeric structure of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), FmoA3 which consists of Cy&#8208;A&#8208;PCP domains, was solved by two strategies, X&#8208;ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy. The molecular basis of the &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid recognition mechanism of the A domain of FmoA3 was proposed. The Cy domain of FmoA3 was expected to lose peptide bond formation activity by eliminating its ability to bind with a donor PCP.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are attractive targets for bioengineering to generate useful peptides. FmoA3 is a single modular NRPS composed of heterocyclization (Cy), adenylation (A), and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains. It uses &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;serine to synthesize a 4&#8208;methyloxazoline ring, probably with another Cy domain in the preceding module FmoA2. Here, we determined the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail homodimeric structures of FmoA3 by X&#8208;ray crystallography (apo&#8208;form, with adenylyl&#8208;imidodiphosphate and &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;seryl&#8208;AMP) and cryogenic electron microscopy single particle analysis, and performed site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments. The data revealed that &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;serine can be accommodated in the active site because of the extra space around Ala688. The Cy domains of FmoA2 and FmoA3 catalyze peptide bond formation and heterocyclization, respectively. FmoA3&#8217;s Cy domain seems to lose its donor PCP binding activity. The collective data support a proposed catalytic cycle of FmoA3.

&lt;p&gt;The dimeric structure of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), FmoA3 which consists of Cy-A-PCP domains, was solved by two strategies, X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy. The molecular basis of the &#945;,&#945;-disubstituted amino acid recognition mechanism of the A domain of FmoA3 was proposed. The Cy domain of FmoA3 was expected to lose peptide bond formation activity by eliminating its ability to bind with a donor PCP.

         <title>Enhancing Rechargeable Persistent Luminescence via Organic Dye Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Firefly&#8208;like persistent luminescence nanoparticles for accurate imaging guided tumor surgery are reported by Gang Han et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101492). Organic dye molecules act as &#8220;wings&#8221; and can be conjugated with persistent luminescence nanoparticles. Such dye&#8208;sensitized nanoparticles emit boosted afterglow signals for a long period of time without the need for additional light input, reminiscent of a firefly.

         <title>Exploiting Supramolecular Dynamics in Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks to Generate Metal&#8211;Oxide and Metal&#8211;Carbon Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular metal&#8211;phenolic networks, consisting of metal ions coordinated with phenolic motifs, can undergo selective thermodynamic transformations into nanoporous structures, including metal&#8211;carbon networks and metal&#8211;oxide networks, with tunable network organization and surface wettability.







Abstract
Supramolecular complexation is a powerful strategy for engineering materials in bulk and at interfaces. Metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs), which are assembled through supramolecular complexes, have emerged as suitable candidates for surface and particle engineering owing to their diverse properties. Herein, we examine the supramolecular dynamics of MPNs during thermal transformation processes. Changes in the local supramolecular network including enlarged pores, ordered aromatic packing, and metal relocation arise from thermal treatment in air or an inert atmosphere, enabling the engineering of metal&#8211;oxide networks (MONs) and metal&#8211;carbon networks, respectively. Furthermore, by integrating photo&#8208;responsive motifs (i.e., TiO2) and silanization, the MONs are endowed with reversible superhydrophobic (&gt;150&#176;) and superhydrophilic (&#8776;0&#176;) properties. By highlighting the thermodynamics of MPNs and their transformation into diverse materials, this work offers a versatile pathway for advanced materials engineering.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quenching&#8208;to&#8208;dequenching switch of fluorescence&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in biological environments was unveiled by Chun&#8208;Xia Zhao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101730). With dye molecules at a solid state, the release and/or degradation of the dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in biological environments led to a several&#8208;fold increase of fluorescence intensity due to the state switch, which has significant implications in quantitative cell uptake and biodistribution studies.

         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization explores the thermodynamics of hybrid quadruplex&#8211;duplex oligonucleotide assemblies comprised of multiple domains and brings insight into mutual domain interaction. As described by Renato Zenobi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016757), thermal denaturation experiments were conducted to reveal unfolding intermediates and changes in thermodynamics DNA complexes depending on the number of domains and their position in a single MS experiment.

         <title>Bioinspired Network Analysis Enabled Divergent Syntheses and Structure Revision of Pentacyclic Cytochalasans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent syntheses of a series of bioactive pentacyclic cytochalasans is reported by Pema&#8208;Tenzin Puno, Jun Deng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102831). Inspired by nature's way of synthesizing various secondary metabolites from a common precursor to maximize the number of natural products, total synthesis and structure revision of pentacyclic cytochalasans were realized from a common precursor aspochalasin D based on bioinspired structure network analysis and DFT calculations.

A bowl&#8208;shaped nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographene composed of a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core substituted with six arene rings circularly bonded with one another, undergoes the bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion with a low barrier. This inversion resembles that of an umbrella flipped by the strong wind. The transition state is not planar, but possesses a rather twisted, S&#8208;shaped conformation with Ci symmetry. The bowl&#8208;inversion mechanism follows a quadruple&#8208;well potential model, as reported by Andrzej&#8197;L. Sobolewski, Micha&#322;&#8197;K. Cyra&#324;ski, Daniel&#8197;T. Gryko et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202104092).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superprotonic conductivity of sulfamate&#8208;grafted MOF&#8208;808 was described by Yung&#8197;Sam Kim, Seung&#8197;Bin Baek, Myoung Soo Lah et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103191). The modulation of the binding mode of the grafted sulfamate from the monodentate mode to the bridging bidentate mode resulted in more efficient proton conduction by generating more acidic cationic sulfiliminium group (&#8211;S=NH2+).

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional arrangement of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), which are a partially oxidized dysprosium(III) phthalocyaninato double&#8208;decker complexes, [DyPc2]Ix, was synthesized in the Communication by Keiichi Katoh, Masahiro Yamashita et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102666) by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. The results of spectrophotometric analysis on [DyPc2]Ix are consistent with the Drude model, which theoretically explains the optical response of the metal. Since conductivity was observed at temperatures lower than the spin blocking temperature (TB), magnetoresistance (MR) effects observed as magnetic hysteresis were observed for the SMM. Our strategy may pave the way for the construction of electro&#8208;conductive SMM as spin valves.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of molecular oxygen is a fundamental step in almost all catalytic oxidation reactions. We have studied this topic and the role of surface vacancies for Co  3  O  4  (100) films with a synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical methods. We show that the as&#8208;prepared surface is B&#8208;layer terminated and that mild reduction produces oxygen single and double vacancies in this layer. Oxygen adsorption experiments clearly reveal different superoxide species below room temperature. The superoxide desorbs below ~120&#160;K from a vacancy&#8208;free surface and is not active for CO oxidation while superoxide on a surface with oxygen vacancies is stable up to ~270&#160;K and can oxidize CO already at the low temperature of 120&#160;K. The vacancies are not refilled by oxygen from the superoxide, which makes them suitable for long&#8208;term operation. Our joint experimental/theoretical effort highlights the relevance of surface vacancies in catalytic oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Rate CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products over a Copper&#8208;Copper Iodide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst achieves a remarkable C2+ partial current density of 591&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE, substantially higher than Cu or CuI alone. It is ascribed to the presence of residual Cu+ and adsorbed iodine species which improve CO adsorption and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling during CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multicarbon hydrocarbon and oxygenate (C2+) products with high energy density and wide availability is of great importance, as it provides a promising way to achieve the renewable energy storage and close the carbon cycle. Herein we design a Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst with abundant Cu0/Cu+ interfaces by physically mixing Cu nanoparticles and CuI powders. The composite catalyst achieves a remarkable C2+ partial current density of 591&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow cell, substantially higher than Cu (329&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and CuI (96&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) counterparts. Induced by alkaline electrolyte and applied potential, the Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst undergoes significant reconstruction under CO2RR conditions. The high&#8208;rate C2+ production over Cu&#8208;CuI is ascribed to the presence of residual Cu+ and adsorbed iodine species which improve CO adsorption and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Engineering High&#8208;Spin State Cobalt Cations in Spinel Zinc Cobalt Oxide for Spin Channel Propagation and Active Site Enhancement in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering high&#8208;spin state cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo2O4 propagates a spin channel for spin&#8208;selected charge transport and enhances active sites for intermediate adsorption. High&#8208;spin cobalt cations can be directly engineered by varying the calcination temperature.







Abstract
Spinel zinc cobalt oxide (ZnCo2O4) is not considered as a superior catalyst for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the bottleneck reaction in water&#8208;electrolysis. Herein, taking advantage of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that the existence of low&#8208;spin (LS) state cobalt cations hinders the OER activity of spinel zinc cobalt oxide, as the t2g6eg0 configuration gives rise to purely localized electronic structure and exhibits poor binding affinity to the key reaction intermediate. Increasing the spin state of cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo2O4 is found to propagate a spin channel to promote spin&#8208;selected charge transport during OER and generate better active sites for intermediates adsorption. The experiments find increasing the calcination temperature a facile approach to engineer high&#8208;spin (HS) state cobalt cations in ZnCo2O4, while not working for Co3O4. The activity of the best spin&#8208;state&#8208;engineered ZnCo2O4 outperforms other typical Co&#8208;based oxides.

         <title>ZW800&#8208;PEG: A Renal Clearable Zwitterionic Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophore for Potential Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZW800&#8208;PEG is a water&#8208;soluble, non&#8208;sticky, and renal clearable near&#8208;infrared fluorophore owing to the balanced zwitterionic charges. By introducing a stable sulfide linker, it improves serum stability and also exhibits potential for augmenting photothermal therapy. It shows a maximum emission wavelength at 800&#8197;nm, enabling its use for image&#8208;guided interventions in the OR using conventional near&#8208;infrared imaging systems.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has advanced medical imaging and image&#8208;guided interventions during the past three decades. Despite tremendous advances in imaging devices, surprisingly only a few dyes are currently available in the clinic. Previous fluorophores, ZW800&#8208;1A and ZW800&#8208;1C, significantly improved the poor performance of the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green. However, ZW800&#8208;1A is not stable in serum and ZW800&#8208;1C induces severe stacking in aqueous media. To solve such dilemmas, ZW800&#8208;PEG was designed by introducing a flexible yet stable thiol PEG linker. ZW800&#8208;PEG shows high solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents, thus improving renal clearance with minimal binding to serum proteins during systemic circulation. The sulfide group on the meso position of the heptamethine core improves serum stability and physicochemical properties including the maximum emission wavelength shift to 800&#8197;nm, enabling the use of ZW800&#8208;PEG for image&#8208;guided interventions and augmenting photothermal therapy.

         <title>Wearable Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells Achieved by a Crystallographic Size Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a size effect that controls the crystallization of perovskite and enhances the passivation effect with g&#8208;C3N4 additive. The similarity in value of lattice constant and distance between double hydrogen binding sites affects crystallization. The combination allows g&#8208;C3N4 to cover tin&#8208;based perovskite, thus improves hydrophobicity and oxidation resistance of films and leads to splendid PCE of wearable device with excellent stability.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) demonstrate a potential application in wearable electronics due to its hypotoxicity. However, poor crystal quality is still the bottleneck for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible devices. In this work, graphite phase&#8208;C3N4 (g&#8208;C3N4) is applied into tin&#8208;based perovskite as a crystalline template, which delays crystallization via a size&#8208;effect and passivates defects simultaneously. The double hydrogen bond between g&#8208;C3N4 and formamidine cation can optimize lattice matching and passivation. Moreover, the two&#8208;dimensional network structure of g&#8208;C3N4 can fit on the crystals, resulting an enhanced hydrophobicity and oxidation resistance. Therefore, the flexible tin&#8208;based PSCs with g&#8208;C3N4 realize a stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.56&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis. In addition, the PSCs can maintain 91&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1000&#8197;h under N2 environment and keep 92&#8201;% of their original PCE after 600&#8197;cycles at a curvature radius of 3&#8197;mm.

         <title>Catalytic Co&#8208;Conversion of CH4 and CO2 Mediated by Rhodium&#8211;Titanium Oxide Anions RhTiO2&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to syngas mediated by single Rh atom&#8208;doped titanium oxide anions (RhTiO2&#8722;) has been experimentally identified. The production of free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) could be achieved at room temperature while the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of the COads from RhTiO2CO&#8722;.







Abstract
Catalytic co&#8208;conversion of methane with carbon dioxide to produce syngas (2&#8201;H2+2&#8201;CO) involves complicated elementary steps and almost all the elementary reactions are performed at the same high temperature conditions in practical thermocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate by mass spectrometric experiments that RhTiO2&#8722; promotes the co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) at room temperature; the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of COads from the RhTiO2CO&#8722; to reform RhTiO2&#8722;. This study not only identifies a promising active species for dry (CO2) reforming of methane to syngas, but also emphasizes the importance of temperature control over elementary steps in practical catalysis, which may significantly alleviate the carbon deposition originating from the pyrolysis of methane.

         <dc:description>
Acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimides (AABIs), nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrenes with two imide functionalities (see structure), were found to exhibit excellent electron affinity, affording an air&#8208;stable radical anion. The intrinsic electron mobility of one derivative obeyed a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device showed high electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimide (AABI), a nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrene with two imide functionalities. AABI exhibits excellent electron affinity as evident by its low&#8208;lying LUMO level (&#8722;4.1&#8197;eV vs. vacuum). Single&#8208;electron reduction of one AABI derivative afforded the corresponding radical anion, which was stable under ambient conditions. Photoconductivity measurements suggest that the intrinsic electron mobility of an N&#8208;phenethyl AABI derivative obeys a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, an electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was attained with the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) device. The vacuum&#8208;deposited OFET device consisting of a polycrystalline sample exhibited high electron mobility of up to 0.27&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 even in air. This study demonstrates that dual incorporation of both imide substituents and imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms is an effective strategy to create novel electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;systems.

&lt;p&gt;Acridino[2,1,9,8-&lt;i&gt;klmna&lt;/i&gt;]acridine bisimides (AABIs), nitrogen-doped anthanthrenes with two imide functionalities (see structure), were found to exhibit excellent electron affinity, affording an air-stable radical anion. The intrinsic electron mobility of one derivative obeyed a band-transport model. Accordingly, the corresponding single-crystal organic field-effect transistor device showed high electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Engineering of a Peptide &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Methyltransferase to Methylate Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide backbone methylation is a highly desired modification. Using split intein, synthetic peptides and an engineered variant of the methylase, fOphMA2, it was possible to enzymatically methylate amide bonds involving non&#8208;natural amino acids. This has application in the biotechnological production of therapeutic peptides.







Abstract
Introduction of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;methylated non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids into peptides can improve their biological activities, membrane permeability and proteolytic stability. This is commonly achieved, in nature and in the lab, by assembling pre&#8208;methylated amino acids. The more appealing route of methylating amide bonds is challenging. Biology has evolved an &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;automethylating enzyme, OphMA, which acts on the amide bonds of peptides fused to its C&#8208;terminus. Due to the ribosomal biosynthesis of its substrate, the activity of this enzyme towards peptides with non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids has not been addressed. An engineered OphMA, intein&#8208;mediated protein ligation and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis have allowed us to demonstrate the methylation of amide bonds in the context of non&#8208;natural amides. This approach may have application in the biotechnological production of therapeutic peptides.

Access to the elusive&#160;UV solar&#8208;blind region&#160;based on direct second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)&#160;enabled by a&#160;non&#8208;traditional &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based phosphate&#160;crystal is reported&#160;by Chi Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102992). The rare&#160;coexistence of UV solar&#8208;blind&#8208;region phase&#8208;matchable optical nonlinearity and anisotropy, including wide UV transparency, large SHG response and sufficient birefringence, can be attributed to&#160;the introduction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations and their favorable collaboration&#160;with phosphate&#160;anions.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Giant Conjugated Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant conjugated macrocycles with a diameter of roughly 7&#8197;nm consisting of up to 30 subunits were synthesized on a Ag(111) surface in a two&#8208;step reaction. Site&#8208;selective debromination initiated the synthesis, resulting in arched covalent oligomers and macrocycles, which were assisted by C&#8211;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits. The subsequent cyclodehydrogenation steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles.







Abstract
We have achieved an on&#8208;surface synthesis of giant conjugated macrocycles having a diameter of &#8776;7&#8197;nm and consisting of up to 30 subunits. The synthesis started with a debrominative coupling of the molecular precursors on a hot Ag(111) surface, leading to the formation of arched oligomeric chains and macrocycles. These products were revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with density functional theory to be covalent oligomers. These intermediates also display C&#8211;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits due to site&#8208;selective debromination and the asymmetric molecular conformation. Subsequent cyclodehydrogenation at higher temperatures steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles. Our findings provide a novel design strategy toward &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles and open up new opportunities for the precise synthesis of organic nanostructures.

         <title>Effect of External Surface Diffusion Barriers on Platinum/Beta&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization of n&#8208;Pentane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
External surface diffusion barriers on zeolite Beta crystals significantly reduce their apparent catalytic activity in catalyzing isomerization of n&#8208;pentane. Eliminating surface barriers can lead to an improvement in apparent catalytic activity higher than 131&#8201;%.







Abstract
We have developed a generalizable strategy to quantify the effect of surface barriers on zeolite catalysis. Isomerization of n&#8208;pentane, catalyzed by Pt/Beta, is taken as a model reaction system. Firstly, the surface modification by chemical liquid deposition of SiO2 was carried out to control the surface barriers on zeolite Beta crystals. The deposition of SiO2 leads to a very slight change in the physical properties of Beta crystals, but an obvious reduction in Br&#248;nsted acid sites. Diffusion measurements by the zero&#8208;length column (ZLC) method show that the apparent diffusivity of n&#8208;pentane can be more than doubled after SiO2 deposition, indicating that the surface barriers have been weakened. Catalytic performance was tested in a fixed&#8208;bed reactor, showing that the apparent catalytic activity improved by 51&#8211;131&#8201;% after SiO2 deposition. These results provide direct proof that reducing surface barriers can be an effective route to improve zeolite catalyst performance deteriorated by transport limitations.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Dihydrodibenzosilines: Silicon Central&#8208;to&#8208;Axial Chirality Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic dihydrodibenzosilines featuring axially chiral 6&#8208;membered bridged biaryls is demonstrated. A wide range of dihydrodibenzosilines containing both silicon&#8208;central and axial chirality are conveniently constructed in excellent enantioselectivity via intramolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;H silylation.







Abstract
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic dihydrodibenzosilines featuring axially chiral 6&#8208;membered bridged biaryls is demonstrated. In the presence of a RhI catalyst with a chiral diphosphine ligand, a wide range of dihydrodibenzosilines containing both silicon&#8208;central and axial chiralities are conveniently constructed in excellent enantioselectivities via dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation. Absolute configuration analysis by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures revealed a novel silicon central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality relay phenomenon, which we believe will inspire further research in the field of asymmetric catalysis and chiroptical materials.

         <title>Molecular Surgery at Microporous MOF for Mesopore Generation and Renovation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plane&#8208;oriented mesopore formation and closure in microporous MOFs were demonstrated mimicking the surgical operation but at molecular level. The established strategy enables formation of hierarchical MOF with tunable porosity. The anisotropic nature of the MOF lattice planes enabled not only engineering the mesopore size and volume, but also controlling the pore shape that could be beneficial for certain kind of new applications in the MOF field.







Abstract
Hierarchically porous MOFs (HP&#8208;MOFs) present advantageous synergism of micro&#8208; and mesopore but challenging in synthetic control at molecular scale. Herein, we present the first example of reversible and controllable mesopore generation and renovation in a microporous MOF of HKUST&#8208;1 via synthetic manipulation at molecular scale. An ammonia&#8208;gas etching strategy is proposed to create mesopores in carboxylate&#8208;based microporous MOFs and thus produce HP&#8208;MOFs. Gas&#8208;phase etching ensures uniform mesopore formation inside the MOF crystals via plane&#8208;oriented cutting the carboxylate&#8208;metal bonds off without affecting the crystal size and morphology. The mesopore size is controlled by the etching temperature, while the mesopore volume could be tuned by adjusting etchant pressure. The generated mesopores could be renovated using MOF precursors solutions so that to achieve controllable mesopore generation/closure, and encapsulation of the adsorbed molecules. This work demonstrates a powerful protocol for precisely tailoring and tuning the properties of MOF materials at molecular scale.

         <title>Engineering Bismuth&#8211;Tin Interface in Bimetallic Aerogel with a 3D Porous Structure for Highly Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to HCOOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12554-12559, May 25, 2021. </description>

Bismuth&#8211;Tin aerogel was prepared at ambient temperature, resulting in a three&#8208;dimensional porous nanostructure with abundant pores. The material presents excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for formic acid generation with a high Faradaic efficiency (93.9&#8201;%) and partial current density of 9.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) into valuable hydrocarbons is appealing in alleviating the excessive CO2 level. We present the very first utilization of metallic bismuth&#8211;tin (Bi&#8208;Sn) aerogel for CO2RR with selective HCOOH production. A non&#8208;precious bimetallic aerogel of Bi&#8208;Sn is readily prepared at ambient temperature, which exhibits 3D morphology with interconnected channels, abundant interfaces and a hydrophilic surface. Superior to Bi and Sn, the Bi&#8208;Sn aerogel exposes more active sites and it has favorable mass transfer properties, which endow it with a high FEHCOOH of 93.9&#8201;%. Moreover, the Bi&#8208;Sn aerogel achieves a FEHCOOH of ca. 90&#8201;% that was maintained for 10&#8197;h in a flow battery. In&#8197;situ ATR&#8208;FTIR measurements confirmed that the formation of *HCOO is the rate&#8208;determining step toward formic acid generation. DFT demonstrated the coexistence of Bi and Sn optimized the energy barrier for the production of HCOOH, thereby improving the catalytic activity.

         <title>Tailoring a Dynamic Metal&#8211;Polymer Interaction to Improve Catalyst Selectivity and Longevity in Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12482-12489, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of polymers with similar framework structures but different metal&#8208;ligating functionalities as supports for Pd catalysts to control the dynamic metal&#8211;polymer interactions (DMPI) and catalytic properties. The polymers containing strongly ligating groups can form a polymer overlayer on the Pd surface via DMPI, which enables selective acetylene adsorption and partial hydrogenation to ethylene without deactivation.







Abstract
Controlling metal&#8211;support interactions is important for tuning the catalytic properties of supported metal catalysts. Here, premade Pd particles are supported on stable polymers containing different ligating functionalities to control the metal&#8211;polymer interactions and their catalytic properties in industrially relevant acetylene partial hydrogenation. The polymers containing strongly ligating groups (e.g., Ar&#8208;SH and Ar&#8208;S&#8208;Ar) can form a polymer overlayer on the Pd surface, which enables selective acetylene adsorption and partial hydrogenation to ethylene without deactivation. In contrast, polymers with weakly ligating groups (e.g., Ar&#8208;O&#8208;Ar) do not form an overlayer, resulting in non&#8208;selective hydrogenation and fast deactivation, similar to Pd catalysts on conventional inorganic supports. The results imply that tuning the metal&#8211;polymer interactions via rational polymer design can provide an efficient way of synthesizing selective and stable catalysts for hydrogenation.

With the guidance of machine learning, the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT (CIE coordinates) of 3107&#8197;K (0.48, 0.51), 4071&#8197;K (0.37, 0.37), and 4548&#8197;K (0.36, 0.36), and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5106&#8197;K (0.34, 0.37), 5632&#8197;K (0.33, 0.33), and 6034&#8197;K (0.32, 0.35) were obtained accurately.







Abstract
Here, we show the fabrication of the carbon dots (CDs) with green and orange emissions from PTCDA (perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride). Using these CDs as emitters, the orange (or green) CDs LEDs were fabricated, which show electroluminescence (EL) spectra centered at 560&#8197;nm (or 498&#8197;nm) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.98&#8201;% (1.76&#8201;%) adhering a luminescence of 626&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 (or 519&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2). The machine learning was successfully used to predict PL CCT value. With the model, the white photoluminescence (PL) emission with adjustable correlated color temperature (CCT) from 3093 to 11018&#8197;K via combining blue, green, and orange CDs was achieved. Then, we obtained the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT of 3107, 4071 and 4548&#8197;K, and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5632 (CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33), EQE: 1.18&#8201;%, luminescence: 598&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2) and 6034&#8197;K accurately.

&lt;p&gt;With the guidance of machine learning, the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT (CIE coordinates) of 3107&#8197;K (0.48, 0.51), 4071&#8197;K (0.37, 0.37), and 4548&#8197;K (0.36, 0.36), and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5106&#8197;K (0.34, 0.37), 5632&#8197;K (0.33, 0.33), and 6034&#8197;K (0.32, 0.35) were obtained accurately.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we show the fabrication of the carbon dots (CDs) with green and orange emissions from PTCDA (perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride). Using these CDs as emitters, the orange (or green) CDs LEDs were fabricated, which show electroluminescence (EL) spectra centered at 560&#8197;nm (or 498&#8197;nm) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.98&#8201;% (1.76&#8201;%) adhering a luminescence of 626&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (or 519&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The machine learning was successfully used to predict PL CCT value. With the model, the white photoluminescence (PL) emission with adjustable correlated color temperature (CCT) from 3093 to 11018&#8197;K via combining blue, green, and orange CDs was achieved. Then, we obtained the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT of 3107, 4071 and 4548&#8197;K, and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5632 (CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33), EQE: 1.18&#8201;%, luminescence: 598&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 6034&#8197;K accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Deliberate Construction of Polyoxoniobates Exploiting the Carbonate Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12461-12466, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonate reacts with the labile decaniobate&#8208;POM, yielding new polyoxoniobates featuring carbonate ligands. The carbonate ligands reinforce oligomerization of clusters in solution that is observed in the solid&#8208;state and scaffolds and stabilizes larger cluster aggregates. Lanthanides directly replace Nb in PONb clusters, rather than associate electrostatically as previously observed. The lanthanide substitution is enabled by carbonate ligation.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs, metals=VV, NbV, TaV, MoVI, WVI) are molecular metal oxides that can be isolated without capping ligands. The high negative charge of polyoxoniobates (PONb) provides strong interactions with heterocations, advantageous for electrostatic assembly of modular materials. In four single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, we demonstrate that carbonate combined with the very reactive decaniobate [Nb10O28]6&#8722; reassembles into a new decaniobate, [Nb10O25(CO3)6]12&#8722;, featuring three carbonate&#8208;ligated Nb&#8208;polyhedra. These Nb&#8208;sites can be replaced by heterometals (lanthanides), and the tridentate carbonate can serve as an anchor point to build niobate&#8208;frameworks. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and two additional X&#8208;ray structures reveal that the reaction pathway proceeds through a Nb24&#8208;PONb intermediate, and the obtained PONb (with or without carbonate) is counterion, temperature, and solvent&#8208;dependent (water or mixed water&#8208;methanol). This provides an uncommon level of control for PONb chemistry.

         <title>Solar and Visible Light Assisted Peptide Coupling</title>

A peptide coupling reaction is described that relies mechanistically on sunlight activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent in situ. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
Amino acid and peptide couplings are widely used in fields related to pharma and materials. Still, current peptide synthesis continues to rely on the use of expensive, water sensitive, and waste&#8208;generating coupling reagents, which are often prepared in multi&#8208;step sequences and used in excess. Herein is described a peptide coupling reaction design that relies mechanistically on sun&#8208;light activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent in situ. The resulting coupling method is rapid, does not require dry solvents or inert atmosphere, and is compatible with all the most common amino acids and protecting groups. Peptide couplings can be run on gram&#8208;scale, without the use of special equipment. This method has a significantly reduced environmental and financial footprint compared to standard peptide coupling reactions. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Prodrug Activation by Gold Artificial Metalloenzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Phenanthridinium Derivatives via Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12446-12454, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold artificial metalloenzyme catalyzes the conversion of a prodrug into a phenanthridinium&#8208;based anticancer drug with a good turnover number (&gt;100) via hydroamination under mild conditions. The gold artificial metalloenzyme successfully triggers drug synthesis to achieve cancer therapy in cell&#8208;based assays.







Abstract
An emerging approach in the field of targeted drug delivery is the establishment of abiotic metal&#8208;triggered prodrug mechanisms that can control the release of bioactive drugs. Currently, the design of prodrugs that use abiotic metals as a trigger relies heavily on uncaging strategies. Here, we introduce a strategy based on the gold&#8208;catalyzed activation of a phenanthridinium&#8208;based prodrug via hydroamination under physiological conditions. To make the prodrug strategy biocompatible, a gold artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) based on human serum albumin, rather than the free gold metal complex, was used as a trigger for prodrug activation. The albumin&#8208;based gold ArM protected the catalytic activity of the bound gold metal even in the presence of up to 1&#8197;mM glutathione in vitro. The drug synthesized via the gold ArM exerted a therapeutic effect in cell&#8208;based assays, highlighting the potential usefulness of the gold ArM in anticancer applications.

Engineering mesopores into microporous organic cages to create hierarchically porous organic cage was explored. The beneficial effect of hierarchical pores on the selective adsorption properties and enhanced catalytic performances was demonstrated.







Abstract
Imparting mesopores to organic cages of an intrinsic microporous nature to build up hierarchically porous cage soft materials is a grand challenge and will reshape the property and application scope of traditional organic cage molecules. Herein, we discovered how to engineer mesopores into microporous organic cages via their host&#8211;guest interactions with long chain ionic surfactants. Equally important, the ionic head of surfactants equips the supramolecularly assembled porous structures with charge&#8208;selective uptake and release function in solution. Interestingly, such hierarchically porous organic cage can serve as a nanoreactor once trapping enzymes within the cavity, which show 5&#8208;fold enhanced activity of enzymatic catalysis when compared with the free enzymes.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Asymmetric Aminoazidation and Diazidation of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12455-12460, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biologically accessible hydroxylation in nature often proceeds through a radical rebound process. However, such a radical rebound usually leads to non&#8208;stereoselectivity. Rendering the radical rebound enantioselective is quite challenging. Herein, the first radical asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation on acyclic systems via radical rebound is reported.







Abstract
Asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation of alkenes are straightforward strategies to build value&#8208;added chiral nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds from feedstock chemicals. They provide direct access to chiral organoazides and complement enantioselective diamination. Despite the advances in non&#8208;asymmetric reactions, asymmetric aminoazidation or diazidation based on acyclic systems has not been previously reported. Here we describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation of styrenes. The method is practically useful and requires relatively low loading of catalyst and chiral ligand. With mild reaction conditions, the reaction can be completed on a 20&#8197;mmol scale. Studies of the mechanism suggest that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway and involves stereocontrol of an acyclic free radical which probably takes place through a group transfer mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;Biologically accessible hydroxylation in nature often proceeds through a radical rebound process. However, such a radical rebound usually leads to non-stereoselectivity. Rendering the radical rebound enantioselective is quite challenging. Herein, the first radical asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation on acyclic systems via radical rebound is reported.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Truly Monodisperse Molecular Nanoparticles of Cerium Dioxide of 2.4&#8197;nm dimensions: A {Ce100O167} Cluster</title>

A bottom&#8208;up molecular approach yields a giant Ce/O cluster with a 2.4&#8197;nm {Ce100O167} core within a monolayer shell of benzoate, benzoic acid, and water ligands. The crystal structure shows it has the fluorite structure of bulk CeO2 and it is thus an ultra&#8208;small piece of CeO2 in molecular form (a molecular nanoparticle) providing structural information to atomic resolution of surface features important to catalysis by CeO2 nanoparticles.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles of CeO2 obtained in molecular form, so&#8208;called molecular nanoparticles, have been limited to date to a family whose largest member is of nuclearity Ce40 with a {Ce40O58} core atom count. Herein we report that a synthetic procedure has been developed to the cation [Ce100O149(OH)18(O2CPh)60(PhCO2H)12(H2O)20]16+, a member with a much higher Ce100 nuclearity and a {Ce100O167} core that is more akin to the smallest ceria nanoparticles. Its crystal structure reveals it to possess a 2.4&#8197;nm size and high D2d symmetry, and it has also allowed identification of core surface features including facet composition, the presence and location of Ce3+and H+ (i.e. HO&#8722;) ions, and the binding modes of the ligand monolayer of benzoate, benzoic acid, and water ligands.

         <title>Unravelling the Fast Alkali&#8208;Ion Dynamics in Paramagnetic Battery Materials Combined with NMR and Deep&#8208;Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12547-12553, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unambiguous assignment of chemical shift in paramagnetic battery materials relies on first&#8208;principles calculation, while the state&#8208;of&#8208;art computational methodology is limited in sluggish dynamic systems. We incorporate hundreds of nanoseconds deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation to expanding the ssNMR application in high&#8208;rate cathode materials.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) has received extensive attention in characterizing alkali&#8208;ion battery materials because it is highly sensitive for probing the local environment and dynamic information of atoms/ions. However, precise spectral assignment cannot be carried out by conventional DFT for high&#8208;rate battery materials at room temperature. Herein, combining DFT calculation of paramagnetic shift and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation to achieve the converged Na+ distribution at hundreds of nanoseconds, we obtain the statistically averaged paramagnetic shift, which is in excellent agreement with ssNMR measurements. Two 23Na shifts induced by different stacking sequences of transition metal layers are revealed in the fast chemically exchanged NMR spectra of P2&#8208;type Na2/3(Mg1/3Mn2/3)O2 for the first time. This DPMD simulation auxiliary protocol can be beneficial to a wide range of ssNMR analysis in fast chemically exchanged material systems.

         <title>Beyond Classical Coordination Chemistry: The First Case of a Triply Bridging Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12577-12584, May 25, 2021. </description>

Phosphines are notorious in acting exclusively as terminal donors, binding a single metal center. We have discovered that a non&#8208;traditional scenario is possible where the phosphorus(III) atom of a R3P ligand bridges three metal atoms at once. Such triply bridging pattern is first observed in the [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;Hal)3L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes, which also exhibit remarkable luminescence properties.







Abstract
The first example of a triply bridging (&#956;3&#8208;P) phosphine ligand has been discovered in the crown&#8208;shaped [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;Hal)3L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes supported by tris[2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethyl]phosphine (L). Theoretical analysis completely confirms the observed &#956;3&#8208;P&#8208;bridging pattern, revealing the interaction of the same lone pair of phosphorus with three valence 4s&#8208;orbitals of Cu atoms. The presented complexes exhibit outstanding blue phosphorescence (&#955;em=442&#8211;465&#8197;nm) with the quantum efficiency reaching 100&#8201;%. The complex [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;I)3L] also exhibits remarkable thermo&#8208; and mechanochromic luminescence resulting in a sharp change in the emission colour upon external stimuli. These findings essentially contribute to coordination chemistry of the pnictine ligands.

         <title>A Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Encapsulated with DNAzyme for Intracellular Drug Synthesis and Self&#8208;Sufficient Gene Therapy</title>

A synergetic therapy nanoplatform was developed by encapsulating the therapeutic DNAzyme into Cu/Zn bimetallic MOF for intracellular drug synthesis and self&#8208;sufficient gene therapy. This design can not only avoid the side effects of traditional chemotherapy, but also effectively inhibit tumor metastasis by cleaving the oncogene substrate.







Abstract
Although chemotherapy is one of the most widely used cancer treatments, there are serious side effects, drug resistance, and secondary metastasis. To address these problems, herein we designed a bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) encapsulated with DNAzyme for co&#8208;triggered in situ cancer drug synthesis and DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy. Once in cancer cells, MOFs would disassemble and liberate copper ions, zinc ions, and DNAzyme under the acidic environment of lysosomes. Copper ions can catalyze the synthesis of the chemotherapeutic drug through copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction after being reduced to CuI; zinc ions act as the cofactor to activate the cleavage activity of DNAzyme. The anticancer drug is synthesized intracellularly and can kill cancer cells on site to minimize side effects to normal organisms. The activated DNAzyme starts gene therapy to inhibit tumor proliferation and metastasis by targeting and cleaving oncogene substrates.

         <title>Functionalization of Silk by AIEgens through Facile Bioconjugation: Full&#8208;Color Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Term Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12424-12430, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent silks with full&#8208;color emissions were fabricated through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation with five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). White light&#8208;emitting silk was prepared and demonstrated potential applications in flexible displays. Moreover, red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silk materials were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging.







Abstract
Silkworm silk is a promising natural biopolymer for textile and biomedical applications for its remarkable flexibility, excellent biocompatibility and controllable biodegradability. The functionalization of silks makes them more versatile for flexible displays and visible bioscaffolds. However, fluorescent silks are normally fabricated through unstable physical absorption or complicated chemical reactions under harsh conditions. Herein, we developed a simple strategy for preparing fluorescent silks. Five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) with activated alkynes were synthesized by rational molecular design, and then reacted with silk fibers through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation. The resulting conjugates show bright full&#8208;color emissions and high stability. A white light&#8208;emitting silk was fabricated by simultaneous bioconjugation with red&#8208;, green&#8208; and blue&#8208;emissive AIEgens. The red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silks were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, demonstrating great potential for tissue engineering and bioscaffold monitoring.

         <title>Lignin Compounds to Monoaromatics: Selective Cleavage of C&#8722;O Bonds over a Brominated Ruthenium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12513-12523, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brominated supported Ru catalyst was developed for the cleavage of C&#8722;O linkages in aryl ethers (reaching yield 90.3&#8201;% to monoaromatics from diphenyl ether) in lignin compounds without hydrogenation of the aromatic rings. Both selective poisoning of terrace sites and electronic promotion of defect sites contribute to the catalytic performance.







Abstract
The cleavage of C&#8722;O linkages in aryl ethers in biomass&#8208;derived lignin compounds without hydrogenation of the aromatic rings is a major challenge for the production of sustainable mono&#8208;aromatics. Conventional strategies over the heterogeneous metal catalysts require the addition of homogeneous base additives causing environmental problems. Herein, we propose a heterogeneous Ru/C catalyst modified by Br atoms for the selective direct cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds in diphenyl ether without hydrogenation of aromatic rings reaching the yield of benzene and phenol as high as 90.3&#8201;% and increased selectivity to mono&#8208;aromatics (97.3 vs. 46.2&#8201;% for initial Ru) during depolymerization of lignin. Characterization of the catalyst indicates selective poisoning by Br of terrace sites over Ru nanoparticles, which are active in the hydrogenation of aromatic rings, while the defect sites on the edges and corners remain available and provide higher intrinsic activity in the C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Automated Quantification of Hydroxyl Reactivities: Prediction of Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12413-12423, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A so&#8208;called &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; program has been developed to foresee and predict the yield and stereoselectivity of glycosylation reactions based on the properties of various donors, acceptors, activation systems and solvents. The program statistically analyzes and compares the relative reactivity value (RRV) of donors and the acceptor nucleophilic constant (Aka) of acceptors.







Abstract
The stereoselectivity and yield in glycosylation reactions are paramount but unpredictable. We have developed a database of acceptor nucleophilic constants (Aka) to quantify the nucleophilicity of hydroxyl groups in glycosylation influenced by the steric, electronic and structural effects, providing a connection between experiments and computer algorithms. The subtle reactivity differences among the hydroxyl groups on various carbohydrate molecules can be defined by Aka, which is easily accessible by a simple and convenient automation system to assure high reproducibility and accuracy. A diverse range of glycosylation donors and acceptors with well&#8208;defined reactivity and promoters were organized and processed by the designed software program &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; for prediction of glycosylation reactions without involving sophisticated computational processing. The importance of Aka was further verified by random forest algorithm, and the applicability was tested by the synthesis of a Lewis A skeleton to show that the stereoselectivity and yield can be accurately estimated.

         <title>Merging Reagent Modulation and Remote Anchimeric Assistance for Glycosylation: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Glycans up to a 30&#8208;mer</title>

Merging reagent modulation and a 6&#8208;O&#8208;levulinoyl remote anchimeric assistance glycosylation strategy has been developed to achieve the first highly stereoselective synthesis of the branched Dendrobium Huoshanense glycans with the immunostimulating activities and the linear Longan glycans containing up to 30 contiguous 1,2&#8208;cis glucosidic bonds with anti&#8208;cancer activities.







Abstract
The efficient synthesis of long, branched, and complex carbohydrates containing multiple 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic linkages is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a merging reagent modulation and 6&#8208;O&#8208;levulinoyl remote anchimeric assistance glycosylation strategy, which is successfully applied to the first highly stereoselective synthesis of the branched Dendrobium Huoshanense glycans and the linear Longan glycans containing up to 30 contiguous 1,2&#8208;cis glucosidic bonds. DFT calculations shed light on the origin of the much higher stereoselectivities of 1,2&#8208;cis glucosylation with 6&#8208;O&#8208;levulinoyl group than 6&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl or 6&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl groups. Orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzoates and ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates has been demonstrated in the efficient synthesis of complex glycans, precluding such issues as aglycon transfer inherent to orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthesis based on thioglycosides.

         <title>Construction of Flexible Amine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks by Catalysis and Reduction of Formic Acid via the Eschweiler&#8211;Clarke Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12396-12405, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the Eschweiler&#8211;Clarke reaction, a series of flexible amine&#8208;linked COFs was synthesized by catalysis and reduction of formic acid. The unique bifunctional properties of formic acid can not only catalyze the formation of rigid C=N bond like acetic acid, the most common catalyst in COF synthesis, but also reduce and transform it to flexible C&#8722;N bond simultaneously, giving COFs the accommodative adaptability to guest molecules.







Abstract
Compared to the current mainstream rigid covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by imine bonds, flexible COFs have certain advantages of elasticity and self&#8208;adaptability, but their construction and application are greatly limited by the complexity in synthesis and difficulty in obtaining regular structure. Herein, we reported for the first time a series of flexible amine&#8208;linked COFs with high crystallinity synthesized by formic acid with unique catalytic and reductive bifunctional properties, rather than acetic acid, the most common catalyst for COF synthesis. The reaction mechanism was demonstrated to be a synchronous in situ reduction during the formation of imine bond. The flexibilities of the products endow them with accommodative adaptability to guest molecules, thus increasing the adsorption capacities for nitrogen and iodine by 27&#8201;% and 22&#8201;%, respectively. Impressively, a novel concept of flexibilization degree was proposed firstly, which provides an effective approach to rationally measure the flexibility of COFs.

&lt;p&gt;Using the Eschweiler&#8211;Clarke reaction, a series of flexible amine-linked COFs was synthesized by catalysis and reduction of formic acid. The unique bifunctional properties of formic acid can not only catalyze the formation of rigid C=N bond like acetic acid, the most common catalyst in COF synthesis, but also reduce and transform it to flexible C&#8722;N bond simultaneously, giving COFs the accommodative adaptability to guest molecules.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the current mainstream rigid covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by imine bonds, flexible COFs have certain advantages of elasticity and self-adaptability, but their construction and application are greatly limited by the complexity in synthesis and difficulty in obtaining regular structure. Herein, we reported for the first time a series of flexible amine-linked COFs with high crystallinity synthesized by formic acid with unique catalytic and reductive bifunctional properties, rather than acetic acid, the most common catalyst for COF synthesis. The reaction mechanism was demonstrated to be a synchronous in situ reduction during the formation of imine bond. The flexibilities of the products endow them with accommodative adaptability to guest molecules, thus increasing the adsorption capacities for nitrogen and iodine by 27&#8201;% and 22&#8201;%, respectively. Impressively, a novel concept of flexibilization degree was proposed firstly, which provides an effective approach to rationally measure the flexibility of COFs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Core&#8211;Shell Gold Nanoparticles and Controllable Assemblies for SERS Ratiometric Detection of MicroRNA</title>

A series of asymmetrical plasmonic core&#8211;shell nanoparticles (JAuNNPs) are created, displaying tailorable optical properties. Using amphiphilic polymer brushes, core&#8208;to&#8208;core or shell&#8208;to&#8208;shell dimers with controllable spatial precision and position of EM field enhancement are fabricated. DNA linkers are utilized to form JAuNND12(50&#8201;%), enabling them to image the distribution of miR&#8208;21 in living cells and tumors.







Abstract
Janus nanogap gold nanoparticles (JAuNNPs) with varying proportions of Au shell coverage of (ca. 100/75/50/25&#8201;%) are presented. The internal nanogap between the partial Au shell and core caused asymmetric optical behavior; tunability depends on the degree of Au shell coverage and structural asymmetry. The shell&#8208;to&#8208;shell or core&#8208;to&#8208;core JAuNNDs(50&#8201;%) were self&#8208;assembled from amphiphilic JAuNNPs(50&#8201;%) by tuning the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer brushes on the Au core or shell. The positions of electromagnetic field enhancement of JAuNNDs varied with geometrical configurations because of hybridized plasmonic coupling effects. Furthermore, DNA linkers were utilized to form JAuNND12(50&#8201;%). By combining with Raman molecules, ratiometric SERS signals could be generated, enabling JAuNND12(50&#8201;%) to image the distribution of miR&#8208;21 in living cells and tumors. Asymmetric JAuNNPs allowed facile conjugation of various linkage molecules to fabricate dimeric nanostructures.

Herein, we have designed and prepared FRET&#8208;based two&#8208;photon mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MTP&#8211;MSNs) for multiplexed intracellular imaging and targeted cancer therapy for the first time. After incubation with cancer cells, MTP&#8211;MSNs could release drugs and performed multicolor two&#8208;photon cellular imaging. These MTP&#8211;MSNs provide a promising system for traceable targeted cancer therapy with further applications in multiplex intracellular imaging.







Abstract
The novel theranostic nanosystems based on two&#8208;photon fluorescence can achieve higher spatial resolution of deep tissue imaging for simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of a variety of cancers. Herein, we have designed and prepared FRET&#8208;based two&#8208;photon mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MTP&#8211;MSNs) for single&#8208;excitation multiplexed intracellular imaging and targeted cancer therapy for the first time. This nanosystem includes two constituents, containing (1) multicolor two&#8208;photon mesoporous silica nanoparticles and (2) cancer cell&#8208;targeting aptamers that act as gatekeepers for MTP&#8211;MSNs. After incubation with cancer cells, the Dox&#8208;loaded and aptamer&#8208;capped MTP&#8211;MSNs could be internalized into the cells, opening the pores and releasing the drug. Furthermore, using two&#8208;photon multicolor fluorescence, MTP&#8211;MSNs could serve as good contrast agents for multicolor two&#8208;photon intracellular imaging with increased imaging depth and improved spatial localization of tissue. In sum, these multicolor MTP&#8211;MSNs provide a promising system for traceable targeted cancer therapy with further applications in multiplex intracellular imaging and the screening of drug.

         <title>A Cysteine&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Red Phosphorus Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12524-12531, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox method was developed for fabrication of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs). Cysteine was responsible for assembly of the RPNSs, and the addition of acetylacetonate enabled the construction of doped RPNSs. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results confirmed that native RPNSs induce drastic autophagy in tumor chemotherapy.







Abstract
Among phosphorus&#8208;based nanomaterials, layered black phosphorus and violet phosphorus have been actively explored in the past decade. However, methods for the synthesis of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs) is lacking, even though red phosphorus (RP) is commercially available at low cost and has excellent chemical stability at room temperature. We report an efficient strategy for fabrication of RPNSs and doped RPNSs using cysteine as a reducing reagent. Data from in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies suggested that RPNSs can trigger production of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and subsequent autophagy&#8208;mediated cell death in a shape&#8208;dependent manner. Our findings provide a method for construction of layered RP nanomaterials and they present a unique mechanism for the application of phosphorus&#8208;based materials in nanomedicines.

A Kagome structure covalent organic framework (COF) film was synthesized and exhibited three&#8208;state electrochromic properties with sub&#8208;second response time and long retention time in the near&#8208;infrared region. Taking potential and absorbance as input and output signal, respectively, a mimicking logic gate with optical memory functions was demonstrated based on the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film.







Abstract
A Kagome structure covalent organic framework (COF) film with three&#8208;state NIR electrochromic properties was designed and synthesized. The COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film is composed of hexagonal nanosheets with high crystallinity and has three reversible color states at different applied potentials. It has high absorption spectra changes in the NIR region, ascribed to the strong intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) interaction of the Class III mixed&#8208;valence systems of the conjugated triphenylamine species. The film showed sub&#8208;second response time (1.3&#8197;s for coloring and 0.7&#8197;s for bleaching at 1050&#8197;nm) and long retention time in the NIR region. COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film shows superior NIR electrochromic properties in term of response time and stability, attributed to the highly ordered porous structure and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking structure of the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA architecture. The COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film was applied in mimicking a flip&#8208;flop logic gate with optical memory function.

         <title>The Pivotal Role of Hot Carriers in Plasmonic Catalysis of C&#8722;N Bond Forming Reaction of Amines</title>

A simple gold nanoparticle catalyzes the oxidative coupling of benzylamine to form imine in presence of visible light. Photoexcitation of Au NP generates an electron&#8211;hole pair that activates adsorbates (reactants) at Au NP surface to form a strong oxidant&#8211;reductant pair (benzylamine radical cation and superoxide radical), which is conducive for the reaction at a low temperature, with high product yield and selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous utilization of both the hot carriers (electrons and holes) in the photocatalytic transformation of benzylamine to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine and the scope of reaction has also been successfully demonstrated with catalytic oxidation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzylamine. The wavelength&#8208;dependent excitation of AuNP allows us to tune the potential energy of charge carriers relative to the redox potential of the reactants which leads to energetically favorable product formation on the nanoparticle surface. We capture the formation of reaction intermediates and products by using in situ Raman spectroscopy, complemented by NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS. Based on the experimental substantiations, a plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Water Oxidation: O&#8211;O Bond Formation via Intramolecular Oxo&#8211;Oxo Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12467-12474, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three binuclear Fe complexes are tested as molecular water oxidation catalysts. O&#8722;O bond formation can be achieved via intramolecular oxo&#8211;oxo interaction rather than by water nucleophilic attack (WNA), and the catalytic performance can be effectively controlled by the framework of the ligand.







Abstract
Herein, we report the importance of structure regulation on the O&#8722;O bond formation process in binuclear iron catalysts. Three complexes, [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)(OH2)2(TPA)2]4+ (1), [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)(OH2)2(6&#8208;HPA)]4+ (2) and [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)(OH2)2(BPMAN)]4+ (3), have been designed as electrocatalysts for water oxidation in 0.1&#8197;M NaHCO3 solution (pH&#8197;8.4). We found that 1 and 2 are molecular catalysts and that O&#8722;O bond formation proceeds via oxo&#8211;oxo coupling rather than by the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) pathway. In contrast, complex 3 displays negligible catalytic activity. DFT calculations suggested that the anti to syn isomerization of the two high&#8208;valent Fe=O moieties in these catalysts takes place via the axial rotation of one Fe=O unit around the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Fe center. This is followed by the O&#8722;O bond formation via an oxo&#8211;oxo coupling pathway at the FeIVFeIV state or via oxo&#8211;oxyl coupling pathway at the FeIVFeV state. Importantly, the rigid BPMAN ligand in complex 3 limits the anti to syn isomerization and axial rotation of the Fe=O moiety, which accounts for the negligible catalytic activity.

         <title>A Ge/Carbon Atomic&#8208;Scale Hybrid Anode Material: A Micro&#8211;Nano Gradient Porous Structure with High Cycling Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
Due to the chemical stability and high melting point of carbon (3500&#8201;&#176;C), Ge/carbon hybridization at the atomic level is challenging. By selecting a suitable carbon source and introducing an active medium, we have achieved the Ge/carbon doping at the atom&#8208;level, and this Ge/carbon anode shows excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The continuous growth of the solid&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI) and material crushing are the fundamental issues that hinder the application of Ge anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Solving Ge deformation crushing during discharge/charge cycles is challenging using conventional carbon coating modification methods. Due to the chemical stability and high melting point of carbon (3500&#8201;&#176;C), Ge/carbon hybridization at the atomic level is challenging. By selecting a suitable carbon source and introducing an active medium, we have achieved the Ge/carbon doping at the atom&#8208;level, and this Ge/carbon anode shows excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible capacity is maintained at 1127&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles (2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (2&#8211;71&#8197;cycles), 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (72&#8211;1000&#8197;cycles)) with a retention of 84&#8201;% compared to the second cycle. The thickness of the SEI is only 17.4&#8197;nm after 1000&#8197;cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance and stable SEI fully reflect the application potential of this material.

         <title>Design of Multi&#8208;Shelled Hollow Cr2O3 Spheres for Metabolic Fingerprinting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12504-12512, May 25, 2021. </description>

Multi&#8208;shelled hollow Cr2O3 spheres displayed strong photo&#8208;response for enhanced ionization and microscale surface roughness with stability for the effective LDI of metabolites, thereby enabling fast and sensitive metabolic profiling in bio&#8208;fluids. Based on the decoded urine and serum metabolic fingerprints, we performed machine learning to discriminate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls with high specificity and selectivity.







Abstract
Schizophrenia (SZ) detection enables effective treatment to improve the clinical outcome, but objective and reliable SZ diagnostics are still limited. An ideal diagnosis of SZ suited for robust clinical screening must address detection throughput, low invasiveness, and diagnosis accuracy. Herein, we built a multi&#8208;shelled hollow Cr2O3 spheres (MHCSs) assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS) platform for the direct metabolic profiling of biofluids towards SZ diagnostics. The MHCSs displayed strong light absorption for enhanced ionization and microscale surface roughness with stability for the effective LDI of metabolites. We profiled urine and serum metabolites (&#8776;1&#8197;&#956;L) with the enhanced LDI efficacy in seconds. We discriminated SZ patients (SZs) from healthy controls (HCs) with the highest area under the curve (AUC) value of 1.000 for the blind test. We identified four compounds with optimal diagnostic power as a simplified metabolite panel for SZ and demonstrated the metabolite quantification for clinic use. Our approach accelerates the growth of new platforms toward a precision diagnosis in the near future.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Noncovalently Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions and End&#8208;Group Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12475-12481, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a series of noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent intramolecular interactions. Combining the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and &#960;&#8208;extended end&#8208;group engineering, a record PCE of 14.53&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8&#8201;% for NFREAs based devices were achieved.







Abstract
Noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) have attracted much attention in recent years owing to their advantages of simple synthetic routes, high yields and low costs. However, the efficiencies of NFREAs based organic solar cells (OSCs) are still far behind those of fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Herein, a series of NFREAs with S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent intramolecular interactions were designed and synthesized with a two&#8208;step synthetic route.

As a result, a record PCE of 14.53&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8&#8201;% for NFREAs based devices were obtained.

&lt;p&gt;We constructed a series of noncovalently fused-ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent intramolecular interactions. Combining the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and &#960;-extended end-group engineering, a record PCE of 14.53&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8&#8201;% for NFREAs based devices were achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noncovalently fused-ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) have attracted much attention in recent years owing to their advantages of simple synthetic routes, high yields and low costs. However, the efficiencies of NFREAs based organic solar cells (OSCs) are still far behind those of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Herein, a series of NFREAs with S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent intramolecular interactions were designed and synthesized with a two-step synthetic route. Upon introducing &#960;-extended end-groups into the backbones, the electronic properties, charge transport, film morphology, and energy loss were precisely tuned by fine-tuning the degree of multi-fluorination. As a result, a record PCE of 14.53&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8&#8201;% for NFREAs based devices were obtained. This contribution demonstrated that combining the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and &#960;-extended end-group engineering is a simple and effective way to explore high-performance NFREAs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Functionalized Phosphonium Cations Enable Zinc Metal Reversibility in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12438-12445, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of phosphonium&#8208;based supporting salts and a subtle difference in their ligand chemistry remarkably improves the reversibility of aqueous Zn electrolytes. By promoting interphase formation, P444(2O1)&#8208;TFSI supports a Zn coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% even at 1.17&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 20&#8201;% Zn utilization per cycle, and a stable Zn&#8741;Na2V6O16&#8901;1.63&#8201;H2O cell cycling.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc metal batteries promise attractive advantages including safety, high volumetric energy density, and low cost; however, such benefits cannot be unlocked unless Zn reversibility meets stringent commercial viability. Herein, we report remarkable improvements on Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes when phosphonium&#8208;based cations are used to reshape interfacial structures and interphasial chemistries, particularly when their ligands contain an ether linkage. This novel aqueous electrolyte supports unprecedented Zn reversibility by showing dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping for over 6400&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, or over 280&#8197;h at 2.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% even with 20&#8201;% Zn utilization per cycle. Excellent full cell performance is demonstrated with Na2V6O16&#8901;1.63&#8201;H2O cathode, which cycles for 2000 times at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. The microscopic characterization and modeling identify the mechanism of unique interphase chemistry from phosphonium and its functionalities as the key factors responsible for dictating reversible Zn chemistry

A gold catalyst promotes the sequential cleavage of the S&#8722;O and N&#8722;S bonds of a sulfinyl group, leading to S&#8208;functionalized azirines. As Itaru Nakamura et&#8197;al. illustrate in their Communication on page&#8197;12248, the transformation is like making plastic models: A golden diagonal plier cuts these bonds, and the cut out parts are assembled into the product using an alkyne triple bond unit. Substituents in the product can be chosen from the kit as desired.

A peptide coupling method that relies on sunlight activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex for the in&#8197;situ generation of a novel coupling reagent is described by Yoav Eichen, Alex&#8197;M. Szpilman, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;12406. The reaction is rapid, water&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;tolerant, and compatible with all common amino acids and protective groups. It is characterized by a significantly reduced environmental, energetical, and economic footprint compared to standard peptide coupling reactions.

Chlorophyll&#8197;f (Chl&#8201;f)&#8208;containing Photosystem&#8197;II absorbing in the far red has transgressed the red limit of photosynthesis locked by chlorophyll&#8197;a at 680&#8197;nm and drives water oxidation at 727&#8197;nm. A phthalocyanine chromophore with similar absorption properties as Chl&#8201;f was stitched to a model of tyrosineZ/histidine, the pair of amino acids that enables electron relay between the Chl&#8201;f and the Mn4Ca water oxidizing complex. In their Communication on page&#8197;12284, Annamaria Quaranta, &#193;ngela Sastre&#8208;Santos, Ally Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers report evidence that these chromophores can mirror the photoactivity of Chl&#8201;f.

There is a strong interest in developing metal nanocrystals with well&#8208;controlled shapes while featuring metastable crystal structures. The unconventional crystal phases not only enrich the diversity and functionality of nanomaterials but also enhance their catalytic properties.







Abstract
In addition to the conventional knobs such as composition, size, shape, and defect structure, the crystal structure (or phase) of metal nanocrystals offers a new avenue for engineering their properties. Various strategies have recently been developed for the fabrication of colloidal metal nanocrystals in metastable phases different from their bulk counterparts. With a focus on noble metals, we begin with a brief introduction to their atomic packing, followed by a discussion about five major synthetic approaches to their colloidal nanocrystals in unconventional phases. We then highlight the success of synthesis in terms of mechanistic insights and experimental controls, as well as the enhanced catalytic properties. We end this Minireview with perspectives on the remaining issues and future opportunities.

Organofluorine chemistry in the focus: Novel transformations based on a radical process were designed recently, offering new synthetic tools for the selective functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with a fluorinated group at a remote position to a functional group. This Minireview highlights these recent advances based on a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer or a &#946;&#8208;fragmentation process.







Abstract
Due to their unique properties, fluorinated scaffolds are pivotal compounds in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science. Over the last years, the development of versatile strategies for the selective synthesis of fluorinated molecules by direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization has attracted a lot of attention. In particular, the design of novel transformations based on a radical process was a bottleneck for distal C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, offering synthetic solutions for the selective introduction of fluorinated groups. This Minireview highlights the major contributions in this blossoming field. The development of new methodologies for the remote functionalization of aliphatic derivatives with various fluorinated groups based on a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process and a &#946;&#8208;fragmentation reaction will be showcased and discussed.

         <title>Salt to Taste: The Critical Roles Played by Inorganic Salts in Organozinc Formation and in the Negishi Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12224-12241, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of organozinc reagents has been studied since its discovery in 1977, but the dramatic dependence on salt additives was only realized some 30&#8197;years later. LiCl and LiBr have been found not only to improve coupling outcomes, but their absence can shut down the reaction completely. This Review summarizes all reports outlining the ways that salt additives impact the formation of organozinc reagents and their use in Negishi cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
The first cross&#8208;coupling of organozinc nucleophiles with aryl halides was reported in 1977 by Negishi. Unknown to all at the time was the importance of salt additives that were often present as a byproduct from the organozinc preparation. For decades, these salt additives were overlooked until 2006 when it was discovered that two different, yet effective methods for preparing organozinc solutions (i.e. one with salt and one without) provided drastically different results. Since this finding, the exact role of salt additives in cross&#8208;coupling has been debated in the catalysis community. In this Review we highlight all the major discoveries regarding the influence of salt additives on the formation of organozinc reagents and their use in the Negishi reaction. These effects include solubilizing key intermediates, the formation of higher&#8208;order zincates, product inhibition, catalyst protection, and solvent effects.

This Review summarizes all reports outlining the ways that salt additives impact the formation of organozinc reagents and their use in Negishi cross-coupling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first cross-coupling of organozinc nucleophiles with aryl halides was reported in 1977 by Negishi. Unknown to all at the time was the importance of salt additives that were often present as a byproduct from the organozinc preparation. For decades, these salt additives were overlooked until 2006 when it was discovered that two different, yet effective methods for preparing organozinc solutions (i.e. one with salt and one without) provided drastically different results. Since this finding, the exact role of salt additives in cross-coupling has been debated in the catalysis community. In this Review we highlight all the major discoveries regarding the influence of salt additives on the formation of organozinc reagents and their use in the Negishi reaction. These effects include solubilizing key intermediates, the formation of higher-order zincates, product inhibition, catalyst protection, and solvent effects.&lt;/p&gt;

Fossil&#8208;based platform molecules such as ethylene and ethylene oxide currently serve as the primary feedstock for the C2&#8208;based chemical industry. This Review compares and critically discusses several production routes toward bio&#8208;based structural analogues of ethylene oxide, for example glycolaldehyde, and the required adaptations for their implementation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art C2&#8208;based chemical processes.







Abstract
Fossil&#8208;based platform molecules such as ethylene and ethylene oxide currently serve as the primary feedstock for the C2&#8208;based chemical industry. However, in the search for a more sustainable chemical industry, fossil&#8208;based resources may preferentially be replaced by renewable alternatives, provided there is realistic economic feasibility. This Review compares and critically discusses several production routes toward bio&#8208;based structural analogues of ethylene oxide and the required adaptations for their implementation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art C2&#8208;based chemical processes. For example, glycolaldehyde, a structural analogue obtainable from carbohydrates by atom&#8208;economic retro&#8208;aldol reactions, may replace ethylene oxide's leading role. This alternative chemical route may not only allow the carbon footprint of conventional chemicals production to be lowered, but the introduction of a bio&#8208;based pathway may also contribute to safer production processes. Where possible, challenges, drawbacks, and prospects are highlighted.

A strategic implementation of indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole units into polycyclic heteroaromatics is proposed, making use of not only the multi&#8208;resonance for narrowband emission but also the enhanced electronic coupling of para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atoms to narrow energy gaps. The corresponding emitters show narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminance and high efficiencies when assisted by a sensitizer with thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) organic emitters bearing small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) are of general interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICz) embedded MR&#8208;fluorophors have demonstrated extremely small FWHMs, yet in the violet region with low electroluminescence efficiency. Herein, a strategic implementation of ICz subunits into MR fluorophors is proposed by taking advantage of the synergetic effect of para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atoms to enhance electronic coupling to decrease emitting energy gap. Deep blue emitters peaking at 441 and 447&#8197;nm with FWHMs of only 18 and 21&#8197;nm are thereof obtained, respectively, accompanied by &#8776;90&#8201;% photo&#8208;luminance quantum yields. With the assistance of a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer to recycle excitons, the corresponding narrowband electroluminescent devices show unprecedent high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 32.0&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with CIEy of 0.10 and 0.085, respectively.

The crystal of Trypanosoma brucei cysteine protease cathepsin B (TbCatB), which is spontaneously produced in insect cells, is used to fabricate protein bundled filaments. The designed disulfide bonds between the monomers are formed by autoxidation in the isolated crystals.







Abstract
Protein assemblies can be designed for development of nano&#8211;bio materials. This has been achieved by modulating protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, fabrication of highly ordered protein assemblies remains challenging. Protein crystals, which have highly ordered arrangements of protein molecules, provide useful source matrices for synthesizing artificial protein assemblies. Here, we describe construction of a supramolecular filament structure by engineering covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions in a protein crystal. Performing in&#8208;cell crystallization of Trypanosoma brucei cysteine protease cathepsin&#8197;B (TbCatB), we achieved a precise arrangement of protein molecules while suppressing random aggregation due to disulfide bonds. We succeeded in synthesizing bundled filament from the crystals by autoxidation of cysteinyl thiols after the isolation of the crystals from living cells.

         <title>Conversion of Dinitrogen into Nitrile: Cross&#8208;Metathesis of N2&#8208;Derived Molybdenum Nitride with Alkynes</title>

The combination of N2 splitting on a Mo complex followed by nitrile&#8211;alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis results in the direct synthesis of nitrile from dinitrogen under mild conditions. This provides a new strategy for functionalizing N2&#8208;derived metal nitrido complexes.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of nitrile from N2 under mild conditions is of great importance and has attracted much interest. Herein, we report a direct conversion of N2 into nitrile via a nitrile&#8211;alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis (NACM) process involving a N2&#8208;derived Mo nitride. Treatment of the Mo nitride with alkyne in the presence of KOTf afforded an alkyne&#8208;coordinated nitride, which was then transformed into MoV carbyne and the corresponding nitrile upon 1&#8201;e&#8722; oxidation. Both aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes underwent this process smoothly. Experiments and DFT calculations have proved that the oxidation state of the Mo center plays a crucial role. This method does not rely on the nucleophilicity of the N2&#8208;derived metal nitride, offering a novel strategy for N2 fixation chemistry.

Micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with clear handedness are obtained through self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(methyl methacrylate) bearing azobenzene mesogen side chains, with the aid of enantiopure tartaric acid as chiral additive. The formation of spiral structures can be reversibly controlled by ultraviolet light and heat treatment.







Abstract
The spiral is a fundamental structure in nature and spiral structures with controllable handedness are of increasing interest in the design of new chiroptical materials. In this study, micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with reversible chirality were fabricated based on the assembly of a liquid crystalline block copolymer film assisted by enantiopure tartaric acid. Mechanistic insight revealed that the formation of the spiral structures was closely related to the liquid crystalline properties of the major phase of block copolymer under the action of chiral tartaric acid. The chiral spiral structures with controllable handedness were easily erased under ultraviolet light irradiation and restored via thermal annealing. This facile thermal treatment method provides guidance for fabrication of chiral micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with adjustable chiral properties.

         <title>Cascade Oxidative C&#8722;H Annulation of Thiophenes: Heck&#8208;Type Pathway Enables Concise Access to Thienoacenes</title>

A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade oxidative C&#8722;H annulation provides a rapid access to a new class of planar thienoacenes with superior stability. Heck&#8208;type pathway is firstly exemplified as a superior process enabling multiple C&#8722;H fusions of heteroaromatics for the synthesis of heteroacenes.







Abstract
The pursuit of efficient synthetic route to thienoacenes represents an appealing yet challenging task in the fields of both organic synthetic chemistry and organic functional materials. In this work, we disclose a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H annulation of phenacyl phosphoniums with (benzo)thiophenes via a Heck&#8208;type pathway to provide a new class of planar thienoacenes, which involves the formation of three Caryl&#8208;Caryl bonds and one Caryl&#8722;O bond in a single operation. The neutral S,O&#8208;heteroacenes exhibit superior stability and adopt a herringbone&#8208;like packing mode with efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the crystals, suggesting their potential in organic semiconducting materials. This work first exemplifies the superiority of cascade oxidative C&#8722;H annulation involving a Heck&#8208;type pathway in the development of concise access to heteroacenes.

         <title>Consecutive O&#8722;S/N&#8722;S Bond Cleavage in Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Rearrangement Reactions of Alkynyl N&#8208;Sulfinylimines</title>

The O&#8722;S and N&#8722;S bonds of alkynyl N&#8208;sulfinylimines were cleaved in gold&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement reactions to afford S&#8208;functionalized 2H&#8208;azirines in good to excellent yields (see scheme). The reactions proceed via a thiooxime intermediate directly bound to an &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbene moiety.







Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkynyl N&#8208;sulfinylimines were used to produce the corresponding 2H&#8208;azirines possessing sulfenyl and acyl groups at the 3&#8208;position of the azirine ring in good to excellent yields. These reactions involved internal transfer of the sulfinyl oxygen atom to form a thiooxime intermediate tethered to an &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbene moiety. Subsequent insertion of the carbene into the N&#8722;S bond resulted in ring construction.

A general titanium&#8208;catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides with boranes is reported. The system can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation process that prevails using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The current strategy worked for various alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Mechanistic studies reveal a possible radical reaction pathway.







Abstract
An unprecedented and general titanium&#8208;catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl&#8208;X, X=I, Br, Cl, OMs) with borane (HBpin, HBcat) is reported. The use of titanium catalyst can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation products that prevail using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. A series of synthetically useful alkyl boronate esters are readily obtained from various (primary, secondary, and tertiary) alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of other reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Preliminary studies on the mechanism revealed a possible radical reaction pathway. Further extension of our strategy to aryl bromides is also demonstrated.

         <title>Atomically Precise Engineering of Single&#8208;Molecule Stereoelectronic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12274-12278, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise control of the dihedral angle and the rotation processes of phenyl rings of a prototype terphenyl molecule can be achieved by introducing a photochromic molecule, azobenzene, as the side chain. The experimental and theoretical data demonstrate that the structure of the side chain can alter the twisted angle of adjacent phenyl rings, as well as the rotation barrier, because of the variable steric hindrance of the azobenzene group.







Abstract
Charge transport in a single&#8208;molecule junction is extraordinarily sensitive to both the internal electronic structure of a molecule and its microscopic environment. Two distinct conductance states of a prototype terphenyl molecule are observed, which correspond to the bistability of outer phenyl rings at each end. An azobenzene unit is intentionally introduced through atomically precise side&#8208;functionalization at the central ring of the terphenyl, which is reversibly isomerized between trans and cis forms by either electric or optical stimuli. Both experiment and theory demonstrate that the azobenzene side&#8208;group delicately modulates charge transport in the backbone via a single&#8208;molecule stereoelectronic effect. We reveal that the dihedral angle between the central and outer phenyl ring, as well as the corresponding rotation barrier, is subtly controlled by isomerization, while the behaviors of the phenyl ring away from the azobenzene are hardly affected.

&lt;p&gt;Precise control of the dihedral angle and the rotation processes of phenyl rings of a prototype terphenyl molecule can be achieved by introducing a photochromic molecule, azobenzene, as the side chain. The experimental and theoretical data demonstrate that the structure of the side chain can alter the twisted angle of adjacent phenyl rings, as well as the rotation barrier, because of the variable steric hindrance of the azobenzene group.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge transport in a single-molecule junction is extraordinarily sensitive to both the internal electronic structure of a molecule and its microscopic environment. Two distinct conductance states of a prototype terphenyl molecule are observed, which correspond to the bistability of outer phenyl rings at each end. An azobenzene unit is intentionally introduced through atomically precise side-functionalization at the central ring of the terphenyl, which is reversibly isomerized between &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; forms by either electric or optical stimuli. Both experiment and theory demonstrate that the azobenzene side-group delicately modulates charge transport in the backbone via a single-molecule stereoelectronic effect. We reveal that the dihedral angle between the central and outer phenyl ring, as well as the corresponding rotation barrier, is subtly controlled by isomerization, while the behaviors of the phenyl ring away from the azobenzene are hardly affected. This tunability offers a new route to precisely engineer multiconfigurational single-molecule memories, switches, and sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Compression&#8208;Driven Internanocluster Reaction for Synthesis of Unconventional Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12253-12257, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compression&#8208;driven internanocluster reaction in the solid state of Au25 was firstly demonstrated by introducing high pressure technology and a novel unconventional NC Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 was obtained. Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 NC consists of a bicuboid Au14 kernel and three pairs of interlocked trimetric staples, which has not been previously reported and endows it with enhanced photoluminescence.







Abstract
Can the active kernels in ultrasmall metal nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) react with one another, or can the internanocluster reaction occur when they are in close enough proximity? To resolve this fundamental issue, we investigated the solid&#8208;state internanocluster reaction of the most studied gold NC Au25(SR)18 (SR: thiolate). A novel NC was produced by increasing the pressure to 5&#8197;GPa, whose composition was determined to be Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 by mass spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis. As revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, the structure, a bicuboid Au14 kernel and three pairs of interlocked trimetric staples, has not been reported and endows the NC with obvious photoluminescence. DFT calculations indicate that the staples contribute substantially to the absorption properties. Further experiments reveal the pressure (internanocluster distance) can tune the internanocluster reaction, and the resulting product is not necessarily the thermodynamic product.

         <title>Deep Learning Accelerated Determination of Hydride Locations in Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12289-12292, May 25, 2021. </description>

Deep convolutional neural networks, trained on existing examples with known hydride locations from neutron diffraction, were able to accurately predict hydride locations given an X&#8208;ray structure of copper&#8208;hydride nanoclusters, thereby relieving the need of neutron diffraction.







Abstract
Although the coordinates of the metal atoms can be accurately determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, locations of hydrides in metal nanoclusters are challenging to determine. In principle, neutron crystallography can be employed to pinpoint the hydride positions, but it requires a large crystal and a neutron source, which prevents its routine use. Here, we present a deep&#8208;learning approach that can accelerate determination of hydride locations in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure of metal nanoclusters of different sizes. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in predicting the most probable hydride sites and their combinations to determine the total structure for two recently reported copper nanoclusters, [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3&#8722; and [Cu61(StBu)26S6Cl6H14]+ whose hydride locations have not been determined by neutron diffraction. Our method can be generalized and applied to other metal systems, thereby eliminating a bottleneck in atomically precise metal hydride nanochemistry.

         <title>Regulative Electronic States around Ruthenium/Ruthenium Disulphide Heterointerfaces for Efficient Water Splitting in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12328-12334, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting from the rearranged charge density around the abundant interface and the enhanced electronic states, in acidic media, the Ru/RuS2 heterostructure exhibits prominent catalytic activity toward oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, and consequent remarkably high overall water splitting performance, demonstrating promising application prospect for industrial proton exchange membrane&#8208;water electrolysis.







Abstract
Theoretical calculations unveil the charge redistribution over abundant interfaces and the enhanced electronic states of Ru/RuS2 heterostructure. The resulting surface electron&#8208;deficient Ru sites display optimized adsorption behavior toward diverse reaction intermediates, thereby reducing the thermodynamic energy barriers. Experimentally, for the first time the laminar Ru/RuS2 heterostructure is rationally engineered by virtue of the synchronous reduction and sulfurization under eutectic salt system. Impressively, it exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for both OER (201&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and HER (45&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in acidic media due to favorable kinetics and excellent specific activity, consequently leading to a terrific performance in acidic overall water splitting devices (1.501&#8197;V @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The in&#8208;depth insight into the internal activity origin of interfacial effect could offer precise guidance for the rational establishment of hybrid interfaces.

         <title>Integrating a Concentration Gradient Generator and a Single&#8208;Cell Trapper Array for High&#8208;Throughput Screening the Bioeffects of Nanomaterials</title>

An integrated microfluidic platform combining a concentration gradient generator (CGG) module with a single&#8208;cell trapper array (SCA) module has been designed for generating gradient concentrations of nanoparticles and evaluating the concentration&#8208;dependent bioeffects of nanoparticles on mammalian cells.







Abstract
We herein develop a concentration gradient generator (CGG) on a microfluidic chip for diluting different nanoparticles. Specifically designed compact disk (CD)&#8208;shaped microchannels in the CGG module could thoroughly mix the flowing solutions and generate a linear concentration gradient of nanoparticles without aggregation. We combine the CGG with a single&#8208;cell trapper array (SCA) on microfluidics to evaluate the concentration&#8208;dependent bioeffects of the nanoparticles. The precise control of the spatiotemporal generation of nanoparticle concentration on the CGG module and the single&#8208;cell&#8208;level monitoring of the cell behaviors on the SCA module by a high&#8208;content system in real time, render the CGG&#8208;SCA system a highly precise platform, which can exclude the average effect of cell population and reflect the response of individual cells to the gradient concentrations accurately. In addition, the CGG&#8208;SCA system provides an automated platform for high&#8208;throughput screening of nanomedicines with high precision and low sample consumption.

         <title>Phthalocyanine as a Bioinspired Model for Chlorophyll f&#8208;Containing Photosystem&#8197;II Drives Photosynthesis into the Far&#8208;Red Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12284-12288, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phthalocyanine chromophore absorbing in the far&#8208;red region with a tyrosine residue hydrogen bonded to an imidazole moiety provides the first example of a bioinspired model for the recent discovery that chlorophyll f&#8208;containing Photosystem II absorbing in the far&#8208;red limit at 727&#8197;nm can drive the four&#8208;electron water oxidation.







Abstract
The textbook explanation that P680 pigments are the red limit to drive oxygenic photosynthesis must be reconsidered by the recent discovery that chlorophyll f (Chlf)&#8208;containing Photosystem II (PSII) absorbing at 727&#8197;nm can drive water oxidation. Two different families of unsymmetrically substituted Zn phthalocyanines (Pc) absorbing in the 700&#8211;800&#8197;nm spectral window and containing a fused imidazole&#8208;phenyl substituent or a fused imidazole&#8208;hydroxyphenyl group have been synthetized and characterized as a bioinspired model of the Chlf/TyrosineZ/Histidine190 cofactors of PSII. Transient absorption studies in the presence of an electron acceptor and irradiating in the far&#8208;red region evidenced an intramolecular electron transfer process. Visible and FT&#8208;IR signatures indicate the formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded phenoxyl radical in ZnPc II&#8208;OH. This study sets the foundation for the utilization of a broader spectral window for multi&#8208;electronic catalytic processes with one of the most robust and efficient dyes.

A straightforward preparation of photochromic siloles based on the dithienylethene motif is developed. It relies upon an efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of a 2,3&#8208;bis(3&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;silirene with terminal alkynes in mild conditions. The reaction is functional group&#8208;tolerant and can be performed in high yields with a variety of functional terminal alkynes.

It can even be extended to a polymeric polypropargylmethacrylamide (PPMA) substrate affording the corresponding photochromic polymer with different degree of photochromic unit incorporation by simply adjusting the polymer/ silirene stoichiometric ratio.

         <title>Catalytic and Enantioselective Control of the C&#8211;N Stereogenic Axis via the Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12279-12283, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic and enantioselective control of the C&#8211;N stereogenic axis of heterocyclic scaffolds is reported. The asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction is achieved by employing a chiral phosphoric acid via dynamic kinetic resolution. Application to substituted benzaldehyde enables control of both axial and point chirality.







Abstract
An unprecedented example of a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of N&#8208;arylindoles is reported. Highly enantioenriched N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines with C&#8722;N bond axial chirality are obtained via dynamic kinetic resolution. The hydrogen bond donor introduced on the bottom aromatic ring, forming a secondary interaction with the phosphoryl oxygen, is essential to achieving high enantioselectivity. A wide variety of substituents are tolerable with this transformation to provide up to 98&#8201;% ee. The application of electron&#8208;withdrawing group&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes enables the control of both axial and point stereogenicity. Biological evaluation of this new and unique scaffold shows promising antiproliferative activity and emphasizes the significance of atroposelective synthesis.

Preliminary mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that both non&#8208;radical and radical pathways are possible for the reaction, and the radical pathway is more likely. The high &#947;&#8208;regioselectivity results from the &#946;&#8208;bromide elimination of alkylnickel(II) species or from the reductive elimination of nickel(III) species [(aryl)(CF2=CHCH2)NiIII(Ln)X].

         <title>Allenylidene Induced 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement of Indole&#8208;Boronates: Diastereoselective Access to Highly Substituted Indolines</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of electrophile, Cu&#8211;allenylidene has been introduced to induce 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Merger of Cu&#8208;catalyzed propargylation and 1,2&#8208;boronate shift has allowed access to densely functionalized chiral indolines with up to three contiguous stereogenic centres in highly diastereoselective fashion (&gt;20:1 dr). Utility of Bpin and alkyne moieties has been demonstrated by subsequent synthetic elaborations.







Abstract
A process to achieve 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangements of indole boronate as a way to access substituted indolines in high diastereoselectivities is presented. The reaction involves the generation of a Cu&#8211;allenylidene, which is sufficiently electrophilic to induce the 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. The scope of the reaction is evaluated as well as further transformations of the product.

Lectins that can be applied to specifically detect high mannose N&#8208;glycans on cell surfaces have been prepared by engineering the C&#8208;terminus of a naturally occurring cyanovirin&#8208;N homologue. The functionalized lectins can be utilized to aid type&#8197;I &#945; 1,2&#8208;mannosidase inhibitor discovery and development. The functionalized lectin is used to prepare kifunensine analogues that are &gt;75&#8208;fold more potent than kifunensine.







Abstract
An engineered cyanovirin&#8208;N homologue that exhibits specificity for high mannose N&#8208;glycans has been constructed to aid type&#8197;I &#945; 1,2&#8208;mannosidase inhibitor discovery and development. Engineering the lectins C&#8208;terminus permitted facile functionalization with fluorophores via a sortase and click strategy. The resulting lectin constructs exhibit specificity for cells presenting high mannose N&#8208;glycans. Importantly, these lectin constructs can also be applied to specifically assess changes in cell surface glycosylation induced by type&#8197;I mannosidase inhibitors. Testing the utility of these lectin constructs led to the discovery of type&#8197;I mannosidase inhibitors with nanomolar potency. Cumulatively, these findings reveal the specificity and utility of the functionalized cyanovirin&#8208;N homologue constructs, and highlight their potential in analytical contexts that require high mannose&#8208;specific lectins.

         <title>Organic Tetrabutylammonium Cation Intercalation to Heal Inorganic CsPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12351-12355, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite is well&#8208;known for its resistance to organic cation substitution. Here, a specific organic cation of tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) with strong ionic binding to the Pb&#8208;I octahedral framework can effectively intercalate into CsPbI3 and substitute the Cs+ cation. A post&#8208;synthesis TBAI passivation then leads to in situ formation of TBAPbI3 layer to heal CsPbI3 perovskite with lower defect density and enhanced stability.







Abstract
The in situ formation of reduced dimensional perovskite layer via post&#8208;synthesis ion exchange has been an effective way of passivating organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites. In contrast, cesium ions in Cs&#8208;based inorganic perovskite with strong ionic binding energy cannot exchange with those well&#8208;known organic cations to form reduced dimensional perovskite. Herein, we demonstrate that tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) cation can intercalate into CsPbI3 to effectively substitute the Cs cation and to form one&#8208;dimensional (1D) TBAPbI3 layer in the post&#8208;synthesis TBAI treatment. Such TBA cation intercalation leads to in situ formation of TBAPbI3 protective layer to heal defects at the surface of inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite. The TBAPbI3&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite exhibited enhanced stability and lower defect density, and the corresponding perovskite solar cell devices achieved an improved efficiency up to 18.32&#8201;% compared to 15.85&#8201;% of the control one.

         <title>Versatile Direct Cyclization Constructs Spiro&#8208;acridan Derivatives for Highly Efficient TADF emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12376-12380, May 25, 2021. </description>

A versatile direct cyclization is demonstrated to proceed by substituted diarylamines with various ketones under simple solvent&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions. It shows huge potential in preparing spiro&#8208;acridan derivatives and TADF emitters.







Abstract
Spiro&#8208;acridan (SpA) derivatives possess a great potential in preparing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters. However, the conventional synthetic routes are cost&#8208;expensive and time&#8208;consuming. The development of a simple procedure to synthesize SpAs is still in urgent pursuing appreciated by academic and industrial communities. In this contribution, we present a feasible acid&#8208;catalyzed solvent&#8208;free metal&#8208;free cyclization between diarylamines and ketones to construct SpAs. The as&#8208;constructed moieties provide a wide possibility to assemble efficient TADF emitters. As an example, D2T&#8208;TR with high photoluminescent quantum yield and proper TADF character is applied in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) which achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.1&#8201;%. This work shows us a bright inspiration on developing excellent organic optoelectronic materials and an effective tool to realize it.

         <title>Aptamer Switches Regulated by Post&#8208;Transition/Transition Metal Ions</title>

Structural transition metal ions: Post&#8208;transition/transition metal ions can induce, through their coordination to nucleobases, substantial DNA destabilization. We exploited such property for elaborating fluorescent aptamer probes that switch between inert, metal ion&#8208;complexed and active, target&#8208;bound states. This very simple structural switching strategy was applied to the homogeneous&#8208;phase detection of small organics using diversely structured aptamers.







Abstract
We introduced an aptamer switch design that relies on the ability of post&#8208;transition/transition metal ions to trigger, through their coordination to nucleobases, substantial DNA destabilization. In the absence of molecular target, the addition of one such metal ion to usual aptamer working solutions promotes the formation of an alternative, inert DNA state. Upon exposure to the cognate compound, the equilibrium is shifted towards the competent DNA form. The switching process was preferentially activated by metal ions of intermediate base over phosphate complexation preference (i.e. Pb2+, Cd2+) and operated with diversely structured DNA molecules. This very simple aptamer switch scheme was applied to the detection of small organics using the fluorescence anisotropy readout mode. We envision that the approach could be adapted to a variety of signalling methods that report on changes in the surface charge density of DNA receptors.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alstilobanine&#8197;C, (+)&#8208;Undulifoline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;Alpneumine&#8197;H</title>

(+)&#8208;Alstilobanine&#8197;C has been synthesized in 11 steps from prochiral 4&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)cyclohexan&#8208;1&#8208;one (A). It is subsequently converted into (+)&#8208;undulifoline and (&#8722;)&#8208;alpneumine&#8197;H via reductive N&#8208;methylation and diastereoselective N&#8208;oxidation of the tertiary amine.







Abstract
We report herein the enantioselective total synthesis of three monoterpene indole alkaloids, namely, (+)&#8208;alstilobanine&#8197;C, (+)&#8208;undulifoline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;alpneumine&#8197;H. The key features of our synthesis include: a) introduction of chirality via enantioselective deprotonation of a prochiral 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone; b) use of methoxymethyl (MOM) ether as both a hydroxyl protective group and a latent oxonium species for the formation of bridged oxepane and c) domino double reductive cyclization to build both the indole and the piperidine ring at the end of the synthesis. The synthesis confirmed the absolute configuration of these natural products assigned based on the biogenetic hypothesis.

The key features of our synthesis include: a) introduction of chirality via enantioselective deprotonation of a prochiral 4-substituted cyclohexanone; b) use of methoxymethyl (MOM) ether as both a hydroxyl protective group and a latent oxonium species for the formation of bridged oxepane and c) domino double reductive cyclization to build both the indole and the piperidine ring at the end of the synthesis. The synthesis confirmed the absolute configuration of these natural products assigned based on the biogenetic hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Turn&#8208;On Persistent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Purely Organic Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12335-12340, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of force&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on persistent RTP luminogen named Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F is reported. The abnormal stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP effect is attributed to the transition of molecular conformation from quasi&#8208;axial to quasi&#8208;equatorial of the phenothiazine group. This material was successfully applied in thermal printing and stylus printing.







Abstract
Research of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials has been a hot topic, especially for those with stimulus response character. Herein, an abnormal stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP effect is reported, in which, purely organic luminogen of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F shows turn&#8208;on persistent phosphorescence under grinding. Careful analyses of experimental results, coupled with the theoretical calculations, show that the transition of molecular conformation from quasi&#8208;axial to quasi&#8208;equatorial of the phenothiazine group should be mainly responsible for this exciting result. Furthermore, the applications of stylus printing and thermal printing are both successfully realized, based on the unique RTP effect of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F.

         <title>Potent Cyclic Tetrapeptide for Lead Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12381-12385, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic tetrapeptides were designed and screened for their ability to recover Pb&#8208;poisoned bacteria and human cells. Excellent potency was identified with two members, outcompeting the benchmark clinical chelating agents. The leading peptide was further characterized, revealing an outstanding metal affinity and selectivity, indicating its great potential as a next&#8208;generation treatment for Pb poisoning.







Abstract
Lead (Pb) is a ubiquitous poisonous metal, affecting the health of vast populations worldwide. Medications to treat Pb poisoning suffer from various limitations and are often toxic owing to insufficient metal selectivity. Here, we report a cyclic tetrapeptide that selectively binds Pb and eradicates its toxic effect on the cellular level, with superior potency than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art drugs. The Pb&#8208;peptide complex is remarkably strong and was characterized experimentally and computationally. Accompanied by the lack of toxicity and enhanced stability of this peptide, these qualities indicate its merit as a potential remedy for Pb poisoning.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Multicomponent Emissive Metallacages as Solid&#8208;State Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12293-12297, May 25, 2021. </description>

Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacages with high fluorescence quantum yield and good processability were prepared. These metallacages were further utilized as coatings of a blue light&#8208;emitting bulb to prepare white&#8208;light emitting diodes, demonstrating their applications as solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials.







Abstract
The construction of solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials with high quantum yield and good processability is of vital importance in the preparation of organic light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacages are prepared by the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridylphenyl)ethylene, cis&#8208;Pt(PEt3)2(OTf)2 and tetracarboxylic ligands. These metallacages exhibit good emission both in solution and in the solid state because the coordination bonds and aggregation restrict the molecular motions of TPE synergistically, which suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of these metallacages. Impressively, one of the metallacages achieves very high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F=88.46&#8201;%) in the solid state, which is further used as the coatings of a blue LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. The study not only provides a general method to the preparation of TPE&#8208;based metallacages but also explores their applications as solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials, which will promote the future design and applications of metallacages as useful emissive devices.

         <title>Fluorescent Membrane Tension Probes for Early Endosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12258-12263, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unidirectional penetration along minimalist pH gradients is developed as a strategy to label the membrane of early endosomes with mechanosensitive flipper probes, by simple addition to unmodified cells. Substituted benzylamines offer the right acidity, pKa=10, not too strong to allow reversibility, not too weak to inhibit penetration from neutral water in the cytosol, and, perhaps, extra returns from interfacial aromatic anchoring.







Abstract
Fluorescent flipper probes have been introduced recently to image membrane tension in live cells, and strategies to target these probes to specific membranes are emerging. In this context, early endosome (EE) targeting without the use of protein engineering is especially appealing because it translates into a fascinating transport problem. Weakly basic probes, commonly used to track the inside of acidic late endosomes and lysosomes, are poorly retained in EE because they are sufficiently neutralized in weakly acidic EE, thus able to diffuse out. Here, we disclose a rational strategy to target EE using a substituted benzylamine with a higher pKa value as a head group of the flipper probe. The resulting EE flippers are validated for preserved mechanosensitivity, ready for use in biology, particularly to elucidate the mechanics of endocytosis.

         <title>Arylene Diimide Phosphors: Aggregation Modulated Twin Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyromellitic Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12323-12327, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, stable in air, from the simplest class of arylene diimides, i.e., pyromellitic diimides, is achieved. Aggregation modulated, colour tuneable phosphorescence emission from cyan to orange&#8208;red in amorphous film and crystalline state is observed. The role of molecular design and weak intermolecular interactions in the observed properties is explained.







Abstract
Arylene diimide derived ambient organic phosphors are seldom reported despite their potential structural characteristics to facilitate the triplet harvesting. In this context, highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from simple, heavy&#8208;atom substituted pyromellitic diimide derivatives in amorphous matrix and crystalline state is reported here. Multiple intermolecular halogen bonding interactions among these phosphors, such as halogen&#8208;carbonyl and halogen&#8208;&#960; resulted in the modulation of phosphorescence, cyan emission from monomeric state and orange&#8208;red emission from its aggregated state, to yield twin RTP emission. Remarkably, the air&#8208;stable phosphorescence presented here own one of the highest quantum yield (&#8776;48&#8201;%) among various organics in orange&#8208;red emissive region.

NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;aryl succinimides having an axially chiral C&#8722;N bond via the desymmetrization of N&#8208;aryl maleimides is presented. The reaction proceeds via the Stetter&#8208;aldol cascade of dialdehydes with prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides followed by oxidation. Preliminary studies on the rotation barrier for the C&#8722;N bond and detailed DFT studies on the mechanism are also provided.







Abstract
Although the construction of axially chiral C&#8722;C bonds leading to the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls and allied compounds are well&#8208;known, the related synthesis of compounds bearing axially chiral C&#8722;N bonds are relatively rare. Described herein is the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;aryl succinimides having an axially chiral C&#8722;N bond via the desymmetrization of N&#8208;aryl maleimides. The NHC involved intermolecular Stetter&#8208;aldol cascade of dialdehydes with prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides followed by oxidation afforded N&#8208;aryl succinimides in good yields and ee values. Preliminary studies on rotation barrier for the C&#8722;N bond, the temperature dependence, and detailed DFT studies on mechanism are also provided.

         <title>Reversed Active Sites Boost the Intrinsic Activity of Graphene&#8208;like Cobalt Selenide for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12360-12365, May 25, 2021. </description>

Graphene&#8208;like Co0.85Se was doped with sulfur, bringing about a reversal in active sites for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from cationic cobalt sites to anionic sulfur sites. A consequent change in the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) of the active sites improved the overpotential of the HER.







Abstract
Optimizing the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) of active sites is essential to improve the overpotential of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We doped graphene&#8208;like Co0.85Se with sulfur and found that the active sites are reversed (from cationic Co sites to anionic S sites), which contributed to an enhancement in electrocatalytic HER performance. The optimal S&#8208;doped Co0.85Se composite has an overpotential of 108&#8197;mV (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a Tafel slope of 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, which exceeds other reported Co0.85Se&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The doped S sites have much higher activity than the Co sites, with a hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) close to zero (0.067&#8197;eV), which reduces the reaction barrier for hydrogen production. This work provides inspiration for optimizing the intrinsic HER activity of other related transition metal chalcogenides.

         <title>Generating Assembled MFI Nanocrystals with Reduced b&#8208;Axis through Structure&#8208;Directing Agent Exchange Induced Recrystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned plate&#8208;shaped MFI crystals with reduced b&#8208;axis thickness was synthesized through homogeneous nucleation followed by structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) exchange induced recrystallization, using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH). The obtained materials markedly exaggerated propene selectivity and showed prolonged catalyst lifetime in the conversion of dimethyl ether&#8208;to&#8208;olefins.







Abstract
Controlling crystal size and shape of zeolitic materials is an effective way to promote their mass transport and catalytic properties. Herein, we report a single step, Na+&#8208; and porogen&#8208; free crystallization of MFI hierarchical architecture made up of aligned nanocrystals with reduced b&#8208;axis thickness (5&#8211;23&#8197;nm) and adjustable Si/Al ratios between 35 to 120, employing the commonly used tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) as structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs). Homogeneous nucleation driven by both SDAs and subsequent SDA&#8208;exchange induced dissolution&#8208;recrystallization are responsible for the formation of such structure. The enhanced textural and diffusion properties account for a notable exaggeration of propene selectivity and catalyst lifetime in dimethyl ether&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (DTO) conversion. This protocol is extendable to the rational synthesis of other hierarchical zeolites through crystallization process control.

         <title>The Influence of a Changing Local Environment during Photoinduced CO2 Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though largely influencing the efficiency of a reaction, the molecular&#8208;scale details of the local environment of the reactants are experimentally inaccessible hindering an in&#8208;depth understanding of a catalyst&#8217;s reactivity, a prerequisite to maximizing its efficiency. We introduce a method to follow individual molecules and their largely changing environment during a photochemical reaction. The method is illustrated for a rate&#8208;limiting step in a photolytic reaction, the dissociation of CO  2  on two catalytically relevant surfaces, Ag(100) and Cu(111). We reveal with a single&#8208;molecule resolution how the reactant&#8217;s surroundings evolve with progressing laser illumination and with it their propensity for dissociation. Counteracting processes lead to a volcano&#8208;like reactivity. Our unprecedented local view during a photoinduced reaction opens the avenue for understanding the influence of the products on reaction yields on the nanoscale.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Despite lipid&#8208;nanodiscs are increasingly used in the structural studies of membrane proteins, drug delivery and other applications, the interaction between the nanodisc&#8208;belt and the protein to be reconstituted is a major limitation. To overcome this limitation and to further broaden the scope of nanodiscs, a family of non&#8208;ionic amphiphilic polymers synthesized by hydrophobic functionalization of fructo&#8208;oligosaccharides/inulin is reported. We show the stability of lipid&#8208;nanodiscs formed by these polymers against pH and divalent metal ions, and their magnetic&#8208;alignment properties. The reported results also demonstrate that the non&#8208;ionic polymers extract membrane proteins with unprecedented efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of the Arene&#8208;Limited Nondirected C&#8211;H Activation of Arenes with Palladium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently palladium catalysts have been discovered that enable the directing group&#8208;free C&#8211;H activation of arenes without requiring an excess of the arene substrate, thereby enabling methods for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex organic molecules. The key to success has been the use of two complementary ligands, an N&#8208;acyl amino acid and an N&#8208;heterocycle. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies on the dual ligand&#8208;enabled C&#8211;H activation of arenes have led us to identify the catalytically active species and a transition state model that explains the exceptional activity and selectivity of these catalysts. These findings are expected to be highly useful for further method development using this powerful class of catalysts.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently palladium catalysts have been discovered that enable the directing group-free C&#8211;H activation of arenes without requiring an excess of the arene substrate, thereby enabling methods for the late-stage modification of complex organic molecules. The key to success has been the use of two complementary ligands, an N-acyl amino acid and an N-heterocycle. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies on the dual ligand-enabled C&#8211;H activation of arenes have led us to identify the catalytically active species and a transition state model that explains the exceptional activity and selectivity of these catalysts.

         <title>Kirkendall Effect Boosts Phosphorylated nZVI for Efficient Heavy Metal Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removal of non&#8208;biodegradable heavy metals has been the top priority in wastewater treatment; the development of green technologies remains a significant challenge. Here we show the phosphorylated nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) is promising for heavy metals (Ni(II), Cu(II), Cr(VI), Hg(II)) removal via boosted Kirkendall effect. Phosphorylation confines tensile hoop stress on the nZVI particles and "breaks" the structurally&#8208;dense spherical nZVI to produce numerous radial nanocracks. Exemplified by Ni(II) removal, the radial nanocracks favor the facile inward diffusion of Ni(II) and the rapid outward transport of electrons and ferrous ions through the oxide shell for surface (Ni(II)/electron) and boundary (Ni(II)/Fe0) galvanic exchange. Accompanied by a pronounced hollow&#8208;out phenomenon, phosphorylated nZVI can instantly reduce and immobilize Ni(II) throughout the inherent oxide shell with a high capacity (258 mg Ni/g Fe). For real electroplating factory wastewater treatment, this novel nZVI performs simultaneous Ni(II) and Cu(II) removal, producing effluent of stable quality that meets local discharge regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Generation of Carbanions through Carbonyl Umpolung</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonyl Umpolung is a powerful strategy in organic chemistry to construct complex molecules. Over the last years, versatile catalytic approaches for the generation of acyl anion equivalents from carbonyls have been developed, but methods to obtain alkyl carbanions from carbonyls in a catalytic fashions are still at an early stage. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the generation of alkyl carbanions through catalytic carbonyl Umpolung. Two different catalytic approaches can be utilized to enable alkyl carbanion generation from carbonyl compounds: the catalytic Wolff Kishner reaction and the catalytic single&#8208;electron reduction of carbonyls and imines. We discuss the reaction scope, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications of the methods as well as potential future developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of a Luminophore into Generic Polymers via Mechanoradical Coupling with a Prefluorescent Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a novel strategy for introducing a luminophore into generic polymers facilitated by mechanical stimulation. In this study, polymeric mechanoradicals were formed  in situ  under ball&#8208;milling conditions to undergo radical&#8211;radical coupling with a prefluorescent nitroxide&#8208;based reagent in order to incorporate a luminophore into the polymer main chains via a covalent bond. This method allowed the direct and conceptually simple preparation of luminescent polymeric materials from a wide range of generic polymers such as polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene. These results indicate that the present mechanoradical coupling strategy may help to transform existing commodity polymers into more valuable functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroaromatic Hyperbranched Polyelectrolytes: Multicomponent Polyannulation and Photodynamic Biopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of facile methods for the synthesis of functional hyperbranched polyelectrolytes plays a pivotal role for biomimicry and the creation of new materials. In this study, we reported an efficient multicomponent polyannulation for  in situ  generation of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes by using readily accessible internal diynes and low&#8208;cost, commercially available arylnitriles, NaSbF  6  , and H  2  O/AcOH. The polymers were obtained in excellent yields (up to 99%) with extraordinary high molecular weights (Mw up to 1.011 &#215; 10^6  &#160;  ) and low polydispersity indices. The resulting polymers showed good processibility and high quantum yields with tunable emission in the solid state, making them as ideal materials for highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning. These hyperbranched polyelectrolytes also possessed strong ability to generate reactive oxygen species, which allowed their applications in efficient bacterial killing and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms in a simple and cost&#8208;effective way. In view of the unique properties and functionalities, these hyperbranched polyelectrolytes hold great promise to be used in a plethora of follow&#8208;up studies, such as photoelectronic materials, disease theranostics, biochips, and tissue engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Crystallization Induced Emission Probes to Detect Amorphous Protein Aggregation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike amyloid, amorphous protein aggregation of no defined structures has been challenging to target and detect in complex cellular milieu. Herein, we rationally designed amorphous protein aggregation sensors from aggregation induced emission probes (AIEgens). Utilizing dicyanoisophorone as a model AIEgen scaffold, we first sensitized the fluorescence of AIEgens to non&#8208;polar and viscous environment mimicking the interior of amorphous aggregated proteins. We identified a generally applicable moiety (dimethylaminophenylene) for selective binding and fluorescence enhancement. Regulation of the electron withdrawing groups tunes the emission wavelength while retaining selective detection. Finally, we utilized the optimized probe to systematically image aggregated proteome upon proteostasis network regulations. Overall, we present a rational approach to develop amorphous protein aggregation sensors from AIEgens with controllable sensitivity, spectral coverage, and cellular performance.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA framework&#8208;engineered long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions for DNA hybridization reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions beyond biomolecular interaction interfaces have not been extensively studied due to the limitation in engineering electric double layers in physiological fluids. Here we find that long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions play an essential role in kinetic modulation of DNA hybridizations. Protein and gold nanoparticles with different charges are encapsulated in tetrahedral frameworks to exert diverse electrostatic effects on site&#8208;specifically tethered single DNA strands. Using this strategy, we have successfully modulated the hybridization kinetics in both bulk solution and single molecule level. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions are the key factor for hybridization rates. This work validates the important role of long&#8208;range electrostatic forces in nucleic acid&#8208;biomacromolecule complexes, which may encourage new strategies of gene regulation, antisense therapy, and nucleic acid detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Nocathioamides, uncovered by a Tunable Metabologenomic Approach, define a Novel Class of Chimeric Lanthipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing number of available genomes, in combination with advanced genome mining techniques, unveiled a plethora of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) coding for ribosomal synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). The products of these BGCs often represent an enormous resource for new and bioactive compounds, but frequently, they cannot be readily isolated and remain cryptic. Here, we describe a tunable metabologenomic approach that recruits a synergism of bioinformatics in tandem with isotope&#8208; and NMR&#8208;guided platform to identify the product of an orphan RiPP gene cluster in the genomes of Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 and 0706T. The application of this tactic resulted in the discovery of nocathioamides family as a founder of a new class of chimeric lanthipeptides I.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells Based on Copper(II/I) Redox Mediators Bearing a Pentadentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, copper redox mediators have attracted growing interest in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs), exhibiting high photovoltage of over 1.0 V and outstanding performance under ambient lighting. However, emerging experimental evidence reveals that the ubiquitously used Lewis base additives in the electrolytes, such as 4&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylpyridine (TBP), coordinate to the Cu(II) species, which restricts further enhancement of device performance and stability for these electrolytes. Here, we report for the first time the application of copper complexes endowed with diamine&#8208;tripyridine pentadentate ligands, namely [Cu(tpe)]  2+/+  (tpe =  N  &#8208;benzyl&#8208;  N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;  &#8208;tris(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine) and [Cu(tme)]  2+/+  (tme =  N  &#8208;benzyl&#8208;  N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;  &#8208;tris(6&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine), as redox mediators in DSCs. Cyclic voltammetry, absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies demonstrate that the coordination environment of copper(II) complexes with pentadentate ligands remains unchanged in the presence of TBP, which is in stark contrast to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bipyridyl counterpart. Strikingly, DSCs based on [Cu(tme)]  2+/+  complexes exhibit an excellent long&#8208;term stability and maintain more than 90% of the initial efficiency after 400 h under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices incorporating the bipyridyl counterpart (less than 80%) under identical conditions. The present work thus provides a guidance for future design of stable copper redox mediators in DSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Current Status of MOF and COF Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amalgamation of different disciplines is at the heart of reticular chemistry and has broadened the boundaries of chemistry by opening up an infinite space of chemical composition, structure, and material properties. Reticular design has enabled the precise prediction of crystalline framework structures, tunability of chemical composition, incorporation of various functionalities onto the framework backbone, and as a consequence, fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF) properties beyond that of any other material class. Leveraging the unique properties of reticular materials has resulted in significant advances from both a fundamental and an applied perspective. Here, we wish to review the milestones in MOF and COF research and give a critical view on progress in their real&#8208;world applications. Finally, we briefly discuss the major challenges in the field that need to be addressed to pave the way for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Microenvironment Modulation Boosting Electron Transfer between Metal Nanoparticles and MOFs for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial electron transfer between cocatalyst and photosensitizer plays a key role in heterogeneous photocatalysis, yet the underlying mechanism remains subtle and unclear. Particularly, the surfactant coated on the metal cocatalysts, greatly modulating the microenvironment of catalytic sites, is largely ignored. Herein, a series of Pt co&#8208;catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as Pt  PVP  ), Pt with partially removed PVP (Pt  rPVP  ), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), have been encapsulated into a representative metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , to afford Pt  PVP  @UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , Pt  rPVP  @UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , and Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , respectively, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Systemic investigations suggest that the PVP presents a negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF. Compared with Pt  PVP  @UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , the removal of interfacial PVP effectively improves the sluggish kinetics of electron transfer, accordingly boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Strategy for CO2 Valorization Integrated with Organic Synthesis by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox&#8208;catalyzed win&#8211;win coupling strategy, in which CO2 valorization is integrated with organic synthesis in one reaction system, provides a promising approach that enables sufficient utilization of excited electrons and holes to achieve feasible and sustainable light&#8208;mediated artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to solar fuels and/or fine chemicals is a promising way to increase the energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the conventional reaction system for CO2 photoreduction with pure H2O or sacrificial agents usually suffers from low catalytic efficiency, poor stability, or cost&#8208;ineffective atom economy. A recent surge of developments, in which photocatalytic CO2 valorization is integrated with selective organic synthesis into one reaction system, indicates an efficient modus operandi that enables sufficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes to achieve the goals for sustainable economic and social development. In this Review we discuss current advances in cooperative photoredox reaction systems that integrate CO2 valorization with organics upgrading based on heterogeneous photocatalysis. The applications and virtues of this strategy and the underlying reaction mechanisms are discussed. The ongoing challenges and prospects in this area are critically discussed.

         <title>Photochemical Probe Identification of a Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitor Binding Site in Hedgehog Acyltransferase (HHAT)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;activity relationship analysis of Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT) inhibitors allowed rational design of photochemical probes for HHAT. Probe photocrosslinking identified the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitor binding site in HHAT and revealed the inhibitory mechanism, providing an optimal HHAT tool inhibitor IMP&#8208;1575 (Ki=38&#8197;nM) for future studies.







Abstract
The mammalian membrane&#8208;bound O&#8208;acyltransferase (MBOAT) superfamily is involved in biological processes including growth, development and appetite sensing. MBOATs are attractive drug targets in cancer and obesity; however, information on the binding site and molecular mechanisms underlying small&#8208;molecule inhibition is elusive. This study reports rational development of a photochemical probe to interrogate a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor binding site in the human MBOAT Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT). Structure&#8208;activity relationship investigation identified single enantiomer IMP&#8208;1575, the most potent HHAT inhibitor reported to&#8208;date, and guided design of photocrosslinking probes that maintained HHAT&#8208;inhibitory potency. Photocrosslinking and proteomic sequencing of HHAT delivered identification of the first small&#8208;molecule binding site in a mammalian MBOAT. Topology and homology data suggested a potential mechanism for HHAT inhibition which was confirmed by kinetic analysis. Our results provide an optimal HHAT tool inhibitor IMP&#8208;1575 (Ki=38&#8197;nM) and a strategy for mapping small molecule interaction sites in MBOATs.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of a Structurally Dynamic Antibacterial Diterpenoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the isolation of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold. The absolute configurations and antibacterial activities of benditerpenoic acid and the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene core were established.







Abstract
A new bicyclic diterpenoid, benditerpenoic acid, was isolated from soil&#8208;dwelling Streptomyces sp. (CL12&#8208;4). We sequenced the bacterial genome, identified the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster, verified the function of the terpene synthase, and heterologously produced the core diterpene.

&lt;p&gt;We report the isolation of an eunicellane-type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold. The absolute configurations and antibacterial activities of benditerpenoic acid and the benditerpe-2,6,15-triene core were established.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new bicyclic diterpenoid, benditerpenoic acid, was isolated from soil-dwelling &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. (CL12-4). We sequenced the bacterial genome, identified the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster, verified the function of the terpene synthase, and heterologously produced the core diterpene. Comparative bioinformatics indicated this &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; strain is phylogenetically unique and possesses nine terpene synthases. The absolute configurations of the new &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-fused bicyclo[8.4.0]tetradecanes were achieved by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including Mosher's analysis, &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-based coupling analysis, and computations based on sparse NMR-derived experimental restraints. Interestingly, benditerpenoic acid exists in two distinct ring-flipped bicyclic conformations with a rotational barrier of &#8776;16&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in solution. The diterpenes exhibit moderate antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin and multi-drug resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. This is a rare example of an eunicellane-type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Coating the Right Polymer: Achieving Ideal Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Particle Dispersibility in Polymer Matrixes Using a Coordinative Crosslinking Surface Modification Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new general method for the coating of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surfaces with a uniform layer of polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, or polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#8208;1 (PIM&#8208;1) is reported. By matching the surface polymer with the matrix polymer, ideal dispersibility of MOF particles in various polymer matrices can thus be achieved.







Abstract
This work describes the first generalizable method to modify various metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surfaces with polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, and polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#8208;1 (PIM&#8208;1). The method first utilizes electrostatic adsorption to rapidly decorate positively charged MOF surfaces with a layer of negatively charged metal&#8208;organic nanocapsule, PgC5Cu. After mixing with the polymer, the copper open metal sites on PgC5Cu can coordinatively crosslink the polar functional groups on the surface polymer upon thermal activation thereby resulting in the immobilization of a uniform sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm polymer coating. We quantitatively analyzed the distribution of free path spacing between MOF particles and demonstrated that when the surface polymer matches the matrix polymer, the MOF dispersion was not only visually improved but also found to align perfectly with a theoretically predicted ideal dispersion model where no aggregation driving force was present.

         <title>Spatial Confinement Tunes Cleavage and Re&#8208;Formation of C=N Bonds in Fluorescent Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial confinement dramatically changes the pathway and energy profile of chemical reactions. Confinement effect promoted increased local concentration and reduced steric hindrance of reactive groups, which realized the reversible conversion of molecular fluorescence. This fluorescence switching system has potential applications in information encryption and multi&#8208;informational display.







Abstract
Molecules in confined spaces exhibit unusual behaviors that are not typically observed in bulk systems. Such behavior can provide alternative strategies for exploring new reaction pathways. Cleavage of the C=N bond of Nile red (NR) in solution is an irreversible reaction. Here, we used spatial confinement within a cationic micelle&#8208;confined system to convert this reaction to a reversible process. The fluorescence of NR shifted between red and green for nine cycles. The new chemical pathway based on spatial confinement can be attributed to two factors: increasing the local concentration of reactants and reducing the reaction energy barrier. This effect is supported by both experimental evidence and theoretical calculations. The cross&#8208;linked silica shell comprising the confinement chamber stabilizes the enclosed molecules. This reduces fluorophore leakage and maintains fluorescence intensity in most environments, including in solution, on paper, and in hydrogel films, and expands practical applications in encrypted information and multi&#8208;informational displays.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Palladium(II) Barrel for Binding of Fullerenes and Photosensitization Ability of the Fullerene&#8208;Encapsulated Barrel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;based tetra&#8208;imidazole ligand and a PdII acceptor were employed to construct a trifacial molecular barrel (1), which acts as an efficient host for fullerenes. The barrel has better binding affinity towards C70 over C60 and predominantly encapsulates C70 from a mixture of C60/C70. In the presence of visible light, C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 show efficient photosensitizing ability for 1O2 generation.







Abstract
Fullerene extracts obtained from fullerene soot lack their real application due to their poor solubility in common solvents and difficulty in purification. Encapsulation of these extracts in a suitable host is an important approach to address these issues. We present a new Pd6 barrel (1), which is composed of three 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole panels, clipped through six cis&#8208;PdII acceptors. Large open windows and cavity make it an efficient host for a large guest. Favorable interactions between the ligand and fullerene (C60 and C70) allows the barrel to encapsulate fullerene efficiently. Thorough investigation reveals that barrel 1 has a stronger binding affinity towards C70 over C60, resulting in the predominant extraction of C70 from a mixture of the two. Finally, the fullerene encapsulated barrels C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 were found to be efficient for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced singlet oxygen generation. Such preferential binding of C70 and photosensitizing ability of C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 are noteworthy.

         <title>Merging Electron Transfer with 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement: Deoxygenative Arylation of Inert Amides with Arylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amides are essentially inert carboxyl derivatives in many types of chemical transformations. In particular, deoxygenative C&#8208;C bond formation of amides to synthetically important amines is a long&#8208;standing challenge for synthetic chemists due to the inertness of the resonance&#8208;stabilized amide C=O bond. Herein, it is disclosed that by merging electron transfer induced activation with 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement, a wide range of inert amides react smoothly with arylboron regents, affording a series of biologically relevant diarylmethylamines as deoxygenative C&#8208;C bond cross coupling products. With its simplicity and versatility, it shows great promise in synthesis of amines from amides, which may open up new avenues in retrosynthetic planning and find widespread use in academia and industry.</dc:description>
