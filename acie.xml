      <title>Pb18O8Cl15I5: A Polar Lead Mixed Oxyhalide with Unprecedented Architecture and Excellent Infrared Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>To develop high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for infrared (IR) applications, we have applied a rational element&#8208;composition design strategy and investigated the unexplored PbO&#8211;PbCl 2  &#8211;PbI 2  system. By doing so, a new polar lead mixed oxyhalide, Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  , representing the first synthetic metal oxyhalide combining both Cl &#8211;  and I &#8211;  was discovered. Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  reveals an unprecedented structural feature with two different dimensional types of oxocentered Pb&#8211;O units, namely, [O 4  Pb 8  ] 8+  clusters and [OPb 2  ] 2+  chains. Centimeter&#8208;sized single crystals of Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  have been successfully grown in ambient condition. Remarkably, Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  satisfies all fundermental yet rigorous cretiria for high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials, exhibiting the widest IR transparency (up to 16.0 &#956;m) among oxide&#8208;based crystals, strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.05 &#215; AgGaS 2  ), superior birefringence (0.086 at 636 nm), and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (8.5 &#215; AgGaS 2  ).</dc:description>

      <title>Photoredox Catalysis Unlocks the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyanation of Aryl Halides under Benign Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyanations of aryl halides are among the most used methods for synthesizing aryl nitriles. Despite tremendous advances, cyanating an aryl halide in a facile and benign fashion has generally been unsuccessful. The challenge for this significant transformation is the strong affinity of cyanide for metal centers, which makes organometallic catalysis elusive by hampering oxidative addition and reductive elimination. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyanations of aryl halides are readily enabled by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis, in which Ni(II) species are transiently oxidized to Ni(III) species, thereby facilitating the subsequent cyanide transfer and reductive elimination. Using this dual catalysis strategy, we cyanated aryl and alkenyl halides at room temperature in a highly benign manner (30 examples, 53&#8208;93% yields) by avoiding the use of air&#8208;sensitive ligands, Ni(0) processors, and hypertoxic cyanation reagents, while also not generating excess metal waste. Computational studies were also used to help understand the present transformation.</dc:description>

      <title>Aminopotassiation by Mixed K/Li Amides: A Synthetic Path to Difficult to Access Phenethylamine Derivates</title>
      <dc:description>Insights gained from a comparison of aminometalation reactions with lithium amides, potassium amides and mixed lithium/potassium amides are presented. A combination of structural characterization, DFT calculations and electrophile reactions of aminometalated intermediates has shown the advantages of using a mixed metal strategy. While potassium amides fail to add, the lithium amides are uncontrollable and eliminated, yet the mixed K/Li amides deliver the best of both.

      <title>Alternative Oxidants for the Catalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons with oxygen (O  2  &#8208;OCM) has garnered renewed worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of enormous new shale gas resources. However, the C2 selectivity of typical OCM processes is significantly challenged by overoxidation to CO  x  products. Other gaseous reagents such as N  2  O, CO  2  , and S  2  have been investigated to a far lesser extent as alternative, milder oxidants to replace O  2  . Although several authoritative review articles have summarized OCM research progress in depth, recent oxidative coupling developments using alternative oxidants (X&#8208;OCM) have not been overviewed in detail. In this perspective, we review and analyze OCM research results reporting the implementation of N  2  O, CO  2  , S  2  , and other non&#8208;O  2  oxidants, highlighting the unique chemistries of these systems and their advantages/challenges compared to O  2  &#8208;OCM.

      <title>A New Mechanically&#8208;Interlocked [Pd2L4] Cage Motif by Dimerization of two Peptide&#8208;based Lemniscates</title>
      <dc:description>Most metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies of low nuclearity adopt simple topologies, with bridging ligands spanning neighboring metal centers in a direct fashion. Here we contribute a new structural motif to the family of host compounds with low metal count (two) that consists of a pair of doubly&#8208;interlocked, figure&#8208;eight&#8208;shaped subunits, also termed &#8220;lemniscates&#8221;. Each metal is chelated by two chiral bidentate ligands, composed of a peptidic macrocycle that resembles a natural product with two pyridyl&#8208;terminated arms. DFT calculation results suggest that dimerization of the mononuclear halves is driven by a combination of 1) Coulomb interaction with a central anion, 2) &#960;&#8208;stacking between intertwined ligand arms and 3) dispersive interactions between the structure&#8217;s compact inner core bedded into an outer shell composed of the cavitand&#8208;type macrocycles. The resulting cage&#8208;like architecture was characterized by NMR, MS and X&#8208;ray structure analyses.

      <dc:description>MOFs have highly ordered self&#8208;assembled nanostructure, high&#8208;surface area, nano porosity with tunable size and shape, reliable host&#8211;guest interaction and responsiveness to physical and chemical stimulus which can be exploited to address the critical issues in sensor application. On one hand, the nanoscale pore size of MOFs ranging from &lt;1 nm to ~10 nm not only allows the diffusion of minor sized molecules into the pore or through the MOF layer, but also excludes other molecules with larger size according to size, shape and conformation of MOFs. On the other hand, MOFs with flexible structure exhibit dynamical response to external stimulus, including guest molecules, temperature, pressure, PH or light. Due to the unsaturated coordination metal sites and active functional groups, the interaction between certain analyte and active site results in the high selectivity. In the review, we summarize the latest studies on MOF&#8208;based electronic sensors in term of the function of MOFs and suggest its perspective and challenges.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Chirality transfer is widely observed in life processes, and many artificial chiral transfer systems have been developed. In these systems, chiral information is transferred from chiral inducers to chiral acceptors by a direct chiral induction process and a direct chiral memorization process.

      <title>Trapping Transient RNA Complexes by Chemically Reversible Acylation</title>
      <dc:description>RNA&#8208;RNA interactions are essential for biology, yet they can be difficult to study due to their transient nature. While crosslinking strategies can in principle be used to trap such interactions, virtually all existing strategies for crosslinking are poorly reversible, chemically modifying the RNA and hindering molecular analysis. Here, we describe a soluble crosslinker design (BINARI) that reacts with RNA via acylation. We find that it efficiently crosslinks noncovalent RNA complexes with miminal sequence bias and establish that the crosslink can be reversed by phosphine reduction of azide trigger groups, liberating the individual RNA components for further analysis. Use of the new approach is demonstrated by reversible protection against nuclease degradation and by trapping transient RNA complexes of E. coli DsrA&#8208;rpoS derived bulge&#8208;loop interactions, which underlines the potential of BINARI crosslinkers to probe RNA regulatory networks.</dc:description>

      <title>Achieving Ultrahigh Molecular Weights with Diverse Architectures for Unconjugated Monomers through Oxygen&#8208;tolerant Photoenzymatic RAFT Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Achieving well&#8208;defined polymers with ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) is an enduring pursuit in the field of reversible deactivation radical polymerization. Synthetic protocols have been successfully developed to achieve UHMWs with low dispersities exclusively from conjugated monomers while no polymerization of unconjugated monomers has provided the same level of control.

      <title>Selective Hydroperoxygenation of Olefin Realized by Coinage Multimetallic 1&#8208;nanometer Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The science of particles on a sub&#8208;nanometer (~ 1 nm) scale has attracted worldwide attention. However, this field of science has remained unexplored because of the technical difficulty in the precise synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoparticles (SNPs). Thus, we recently developed the &#8216;atom&#8208;hybridization method (AHM)&#8217; that precisely synthesizes the SNPs by using a suitably&#8208;designed macromolecule as a template. In this study, toward revealing this unexplored field, we newly investigated the chemical reactivity of alloy SNPs obtained by the AHM. Focusing on the coinage metal elements, the oxidation reaction of an olefin catalyzed by these SNPs was systematically evaluated. The SNPs showed a high catalytic performance even under the milder condition in contrast to conventional catalysts. Additionally, the hybridization of multiple elements enhanced the turnover frequency and the selectivity of the hydroperoxide derivative. We discuss the unique quantum&#8208;sized catalysts providing generally unstable hydroperoxides from the viewpoint of miniaturization and hybridization of the materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrafast Semi&#8208;Solid Processing of Highly Durable ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
      <dc:description>ZIF&#8208;8 membrane has emerged as the most promising candidate for propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) separation due to its precise molecular sieving characteristics. The poor reproducibility and durability, high cost, thus far pose challenges on the scalable synthesis and industrial application of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. Herein, we report a semi&#8208;solid process featured with ultrafast and high&#8208;yield synthesis, and outstanding scalability for reproducible fabrication of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. The resultant membranes exhibit excellent C3H6/C3H8 separation performance in a wide range of temperature and pressure, and remarkable stability over a span of 6 months. The new ZIF&#8208;8 membrane features dimethylacetamide entrapped ZIF&#8208;8 crystals retainning same diffusion charactristics but offering enhanced adsorptive selectivity for C3H6/C3H8. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane was successfully fabricated on commercial flat&#8208;sheet ceramic substrate. A prototypical plate&#8208;and&#8208;frame membrane module with effective membrane area of about 300 cm2  was implemented for efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation. Overall, the reliable reproducibility and durability as well as scalability of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have greatly unlocked its commercialization potential.</dc:description>

Herein, we succeeded in controlling rotational isomerism of &#956;&#8208;oxo silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc) oligomers to achieve an external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive orientational ordering using intermolecular interactions of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF). In this system, three modes of orientations, free rotation, eclipsed conformation, and staggered conformation, were interconverted in response to the oxidation states of TTF, which varied interactions from association due to formation of mixed&#8208;valence TTF dimer to dissociation due to electrostatic repulsion between TTF dications. Furthermore, a stable performance of oligomers as a cathode material in a Li&#8208;ion battery proved that the one&#8208;dimensionally stacked, rotatable structure of SiPc oligomers is useful to control the orientation of functional molecules toward molecular electronics.</dc:description>

      <title>Overcoming Fundamental Limitations in Adsorbent Design: Alkene Adsorption by Non&#8208;porous Copper(I) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Purifying alkenes from alkanes requires cryogenic distillation. At global scale, this consumes energy equivalent to countries of ca. 5 million people. Replacing distillation with adsorption processes would significantly increase energy efficiency. Trade&#8208;offs between kinetics, selectivity, capacity, and heat of adsorption have prevented production of an optimal adsorbent. We report adsorbents that overcome these trade&#8208;offs.  [Cu&#8208;Br]  3  and  [Cu&#8208;H]  3  are air&#8208;stable trinuclear complexes that undergo reversible solid&#8208;state inter&#8208;molecular rearrangements to produce dinuclear  [Cu&#8208;Br&#8226;(alkene)]  2  and  [Cu&#8208;H&#8226;(alkene)]  2  . The reversible solid&#8208;state rearrangement, confirmed  in&#8208;situ  using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, allows adsorbent design trade&#8208;offs to be overcome, coupling low heat of adsorption (&#8208;10 to &#8208;17 kJ&#183;mol  &#8208;1  alkene  ), high alkene:alkane selectivity (47; 29), and uptake capacity (&gt;2.5 mol  alkene  &#183;mol  &#8208;1  Cu3  ).

      <title>Sub&#8208;10 nm Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Quantum Dots Assembled by Microfluidics for Enhanced Tumor&#8208;Targeting and Reduced Retention in the Liver</title>
      <dc:description>A robust platform is developed to assemble sub&#8208;10 nm organic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) particles using four different AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with emissions from green to the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II).

Compared with AIE dots that are larger than 25 nm, AIE QDs allow more efficient cellular uptake and imaging without surface modification of any membrane&#8208;penetrating peptides or other targeting molecules. NIR&#8208;II AIEgens, which have nearly no background fluorescence from organisms, are used to demonstrate that AIE QDs can achieve high contrast at the tumor as small as 80 mm  3  , and evade the liver more efficiently than AIE dots. AIE QDs hold a good promise for sensitive and precise diagnosis of the latent solid tumor in clinical medicine with much lower off&#8208;targeting to the liver than AIE dots.</dc:description>

Here, we investigate the NIR to UV and visible emission of sub&#8208;15 nm alkaline&#8208;earth rare&#8208;earth fluoride UCNPs (M  1&#8208;x  Ln  x  F  2+x,  MLnF) with a CaF  2  shell.

We explore UCNP composition, size, and lanthanide doping dependent emission, focusing on upconversion quantum yield (UCQY) and UV emission. UCQY values of 2.46% at 250 W/cm  2  are achieved with 14.5 nm SrLuF@CaF  2  particles, with 7.3% of total emission in the UV. In 10.9 nm SrYbF:1%Tm  3+  @CaF  2  particles, UV emission increased to 9.9% with UCQY at 1.14%.

      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the search for practical next&#8208;generation deep&#8208;UV NLO crystals are reviewed.

Abstract
Advances in the generation of coherent lasers at wavelengths below 200&#8197;nm as well as the associated equipment and technologies have greatly spurred the development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that are capable of phase&#8208;matching in the deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) spectral regions. However, few crystals can meet the technical demands, and studies to date have focused mainly on finding the next competitive candidates. Consequently, several crystals have emerged that hold great potential for the production of deep&#8208;UV harmonic coherent light, which benefit from newly developed systems with novel NLO&#8208;active units and chromophores. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the developments of emergent candidates in the field of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials, discussing the recent efforts and active advances in the search for superior systems and in understanding their structure&#8211;property relationships. The intention is to provide a clear perspective on the current emergent deep&#8208;UV NLO candidates, and to accelerate the discovery of next candidates with high performances to meet the urgent demands.

      <title>Ag+&#8208;Coupled Black Phosphorus Vesicles with Emerging NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Imaging Performance for Cancer Immune&#8208;Dynamic Therapy and Fast Wound Healing</title>
      <dc:description>Despite black phosphorus quantum dots (BP QDs) have been revealed their significant prospects in biomedical field, virtually no reports involved BP QDs&#8217;s optical imaging in second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region due to the unsatisfactory NIR&#8208;II light absorption property of BP QDs. Herein, a silver ion (Ag  +  )&#8208;coupled BP vesicle (BP Ve&#8208;Ag  +  ) with a pioneering NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) imaging capability was firstly constructed to maximize BP QD&#8217;s potential in deeper bioimaging and diversified therapy. Notably, based on theoretical simulation analysis results, we convinced that the embedded Ag  +  could improve the relatively large bandgap of BP QD  via  intense charge coupling, subsequently leading to the enhanced optical absorption capability, accompanied with the occurrence of the strong NIR&#8208;II PA signal. Guiding with the NIR&#8208;II PA bioimaging, the hidden Ag+ can be precisely released with the disassembly of Ve during photodynamic therapy (PDT) process and captured by macrophages located in lesion region for arousing synergistic cancer photodynamic/Ag  +  immunotherapy benefited from the integration of immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect and macrophages activation. Furthermore, BP Ve&#8208;Ag  +  can contrapuntally kill pathogenic bacteria and accelerate wound healing with the assist of NIR&#8208;II PA imaging.

Furthermore, BP Ve&#8208;Ag  +  can contrapuntally kill pathogenic bacteria and accelerate wound healing with the assist of NIR&#8208;II PA imaging. Therefore, a BP Ve&#8208;Ag  +  with extra NIR&#8208;II PA imaging ability reveals a boundless prospect in the biomedical field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>
Nanotechnology based on functional nucleic acids (FNAs) is an interdisciplinary field that builds on the interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials. In this Review, a number of common FNA nanomaterials are described along with their structures and applications.

Abstract
Functional nucleic acid (FNA) nanotechnology is an interdisciplinary field between nucleic acid biochemistry and nanotechnology that focuses on the study of interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials and explores the particular advantages and applications of FNA nanomaterials. With the goal of building the next&#8208;generation biomaterials that combine the advantages of FNAs and nanomaterials, the interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials as well as FNA self&#8208;assembly technologies have established themselves as hot research areas, where the target recognition, response, and self&#8208;assembly ability, combined with the plasmon properties, stability, stimuli&#8208;response, and delivery potential of various nanomaterials can give rise to a variety of novel fascinating applications. As research on the structural and functional group features of FNAs and nanomaterials rapidly develops, many laboratories have reported numerous methods to construct FNA nanomaterials. In this Review, we first introduce some widely used FNAs and nanomaterials along with their classification, structure, and application features. Then we discuss the most successful methods employing FNAs and nanomaterials as elements for creating advanced FNA nanomaterials. Finally, we review the extensive applications of FNA nanomaterials in bioimaging, biosensing, biomedicine, and other important fields, with their own advantages and drawbacks, and provide our perspective about the issues and developing trends in FNA nanotechnology.

      <dc:description>Aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) are promising alternatives for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, new organic redox&#8208;active molecules with good chemical stability and high solubility are still desired for high&#8208;performance aqueous RFBs due to their low crossover capability and high abundance.

      <title>Jahn&#8208;Teller Disproportionation Induced Exfoliation of Unit&#8208;Cell Scale &#949;&#8208;MnO2</title>
      <dc:description>Exfoliation of nanosheet from non&#8208;layered bulk material is challenging because of the strong chemical bonds in lattice, rather than the weak van de Waals (vdW) interaction in the layered bulk counterparts. In this paper, we propose a top&#8208;down method to exfoliate &#949;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheets from a family of charge&#8208;ordered La1&#8208;xAExMnO3 (AE=Ca, Sr, Ba) perovskites, taking advantage of Jahn&#8208;Teller disproportion effect of Mn3+ and bond strength difference. The &#949;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheet (a thickness of 0.91 nm, two&#8208;fold of the unit cell along c&#8208;axis) crystalized into a nickel arsenide (NiAs) structure with ordered arrangement of 50% cation vacancy in reference to NiAs, which shows thermal metastability and the best water oxidation activity compared with other types of manganese oxide. The exfoliation mechanism has been reasoned as a synergistic proton&#8208;induced Mn3+ disproportionation and structural reconstruction. The stochastic surface walking (SSW) pathway calculation of energy and phase transformation suggested a proton&#8208;exchanged perovskite to birnessite route followed by the local reconstruction of MnO6 from perovskite skeleton. The synthetic method could also be potentially extended to the exfoliation of other two&#8208;dimensional nanosheet materials with non&#8208;layered crystal structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Single&#8208;electron Transfer in Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) are well known for their ability to activate small molecules. Recent reports of radical formation within such systems indicate single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) could play an important role in their chemistry. Herein, we investigate radical formation upon reacting FLP systems with dihydrogen, triphenyltin hydride or tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCQ) both experimentally and computationally to determine the nature of the single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) events; i.e. being direct SET to B(C  6  F  5  )  3  or not. We show that the reactions of H  2  and Ph  3  SnH with archetypal P/B FLP systems do not proceed via a radical mechanism. In contrast, reaction with TCQ proceeds via SET, which is only feasible by Lewis acid coordination to the substrate. Furthermore, we highlight that SET from the Lewis base to the Lewis acid&#8211;substrate adduct may be prevalent in other literature examples of radical FLP chemistry, which provides important design principles for radical main&#8208;group chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>In&#8208;situ ligand bonding management of CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots enables high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and red light&#8208;emitting diodes</title>
      <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) are promising materials for the next generation optoelectronic devices. Importantly, the bonding nature of QD capping ligands plays a crucial role in the resultant device performance.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) are promising materials for the next generation optoelectronic devices. Importantly, the bonding nature of QD capping ligands plays a crucial role in the resultant device performance. To fine&#8208;tuning the surface ligand towards high&#8208;performance devices, we first developed an  in&#8208;situ  passivation process for all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead iodide (CsPbI  3  ) perovskite QDs by using a bi&#8208; functional ligand, namely L&#8208;phenylalanine (L&#8208;PHE).

      <title>Engineering Charge Transfer State to Facilitate Spin&#8208;orbit Charge Transfer Intersystem Crossing in Spirobis[anthracene]diones Solution</title>
      <dc:description>The potency of spiro&#8208;conjugation has been proposed to dictate the efficiency of charge transfer, which could directly affect spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process, as predicted by the El&#8208;Sayed rule. However, this process has yet to be exemplified. Herein, we judiciously prepared three novel spirobis[anthracene]diones, in which two benzophenone moieties are locked in close proximity and differentially functionalized to fine&#8208;tune the charge transfer state. Its feasibility for SOCT&#8208;ISC was theoretically predicted, then experimentally evaluated. Through fine&#8208;tuning the spiro&#8208;conjugation coupling and varying the solvent dielectric constants, ISC rate constants were engineered to vary in a dynamic range of 3 orders of magnitude, from 7.8&#215;108  s&#8208;1  to 1.0&#215;1011  s&#8208;1  , which is the highest ISC rate reported for SOCT&#8208;ISC system to our knowledge. Our findings substantiate the key factors for effective SOCT&#8208;ISC and offer a new avenue for the rational design of heavy atom free triplet sensitizers.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Chemical looping provides an energy and cost effective route for alkane utilization.

The highly dispersed vanadia nanostructures on titanium dioxide support showed over 90% propylene selectivity at 500 &#176;C, exhibiting highest turnover frequency of 1.9&#215;10  &#8208;2  s  &#8208;1  , which is over 20 times greater than that of conventional crystalline V  2  O  5  oxygen carriers. Combining in situ spectroscopic characterizations and density functional theory calculation, we revealed the loading&#8211;reaction barrier relationship through the vanadia/titanium interfacial interaction.

Chemistry, which was traditionally focused on reactions in simple mixtures, is dedicating an increasing attention to the network reactivity of highly complex synthetic systems, able to display new kinetic phenomena.

      <title>Operando NRIXS and XAFS Investigation of Segregation Phenomena in Fe&#8208;Cu and Fe&#8208;Ag Nanoparticle Catalysts during CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>Operando  nuclear resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering (NRIXS) and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure spectroscopy (XAFS) measurements have been used to gain insight into the structure and surface composition of FeCu and FeAg nanoparticles (NPs) during the CO  2  electrochemical reduction (CO  2  RR) and to extract correlations with their catalytic activity and selectivity. The formation of a core&#8208;shell structure during CO  2  RR for FeAg NPs was inferred from the analysis of the  operando  NRIXS data (phonon density of states, PDOS) and XAFS measurements. Electrochemical analysis of the FeAg NPs revealed a faradaic selectivity of ~&#160;36 % for CO in 0.1&#160;M KHCO  3  at &#8208;1.1 V vs RHE, similar to that of pure Ag NPs. In contrast, a predominant selectivity towards H  2  evolution is obtained in the case of the FeCu NPs, analogous to the results obtained for pure Fe NPs, although small Cu NPs have also been shown to favor H  2  production. These results, together with the findings from NRIXS and XAFS, revealed that Ag is preferentially present on the surface of the FeAg NPs during CO  2  RR, while Cu is also likely to be mainly distributed on the surface of the FeCu NPs but with a larger degree of intermixing with Fe.</dc:description>

      <title>Toward replacing ethylene oxide in a sustainable world: Glycolaldehyde as bio&#8208;based C2 platform molecule</title>
      <dc:description>Nowadays, fossil&#8208;based platform molecules such as ethylene and ethylene oxide serve as primary feedstock for the C  2  &#8208;based chemical industry. However, in search for a more sustainable chemical industry, fossil&#8208;based resources may preferentially be replaced by renewable alternatives, provided realistic economic feasibility. This review compares and critically discusses several production routes toward&#160;bio&#8208;based structural analogs of ethylene oxide and the required adaptations for their implementation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art C  2  &#8208;based chemical processes. For instance, glycolaldehyde, a structural analog obtainable from carbohydrates&#160;  via  &#160;atom&#8208;economic retro&#8208;aldol, may replace ethylene oxide's leading role. This alternative chemical route may not only accommodate to lower the carbon footprint of conventional chemicals production, but the introduction of a bio&#8208;based pathway may also contribute to safer production processes. Where possible, challenges, drawbacks, and prospects are highlighted.</dc:description>

      <title>Flexible C&#8211;C Bond: Reversible Expansion, Contraction, Formation, and Scission of Extremely Elongated Single Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Since carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) covalent bonds are rigid and robust, the bond length is, in general, nearly constant and depends only on the bond order and hybrid orbitals. We report here direct visualization of the reversible expansion and contraction of a Csp3&#8211;Csp3 single bond by light and heat. This flexibility of a C&#8211;C bond was demonstrated by X&#8208;ray analyses and Raman spectroscopy of hexaphenylethane (HPE)&#8208;type hydrocarbons with two spiro&#8208;dibenzocycloheptatriene units, where intramolecular [2+2] photocyclization and thermal cleavage of the resulting cyclobutane ring both occur in a single&#8208;crystalline phase. The force constant of the contracted C&#8211;C bond is 1.6 times greater than that of the expanded bond. Since formation of the cyclobutane ring and contraction of the C&#8211;C bond lower the HOMO level by ca. 1 eV, the oxidative properties of these HPEs having a flexible C&#8211;C bond can be deactivated/activated by light/heat.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Mediated Cleavage of C&#8722;C Single Bonds: Making the Cut in Total Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Rapid remodeling of skeletal frameworks can be achieved by transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds and enable new retrosynthetic disconnections. In this Review, ten total syntheses from 2014&#8211;2019 are highlighted that illustrate how transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds can streamline synthetic efforts.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds can enable entirely new retrosynthetic disconnections in the total synthesis of natural products. Given that C&#8722;C bond cleavage inherently alters the carbon framework of a compound, and that, under transition&#8208;metal catalysis, the generated organometallic or radical intermediate is primed for further complexity&#8208;building reactivity, C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage events have the potential to drastically and rapidly remodel skeletal frameworks. The recent acceleration of the use of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds in total synthesis can be ascribed to a communal recognition of this fact. In this Review, we highlight ten selected total syntheses from 2014 to 2019 that illustrate how transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds at either the core or the periphery of synthetic intermediates can streamline synthetic efforts.

      <title>Rechargeable Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Battery with Improved Electrochemical Performance by Cobalt&#8208;Containing Electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The rechargeable aluminum sulfur (Al&#8208;S) battery is regarded as a potential alternative beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;battery system owing to its safety, promising energy density, and the high earth abundance of the constituent electrode materials, however, sluggish kinetic response and short life&#8208;span are the major issues that limit the battery&#8217;s development towards applications. In this article, we report Co(II, III) as an electrochemical catalyst in the sulfur cathode that renders a reduced discharge&#8208;charge voltage hysteresis and improved capacity retention and rate capability for Al&#8208;S batteries. The structural and electrochemical analysis suggest that the catalytic effect of Co(II, III) is closely associated with the formation of cobalt sulfides and the changes in the valence states of the Co(II,III) during the electrochemical reactions of the sulfur species, which lead to improved reaction kinetics and sulfur utilization in the cathode. The Al&#8208;S battery, assembled with the cathode consisting of Co(II,III) decorated carbon matrix, demonstrates a considerably reduced voltage hysteresis of 0.8 V, a reversible specific capacity of &#8764;500 mAh/g  &#160;  at 1 A/g  &#160;  after 200 discharge&#8208;charge cycles and of &#8764;300 mAh/g  &#160;  at 3 A/g  &#160;  .</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from All&#8208;Inorganic Cesium Zirconium Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is generally observed in solid&#8208;state organic molecules or metal&#8208;organic complexes. However, TADF in all&#8208;inorganic colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) is rare. Herein, we report the first colloidal synthesis of an air&#8208;stable all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free Cs  2  ZrCl  6  perovskite NCs. The Cs  2  ZrCl  6  NCs exhibit long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (138.2 &#956;s), featuring highly efficient photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency (QY= 60.37%) due to TADF. The emission color can be easily tuned from blue to green by synthesizing the mixed&#8208;halide Cs  2  ZrBr  x  Cl  6&#8208;x  (0&#8804;x&#8804;1.5) NCs. Both femtosecond transient absorption and temperature dependent PL measurements are performed to clarify the emission mechanism. In addition, Bi  3+  ions are successfully doped into Cs  2  ZrCl  6  NCs, which further extends the PL properties. This work not only develops a new lead&#8208;free perovskite Cs  2  ZrCl  6  NCs for potential optoelectronic applications, but also offers unique strategies for developing new inorganic phosphors.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Intermediate Regulation Enabled by Sulfur Containers in Working Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Polysulfide intermediates (PSs), the liquid&#8208;phase species of active materials in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, connect the electrochemical reactions between insulative solid sulfur and lithium sulfide and are regarded as the key to full exertion of the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S system. To manipulate the reactivity and distribution of PSs is one of the most important targets to enhance the performances of Li&#8211;S batteries. Compared with the exploration of extrinsic regulations such as physical confinement and chemical catalysis, direct and intramolecular engineering of PSs has been less concerned. In this contribution, the concept of sulfur container additives is proposed for the direct modification on the PSs species. Through reversible storage and release of the sulfur species, the container molecule converts small PSs into large organosulfur species. The prototype di(tri)sulfide&#8208;polyethylene glycol sulfur container displays high efficiency in the reversible PS transformation to multiply affect the electrochemical behaviors of sulfur cathodes in terms of liquid&#8208;species clustering, reaction kinetics, and solid deposition. Therefore, the stability and capacity of Li&#8211;S cells was enhanced. The concept of sulfur container affords a strategy to directly modify PSs, enlightening the precise regulation on Li&#8211;S batteries and analogues multi&#8208;phase electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

      <title>A Universal Graphene Quantum Dot&#8208;Tethering Design Strategy to Synthesize Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesizing a wide variety of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) on different supports via a universal strategy is still challenging because of the high surface energy of single atoms which leads to serious aggregation. Here we report a general graphene quantum dot&#8208;tethering design strategy to synthesize SACs. The strategy is applicable to different metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) and supports (0D carbon nanosphere, 1D carbon nanotube, 2D graphene nanosheet, and 3D graphite foam) with the metal loading of 3.0&#8211;4.5 wt%. The direct transmission electron microscopy imaging and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra analyses confirm the atomic dispersed metal in carbon supports. Our study reveals that the abundant oxygenated groups for complexing metal ions and the rich defective sites for incorporating nitrogen are essential to realize the synthesis of SACs. Furthermore, the carbon nanotube supported Ni SACs exhibit high electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction with nearly 100% CO selectivity. This universal strategy is expected to open up new research avenues to produce SACs for diverse electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synthesizing a wide variety of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) on different supports via a universal strategy is still challenging because of the high surface energy of single atoms which leads to serious aggregation. Here we report a general graphene quantum dot&#8208;tethering design strategy to synthesize SACs. The strategy is applicable to different metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) and supports (0D carbon nanosphere, 1D carbon nanotube, 2D graphene nanosheet, and 3D graphite foam) with the metal loading of 3.0&#8211;4.5 wt%. The direct transmission electron microscopy imaging and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra analyses confirm the atomic dispersed metal in carbon supports. Our study reveals that the abundant oxygenated groups for complexing metal ions and the rich defective sites for incorporating nitrogen are essential to realize the synthesis of SACs. Furthermore, the carbon nanotube supported Ni SACs exhibit high electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction with nearly 100% CO selectivity. This universal strategy is expected to open up new research avenues to produce SACs for diverse electrocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition for Atomically Dispersed and Nitrogen Coordinated Single Metal Site Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated single metal sites (M&#8208;N&#8208;C, M=Fe, Co, Ni, or Mn) are the popular platinum group&#8208;metal (PGM)&#8208;free catalysts for many electrochemical reactions. Traditional wet&#8208;chemistry catalyst synthesis often requires complex procedures with unsatisfied reproducibility and scalability. Here, we report a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy to synthesize the promising single metal site (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts. The deposition of gaseous 2&#8208;methylimidazole onto ZnO substrates doped with M, followed by an in&#8208;situ thermal activation, was proved effective in generating single metal sites well dispersed into porous carbon. In particular, an optimal CVD&#8208;derived Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst is featured with atomically dispersed FeN4 sites with increased Fe loading relative to other catalysts from wet&#8208;chemistry synthesis. The catalyst exhibited outstanding oxygen&#8208;reduction activity in acidic electrolytes, which was further studied in proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells with encouraging performance. The CVD synthesis sheds some light on the mass production of single metal site catalysts towards advanced electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Accurate control of initial Coulombic efficiency for Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides by surface multicomponent integration</title>
      <dc:description>Low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) is one of the most obstacles for practical application of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLOs), which is closely related with the irreversible oxygen evolution due to the overoxidized reaction of surface labile oxygen. Here we report a NH4F&#8208;assisted surface multicomponent integration technology to accurately control the ICE, by which oxygen vacancies, spinel&#8208;layered coherent structure and F&#8208;doping are skillfully integrated on the surface of treated LLOs microspheres. Though the regulation on the removed amount of labile oxygen by surface integrated structure, the ICE of LLOs cathodes can adjust from starting value to 100%. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, refined X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrate the removed labile oxygen mainly comes from Li2MnO3&#8208;like structure. In addition, the multicomponent integrated structure greatly improves the surface stability of LLOs cathodes. Even operated at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 5 V, the capacity retention of integrated sample at 200 mA g&#8208;1 is still larger than 98% after 100 cycles. The surface multicomponent integration technology to control ICE of this work is critical for practical application of LLOs cathodes in the near future.</dc:description>
