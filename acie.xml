         <title>Access to N&#8208;CF3 Formamides by Reduction of N&#8208;CF3 Carbamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The departure into unknown chemical space is essential for the discovery of new properties and function. We herein report the first synthetic access to N&#8208;trifluoromethylated formamides. The method involves the reduction of bench&#8208;stable NCF  3  carbamoyl fluorides and is characterized by operational simplicity and mildness, tolerating a broad range of functional groups as well as stereocenters. The newly made N&#8208;CF  3  formamide motif proved to be highly robust and compatible with diverse chemical transformations, underscoring its potential as building block in complex functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Cysteine 270 as a Novel Site for Allosteric Modulators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Papain&#8208;Like Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coronavirus papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) plays an important role in the proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins and the dysregulation of the host immune response, providing a promising therapeutic target. However, the development of inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) PLpro is challenging owing to the restricted S1/S2 sites in the substrate binding pocket. Here we report the discovery of two activators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and the identification of the unique residue, cysteine 270 (C270), as an allosteric and covalent regulatory site for the activators. This site is also specifically modified by glutathione, resulting in protease activation. Furthermore, a compound was found to allosterically inhibit the protease activity by covalent binding to C270. Together, these results elucidate an unrevealed molecular mechanism for allosteric modulation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and provided a novel site for allosteric inhibitors design.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Devices Enabled by a Polyfullerene Electron Transporting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron transporting materials (ETMs) play vital roles in determining the efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells. The widely used PCBM is prone to undesirable aggregation and migration in a cell, thus impairing device stability. In this work, we develop a new type of ETMs by polymerizing C60 fullerene with an aromantic linker unit. The resultant polyfullerene (PFBS&#8208;C12) not only maintains the good optoelectronic properties of fullerenes, but also can address the aforementioned aggregation problem of PCBM. The polyfullerene&#8208;based blade&#8208;coated cells exhibit a high efficiency of 23.2% and good device stability that maintain 96% of initial efficiency after &gt; 1,300&#8208;hour light soaking. An aperture efficiency of 18.9% is also achieved on a 53.6&#8208;cm2 perovskite mini&#8208;module. This work provides a new strategy for designing ETMs that retain the key figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of conventional fullerene molecules and enable more stable perovskite solar devices simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic C4 Epimerization of UDP&#8208;Glucuronic Acid: Precisely Steered Rotation of a Transient 4&#8208;Keto Intermediate for Inverting Reaction without Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UDP&#8208;glucuronic acid (UDP&#8208;GlcA) 4&#8208;epimerase represents in special ways an important general problem of enzyme catalysis: the requirement to balance conformational flexibility with precise positioning for efficient reaction. The enzyme coordinates site&#8208;specific oxidation of the substrate by NAD  +  with coupled motion (rotation) of a decarboxylation&#8208;prone &#946;&#8208;keto acid intermediate in the active site, to enable stereo&#8208;inverting keto group reduction by NADH. We here reveal the elusive rotational itinerary of the emergent 4&#8208;keto&#8208;intermediate. Sugar ring distortion to boat conformations (  B  1,4  ,  5  S  1  ) induces torsional mobility in the constrained enzyme binding pocket. The low&#8208;energy rotational endpoints feature the 4&#8208;keto&#8208;sugar as undistorted  4  C  1  chair. With the carboxylate group placed equatorially stereo&#8208;electronic constraints are set to disfavor the 4&#8208;keto&#8208;intermediate decarboxylation. Epimerase variants give decarboxylation in the extent that they remove binding interactions with the carboxylate group in the opposite rotational isomer of the substrate. Substitutions R185A and R185D convert the epimerase into primitive UDP&#8208;xylose synthases that decarboxylate UDP&#8208;GlcA in completely stereospecific, configuration&#8208;retaining reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Durable High&#8208;temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Enabled by the Working&#8208;temperature&#8208;matching Palladium&#8208;Hydrogen Buffer Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The durability&#160;degradation during stack&#8208;operating conditions seriously undermines the lifetime and performance of fuel cell. To alleviate the rapid potential rise and performance degradation, herein, an ingenious&#160;anode design is proposed to match the working temperature of high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) with palladium&#8208;hydrogen release temperature and significantly enhanced hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity of Pd, achieving superior performance of Pd anode. Furthermore, Pd as hydrogen buffer and oxygen absorbent layer in&#160;anode can provide additional in&#8208;situ&#160;hydrogen and absorb infiltrated oxygen during local fuel starvation to maintain HOR and suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. Compared with the traditional unitary Pt/C anode, the Pd/C anode greatly improved HT&#8208;PEMFCs durability during start&#8208;up/shut&#8208;down and current mutation.&#160;The reversibility of hydrogen storage materials provides innovative guidance for improving the durability of PEMFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Darobactins Exhibiting Superior Antibiotic Activity by Cryo&#8208;EM Structure Guided Biosynthetic Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over recent decades, the pipeline of antibiotics acting against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is running dry, as most discovered candidate antibiotics suffer from insufficient potency, pharmacokinetic properties, or toxicity. The darobactins, a promising new small peptide class of drug candidates, bind to novel antibiotic target BamA, an outer membrane protein. Previously, we reported that biosynthetic engineering in a heterologous host generated novel darobactins with enhanced antibacterial activity. Here we utilize an optimized purification method and present cryo&#8208;EM structures of the Bam complex with darobactin 9 (D9), which served as a blueprint for the biotechnological generation of twenty new darobactins including halogenated analogs. The newly engineered darobactin 22 binds more tightly to BamA and outperforms the favorable activity profile of D9 against clinically relevant pathogens such as carbapenem&#8208;resistant Acinetobacter baumannii up to 32&#8208;fold, without observing toxic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Dimethyl Carbonate from CO2: Engineering Reactive Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Ceria with Vacancy Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical conversion of CO2 to long&#8208;chain chemicals is considered as a highly attractive way to produce value&#8208;added organics, while the underlying reaction mechanism remains unclear. Herein, by constructing surface vacancy cluster mediated solid frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), the 100% atom&#8208;economic efficient chemical conversion of CO2 to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is realized. By taking CeO2 as a model system, we illustrate that FLP sites can efficiently accelerate the coupling and conversion of key intermediates. As demonstrated, CeO2 with rich FLP sites show improved reaction activity and achieve a high yield of DMC up to 15.3 mmol/g. In addition, by means of synchrotron radiation in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy , combining with density functional theory calculations, the in&#8208;depth reaction mechanism on FLP site is systematically investigated, providing pioneering insights in the underlying pathway for CO2 chemical conversion to long&#8208;chain chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanocomposite of Bi Clusters and Bi2O2CO3 Sheets for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the most promising CO2 utilization routes, the renewable electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid would contribute to establishing a carbon&#8208;neutral society. The current catalyst suffers from limited activity and stability under high selectivity and the ambiguous nature of active sites. Here, we report a powerful Bi2S3&#8208;derived catalyst that demonstrates a current density of 2.0 A cm&#8208;2 with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93% at &#8208;0.95 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The energy conversion efficiency and single&#8208;pass yield of formate reach 80% and 67%, respectively, and the durability reaches 100 h at an industrial&#8208;relevant current density. Pure formic acid with a concentration of 3.5 mol L&#8208;1 has been produced continuously. Our operando spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal the dynamic evolution of catalyst into a nanocomposite composed of Bi0 clusters and Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets and the pivotal role of Bi0&#8722;Bi2O2CO3 interface in CO2 activation and conversion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of free carboxylic acids represents a significant advance from conventional cyclopalladation initiated reactions. However, developing a modular synthetic platform for diverse quaternary and tertiary carbon centers based on this reactivity, two challenges remain to be addressed: mono&#8208;selectivity in each consecutive C&#8211;H functionalization step; compatibility with heteroatoms. While the exclusive mono&#8208;selectivity was achieved by &#946; &#8208;lactonization/nucleophilic attack, the latter limitation remains to be overcome.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Oligosaccharides by Mechanochemical Hydrolysis of Chitin over a Carbon&#8208;Based Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligosaccharides possess fascinating functions that are applicable in a variety of fields, such as agriculture. However, the selective synthesis of oligosaccharides, especially chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides, has remained a challenge. Chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides activate the plant immune system, enabling crops to withstand pathogens without harmful agrichemicals. Here, we demonstrate the conversion of chitin to chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides using a carbon catalyst with weak acid sites and mechanical milling. The catalyst produces chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides with up to 94% selectivity in good yields. Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations indicate that our system preferentially hydrolyzes larger chitin molecules over oligomers, thus providing the desired high selectivity. This unique kinetics is in contrast to the fact that typical catalytic systems rapidly hydrolyze oligomers to monomers. Unlike other materials carbons more strongly adsorb large polysaccharides than small oligomers, which is suitable for the selective synthesis of small oligosaccharides.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoelectric Coupling via Spin Crossover in a Fe(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetoelectric coupling is achieved near room temperature in a spin crossover Fe(II) molecule&#8208;based compound, [Fe(1bpp)2](BF4)2. Large atomic displacements resulting from Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions induce a change in the molecule dipole moment when switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states leading to a step&#8208;wise change in the electric polarization and dielectric constant. For temperatures in the region of bistability, the changes in magnetic and electrical properties are induced with a remarkably low magnetic field of 3 T. This result represents a successful expansion of magnetoelectric spin crossovers towards ambient conditions. Moreover, the observed 0.3&#8211;0.4 mC/m2 changes in the H&#8208;induced electric polarization suggest that the high strength of the coupling obtained via this route is accessible not just at cryogenic temperatures but also near room temperature, a feature that is especially appealing in the light of practical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Achieving Dipeptidyl Peptidase 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) selectivity is a current challenge in chemical biology. Supported by activity&#8208;based protein profiling and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we disclose 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors with different binding modes for DPP8/9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; subsite in DPP8 and the best selectivity index reported to date.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) have gathered interest as drug targets due to their important roles in biological processes like immunity and tumorigenesis. Elucidation of their distinct individual functions remains an ongoing task and could benefit from the availability of novel, chemically diverse and selective chemical tools. Here, we report the activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP)&#8208;mediated discovery of 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic structures revealed different ligand binding modes for DPP8 and DPP9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; (eS2&#8242;) subsite in DPP8. Biological assays confirmed inhibition at both target and cellular levels. Altogether, our integrated chemical proteomics and structure&#8208;guided small molecule design approach led to novel DPP8/9 inhibitors with alternative molecular inhibition mechanisms, delivering the highest selectivity index reported to date.

         <title>Semisynthetic Viral Inhibitor for Light Control of the MHC I Peptide Loading Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immune system supervises every cell via major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, which are prepared in the peptide loading complex (PLC). Using a light&#8208;activated viral nanotool, the authors succeeded in spatiotemporally controlling antigen processing and reconstituting a completely active native PLC. The photo&#8208;conditional function of PLC was analyzed with a flow cytometry&#8208;based assay at single&#8208;organelle resolution.







Abstract
The immune system detects virally or malignantly transformed cells via peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex class&#8197;I (pMHC&#8197;I) molecules on the cell surface. MHC I molecules are loaded with cargo peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the highly dynamic multiprotein peptide loading complex (PLC). Here, we developed a semisynthetic approach to generate a photocleavable immune modulator ICP47 of Herpes simplex virus. Using this nanotool, we revealed key mechanistic events of the purified PLC, such as peptide binding and translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis, triggered by light. We established a single&#8208;organelle flow cytometry assay to monitor light&#8208;controlled activation of the antigen processing machinery in native ER membranes. This photochemical modulation opens new opportunities for a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of the antigen processing machinery in vitro and native membrane environment.

&lt;p&gt;The immune system supervises every cell via major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, which are prepared in the peptide loading complex (PLC). Using a light-activated viral nanotool, the authors succeeded in spatiotemporally controlling antigen processing and reconstituting a completely active native PLC. The photo-conditional function of PLC was analyzed with a flow cytometry-based assay at single-organelle resolution.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Organoplatinum(II) Complexes for Subcellular Distribution and Cell Viability Monitoring with Differentiated Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation affinities of the platinum(II) complexes enable them to exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red, attributed to the extent of PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The platinum(II) complex is applied to manifest the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells.







Abstract
The ability to precisely control the subcellular distribution of luminous materials presents unprecedented advantages for understanding cell biology and disease therapy. We introduce a luminescence tool for subcellular distribution imaging and differentiation of live and dead cells, utilizing cationic organoplatinum(II) complexes that exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red due to assembly via PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. One of the complexes was chosen to demonstrate the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells, respectively, which represents the first example to discriminate the subcellular localization of platinum(II) complexes through differential luminescence response. These new findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of self&#8208;assembly behaviors of platinum(II) complexes for potential subcellular detection assays.

         <title>A General Method to Edit Histone H3 Modifications on Chromatin Via Sortase&#8208;Mediated Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) on the tail of histone H3 control chromatin structure and influence epigenetics and gene expression. The current chemical methods including unnatural amino acid incorporation and protein splicing enable preparations of histone with diverse PTMs in cellular contexts, but they are not applicable to edit native chromatin. The manipulation of histone modifying enzymes alter the endogenous histone PTMs but the lack of specificity of most histone modifying enzymes prevents precise control of specific H3 tail PTM patterns. Here we report a new method to edit the N&#8208;tail of histone H3 via sortase mediated metathesis (SMM). The sortase can install desired patterns of PTM into histone H3 on nucleosome in vitro and in cellulo. This study expands the application scope of sortase from ligation to metathesis in live cells using cell penetrating peptides (CPPs). In addition, it offers a strategy to edit PTMs of cellular histone H3 with potential for the development of precise epigenome editing.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of a Ferryl Flip in Electronically Tuned Nonheme Complexes. Consequences in Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two oxoiron(IV) isomers ( R2a and  R2b) of general formula [FeIV(O)(RPyNMe3)(CH3CN)]2+ are obtained by reaction of their iron(II) precursor with NBu4IO4. The two isomers differ in the position of the oxo ligand, cis and trans to the pyridine donor. The mechanism of isomerization between  R2a and  R2b has been determined by kinetic and computational analyses uncovering an unprecedented path for interconversion of geometrical oxoiron(IV) isomers. The activity of the two oxoiron(IV) isomers in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions shows that  R2a reacts one order of magnitude faster than  R2b, which is explained by a repulsive noncovalent interaction between the ligand and the substrate in  R2b. Interestingly, the electronic properties of the R substituent in the ligand pyridine ring do not have a significant effect on reaction rates, Overall, the intrinsic structural aspects of each isomer define its relative HAT reactivity, overcoming changes in electronic properties of the ligand.</dc:description>

The steric hindrance caused by the bulky substituent induces a strain in its 1D chain, achieving at ambient condition the first pure alternate charge&#8208;polarization (ACP) state (&#8211;Pt  2+  &#8211;Pt  3+  &#8211;I  &#8722;  &#8211;Pt  3+  &#8211;Pt  2+  &#8211;I  &#8722;  &#8211;), a kind of spin&#8208;Peierls state, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and its conducting and magnetic properties. The strain effect is also manifested as a very large linear thermal expansion along the chain direction, which is quite different from conventional MMX&#8208;chains without a bulky ligand. The design of low&#8208;dimensional materials with ligand variations is expected to lead to the emergence of new electron&#8211;lattice coupled electronic states.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Trivalent group&#8208;9 metal catalysts with a cyclopentadienyl&#8208;type ligand (CpMIII; M = Co, Rh, Ir, Cp = cyclopentadienyl) have been widely used for directed C&#8211;H functionalizations, albeit that their application to challenging C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalizations suffers from the limitations of the available directing groups. In this report, we describe directed C(sp3)&#8211;H amidation reactions of simple amide substrates with a variety of substituents. The combination of an electron&#8208;deficient CpERh catalyst (CpE = 1,3&#8208;bis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;substituted Cp) and an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand is essential for high reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Untangling Degradation Chemistries of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Through Interpretable Hybrid Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpretable hybrid machine learning framework is designed for post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion battery (e.g. lithium&#8208;sulfur battery) forecast using lab&#8208;scale battery dataset with compromised quality and tremendous variables. Key knowledge about the complex and dynamic degradation chemistries is extracted to illuminate future battery design and optimization.







Abstract
The development of emerging rechargeable batteries is often hindered by limited chemical understanding composing of entangled patterns in an enormous space. Herein, we propose an interpretable hybrid machine learning framework to untangle intractable degradation chemistries of conversion&#8208;type batteries. Rather than being a black box, this framework not only demonstrates an ability to accurately forecast lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (with a test mean absolute error of 8.9&#8201;% for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life prediction) but also generate useful physical understandings that illuminate future battery design and optimization. The framework also enables the discovery of a previously unknown performance indicator, the ratio of electrolyte amount to high&#8208;voltage&#8208;region capacity at the first discharge, for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries complying practical merits. The present data&#8208;driven approach is readily applicable to other energy storage systems due to its versatility and flexibility in modules and inputs.

         <title>CO2 Hydrogenation over Copper/ZnO Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Water&#8208;Promoted Transient Synthesis of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acting as a bridge for hydrogen atoms during CO2 hydrogenation, water facilitates the transformation of relatively stable intermediates for enhancing the activity which in turn produces more water to react with CO via the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. As a result, the yield of methanol is promoted by a suitable amount of water over Cu single atoms on ZnO supports.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of CO2 by renewable power&#8208;generated hydrogen offers a promising approach to a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the role of water during CO2 hydrogenation is still under debate. Herein, we demonstrated that either too low or too high contents of water hampered the methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO based catalysts. For Cu single atoms on ZnO supports, the optimal content of water was 0.11&#8197;vol.&#8201;% under 30&#8197;bar (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;H2=1&#8201;:&#8201;3) at 170&#8201;&#176;C. Upon the introduction of optimal&#8208;content water, the methanol selectivity immediately became 99.1&#8201;%, meanwhile the conversion of CO2 underwent a volcano&#8208;type trend with the maximum of 4.9&#8201;%. According to mechanistic studies, water acted as a bridge between H atoms and CO2/intermediates, facilitating the transformation of COOH* and CH2O*. The enhanced activity induced the generation of more water to react with CO via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, resulting in the increase in methanol selectivity.

         <title>Modular Construction of Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Derivatives by Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a highly selective radical cascade&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reaction for the modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAA) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal the excited state of an in situ&#8208;generated oxazolone enolate as a key intermediate, which functions both as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs) has been extensively studied, the development of an inexpensive and facile methodology to incorporate multifunctionality on ATAAs remains challenging. In this article, we present a single&#8208;step radical approach for the modular synthesis of functionally diverse ATAAs. This synthesis takes place under mild conditions with an absence of metals, photocatalysts, and all other additives. We demonstrate the broad applications of this approach on a variety of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, alkenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and oxazolones. The results prove that our method provides excellent functional group tolerance and late&#8208;stage applicability, as well as gram&#8208;scale synthesis via flow chemistry. Additionally, we include mechanistic studies which reveal that the excited state of oxazolone enolate upon light excitation is a key intermediate that acts as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.

         <title>Alkaline Tolerant Antifreezing Additive Enabling Aqueous Zn||Ni Battery Operating at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a stable electrolyte by using alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive to realize the antifreezing property and the stable Zn anode in alkaline condition. Leveraging the high reversibility and good antifreezing property, the fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with good electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Alkaline aqueous batteries such as the Zn||Ni batteries have attracted substantial interests due to their merits of high energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolyte and the poor cycling stability in alkaline condition have hindered their operation in subzero conditions. Herein, we construct a stable aqueous electrolyte with lowest freezing point down to &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive into 1&#8197;M KOH solution. Meanwhile, we find the DMSO can also retard Zn anode corrosion and prevent Zn dendrite formation in alkaline condition, which enables the Zn plating/stripping over 700&#8197;h cycle at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and its dischage capacity retains 84.1&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, 60.6&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C at 0.5&#8197;C.

     alt="Alkaline Tolerant Antifreezing Additive Enabling Aqueous Zn||Ni Battery Operating at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work develops a stable electrolyte by using alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive to realize the antifreezing property and the stable Zn anode in alkaline condition. Leveraging the high reversibility and good antifreezing property, the fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with good electrochemical performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkaline aqueous batteries such as the Zn||Ni batteries have attracted substantial interests due to their merits of high energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolyte and the poor cycling stability in alkaline condition have hindered their operation in subzero conditions. Herein, we construct a stable aqueous electrolyte with lowest freezing point down to &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive into 1&#8197;M KOH solution. Meanwhile, we find the DMSO can also retard Zn anode corrosion and prevent Zn dendrite formation in alkaline condition, which enables the Zn plating/stripping over 700&#8197;h cycle at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and its dischage capacity retains 84.1&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, 60.6&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C at 0.5&#8197;C. Meanwhile, it can maintain 600 cycles with a specific capacity retention of 86.5&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C at 2&#8197;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Local Covalent Bonding to Extended Electric Field Interactions in Proton Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How far does the influence of a proton reach in water? X&#8208;ray spectroscopy reveals how&#8212;layer by layer&#8212;the electronic structure of water molecules is altered when hydrating a proton. A general architectural hierarchy exists in which the proton strongly interacts with the three nearest water molecules to form a hybridized H7O3+&#160;core while the first hydration shell is affected by the electric field of the proton&#8216;s positive charge. Further solvation shells contain bulk&#8208;like water molecules, as reported by Ehud Pines, Philippe Wernet, Michael Odelius, Erik&#8197;T.&#8197;J. Nibbering et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202211066).

         <dc:description>
The formation of ultrathin nanowires has thermodynamic advantages at low temperature. However, at low temperatures the monomers for nanocrystal growth are difficult to generate through precursor decomposition. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202212251), Di Qiu, Yaping Du et&#8197;al. report an efficient growth process by adding polyoxometalate clusters to the monomers. 15 types of rare earth oxide ultrathin nanowires were synthesized, all exhibiting polymer&#8208;like behaviors due to the extremely high aspect ratio.

Thermoresponsive polymers undergo phase separation in response to changes in temperature. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209530), Simon Harrisson, Colin Bonduelle et&#8197;al. present the use of synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibiting temperature&#8208;driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis.

         <title>The Dynamic Formation from Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks of High&#8208;Density Platinum Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of metal cations in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) via a cation exchange process is governed by the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base (HSAB) principle. During pyrolysis, the evolution of first&#8208;shell Pt&#8208;ligand coordination determines the formation of the Pt&#8722;Pt second&#8208;shell coordination, which promotes the immobilization of Pt atoms as high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts in the Co3O4 host.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis, yet the practical applications require the development of high&#8208;density active sites with flexible geometric structures. The lack of understanding in the dynamic formation process of single atoms in the host framework has been plaguing the controllable synthesis of next generation SACs. Here using Co&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a starting substrate, we fully elucidated the formation of high&#8208;density Pt single atoms with inter&#8208;site interactions in derived Co3O4 host. The cation exchange process and dynamic evolution of Pt&#8722;Pt interactions, organic ligand cleavage and Pt&#8208;oxygen coordination formation during the pyrolysis process have been unambiguously interpreted by a series of in situ/ex situ spectroscopic measurements and theoretical computation. These findings would direct the synthesis of high&#8208;density SACs with metal&#8208;metal interactions, which demonstrate significantly enhanced structural flexibility and catalytic properties.

         <title>Development of Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Electrochemical Biosensors for Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses the role of nucleic acids as biorecognition and/or reporter probes in electrochemical biosensors. It highlights specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based electrochemical sensors that have been evaluated with clinical or clinically relevant samples for the management of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are remarkable molecules. In addition to Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing, the different structural motifs of these molecules can bind non&#8208;nucleic acid targets or catalyze chemical reactions. Additionally, nucleic acids are easily modified with different molecules or functional groups. These properties make nucleic acids, particularly DNA, ideally suited for use in electrochemical biosensors, both as biorecognition elements and redox reporter probes. In this Minireview, we will review the historical evolution of nucleic acids as probes in electrochemical biosensors. We will then review the specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based biosensors that have been evaluated for clinical use in the areas of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.

         <title>Thermoreversible Polymorph Transitions in Supramolecular Polymers of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Squaramides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoreversible polymorph transitions&#160;in supramolecular polymers&#160;are reported in the Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202213345) by Juan Arag&#243;, Bartolome Soberats et&#8197;al.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening of an Artificial Metalloenzyme using Double Emulsions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial metalloenzyme was screened in vivo using a high&#8208;throughput microfluidics&#8208;based assay. Single E. coli cells expressing streptavidin were encapsulated in double emulsion droplets together with a fluorogenic substrate and a cofactor catalyzing the reaction to yield a fluorescent product. Using this method, a 400&#8208;member library was screened, and the same hits found previously in a 96&#8208;well plate assay were identified.







Abstract
The potential for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput compartmentalization renders droplet microfluidics an attractive tool for the directed evolution of enzymes. Importantly, it ensures maintenance of the phenotype&#8208;genotype linkage, enabling reliable identification of improved mutants. Herein, we report an approach for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening of an artificial metalloenzyme in double emulsion droplets (DEs) using commercially available fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorters (FACS). This protocol was validated by screening a 400 double&#8208;mutant streptavidin library for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed deallylation of an alloc&#8208;protected aminocoumarin. The most active variants, identified by next&#8208;generation sequencing, were in good agreement with hits obtained using a 96&#8208;well plate procedure. These findings pave the way for the systematic implementation of FACS for the directed evolution of (artificial) enzymes and will significantly expand the accessibility of ultrahigh&#8208;throughput DE screening protocols.

         <title>Overcoming Hypoxia&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis Resistance via a 19F/1H&#8208;MRI Traceable Core&#8208;Shell Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorocarbon@MnOx core&#8208;shell nanostructure for overcoming the tumor microenvironment hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance via direct delivery of oxygen into the tumor is presented. Using this nanoplatform, activatable 19F&#8208;MRI/1H&#8208;MRI imaging of ferroptosis initiation is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Lipid peroxides accumulation induced ferroptosis is an effective cell death pathway for cancer therapy. However, the hypoxic condition of tumor microenvironment significantly suppresses the efficacy of ferroptosis. Here, we design a novel nanoplatform to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance. Specifically, we synthesize a novel kind of perfluorocarbon (PFOB)@manganese oxide (MnOx) core&#8208;shell nanoparticles (PM&#8208;CS NPs). Owing to the good carrier of O2 as fuel, PM&#8208;CS NPs can induce higher level of ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion, as well as lower activity of GPX4, compared with MnOx NPs alone. Moreover, the supplement of O2 can relieve tumor hypoxia to break down the storage of intracellular lipid droplets and increase expression of ACSL4 (a symbol for ferroptosis sensitivity). Furthermore, upon stimulus of GSH or acidity, PM&#8208;CS NPs exhibit the &#8220;turn on&#8221; 19F&#8208;MRI signal and activatable T1/T2&#8208;MRI contrast for correlating with the release of Mn. Finally, PM&#8208;CS NPs exert high cancer inhibition rate for ferroptosis based therapy via synergetic combination of O2&#8208;mediated enhancement of key pathways of ferroptosis.

         <title>Activatable Multimodal Probes for In Vivo Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable probes capable of generating switchable multimodal imaging signals upon interaction with a molecular target of interest have attracted much attention in the past few years. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in the development of activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and theranostics, with a focus on their design, signal activation mechanism and biological applications.







Abstract
Multimodal imaging, which harnesses two or more imaging modalities to produce complementary anatomical and molecular information of a living subject, has become as a powerful tool in both basic biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. The progresses in multimodal imaging are paralleled by the advances in multimodal probes, particularly activatable multimodal imaging probes that can generate concurrent switches in different imaging modality signals upon interaction with a molecular target. These probes are extremely promising for in vivo imaging. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and cancer theranostics, focusing on their design principle, signal activation mechanism and biomedical applications. The current challenges and perspectives for future developments of activatable multimodal probes are also briefly discussed. We hope that this Minireview will provide inspiration for the design of other activatable multimodal probes for improving in vivo imaging and theranostics.

         <title>pH Dependence of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Assembly Kinetics: Unravelling the Microscopic Molecular Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Globally fitting different kinetic models of fibril formation, over a range of pHs, reveals the key microscopic molecular processes of amyloid assembly. Primary nucleation is driven by a loss of net charge, while surprisingly, both secondary nucleation and elongation rates are independent of pH.







Abstract
Central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the assembly of the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide (A&#946;) into fibrils. A reduction in pH accompanying inflammation or subcellular compartments, may accelerate fibril formation as the pH approaches A&#946;&#8217;s isoelectric point (pI). Using global fitting of fibril formation kinetics over a range of pHs, we identify the impact net charge has on individual fibril assembly microscopic rate constants. We show that the primary nucleation has a strong pH dependence. The titration behaviour exhibits a mid&#8208;point or pKa of 7.0, close to the pKa of A&#946; histidine imidazoles. Surprisingly, both the secondary nucleation and elongation rate constants are pH independent. This indicates the charge of A&#946;, in particular histidine protonation, has little impact on this stage of A&#946; assembly. These fundamental processes are key to understanding the forces that drive the assembly of A&#946; into toxic oligomers and fibrils.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectral tuning, from green to red, of luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is achieved by electrolyte engineering, demonstrating that this does not require a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter. Visual mapping of luciferin's ECL enables a straightforward optical measurement of superoxide diffusivity, as described by Michelle&#8197;L. Coote, Marco Garavelli, Simone Ciampi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209670).

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controlled Formation and Rotation of Magnetic Nanochain In Vivo for Precise Mechanotherapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systemic cancer therapy is always accompanied with toxicity to normal tissues, which prompts concerted efforts to develop precise cancer therapy strategy. Herein, we firstly develop an intriguing approach that enables spatiotemporally controlled formation and rotation of magnetic nanochains  in vivo,  allowing for precise mechanotherapy of tumor with minimal side effects. The building blocks of the nanochain are hybrid nanocomposites of pheophorbide&#8208;A (PP) modified iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and lanthanide&#8208;doped down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNPs). By applying permanent magnetic field, the nanocomposites would be aligned to form nanochain. Next, MnO  2  NPs were subsequently administrated to accumulate in tumors as supplier of Mn  2+  , which effectively coordinates with the PP located at the joint the nanocomposite to immobilize the formed nanochains. In rotating magnetic field, the nanochains would rapidly rotate, leading to mechanical damage to organelles and cytoskeletons, and consequently resulting in apoptosis/necrosis of tumor cells. Furthermore, the IONPs and DCNPs showed high  T  2  &#8208;MR and NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging performances, respectively, which systematically facilitate to determine the tumor location and guide therapy. Overall, we represent a novel mechanotherapy strategy with great potential in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carboranyl Electrolyte Enabling Highly Reversible Sodium Metal Anodes via a &#8220;Fluorine&#8208;Free&#8221; SEI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realization of practical sodium metal batteries (SMBs) is hindered due to lack of compatible electrolyte components, dendrite propagation, and poor understanding of anodic interphasial chemistries. Chemically robust liquid electrolytes that facilitate both favorable sodium metal deposition and a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) are ideal to enable sodium metal and anode&#8208;free cells. Herein we present advanced characterization of a novel fluorine&#8208;free electrolyte utilizing the [HCB  11  H  11  ]  1&#8208;  anion. Symmetrical Na cells operated with this electrolyte exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of 0.032 V at a current density of 2.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  and a high coulombic efficiency of 99.5% in half&#8208;cell configurations. Surface characterization of electrodes post&#8208;operation reveals the absence of dendritic sodium nucleation and a surprisingly stable fluorine&#8208;free SEI. Furthermore, weak ion&#8208;pairing is identified as key towards the successful development of fluorine&#8208;free sodium electrolytes</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonia Synthesis at Room Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure from N2: A Boron&#8208;Radical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia, NH  3  , is an essential molecule, being part of fertilizers. It is currently synthesized via the Haber&#8208;Bosch process, from the very stable dinitrogen molecule, N  2  and dihydrogen, H  2  . This process requires high temperatures and pressures, thereby generating  ca  1.6% of the global CO  2  emissions. Alternative strategies are needed to realize the functionalization of N  2  to NH  3  under mild conditions. Here, we show that boron&#8208;centered radicals provide a means of activating N  2  at room temperature and atmospheric pressure whilst allowing a radical process to occur, leading to the production of borylamines. Subsequent hydrolysis released NH  4  +  , the acidic form of NH  3  . EPR spectroscopy supported the intermediacy of radicals in the process, corroborated by DFT calculations, which rationalized the mechanism of the N  2  functionalization by R  2  B radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabricating&#160;Industry&#8208;compatible Olefin&#8208;Linked COF Resins for Oxoanion Pollutant Scavenging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains formidably challenging to produce covalent organic frameworks (COFs) capable of large&#8208;scale synthesis and low cost to meet the industrial application demands (e.g., pollutant removal). Here we report using inexpensive 2,4,6&#8208;collidine as building unit to produce a series of highly crystalline and robust olefin&#8208;linked COFs capable of industrial&#8208;scale fabrication by a melt polymerization method. This method not only breaks the dogma that the reactivity of 2,4,6&#8208;collidine is too low to serve as COF monomers, but also facilitates the kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis and formation of self&#8208;shaped monolithic robust foams. The afforded COFs possess extremely low cost (&lt;50 USD/kg), superior to all the reported COFs. More importantly, using one&#8208;pot or post&#8208;modification methods can conveniently transform neutral COFs to ionic COFs, which can be applied as highly efficient ion&#8208;exchange sorbents for scavenging oxoanion pollutants with fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity, and ultra&#8208;low swelling performance. Remarkably, the superior adsorption capacity of a model oxoanion (ReO  4  &#8208;  ) is the highest among crystalline porous materials reported so far. This work not only expands the scopes of olefin&#8208;linked COFs but also enlightens the route for the industrial production of crystalline ion exchange sorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>An RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure within the ADAR 5&#8217;UTR Interacts with DHX36 Helicase to Regulate Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) structures in the 5&#8217; untranslated region (5&#8217;UTR) play crucial roles in fundamental cellular processes. ADAR is an important enzyme that binds to double&#8208;strand RNA and accounts for the conversion of Adenosine to Inosine in RNA editing. However, so far there is no report on the formation and regulatory role of rG4 on ADAR expression. Here, we identify and characterize a thermostable rG4 structure within the 5&#8217;UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA and demonstrate its formation and inhibitory role on translation in reporter gene and native gene constructs. We reveal rG4&#8208;specific helicase DHX36 interacts with this rG4 in vitro and in cells under knockdown and knockout conditions by GTFH (G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;triggered fluorogenic hybridization) probes and modulates translation in an rG4&#8208;dependent manner. Our results further substantiate the rG4 structure&#8208;DHX36 protein interaction in cells and highlight rG4 to be a key player in controlling ADAR1 translation.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Computational Design of &#969;&#8208;Transaminase by Reprograming of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Barrier Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#969;&#8208;Transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) show considerable potential for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, their low catalytic efficiency towards bulky substrates limits their application, and complicated catalytic mechanisms prevent precise enzyme design. Herein, we address this challenge using a mechanism&#8208;guided computational enzyme design strategy by reprograming the transition and ground states in key reaction steps. The common features among the three high&#8208;energy barrier steps responsible for the low catalytic efficiency were revealed using quantum mechanics (QM). Five key residues were simultaneously tailored to stabilize the rate&#8208;limiting transition state with the aid of the Rosetta design. All top&#8208;ranked 14 variants showed improved catalytic activity by 16.9&#8211;142.8&#8208;fold. The catalytic efficiency of the best variant, M9 (Q25F/M60W/W64F/I266A), was significantly increased by 1660&#8208;fold in kcat/Km, and 1.5&#8722;26.8&#8208;fold increase in turnover number (TON) towards various indanone derivatives.</dc:description>

The catalytic efficiency of the best variant, M9 (Q25F/M60W/W64F/I266A), was significantly increased by 1660-fold in kcat/Km, and 1.5&#8722;26.8-fold increase in turnover number (TON) towards various indanone derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Electrolyte for 4.7 V Sodium Metal Batteries Enabled by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as promising battery system&#160;due to abundant Na sources. However, poor compatibility&#160;between electrolyte and cathode severely impedes its development.&#160;Herein, we proposed an anion/cation solvation strategy for&#160;realizing&#160;4.7 V resistant&#160;SMBs electrolyte with&#160;NaClO4&#160;and trimethoxy(pentafluorophenyl)silane (TPFS)&#160;as dual additives (DA). The ClO4&#8208;&#160;can rapidly transfer to the cathode surface and strongly coordinate with Na+&#160;to&#160;form&#160;stable polymer&#8208;like chains&#160;with solvents. Meanwhile, TPFS can preferentially enter into the PF6&#8208;&#160;anion solvation sheath for reducing PF6&#8208;solvent interaction and effectively scavenge adverse electrolyte species for protecting electrode electrolyte interphases.&#160;Thus, such electrolyte elevates the oxidative stability of carbonate electrolytes from 3.77 to 4.75 V, and enables Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F&#160;(NVPF) battery with a capacity retention of 93% and an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6% after 500 cycles&#160;at 4.7 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation Enabled by a Chiral 2,2&#697;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to previous approaches to chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids that based on reactions using hazardous gases, pressurized setup and mostly noble metal catalysts, in this work, a nickel&#8208;catalysed general, efficient and highly enantioselective carboxylation reaction of racemic benzylic (pseudo)halides under mild conditions using atmospheric CO2  has been developed. A unique chiral 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine ligand named Me&#8208;SBpy featuring compact polycyclic skeleton enabled both high reactivity and stereoselectivity. The utility of this method has been demonstrated by synthesis of various chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids (30 examples, up to 95% yield and 99:1 er), including profen family anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and transformations using the acids as key intermediates. Based on mechanistic experimental results, a plausible catalytic cycle involving Ni&#8208;complex/radical equilibrium and Lewis acid&#8208;assisted CO  2  activation has been proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>&#928;&#8208;Expanded Carbazoles as Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are promising hole&#8208;selective materials for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often possess small dipoles which prohibit them from effectively modulating the workfunction of ITO substrate, limiting the PSC photovoltage. Moreover, their properties can be drastically affected by even subtle structural modifications, undermining the final PSC performance. Here, we designed two carbazole&#8208;derived SAMs, CbzPh and CbzNaph through asymmetric or helical &#960;&#8208;expansion for improved molecular dipole moment and strengthened p&#8208;p interaction. The helical &#960;&#8208;expanded CbzNaph has the largest dipole, forming densely packed and ordered monolayer, facilitated by the highly ordered assembly observed in its p&#8208;scaffold's single crystal. These synergistically modulate the perovskite crystallization atop and tune the ITO workfunction. Consequently, the champion PSC employing CbzNaph showed an excellent 24.1% efficiency and improved stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Compacting Electric Double Layer Enables Carbon Electrode with Ultrahigh Zn Ion Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;based cathodes for aqueous zinc ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) typically undergo low Zn ion storage capability due to their electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) energy storage mechanism that is restricted by specific surface area and thickness of electric double layer (EDL). Here, we report a universal surface charge modulation strategy to effectively enhance the capacitance of carbon materials by decreasing the thickness of EDL. Amino groups with lone pair electrons were chosen to increase the surface charge density and enhanced the interaction between carbon electrode and Zn ions, thus effectively compacting the EDL. Consequently, amino functionalized porous carbon based ZHSCs can deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 255.2 mAh g&#8208;1 along with excellent cycling stability (95.5% capacity retention after 50000 cycles) in 1M ZnCl2 electrolyte. This study demonstrates the feasibility of EDL modified carbon as Zn2+ storage cathode and great prospect for constructing high performance ZHSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Green &amp; Red Narrowband Emissive Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrate how judicious selection of donor decorating a central multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) core based on DiKTa can lead to very high&#8208;performance OLEDs. Decorating the DiKTa core with triphenylamine (TPA) and diphenylamine (DPA), 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa exhibit bright, narrowband green and red emission in doped films, respectively. The OLEDs based on these emitters showed record&#8208;high performance with maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) for this family of emitters, with a EQEmax of 30.8% for 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL of 551 nm and 16.7% for 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL of 613 nm. The efficiency roll&#8208;off in the OLEDs was improved significantly by using 4CzIPN as an assistant dopant in hyperfluorescence (HF) devices. The outstanding device performance has been attributed to preferential horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moments of 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Alkali metal dihydrogen&#8208;antimonides [M(L)xSbH2], short: alkali metal antimonides (M&#160;=&#160;Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; 1: L = pmdta; 2: L = crown&#8208;ether), were prepared from stibine and n&#8208;Butyllithium, M(hmds) (hmds&#160;=&#160;hexamethyldisilazane) or MOtBu, respectively. We developed a generally applicable synthesis route for these compounds and the obtained compounds were examined on their stability depending on the alkali metal and stabilizing additives used, whereby the use of appropriate crown&#8208;ethers allowed their isolation and characterization at room temperature. Moreover, the 1,4&#8208;dioxane adduct [Na(dioxane)xSbH2] was the appropriate starting compound for the synthesis of the first primary silylstibane (Me3Si)3SiSbH2 (3) which was characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy.

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Functionalized Azetidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the favorable properties that azetidine rings can engender on drug&#8208;compounds, methods for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of azetidine&#8208;based structures are significantly underdeveloped.  Herein, we report the successful realization of a multicomponent [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement/strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven anion relay sequence and its application to the modular synthesis of substituted azetidines. The rapidity of the reaction, as confirmed by in situ infra&#8208;red spectroscopy, leverages the strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane to drive the equilibrium of the Brook rearrangement. The three electrophilic coupling partners, added sequentially to azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;lithium, could be individually varied to access a diverse compound library. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated in a 4&#8208;step synthesis of the EP2 receptor antagonist PF&#8208;04418948.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Properties of High Nitrogen Content Carbonaceous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of structural modifications on the catalytic activity of carbon materials is poorly understood. A collection of carbonaceous materials with different pore networks and high nitrogen content was characterized and used to catalyze four reactions to deduce structure&#8208;activity relationships. The CO2 cycloaddition and Knoevenagel reaction depend on Lewis basic sites (electron&#8208;rich nitrogen species). The absence of large conjugated carbon domains resulting from the introduction of large amounts of nitrogen in the carbon network is responsible for poor redox activity, as observed through the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene with hydrazine and the catalytic oxidation of 3,3',5,5'&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine using hydroperoxide. The material with the highest activity towards Lewis acid catalysis (in the hydrolysis of (dimethoxymethyl)benzene to benzaldehyde) is the most effective for small molecule activation and presents the highest concentration of electron&#8208;poor nitrogen species.</dc:description>

         <title>Bromine Assisted MnO2 Dissolution Chemistry: Toward a Hybrid Flow Battery with Energy Density of over 300 Wh L&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn2+/Mn3+ redox pair has been considered as a promising cathode for high energy density batteries, due to its attractive features of high redox potential, solubility and outstanding kinetics. However, the disproportionation side reaction of Mn3+, which results in accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; MnO2 limits its reversibility and further energy density. Herein, a novel catholyte based on mixture of Mn2+ and Br&#8208; was proposed for flow batteries with high energy density and long cycle life. In the design, the &#8220;dead&#8221; MnO2 can be fully discharged via Br&#8208; by a chemical&#8208;electrochemical reaction. Coupled with Cd/Cd2+ as anode, the assembled Bromine&#8208;Manganese flow battery (BMFB) demonstrates a high energy efficiency of 76% at 80 mA cm&#8208;2 with energy density of 360 Wh L&#8722;1. The battery assembled with silicotungstic acid as anode could continuously run for over 2000 cycles at 80 mA cm&#8208;2. With high power density, energy density and durability, the BMFB shows great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Screening for Cu&#8208;based Bimetallic Electrocatalysts: Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to C2+ Products on Magnesium&#8208;Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2  (CO2  RR) into high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive route to achieve carbon neutralization. However, the development of an efficient catalyst for CO2  RR is still largely by trial&#8208;and&#8208;error and is very time&#8208;consuming. Herein, we bulid an electrocatalyst testing platform featuring a home&#8208;built automatic flow cell to accelarate the discovery of efficient catalysts. A fast screening of 109 Cu&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts in only ~55 h identifies the Mg combined with Cu as the best electrocatalyst for CO2  to C2+  products. The thus designed Mg&#8208;Cu catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+  products up to 80% with a current density of 1.0 A cm&#8208;2  at &#8208;0.77 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Systematic experiments with  in&#8208;situ  spectroelectrochemistry analyses unravel that Mg2+  species stabilizes Cu+  sites during CO2  RR and promotes the CO2  activation, thus enhancing the *CO coverage to promote C&#8208;C coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Biocatalytic N&#8208;Methylation of Unsaturated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Methylated and &#8208;alkylated unsaturated heterocycles are privileged scaffolds in pharmaceuticals that are often tedious to synthesize. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes can be used to access such molecules through alkylation with high regioselectivity, high yield and on a preparative scale using simple starting materials.







Abstract
Methods for regioselective N&#8208;methylation and &#8208;alkylation of unsaturated heterocycles with &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; reagents are highly sought&#8208;after. This reaction could drastically simplify synthesis of privileged bioactive molecules. Here we report engineered and natural methyltransferases for challenging N&#8208;(m)ethylation of heterocycles, including benzimidazoles, benzotriazoles, imidazoles and indazoles. The reactions are performed through a cyclic enzyme cascade that consists of two methyltransferases using only iodoalkanes or methyl tosylate as simple reagents. This method enables the selective synthesis of important molecules that are otherwise difficult to access, proceeds with high regioselectivity (r.r. up to &gt;99&#8201;%), yield (up to 99&#8201;%), on a preparative scale, and with nearly equimolar concentrations of simple starting materials.

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Synthetic Drug Delivery Systems for Systemic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100&#8197;years after Paul Ehrlich's vision of the &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;, the major challenges in drug delivery remain unchanged: 1)&#8197;controlling pharmacokinetic and biodistribution drug distribution and clearance in the blood; 2)&#8197;solubilizing hydrophobic agents, and 3)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. This Review describes new alternatives for synthetic drug delivery systems for systemic applications.







Abstract
Poor water solubility and low bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are major causes of friction in the pharmaceutical industry and represent a formidable hurdle for pharmaceutical drug development. Drug delivery remains the major challenge for the application of new small&#8208;molecule drugs as well as biopharmaceuticals. The three challenges for synthetic delivery systems are: (i)&#8197;controlling drug distribution and clearance in the blood; (ii)&#8197;solubilizing poorly water&#8208;soluble agents, and (iii)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. Although several polymer&#8208;based systems have addressed the first two demands and have been translated into clinical practice, no targeted synthetic drug delivery system has reached the market. This Review is designed to provide a background on the challenges and requirements for the design and translation of new polymer&#8208;based delivery systems. This report will focus on chemical approaches to drug delivery for systemic applications.

A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulated the order of hydroxide transfer. The system offers insights into bimetallic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic systems and provides a model of in situ/operando investigations on the mechanistic understanding as well as future catalysts design.







Abstract
The hetero&#8208;atomic interaction has been the subject of many investigations, due to their heterogeneity, the individual roles of the atoms are still difficult to realize. Herein, an electrocatalyst with a hetero&#8208;atomic pair confined on a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Fe3+&#8208;site of the pair is distal to the surface is shown to deliver an extremely low overpotential of 192&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and one of the highest oxygen production turnover frequencies (TOF) of 2.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mV under alkaline environment for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Operando characterization shows the Lewis acidic Fe3+ site boosts a large population of Co4+/3+ and the deprotonation of coordinated water, allowing simultaneously enhanced electron&#8208;transfer as well as the proton&#8208;transfer. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulates the order of hydroxide transfer in the pre&#8208;equilibrium step (PES) and rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS), leading to a remarkable OER performance.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of a Library of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Like &#8220;Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail&#8221; Linked Multimers for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies

New heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized where the disaccharide modules were connected from the reducing end to the non&#8208;reducing end to mimic the structures of native polysaccharides more closely. A library of 27 such &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides was prepared, which was found to exhibit similar structure&#8208;activity relationship trends as HS hexasaccharides in the binding to fibroblast growth factor 2.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) plays important roles in many biological processes. The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;activity relationship. To facilitate biological studies, a new strategy has been developed to synthesize a HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharide library, where HS disaccharides were linked in a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; fashion from the reducing end of a disaccharide module to the non&#8208;reducing end of a neighboring module. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides were achieved. This new class of compounds bound with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF&#8208;2) with similar structure&#8208;activity trends as HS oligosaccharides bearing native glycosyl linkages. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mirror natural HS activity trends suggest that the new head&#8208;to&#8208;tail linked pseudo&#8208;oligosaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.

         <title>Next Generation Opto&#8208;Jasplakinolides Enable Local Remodeling of Actin Networks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of actin dynamics in biology requires tools that can be controlled with high spatial and temporal resolution. A new photoresponsive and fast&#8208;relaxing jasplakinolide (neo&#8208;optojasp) allows for the stabilization of F&#8208;actin upon irradiation with blue&#8208;green light and provides excellent spatiotemporal control. neo&#8208;Optojasp can be useful to studying actin dynamics with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
The natural product jasplakinolide is widely used to stabilize F&#8208;actin. Based on extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, we have developed a new generation of photoswitchable jasplakinolides that feature rationally designed red&#8208;shifted azobenzene photoswitches. Our lead compound, nOJ, can be activated with longer wavelengths in the visible range (e.g. 440&#8211;475&#8197;nm) and rapidly returns to its inactive state through thermal relaxation. nOJ enables the reversible control of F&#8208;actin dynamics, as shown through live&#8208;cell imaging, cell migration, and cell proliferation assays. Short, local irradiation with blue light resulted in highly localized and reversible actin aggregation with subcellular precision. Our optical tool can be useful in diverse fields to study actin dynamics with excellent spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Addition of N&#8208;unprotected Propargylic Amines to Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the very low acidity of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds (pKa&#8776;42.6), direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones has been achieved by using a chiral pyridoxal as the carbonyl catalyst, producing a broad variety of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Direct asymmetric functionalization of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines is a big challenge in organic chemistry, due to the low acidity (pKa&#8776;42.6) of the &#945; C&#8722;H bonds and interruption of the nucleophilic NH2 group. By using a chiral pyridoxal as carbonyl catalyst, we have successfully realized direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones, producing a broad range of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in 54&#8211;84&#8201;% yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee). The &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of propargylic amines are greatly activated by the pyridoxal catalyst via the formation of an imine intermediate, resulting in the increase of acidity by up to 1022&#8197;times (from pKa&#8197;42.6 to pKa&#8197;20.1), which become acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions for the asymmetric addition. This work presented an impressive example for asymmetric functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds enabled by an organocatalyst.

         <title>Cyanine Dye Coupling Mediates Self&#8208;assembly of a pH Sensitive Peptide into Novel 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated Cy5 dye&#8208;peptide system reveals the formation of two novel and structurally distinct supramolecular assemblies with photo&#8208;physical characteristics of H&#8208;type dimers or tetramers, respectively. The molecular ultrastructures are triggered by the complementary interplay of mutual chromophore coupling and pH induced changes in the peptide charge pattern.







Abstract
Synthetic multichromophore systems are of great importance in artificial light harvesting devices, organic optoelectronics, tumor imaging and therapy. Here, we introduce a promising strategy for the construction of self&#8208;assembled peptide templated dye stacks based on coupling of a de novo designed pH sensitive peptide with a cyanine dye Cy5 at its N&#8208;terminus. Microscopic techniques, in particular cryogenic TEM (cryo&#8208;TEM) and cryo&#8208;electron tomography technique (cryo&#8208;ET), reveal two types of highly ordered three&#8208;dimensional assembly structures on the micrometer scale. Unbranched compact layered rods are observed at pH&#8197;7.4 and two&#8208;dimensional membrane&#8208;like assemblies at pH&#8197;3.4, both species displaying spectral features of H&#8208;aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the coupling of Cy5 moieties promotes the formation of both ultrastructures, whereas the protonation states of acidic and basic amino acid side chains dictates their ultimate three&#8208;dimensional organization.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Oligopeptides by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Radical Addition to Dehydroalanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical addition to the dehydroalanine (Dha) residue of a peptide could diversify the peptide sequence with noncanonical residues, but this strategy is currently limited by the lack of control over the stereochemistry. This work addresses this important challenge by applying chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselective radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides.







Abstract
Radical addition to dehydroalanine (Dha) represents an appealing, modular strategy to access non&#8208;canonical peptide analogues for drug discovery. Prior studies on radical addition to the Dha residue of peptides and proteins have demonstrated outstanding functional group compatibility, but the lack of stereoselectivity has limited the synthetic utility of this approach. Herein, we address this challenge by employing chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselectivity of radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides. The conditions accommodate a variety of primary and secondary electrophiles to introduce polyethylene glycol, biotin, halo&#8208;tag, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains to the peptide. The reaction features catalyst control to largely override substrate&#8208;based control of stereochemical outcome for modification of short peptides. We anticipate that the discovery of chiral nickel complexes that confer catalyst control will allow rapid, late&#8208;stage modification of peptides featuring nonnatural sidechains.

         <title>A Sonication&#8208;Activated Valence&#8208;Variable Sono&#8208;Sensitizer/Catalyst for Autography Inhibition/Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the tumor microenvironment, we developed a versatile sono&#8208;sensitizer/catalyst that can realize ultrasound&#8208;responsive spatiotemporal chemodynamic therapy coupled with sonodynamic therapy. The presented nanoplatform thereby provides a feasible and efficient tumor theranostic modality with remarkable outcome and biosafety.







Abstract
The effective deployment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated oncotherapy in practice remains challenging, mired by uncontrollable catalytic processes, stern reaction conditions and safety concerns. Herein, we develop a copper nanodot integrating sonodynamic and catalytic effects within one active center, which responds to exogenous ultrasound (US) and endogenous H2O2 stimuli. US irradiation induces the valence conversion from CuII to CuI catalyzing H2O2 into &#8901;OH for chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, valence transformation results in electron&#8208;hole pairs separation, promoting ROS generation for sonodynamic therapy. Notably, copper nanodots not only block lysosome fusion and degradation leading to autophagy flux blockage, but also interfere with the glutathione peroxidase 4 and cystine&#8208;glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 function achieving ferroptosis. Furthermore, reversible valence changes, inherent hydrophilicity and renal clearance ultrasmall size guarantee biosafety.

         <title>Expanded Sequence Space of Radical S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rSAM enzymes are known to catalyze diverse crosslink formation in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Here, we develop a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO) to reveal the untapped biosynthetic landscape of rSAM&#8208;modified RiPPs and characterize cyclophane&#8208;forming enzymes that catalyze various tyrosine/histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain crosslinks.







Abstract
Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent one of the largest but primarily underexplored natural product families in bacteria. The genetically encoded nature of RiPPs simplifies the prediction and prioritization of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). We report a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO), which allowed us to identify 32&#8201;220 prospective rSAM&#8208;catalyzed RiPP BGCs from 161&#8201;954 bacterial genomes and prioritize 25 families with new biosynthetic architectures or precursor patterns. We characterized three new enzymes that respectively catalyze cysteine&#8208;glycine (BlaB), histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain (ScaB), and tyrosine/histidine&#8208;arginine (VguB) cross&#8208;links. The cyclophane&#8208;forming enzyme ScaB exhibits broad substrate selectivity, allowing it to catalyze diverse triceptide formation. These results demonstrate the strength of the SPECO workflow in discovering new enzymes for peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>From a Metal&#8211;Organic Square to a Robust and Regenerable Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly for Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a metal&#8211;organic square, a robust and renewable polyhedron&#8208;based framework material is assembled with potential for CH4 purification from natural gas and CO2 capture from industrial off&#8208;gas.







Abstract
Porous supramolecular assemblies constructed by noncovalent interactions are promising for adsorptive purification of methane because of their easy regeneration. However, the poor stability arising from the weak noncovalent interactions has obstructed their practical applications. Here, we report a robust and easily regenerated polyhedron&#8208;based cationic framework assembled from a metal&#8211;organic square. This material exhibits a very low affinity for CH4 and N2, but captures other competing gases (e.g. C2H6, C3H8, and CO2) with a moderate affinity. These results underpin highly selective separation of a range of gas mixtures that are relevant to natural gas and industrial off&#8208;gas. Dynamic breakthrough studies demonstrate its practical separation for C2H6/CH4, C3H8/CH4, CO2/N2, and CO2/CH4. Particularly, the separation time is &#8776;11&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C2H6/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture and &#8776;49&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C3H8/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture (under a flow of 2.0&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1), respectively, enabling its capability for CH4 purification from light alkanes.

         <title>Sustainable Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wacker&#8208;type oxidations afford highly value&#8208;added carbonyl compounds starting from readily available olefins and using scarce and expensive palladium catalysts at high dioxygen pressures and elevated temperatures. The last few years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the development of procedures that operate under mild conditions, as discussed in this Minireview. These procedures are based on more abundant and affordable, first&#8208;row transition metals, including metal&#8208;free processes.







Abstract
The Wacker reaction is the oxidation of olefins to ketones and typically requires expensive and scarce palladium catalysts in the presence of an additional copper co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions (acidic media, high pressure of air/dioxygen, elevated temperatures). Such a transformation is relevant for industry, as shown by the synthesis of acetaldehyde from ethylene as well as for fine&#8208;chemicals, because of the versatility of a carbonyl group placed at specific positions. In this regard, many contributions have focused on controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the olefin oxidation by means of well&#8208;defined palladium catalysts under different sets of reaction conditions. However, the development of Wacker&#8208;type processes that avoid the use of palladium catalysts has just emerged in the last few years, thereby paving the way for the generation of more sustainable procedures, including milder reaction conditions and green chemistry technologies. In this Minireview, we discuss the development of new catalytic processes that utilize more benign catalysts and sustainable reaction conditions.

However, the development of Wacker-type processes that avoid the use of palladium catalysts has just emerged in the last few years, thereby paving the way for the generation of more sustainable procedures, including milder reaction conditions and green chemistry technologies. In this Minireview, we discuss the development of new catalytic processes that utilize more benign catalysts and sustainable reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Hybridization of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Membranes for Intrinsic Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic aperture size of the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) is realized by embedding graphene nanoribbons into the crystal. Particularly, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; is observed for the ZIF&#8208;8, resulting in sharp H2/CO2 separation. The atomistic molecular transport mechanism is investigated with molecular dynamics simulation.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are promising for gas separation membrane, but their molecular cut&#8208;off differs from that expected from its intrinsic aperture structure because of their flexibility. Herein, we introduced graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to rigidify the ZIF framework. Because the sp2 edge of the GNRs induces strong anchoring effects, the modified layer can be rigidified. Particularly, when the GNRs were embedded and distributed in the ZIF&#8208;8 layer, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; was observed, resulting in high H2/CO2 separation (H2 permeance: 5.2&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;mol/m2&#8201;Pa&#8201;s, ideal selectivity: 142). The performance surpasses the upper bound of polycrystalline MOF membrane performance. In addition, the membrane can be applied to blue H2 production, as demonstrated with a simulated steam reformed gas containing H2/CO2/CH4. The separation performance was retained in the presence of water. The fundamentals of the molecular transport through the rigid ZIF&#8208;8 framework were revealed using molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Direct TEM Observation of Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Heteroatom Incorporation into a Zeolite Framework: Towards Microscopic Design of Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In zeolite YNU&#8208;2, point vacancies and titanium active sites at specific framework positions act as cooperative binding sites. Titanium&#8208;substituted YNU&#8208;2 (Ti&#8208;YNU&#8208;2) with a pre&#8208;designed titanium distribution, was synthesized from YNU&#8208;2 by vacancy&#8208;mediated heteroatom incorporation. Transmission electron microscopy enables direct imaging at atomic scale and provided precise structural information to understand the post&#8208;synthesis process.







Abstract
Incorporating hetero&#8208;metal&#8208;atom, e.g., titanium, into zeolite frameworks can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidation reactions. However, the rational design of zeolites containing titanium at specific sites is difficult because the precise atomic structure during synthesis process remained unclear. Here, a titanosilicate with predictable titanium distribution was synthesized by mediating vacancies in a defective MSE&#8208;type zeolite precursor, based on a pre&#8208;designed synthetic route including modification of vacancies followed by titanium insertion, where electron microscopy (EM) plays a key role at each step resolving the atomic structure. Point defects including vacancies in the precursor and titanium incorporated into the vacancy&#8208;related positions have been directly observed. The results provide insights into the role of point defects in zeolites towards the rational synthesis of zeolites with desired microscopic arrangement of catalytically active sites.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Performance Lithium/Sodium&#8208;Iodine Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked with Ti3C2Tx MXene was designed and adopted as the electrodes with excellent cyclic stability and rate&#8208;performances for Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries application.







Abstract
The rechargeable lithium/sodium&#8208;iodine battery (Li/Na&#8208;I2) is a promising candidate for meeting the growing energy demand. Herein, a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked to the Ti3C2Tx MXene complex (HOF@Ti3C2Tx) has been presented for iodine loading. HOF is self&#8208;assembled by organic monomers through hydrogen bonding interactions between each monomer. It leads to numerous cavities in HOF structure, which can encapsulate iodine through various adsorptive sites and intermolecular interactions. The unique structure of complex can accelerate the nucleation of iodine, achieve fast reaction kinetics, stabilize iodide and retard the shuttle effect, thus improving the cycling stability of I2&#8208;based batteries. The I2/HOF@Ti3C2Tx exhibits large reversible capacities of 260.2 and 207.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C after repeated cycling for Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries, respectively. This work can gain insights into the HOF&#8208;related energy storage application with reversible iodine encapsulation and its related redox reaction mechanisms with Li and Na metal ions.

         <title>Surface Degradation of Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Cathode and Regulation Mechanism by Atomic Layer Deposition in Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the surface mechanism on the single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (SC&#8208;NCM) cathode are disclosed by in situ atomic force microscopy in solid&#8208;state batteries. Via atomic layer deposition, the Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM, leading to the uniform formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase and suppression of undesired side reaction, which endows batteries with enhanced interfacial stability, durability and dynamics.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode (SC&#8208;NCM) has attracted increasing interest owing to its greater capacity retention in advanced solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), while suffers from severe interfacial instability during cycling. Here, via atomic layer deposition, Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM (L&#8208;NCM), to suppress undesired side reaction and enhance interfacial stability. The dynamic degradation and surface regulation of SC&#8208;NCM are investigated inside a working SSLB by in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). We directly observe the uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and surface defects on pristine SC&#8208;NCM particle. Remarkably, the formed amorphous LiF&#8208;rich CEI on L&#8208;NCM maintains its initial structure upon cycling, and thus endows the battery with improved cycling stability and excellent rate capability. Such on&#8208;site tracking provides deep insights into surface mechanism and structure&#8211;reactivity correlation of SC&#8208;NCM, and thus benefits the optimizations of SSLBs.

         <title>Photoresponsive Dissipative Macrocycles Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of fluorinated, visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable azobenzenes in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, enabled the creation of a library of macrocyclic compounds that include highly strained, metastable, and dissipative systems. These studies give a detailed insight into photoresponsive dissipative systems and the vast potential of using azobenzenes in dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium.

&lt;p&gt;Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium. We studied a fluorinated azobenzene building block that reliably undergoes geometric isomerism upon irradiation. The building block was used in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and &lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-diaminocyclohexane, to create a library of imine macrocycles. Whereas the simple amine can be used to access a polymeric state and a defined bowl-shaped macrocycle, the chiral amine gives access to a rich network of macrocycles that undergo both isomerisation as well as interconversion between different macrocyclic species, thereby allowing for control over the number of monomers involved in the cyclo-oligomerization; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H- and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-DOSY NMR, MALDI-MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy were used to study the processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remote Editing of Stacked Aromatic Assemblies for Heteroannular C&#8722;H Functionalization by a Palladium Switch between Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient ligand&#8208;enabled palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination and allylation of stacked aromatic assemblies has been developed, in which the remote heteroannular site over the proximal homoannular site is functionalized. Mechanistic investigations support an olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
An approach allowing remote editing of stacked aromatic assemblies for heteroannular C&#8722;H functionalization would represent a transformative chemical toolbox that may make the diversification of complex molecules in a straightforward manner. However, such a C&#8722;H activation is usually less kinetically and thermodynamically favorable than homoannular ortho C&#8722;H activation and remains a fundamental challenge. Herein we disclose an engineer's approach, using a transient ligand as an interim bridge between two aryl rings (analogues to mountaintops) to anchor the metal center on the remote heteroannular C&#8722;H bond. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination of stacked aromatic assemblies with olefins and allylation with vinyl acetates using L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine acid as a transient ligand. Mechanistic investigations suggest an unusual olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirosilabicyclohexenes by Asymmetric Dual Ring Expansion of Spirosilabicyclobutane with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirosilabicyclobutanes undergoes asymmetric dual ring expansion with alkynes to provide homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;disubstituted spirosilabicyclohexenes, possessing axially chiral 6/6&#8208;silaspirane framework, in good yields with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Silaspiranes have attracted particular attention due to their chiral spiro&#8208;silicon center, which serves as an ideal carbon isostere and can endow spiro&#8208;analogs with distinct properties. Distinct from previously reported cyclization or cycloaddition strategies to form 5/5&#8208;silaspiranes, we report herein the asymmetric dual ring expansion of spirosilabicyclobutanes with alkynes to synthesize axially chiral spirosilabicyclohexenes bearing a novel 6/6&#8208;silaspirane framework. DFT (density functional theory) calculations provide the deep insight into the origin of the high enantioselectivity controlled by the sterically demanding binaphthyl phosphoramidite ligand. Preliminary studies of chiroptical properties indicate that one of the spirosilabicyclohexene analogs exhibit fluorescence emission, Cotton effects and CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) activity.

         <title>Spontaneous Assembly and Three&#8208;Dimensional Stacking of Antiaromatic 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin on HOPG</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous assembly of antiaromatic meso&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin (DOP&#8208;1) has been studied at the liquid&#8208;solid interface to elucidate its polymorphism in a monolayer and the facile formation of the stacked layer. The study of the intrinsic electronic structures of the stacked bilayer by scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed a narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap compared to the monolayer, thus suggesting significant molecular orbital interactions.







Abstract
Antiaromatic compounds have recently received considerable attention because of their novel properties such as narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and facile formation of mutual stacking. Here, the spontaneous assembly of antiaromatic meso&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin (DOP&#8208;1) is scrutinized at the liquid&#8208;solid interface by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Polymorphism in monolayers characterized by the orthogonal and parallel assemblies is found at the low concentration of 0.05&#8197;mM. The parallel assembly is more stable and dominantly formed at higher concentrations. Aggregation was observed at concentrations &gt;0.2&#8197;mM, and the STM images of the aggregates implied the formation of stacked layers. The intrinsic electronic structures of the mutually stacked bilayer generated by applying an electric pulse to the monolayer were probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy to reveal the narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap by about 20&#8201;% compared with the monolayer, thus suggesting significant molecular orbital interactions.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Regulated Multi&#8208;State Long&#8208;Lived Emission from Star&#8208;Shaped Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;state long&#8208;lived emission has been obtained by regulating the molecular motions of star&#8208;shaped molecules. Reverse intersystem crossing assisted by the T2 state of the star&#8208;shaped molecules leads to thermally activated delayed fluorescence in solution and the solid state. Suppressing the molecular motions of the dye in a polymer leads to ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
How to utilize molecular vibration to tune triplet&#8208;involved emissions in multiple states is highly challenging. Here, star&#8208;shaped triphenylamine derivatives have been employed as model systems to understand how molecular vibration affects thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions in multiple states. Nonplanar, star&#8208;shaped conformations allow molecules to generate appropriate vibrations in the solution state, facilitating vibronic coupling between their T1 and T2 states to generate effective TADF. More importantly, a relatively dispersed state can allow the molecules to efficiently vibrate in the solid state, and a crystalline environment further promotes a more efficient TADF. Lastly, by suppressing molecular vibration to inhibit the TADF, ultra&#8208;long RTP was observed upon doping these molecules into polymers. These molecules can be used in information encryption and storage as well as bioimaging.

         <title>Formation of CuMn Prussian Blue Analog Double&#8208;Shelled Nanoboxes Toward Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;PBA double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs) are rationally designed and fabricated through efficient tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches. Benefiting from the distinctive hollow structures, Cu substitution, and Mn vacancies, the CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs electrode shows improved Zn ion storage properties with high reversible capacity, impressive rate capability, and superior cycling stability.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising candidates for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to their unique open&#8208;framework structures. However, they suffer from limited capacity and severe capacity decay originating from insufficient redox sites and structural instability. Herein, Cu&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;PBA double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs) prepared by tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches are demonstrated for efficient Zn ion storage. The unique hollow structures can expose abundant active sites and alleviate the volume change during the cycling test. Moreover, partial Cu substitution and induced Mn vacancies might inhibit the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions of Mn&#8208;N6 octahedra, thus contributing to the prolonged lifespan. As a result, CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs exhibit high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage mechanism of CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs mainly involves the reversible redox reactions of transition metals and Zn2+ ion insertion/extraction processes.

&lt;p&gt;Cu-substituted Mn-PBA double-shelled nanoboxes (CuMn-PBA DSNBs) are rationally designed and fabricated through efficient tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches. Benefiting from the distinctive hollow structures, Cu substitution, and Mn vacancies, the CuMn-PBA DSNBs electrode shows improved Zn ion storage properties with high reversible capacity, impressive rate capability, and superior cycling stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising candidates for aqueous Zn-ion batteries due to their unique open-framework structures. However, they suffer from limited capacity and severe capacity decay originating from insufficient redox sites and structural instability. Herein, Cu-substituted Mn-PBA double-shelled nanoboxes (CuMn-PBA DSNBs) prepared by tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches are demonstrated for efficient Zn ion storage. The unique hollow structures can expose abundant active sites and alleviate the volume change during the cycling test. Moreover, partial Cu substitution and induced Mn vacancies might inhibit the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions of Mn-N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra, thus contributing to the prolonged lifespan. As a result, CuMn-PBA DSNBs exhibit high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage mechanism of CuMn-PBA DSNBs mainly involves the reversible redox reactions of transition metals and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion insertion/extraction processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Parent Core Engineering for Six&#8208;Level System Lasing Toward 900 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A six&#8208;level system lasing toward 900&#8197;nm was achieved with a low lasing threshold of 27.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 through engineering of the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) parent core. This work demonstrates that extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the ESIPT parent core can effectively enhance the second proton transfer process in a cascaded double ESIPT system.







Abstract
Organic molecules which can undergo excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process have been considered as ideal gain materials for near&#8208;infrared organic lasers owing to their effective four&#8208;level systems. However, extending lasing wavelength beyond 800&#8197;nm with present ESIPT&#8208;active gain materials is still in challenge. Herein, we established a molecular design strategy that operates via extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the ESIPT parent core to enhance the cascaded double ESIPT process and thus to achieve the red&#8208;shifted six&#8208;level system lasing. Concretely, a model molecule with 1,9&#8208;dihydroxyanthracene as the ESIPT parent core was designed and synthesized, which was proved to undergo twice cascaded ESIPT processes while the 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene&#8208;based analogue can only undergo once ESIPT process based on DFT calculations and ultrafast dynamics analyses. Finally, a six&#8208;level system lasing toward 900&#8197;nm was achieved with a low threshold of 27.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>An Ultraviolet Fluorophore with Narrowed Emission via Coplanar Molecular Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coplanar strategy using indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ) simultaneously achieves narrowed emission and ultraviolet (UV) emission in fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and a synthetic shortcut is carried out to efficiently obtain the target coplanar ICZ derivatives. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) shows UV emission with peaks below 400&#8197;nm and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) both in photoluminescence and electroluminescence, achieving best results among fluorescent UV&#8208;OLEDs.







Abstract
Narrowband emitting fluorophores exhibit immense potentials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, it's still hard to simultaneously realize short&#8208;wavelength ultraviolet (UV) or near ultraviolet emission (NUV) while maintaining a narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) value, and rare work focus on such challenging pursuit. Herein, an ingenious synthetic method was devised to achieve emitters with coplanar structure. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) was designed to realize narrowed UV emission both in photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) which benefited from the suppression of vibronic coupling. UV/NUV OLEDs based on ICZ&#8208;TAZ achieve external quantum efficiency (EQE) maximums of 3.26&#8201;% peaks @ 388&#8197;nm and 4.02&#8201;% peaks @ 406&#8197;nm with small FWHM of 32&#8197;nm and 46&#8197;nm, respectively, corresponding with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off at luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Fluorinated Tetraarylethenes: Universal Tags for the Synthesis of Solid State Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method for the coupling of fluorinated tetraarylethens to a wide range of substrates is described. The approach allows converting amino acids, bioactive compounds, carbohydrates, steroids, and polymers in one step into solid state luminogens.







Abstract
The aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties of tetraarylethenes (TAEs) have led to numerous applications in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Herein, we describe two fluorinated tetraarylethenes, which can be employed as universal tags for the synthesis of solid state luminogens. The tags are accessible in one or two steps from commercially available starting materials. Facile coupling reactions with ubiquitous substrates such as thiols, alcohols, amines, phosphines, aldehydes, and enamines allow preparing a wide range of TAE conjugates, including tagged amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, steroids, and commercial polymers.

         <title>Discovery of a Thioxanthone&#8211;TfOH Complex as a Photoredox Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Alkenes Using p&#8208;Xylene as both Electron and Hydrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic photoredox catalyst was discovered by simply adding a catalytic amount of TfOH as a co&#8208;catalyst to readily available thioxanthone. The new catalyst, 9&#8208;HTXTF, shows a sufficiently long singlet lifetime and adequately strong oxidation potential, as well as relatively facile photoexcitation, with applications in the hydrogenation and deuteration of carbonylated alkenes.







Abstract
Hydrogenation of alkenes is one of the most fundamental transformations in organic synthesis, and widely used in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Although numerous hydrogenation methods have been developed, novel types of catalysis with new mechanisms and new hydrogen sources are still desirable. Thioxanthone (TX) is widely used in energy&#8208;transfer photoreactions, but rarely in photoredox processes. Herein we show that a catalytic amount of TfOH as a co&#8208;catalyst can tune the properties of TX to make it a photoredox catalyst with highly enhanced oxidative capability in the hydrogenation of carbonylated alkenes with the cheap petroleum industrial product p&#8208;xylene serving as the hydrogen source. Deuterium can also be introduced by this method by using D2O as the D source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of using p&#8208;xylene as a hydrogen source.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Control of Topochemical Polymer Single Crystals with Tunable Elastic Modulus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reactive single crystals of bis(indandione) derivatives were carefully functionalized by controlling side chain length as well as introducing different end groups on the side chains. While maintaining topochemical reactivities, modifying side chains can significantly affect polymerization kinetics and enhance polymer elastic modulus. Furthermore, polymer single crystals could be processed into free&#8208;standing and robust thin films.







Abstract
Topochemical polymerizations hold the promise of producing high molecular weight and stereoregular single crystalline polymers by first aligning monomers before polymerization. However, monomer modifications often alter the crystal packing and result in non&#8208;reactive polymorphs. Here, we report a systematic study on the side chain functionalization of the bis(indandione) derivative system that can be polymerized under visible light. Precisely engineered side chains help organize the monomer crystals in a one&#8208;dimensional fashion to maintain the topochemical reactivity. By optimizing the side chain length and end group of monomers, the elastic modulus of the resulting polymer single crystals can also be greatly enhanced. Lastly, using ultrasonication, insoluble polymer single crystals can be processed into free&#8208;standing and robust polymer thin films. This work provides new insights on the molecular design of topochemical reactions and paves the way for future applications of this fascinating family of materials.

     alt="Side-Chain Control of Topochemical Polymer Single Crystals with Tunable Elastic Modulus"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topochemical reactive single crystals of bis(indandione) derivatives were carefully functionalized by controlling side chain length as well as introducing different end groups on the side chains. While maintaining topochemical reactivities, modifying side chains can significantly affect polymerization kinetics and enhance polymer elastic modulus. Furthermore, polymer single crystals could be processed into free-standing and robust thin films.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topochemical polymerizations hold the promise of producing high molecular weight and stereoregular single crystalline polymers by first aligning monomers before polymerization. However, monomer modifications often alter the crystal packing and result in non-reactive polymorphs. Here, we report a systematic study on the side chain functionalization of the bis(indandione) derivative system that can be polymerized under visible light. Precisely engineered side chains help organize the monomer crystals in a one-dimensional fashion to maintain the topochemical reactivity. By optimizing the side chain length and end group of monomers, the elastic modulus of the resulting polymer single crystals can also be greatly enhanced. Lastly, using ultrasonication, insoluble polymer single crystals can be processed into free-standing and robust polymer thin films. This work provides new insights on the molecular design of topochemical reactions and paves the way for future applications of this fascinating family of materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Operando Laboratory&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Edge X&#8208;Ray Absorption Near&#8208;Edge Spectroscopy of Solid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando laboratory&#8208;based multi&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES) offers possibilities for advanced catalyst characterization, as demonstrated for mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic CO2 hydrogenation catalysts consisting of Ni, Cu, and Fe. Synergistic effects during catalyst reduction and their influence on catalytic performance were unraveled, guiding rational design of multielement solid catalysts for various applications.







Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and especially X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) offers new opportunities in catalyst characterization and presents not only an alternative, but also a complementary approach to precious beamtime at synchrotron facilities. We successfully designed a laboratory&#8208;based setup for performing operando, quasi&#8208;simultaneous XANES analysis at multiple K&#8208;edges, more specifically, operando XANES of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic CO2 hydrogenation catalysts containing Ni, Fe, and Cu. Detailed operando XANES studies of the multielement solid catalysts revealed metal&#8208;dependent differences in the reducibility and re&#8208;oxidation behavior and their influence on the catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation. The applicability of operando laboratory&#8208;based XANES at multiple K&#8208;edges paves the way for advanced multielement catalyst characterization complementing detailed studies at synchrotron facilities.

         <title>Nitrene&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Oxygenation: Catalytic Enantioselective Formation of Five&#8208;Membered Cyclic Organic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the synthesis of non&#8208;racemic cyclic carbonates from abundant alcohol feedstocks is presented. The method exploits an unusual nitrene&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H oxygenation via a proposed 1,7&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT).







Abstract
The synthesis of non&#8208;racemic 5&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates from abundant alcohols is reported. Conversion of the alcohol into an azanyl carbonate is followed by a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalyzed cyclization to provide chiral cyclic carbonates in yields of up to 95&#8201;% and with up to 99&#8201;% ee. This new synthetic method is proposed to proceed through a nitrene&#8208;mediated intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H oxygenation which includes an unusual 1,7&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer within a ruthenium nitrene intermediate. The method is applicable to the synthesis of non&#8208;racemic chiral mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted cyclic alkylene carbonates.

         <title>FRET Monitoring of a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Elongation Module Reveals Carrier Protein Shuttling between Catalytic Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Translocation of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) between two catalytic domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) has been studied for the first time. Monitoring PCP interaction with A and C domains during catalysis using two FRET sensors of an elongation module revealed conformational population shifts that correlate with the directionality of synthesis. The first light&#8208;controlled NRPS was created to further probe and support this model.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) employ multiple domains, specifically arranged in modules, for the assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis of a plethora of bioactive peptides. It is poorly understood how catalysis is correlated with the domain interplay and associated conformational changes. We developed FRET sensors of an elongation module to study in solution the intramodular interactions of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) with adenylation (A) and condensation (C) domains. Backed by HDX&#8208;MS analysis, we discovered dynamic mixtures of conformations that undergo distinct population changes in favor of the PCP&#8208;A and PCP&#8208;C interactions upon completion of the adenylation and thiolation reactions, respectively. To probe this model we blocked PCP binding to the C domain by photocaging and triggered peptide bond formation with light. Changing intramodular domain affinities of the PCP appear to result in conformational shifts according to the logic of the templated assembly process.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Iodine Uptake by a Molecular Host&#8901;Guest Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrated and molecular porous host&#8901;guest crystal (PHGC&#8208;1) made of cucurbit[8]uril and trimethoxybenzylazaphosphatrane can adsorb iodine spontaneously and selectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The absence of a)&#8197;heat for material synthesis, b)&#8197;moisture sensitivity, and c)&#8197;energy&#8208;intensive steps for pore activation are very attractive attributes of this new generation of energy&#8208;saving porous materials.







Abstract
Recently, porous organic crystals (POC) based on macrocycles have shown exceptional sorption and separation properties. Yet, the impact of guest presence inside a macrocycle prior to adsorption has not been studied. Here we show that the inclusion of trimethoxybenzyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane in the macrocycle cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) affords molecular porous host&#8901;guest crystals (PHGC&#8208;1) with radically new properties. Unactivated hydrated PHGC&#8208;1 adsorbed iodine spontaneously and selectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The absence of (i)&#8197;heat for material synthesis, (ii)&#8197;moisture sensitivity, and (iii)&#8197;energy&#8208;intensive steps for pore activation are attractive attributes for decreasing the energy costs. 1H&#8197;NMR and DOSY were instrumental for monitoring the H2O/I2 exchange. PHGC&#8208;1 crystals are non&#8208;centrosymmetric and I2&#8208;doped crystals showed markedly different second harmonic generation (SHG), which suggests that iodine doping could be used to modulate the non&#8208;linear optical properties of porous organic crystals.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Cluster Embedded Necklace&#8208;Shaped Nanohoops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Necklace&#8208;like nanohoops with an embedded carborane have been synthesized. The nanohoops functionalized by nido&#8208;o&#8208;carborane show excellent fluorescence emission properties, with a solution quantum yield of up to 90&#8201;% and a high solid&#8208;state quantum efficiency (87.3&#8201;%), which offer applications in OLEDs and bioimaging.







Abstract
The combination of carbon&#8208;based nanohoops with other functional organic molecular structures should lead to the design of new molecular configurations with interesting properties. Here, necklace&#8208;like nanohoops embedded with carborane were synthesized for the first time. The unique deboronization of o&#8208;carborane has led to the facile preparation of ionic nanohoop compounds. Nanohoops functionalized by nido&#8208;o&#8208;carborane show excellent fluorescence emission, with a solution quantum yield of up to 90.0&#8201;% in THF and a solid&#8208;state quantum efficiency of 87.3&#8201;%, which opens an avenue for the applications of the nanohoops in OLEDs and bioimaging.

Nanohoops functionalized by &lt;i&gt;nido&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane show excellent fluorescence emission, with a solution quantum yield of up to 90.0&#8201;% in THF and a solid-state quantum efficiency of 87.3&#8201;%, which opens an avenue for the applications of the nanohoops in OLEDs and bioimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synchronizing Two Distinct Nano&#8208;Circular Sliding Motions in Six&#8208;Component Machinery for Double Catalysis</title>

The speed synchronization of two slider&#8208;on&#8208;deck systems, each activating a catalytic unit through circular motion, leads to synergistic effects in the catalytic turnover of a double catalysis.







Abstract
The heteroleptic multi&#8208;component double slider&#8208;on&#8208;deck system DS3 exhibits tight coupling of motional speed of two distinct nano&#8208;circular sliders (k298=77 and 41&#8197;kHz) despite a 2.2&#8197;nm separation. In comparison, the single sliders in DS1 and DS2 move at vastly different speed (k298=1.1 vs. 350&#8197;kHz). Synchronization of the motions in DS3 remains even when one slows the movement of the faster slider using small molecular brake pads. In contrast to the individual DS1 and DS2 systems, DS3 is a powerful catalyst for a two&#8208;step reaction by using the motion of both sliders to drive two catalytic processes.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, 2&#8208;chlorothioxanthone (2&#8208;CTX) triplet energy sensitization of simple acrylamides enables facile access to a diverse range of &#946;&#8208;lactam products. The reaction proceeds through triplet sensitization of the C&#8722;C olefin moiety and features a C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization through a biradical carbon&#8208;to&#8208;carbon 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. The proposed mechanism is supported by deuterium labelling experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;azetidinones (&#946;&#8208;lactams) from simple acrylamide starting materials by visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated energy transfer catalysis is reported. The reaction features a C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization via a variation of the Norrish&#8211;Yang photocyclization involving a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;carbon 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (supported by deuterium labelling and DFT calculations) and can be used for the construction of a diverse range of &#946;&#8208;lactam products.

         <title>Expansion of the Catalytic Repertoire of Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Plant Metabolism
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medium chain alcohol dehydrogenases usually perform a reversible 1,2&#8208;reduction of aldehydes to form the corresponding alcohols. Here we show how the active site of these dehydrogenases can be modified to perform 1,2&#8208;reduction of iminium moieties, as well 1,4&#8208;reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminium groups and 1,4&#8208;reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) comprise a highly conserved enzyme family that catalyse the reversible reduction of aldehydes. However, recent discoveries in plant natural product biosynthesis suggest that the catalytic repertoire of ADHs has been expanded. Here we report the crystal structure of dihydroprecondylocarpine acetate synthase (DPAS), an ADH that catalyses the non&#8208;canonical 1,4&#8208;reduction of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminium moiety. Comparison with structures of plant&#8208;derived ADHs suggest the 1,4&#8208;iminium reduction does not require a proton relay or the presence of a catalytic zinc ion in contrast to canonical 1,2&#8208;aldehyde reducing ADHs that require the catalytic zinc and a proton relay. Furthermore, ADHs that catalysed 1,2&#8208;iminium reduction required the presence of the catalytic zinc and the loss of the proton relay. This suggests how the ADH active site can be modified to perform atypical carbonyl reductions, providing insight into how chemical reactions are diversified in plant metabolism.

         <title>Boosting Ethane/Ethylene Separation by MOFs through the Amino&#8208;Functionalization of Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By virtue of a pore engineering strategy based on isoreticular chemistry, an amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with suitable pore confinement and more binding sites improved the ethane/ethylene separation performance compared to the parent MOF.







Abstract
Adsorption technology based on ethane&#8208;selective materials is a promising alternative to energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation for separating ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4). We employed a pore engineering strategy to tune the pore environment of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) through organic functional groups and boosted the C2H6/C2H4 separation of the MOF. Introduction of amino (&#8722;NH2) groups into Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76 not only decreased pore sizes but also facilitated multiple guest&#8208;host interactions in confined pores. The NH2&#8208;functionalized Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76(NH2) has increased C2H6 and C2H4 uptakes and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. The results of experimental and simulated transient breakthroughs reveal that Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76(NH2) has significantly improved one&#8208;step separation performance for C2H6/C2H4 mixtures with a high C2H4 (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) productivity of 17.66&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 compared to 7.53&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 by Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76, resulting from the suitable pore confinement and accessible &#8722;NH2 groups on pore surfaces.

         <title>Cesium Amide&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Deuteration of Benzylic C&#8208;H Bonds with D2 and Application for Tritiation of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) represents one of the most attractive labeling methods to synthesize deuterium&#8208; and tritium&#8208;labeled compounds. Catalytic HIE methods that enable site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H bond activation and exchange labeling with gaseous isotopes D2 and T2 are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals. As part of our interest in exploring s&#8208;block metals for catalytic transformations, we found CsN(SiMe3)2 to be an efficient catalyst for selective HIE of benzylic C&#8211;H bonds with D2 gas. The reaction proceeds through a kinetic deprotonative equilibrium that establishes an exchange pathway between C&#8211;H bonds and D2 gas. By virtue of multiple C&#8211;H bonds activation and high activity (isotope enrichment up to 99%), the simple cesium amide catalyst provided a very powerful and practically convenient labeling protocol for synthesis of highly deuterated compounds and high&#8208;specific&#8208;activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Protonation Kinetics&#8208;Dependent Selectivity in Nitrogen Electroreduction: Achieving 75.05% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While higher selectivity of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia (NH3) is always achieved in alkali, the selectivity dependence on nitrogen (N2) protonation and mechanisms therein are unrevealed. Herein, we profile how the NRR selectivity theoretically relies upon the first protonation that is collectively regulated by proton (H) abundance and adsorption&#8208;desorption, along with intermediate&#8208;*NNH formation. By incorporating electronic metal modulators (M=Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) in nitrogenase&#8208;imitated model&#8208;iron polysulfide (FeSx), a series of FeMSx catalysts with tailorable protonation kinetics are obtained. The key intermediates behaviors traced by in&#8208;situ FT&#8208;IR and Raman spectroscopy and operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrate the strong protonation kinetics&#8208;dependent selectivity that mathematically follows a log&#8208;linear Bradley curve. Strikingly, FeCuSx exhibits a record&#8208;high selectivity of 75.05% at &#8722;0.1 V (vs. RHE) for NH3 production in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbon Nanotube Binding Bis(pyrenylstyryl)BODIPY&#8208;C60 Nano Tweezer: Charge Stabilization through Sequential Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron donor&#8208;acceptor (DA) hybrids comprised of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are promising functional materials for light energy conversion. However, the DA hybrids built on SWCNT have failed to reveal the much&#8208;sought long&#8208;lived charge separation (CS) due to the close proximity of the DA entities facilitating charge recombination. Here, we address this issue and report an elegant strategy to build multi&#8208;modular DA hybrids capable of producing long&#8208;lived CS states. For this, a nano tweezer featuring V&#8208;shape configured bis(pyrenylstyryl)BODIPY was synthesized to host SWCNTs of different diameters via &#960;&#8208;stacking. Supported by spectral, electrochemical, and computational studies, the established energy scheme revealed the possibility of sequential electron transfer. Systematic pump&#8208;probe studies covering wide spatial and temporal scales provided evidence of CS from the initial 1BODIPY* ultimately resulting in C60 .&#8208; &#8208;BODIPY&#8208;SWCNT .+  CS states of lifetimes in the 20&#8208;microsecond range.</dc:description>

         <title>Organizing Enzymes on Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Cages for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells use self&#8208;assembled biomaterials such as lipid membranes or proteinaceous shells to coordinate thousands of reactions that simultaneously take place within crowed spaces. However, mimicking such spatial organization for synthetic applications in engineered systems remains challenge, resulting in inferior catalytic efficiency. In this work, we show that protein cages as an ideal scaffold to organize enzymes to enhance cascade reactions both in vitro and in living cells. We demonstrate that not only enzyme&#8208;enzymes distance but also the improved Km value contribute to the enhanced reaction rate of cascade reactions. Three sequential enzymes for lycopene biosynthesis have been co&#8208;localized on the exterior of the engineered protein cages in Escherichia coli, leading to an 8.5&#8208;fold increase of lycopene production by streamlining metabolic flux towards its biosynthesis. This versatile system offers a powerful tool to achieve enzyme spatial organization for broad applications in biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Excitonic Networks Directed by DNA Templates as an Efficient Model Light&#8208;Harvesting and Energy Transfer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthetic organisms organize discrete light&#8208;harvesting complexes into large&#8208;scale networks to facilitate efficient light collection and utilization. Inspired by nature, herein, synthetic DNA templates were used to direct the formation of dye aggregates with a cyanine dye, K21, into discrete branched photonic complexes, and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) excitonic networks. The DNA templates ranged from four&#8208;arm DNA tiles, ~ 10 nm in each arm, to 2D wireframe DNA origami nanostructures with different geometries and varying dimensions up to 100 &#215; 100 nm  2  . These DNA&#8208;templated dye aggregates presented strongly coupled spectral features and delocalized exciton characteristics, enabling efficient photon collection and energy transfer. Compared to the discrete branched photonic systems templated on individual DNA tiles, the interconnected excitonic networks showed approximately a 2&#8208;fold increase of energy transfer efficiency. This bottom&#8208;up assembly strategy paves the way to create 2D excitonic systems with complex geometries and engineered energy pathways.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Acceleration of singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossings (ISC) is instrumental in bolstering triplet exciton harvesting of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. This work describes a simple gold(I) coordination strategy to enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling of green and blue BN(O)&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters, which results in a notable increase in rates of the spectroscopically observed ISC process to 3&#215;109 s&#8208;1 with nearly unitary ISC quantum yields. Accordingly, the resultant thermally&#8208;stable Au(I) emitters attained large delayed fluorescence rate constants up to 1.3&#215;105/1.7&#215;105 s&#8208;1 in THF/PMMA while preserving narrowband emissions (FWHM = 30&#8211;37 nm) and high emission quantum yields (ca. 0.9). The vapor&#8208;deposited ultrapure&#8208;green OLEDs fabricated with these Au(I) emitters delivered high luminance of up to 2.53&#215;105&#160;cd m&#8208;2 as well as external quantum efficiencies up to 30.3% with roll&#8208;offs as low as 0.8% and long device lifetimes (LT60) of 1210 h at 1000 cd m&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sustainable NH4+ Ion Battery by Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous ammonium ion battery is a promising sustainable energy storage system. However, the side reactions originating from electrolytes (the water decomposition and host material dissolution) preclude its practical applications. Unlike the metal&#8208;based aqueous batteries, the idea of &#8220;ultrahigh concentrated electrolyte&#8221; is not feasible due to the strong hydrolysis of ammonium ions. Therefore, we proposed an effective and sustainable strategy for the water hydrogen bond network modulation by adding sucrose into the electrolytes. The sucrose can form sucrose&#8208;water hydrogen bond networks to break the continuous water hydrogen bond network, thereby inhibiting water decomposition significantly. Moreover, the weak hydrogen bond interaction between ammonium and sucrose facilitates rapid ion migration, leading to an improved ionic conductivity. This work presents a new electrolyte modulating strategy for the practical application of aqueous ammonium ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Heterogeneous Catalysis with Strong Metal &#8211; Support Interactions: Characterization, Theory and Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) represent a classic yet fast&#8208;growing area in catalysis research. The SMSI phenomenon results in encapsulation and stabilization of active metal nanoparticles (NPs) with the support material and has been found for multiple types of catalysts that significantly impact the catalytic performance through stabilization of supported particles and regulation of the interfacial interactions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) represent a classic yet fast-growing area in catalysis research. The SMSI phenomenon results in encapsulation and stabilization of active metal nanoparticles (NPs) with the support material and has been found for multiple types of catalysts that significantly impact the catalytic performance through stabilization of supported particles and regulation of the interfacial interactions. Engineering the strong-metal support interactions provide a promising approach to steer catalytic performance in various chemical processes, which serves as an effective tool to tackle energy and environmental challenges. Our minireview covers characterization, theory, catalytic activity, and structural and environmental sensitivity of the SMSI phenomena.

         <title>Dynamic B/N Lewis Pairs: Insights into the Structural Variations and Photochromism via Light&#8208;Induced Fluorescence to Phosphorescence Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultralong afterglow emissions due to room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are of paramount importance in the advancement of smart sensors, bioimaging and light&#8208;emitting devices. We herein present an efficient approach to achieve rarely accessible phosphorescence of heavy atom&#8208;free organoboranes via photochemical switching of sterically tunable fluorescent Lewis pairs (LPs). LPs are widely applied in and well&#8208;known for their outstanding performance in catalysis and supramolecular soft materials but have not thus far been exploited to develop photo&#8208;responsive RTP materials. The intramolecular LP  M1BNM  not only shows a dynamic response to thermal treatment due to reversible N&#8594;B coordination but crystals of  M1BNM  also undergo rapid photochromic switching. As a result, unusual emission switching from short&#8208;lived fluorescence to long&#8208;lived phosphorescence (  rad  &#8208;  M1BNM,  &#964;  RTP  = 232 ms) is observed. The reported discoveries in the field of Lewis pairs chemistry offer important insights into their structural dynamics, while also pointing to new opportunities for photoactive materials with implications for fast responsive detectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Upgrading to Triethanolamine by Bromine&#8208;assisted C2H4 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction represents a promising approach for converting this greenhouse gas into value&#8208;added chemicals, while the capability of producing multi&#8208;carbon products with longer carbon chains (Cn &gt; 3) is predominantly limited. Herein, we first demonstrated the Br&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene (C2H4), a major CO2 electroreduction product, into 2&#8208;bromoethanol by electro&#8208;generated bromine on metal phthalocyanine catalysts. Due to the preferential formation of Br2 over *O or Cl2 to activate C=C bond, a high partial current density of producing 2&#8208;bromoethanol (46.6 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2) was obtained with 87.2% Faradaic efficiency. Further coupling with the electrocatalytic nitrite reduction to ammonia at the cathode allowed to produce triethanolamine with six carbon atoms. Moreover, by coupling a CO2 electrolysis cell for in&#8208;situ C2H4 generation and a C2H4 oxidation/nitrite reduction cell, the capability of upgrading of CO2 and nitrite into triethanolamine was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;off&#8208;on Control of Molecular Inversion Symmetry via Multi&#8208;stage Protonation: Elucidating Vibronic Laporte Rule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Laporte rule dictates that one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption spectra of inversion&#8208;symmetric molecules should display alternatively forbidden electronic transitions; however, for organic fluorophores, drawing clear distinction between the symmetric&#8208; and non&#8208;inversion symmetric two&#8208;photon spectra is often obscured due to prevalent vibronic interactions. We take advantage of consecutive single&#8208; and double&#8208;protonation to break and then reconstitute inversion symmetry in a nominally symmetric diketopyrrolopyrrole, causing large changes in two&#8208;photon absorption. By performing detailed one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon titration experiments, with supporting quantum&#8208;chemical model calculations, we explain how certain low&#8208;frequency vibrational modes may lead to apparent deviations from the strict Laporte rule. As a result, the system may be indeed considered as an on&#8208;off&#8208;on inversion symmetry switch, opening new avenues for two&#8208;photon sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Catalyst&#8208;Solvent Interactions in Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Sulfur Reduction Electrocatalysis for Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lean&#8208;electrolyte condition is important for high&#8208;energy Li&#8722;S batteries, but sulfur cathode undergoes sluggish reduction kinetics with low electrolyte dosage. This demands efficient catalyst design to promote lean&#8208;electrolyte sulfur reduction. However, most of the reported electrocatalysts focus on the catalyst&#8208;polysulfide interactions, and these undertakings generally exhibit high activity only with a large excess of electrolyte. Therefore, a mechanistic insight into catalyst design targeted at lean&#8208;electrolyte sulfur reduction is still lacking. Herein, we have proposed a general rule to boost lean&#8208;electrolyte sulfur reduction by controlling the catalyst&#8208;solvent interactions. As evidenced by synchrotron&#8208;based analysis, in&#8208;situ spectroscopy, theoretical computations and electrochemical tests, the catalyst&#8208;solvent binding strength plays a crucial role in lean&#8208;electrolyte catalytic activity, electrolyte consumption and battery stability. Strong catalyst&#8208;solvent interaction greatly enhances the catalytic activity and battery performance, which is only obvious under lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions. Benefitting from the strong interaction between solvent molecules and cobalt catalyst, the Li&#8722;S battery achieves stable cycling with only 0.22% capacity decay per cycle under lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions. Compared to the battery with flooded electrolyte, the lean&#8208;electrolyte battery with an electrolyte/sulfur mass ratio of 4.2 maintains 79% capacity, which is the highest capacity retention among systems with low electrolyte dosages reported so far.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The nickel catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type coupling of aryl sulfamates and boronic acid derivatives enabled by temperature&#8208;controlled mechanochemistry via the development of a programmable PID&#8208;controlled jar heater is reported. This base&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;free, all&#8208;under&#8208;air protocol was also scaled 200&#8208;fold using twin&#8208;screw extrusion technology affording decagram quantities of material.







Abstract
The use of temperature&#8208;controlled mechanochemistry to enable the mechanochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling is herein described. Transitioning from a capricious room&#8208;temperature protocol, through to a heated, PID&#8208;controlled programmable jar heater manifold was required to deliver an efficient method for the coupling of aryl sulfamates (derived from ubiquitous phenols) and aryl boronic acid species. Furthermore, this process is conducted using a base&#8208;metal nickel catalyst, in the absence of bulk solvent, and in the absence of air/moisture sensitive reaction set&#8208;ups. This methodology is showcased through translation to large&#8208;scale twin&#8208;screw extrusion methodology enabling 200&#8208;fold scale increase, producing decagram quantities of C&#8722;C coupled material.

Transitioning from a capricious room-temperature protocol, through to a heated, PID-controlled programmable jar heater manifold was required to deliver an efficient method for the coupling of aryl sulfamates (derived from ubiquitous phenols) and aryl boronic acid species. Furthermore, this process is conducted using a base-metal nickel catalyst, in the absence of bulk solvent, and in the absence of air/moisture sensitive reaction set-ups. This methodology is showcased through translation to large-scale twin-screw extrusion methodology enabling 200-fold scale increase, producing decagram quantities of C&#8722;C coupled material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic AIE crosslinks in liquid crystal networks: visualizing for actuation&#8208;guiding, re&#8208;bonding for actuation&#8208;altering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel covalent adaptable liquid crystal network (CALCN) actuators crosslinked by dynamic AIE luminogens were built based on Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one material design &#8220;visualizes&#8221;, through fluorescing, the crosslinking state and actuation capability for actuation&#8208;guiding in CALCN, while enabling network &#8220;re&#8208;bonding&#8221; through associative and dissociative exchange mechanisms for unprecedented actuation&#8208;reprogrammability.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable liquid crystal networks (CALCNs) are highly potential actuating materials due to their actuation properties and shape reprogrammability. Given the importance of network crosslinking state in a CALCN actuator, we sought an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy to probe and visualize its dynamic network while ensuring actuation and reprogramming. Here, tetraphenylethylene derivatives were incorporated into liquid crystal networks via the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reaction, acting simultaneously as reversible crosslinkers and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorescent probes. The thermally tunable fluorescence of the resulting network can correlate to and thus visualize the actuator's crosslinking status, actuation capability and temperature in real&#8208;time and in situ, yielding an intriguing actuation limit&#8208;alerting function. Furthermore, we verified unprecedented reprogrammability of the AIE&#8208;type CALCNs through both associative and dissociative exchange mechanisms of DA chemistry.

         <title>Facile Route to Novel Diazaphosphinine&#8208;Based Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of diazaphosphinine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (DP&#8208;PAHs) is reported. The electronic structures and optoelectronic properties are highly tunable via the rich phosphorus chemistry. With balanced S1 and T1 emission, DP&#8208;PAH with P=S center exhibits a single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emitting character in the crystalline state.







Abstract
Doping main&#8208;group elements has become a unique strategy to fine&#8208;tune optoelectronic properties of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Herein, we report the first example of diazaphosphinine based polycyclic hydrocarbons (DP&#8208;PAHs) via facile synthetic protocols. Synthesis of diazaphosphinine heterocycles harnesses mild and efficient P&#8722;N chemistry. The heterocycles readily undergo photocyclizations by using only oxidants. The photocyclization protocol is applicable to the heterocycles with various P&#8208;centers. We successfully extended the protocols in extended DP&#8208;PAHs with 13&#8208;fused aromatic rings. Further adjusting P&#8208;chemistry allows to efficiently fine&#8208;tune the singlet and triplet emission characteristics. More importantly, single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting character was achieved via the balanced singlet and triplet emission of DP&#8208;PAH. Therefore, this work opens up new horizons in the area of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials.

         <title>Single&#8208;Product Faradaic Efficiency for Electrocatalytic of CO2 to CO at Current Density Larger than 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in Neutral Aqueous Solution by a Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In neutral aqueous solution, a single&#8208;atom nanozyme Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C with enzyme&#8208;like catalytic active sites exhibited ultra&#8208;high current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and durability of 100&#8197;h for electroreduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to CO is a promising approach for the cycling use of CO2, while it still suffers from impractical current density and durability. Here we report a single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C) that achieves industrial&#8208;scale performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeded 97&#8201;% over &#8722;0.8&#8211;&#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. The current density at &#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. RHE reached a maximum of 1.23&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (turnover frequency of 69.7&#8197;s&#8722;1) with an FE of 99.6&#8201;%. No obvious degradation was observed over 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation. Compared with the planar Ni&#8722;N4 site, the square&#8208;pyramidal Ni&#8722;N5 site has an increase and a decrease in the 
 and dxz/yz orbital energy levels, respectively, as revealed by density functional theory calculations. Thus, the Ni&#8722;N5 catalytic site is more superior to activate CO2 molecule and reduce the energy barriers as well as promote the CO desorption, thus boosting the kinetic activation process and catalytic activity.

         <title>Tracking Hepatic Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury in Real Time with a Reversible NIR&#8208;IIb Fluorescent Redox Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible fluorescent redox probe with emission beyond 1500&#8197;nm was synthesized to dynamically monitor the time&#8208;resolved reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluctuations during hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (HIRI) in vivo. The strategy not only circumvents the difficulty in building reversible fluorescent probes in the NIR&#8208;II region but also offers a useful tool for early diagnosis and timely treatment of HIRI.







Abstract
Hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (HIRI) is responsible for liver dysfunction, which involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the most critical marker. Real&#8208;time monitoring of ROS during HIRI can provide significant chance for early diagnosis and timely intervention. However, there is no probe available to track ROS fluctuations during HIRI in vivo, as it is extremely challenging to design reversibly responsive fluorescent probe in near&#8208;infrared region. Here, a reversible redox probe REPOMs emitting beyond 1500&#8197;nm is proposed to fill the blank, using rare earth ions&#8208;doped nanoparticles as emitter, and molybdenum&#8208;based polyoxometalate nanoclusters as the ROS&#8208;recognition site and emission modulator. REPOMs exhibited excellent response towards the repeated cycle between ROS and glutathione, based on which the time&#8208;resolved ROS changes during HIRI were successfully obtained. This reversible probe may provide a powerful tool to promote the hepatology research in the future.

         <title>Multistate Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching through Stimuli&#8208;Induced Co&#8208;Conformation Regulations of Pyrene&#8208;Functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>

By using topologically chiral [2]catenanes as not only the chiral platform but also the switching scaffold, the first construction of a novel bidirectional circularly polarized luminescence switching system was successfully realized.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches with multiple switchable emission states and high dissymmetry factors (glum), topologically chiral [2]catenanes were employed as the key platform to construct a novel multistate CPL switching system. Taking advantage of the precise co&#8208;conformation regulations of the resultant pyrene&#8208;functionalized [2]catenanes under different external stimuli, reversible transformations between three emission states with different CPL performances, i.e. the initial &#8220;closed&#8221; form with a |glum| value of 0.012, the &#8220;open&#8221; form with an almost complete turn&#8208;off of CPL emission, and the &#8220;protonated&#8221; form with a boosted |glum| value of 0.022, were successfully realized. This study demonstrates the successful construction of not only the first topological chirality&#8208;based CPL switch, but also a novel bidirectional CPL switch, thus providing a promising platform for the construction of novel chiral materials.

We combined covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and piezoelectric material by covalent bonds to form a Z&#8208;scheme core@shell heterostructure piezo&#8208;photocatalyst with tunable shell thickness for overall water splitting. The optimal sample reveals the unprecedented H2 and O2 production rates of 1416.4 and 708.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the excitation of ultrasonication coupled with visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is an ideal way to generate renewable energy while still challenging. For the first time, this work combined covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and piezoelectric material by covalent linkages to form Z&#8208;scheme core@shell heterostructure for overall water splitting. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the polarized electric field and photo&#8208;generated charges, as well as the precise adjustment of shell thickness, the carrier separation and utilization efficiency is greatly improved. The optimal BiFeO3@TpPa&#8208;1&#8208;COF photocatalyst revealed hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) production rates of 1416.4 and 708.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the excitation of ultrasonication coupled with light irradiation, which is the best performance among various piezo&#8208; and COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This provides a new sight for the practical application of highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting.

         <title>Generation of Tunable Ultrastrong White&#8208;Light Emission by Activation of a Solid Supramolecule through Bromonaphthylpyridinium Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid supramolecule based on a sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and diarylethene derivative has been developed by a bromonaphthylpyridinium polymerization strategy. The supramolecule exhibits tunable phosphorescence emission in the amorphous state and can be applied for stimuli&#8208;responsive data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Herein, we reported solid supramolecular bromonaphthylpyridinium polymers (P&#8208;BrNp), which exhibit tunable phosphorescence emission in the amorphous state enabled by sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (SBE&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) and diarylethene derivatives. The monomer BrNp gave single fluorescence emission at 490&#8197;nm, while an apparent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) at 550&#8197;nm emerged for P&#8208;BrNp copolymers with various feed ratios. Through fluorescence&#8208;phosphorescence dual emission, P&#8208;BrNp&#8208;0.1 displayed an ultrahigh white&#8208;light emission quantum yield of 83.9&#8201;%. Moreover, the subsequent assembly with SBE&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD further enhanced the phosphorescent quantum yield of P&#8208;BrNp&#8208;0.1 from 64.1&#8201;% to 71.3&#8201;%, accompanied by the conversion of photoluminescence emission from white to yellow. Diarylethene monomers were introduced as photoswitches to realize reversible RTP emission, which can be used in switchable data encryption and multifunctional writing ink.

         <title>The Microscopic Origin of Second Harmonic Generation Response: The Spatial Structure of Instantaneous Dipole Moments in Electron Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the NLO materials reported herein, an electron transits from the oxygen atom of the valence state to the barium atom of the conduction state caused by the optical excitation. The charge transition generates instantaneous spatial dipole moments, which contribute to the projected SHG. Depending on the arrangement and ambience of the dipole moments, all microscopic SHG integrate into the macroscopic SHG response.







Abstract
A deep understanding on the crucial factors of the enhanced macroscopic second harmonic generation (SHG) in some deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is needed to design new NLO materials. Since an optical process relates to the electron excitation and polarization simultaneously, the instantaneous dipole moments and their structures in excitation should be seriously taken account to seek the principal factor in SHG response. In this work, we study the Ba4B11O20F (BBOF), a NLO material, by using the orbital projection technique. From the projected SHG of our theoretic calculation, we recognize the principal dipole moment of the dominant influence on SHG and the relevant atom groups between which the dipole moment is accommodated. With the conclusion that the dipole moment with the most significant influence on SHG is the one between the oxygen&#8211;boron polyhedral anion group and barium cation, we predict that Ba4Al11O20F (BAOF) has a comparable SHG response.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhanced Hydrophilicity and Stability of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework via Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification for Water Vapor Sorption/Desorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with large pores often lack sufficient hydrophilicity and stability. A post&#8208;synthetic modification of MOF&#8208;808 with di&#8208;sulfonic acids simultaneously enhances its hydrophilicity and stability while maintaining the high water&#8208;sorption capacity, achieving high swing capacities practical for potential applications, such as water harvesting and adsorptive heat transformations.







Abstract
With increasing demands for high&#8208;performance water sorption materials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained considerable attention due to their high maximum uptake capacities. In many cases, however, high overall capacity is not necessarily accomplishing high working capacity under operating conditions, due to insufficient hydrophilicity and/or water stability. Herein, we present a post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of MOF&#8208;808, with di&#8208;sulfonic acids enhancing simultaneously its hydrophilicity and water stability without sacrificing its uptake capacity of &#8776;30&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Di&#8208;sulfonic acid PSM enabled a shift of the relative humidity (RH) associated with a sharp step in water vapor sorption from 35&#8211;40&#8201;% RH in MOF&#8208;808 to below 25&#8201;% RH. While MOF&#8208;808 lost uptake capacity and crystallinity over multiple sorption/desorption cycles, the di&#8208;sulfonic acid PSM MOF&#8208;808 retained &gt;80&#8201;% of the original capacity. PSM MOF&#8208;808 exhibited good hydrothermal stability up to 60&#8201;&#176;C and high swing capacity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With increasing demands for high-performance water sorption materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained considerable attention due to their high maximum uptake capacities. In many cases, however, high overall capacity is not necessarily accomplishing high working capacity under operating conditions, due to insufficient hydrophilicity and/or water stability. Herein, we present a post-synthetic modification (PSM) of MOF-808, with di-sulfonic acids enhancing simultaneously its hydrophilicity and water stability without sacrificing its uptake capacity of &#8776;30&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Di-sulfonic acid PSM enabled a shift of the relative humidity (RH) associated with a sharp step in water vapor sorption from 35&#8211;40&#8201;% RH in MOF-808 to below 25&#8201;% RH. While MOF-808 lost uptake capacity and crystallinity over multiple sorption/desorption cycles, the di-sulfonic acid PSM MOF-808 retained &amp;gt;80&#8201;% of the original capacity. PSM MOF-808 exhibited good hydrothermal stability up to 60&#8201;&#176;C and high swing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenyl Imide with Mono&#8208; or Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allenyl imide and alkenes was achieved by utilizing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;magnesium(II) complex as the catalyst. This protocol provided a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A stepwise mechanism was proposed based on experimental studies and DFT calculations and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction was crucial for the enantioselectivity.







Abstract
An efficient catalytic asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition of allenyl imide and mono&#8208; or disubstituted alkenes is disclosed. The key feature of this method is the use of bidentate allenyl imide and weakly activated and less steric hindered alkene pair by utilizing chiral magnesium(II) complex of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide, which could provide through&#8208;space dispersion interactions to orientate the arrangement of the alkene. This protocol allows the generation of a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes and four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing spirocycles (80 examples) in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee), and the late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active molecules as well. Experimental studies and DFT calculations revealed that this [2+2] cycloaddition proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving a short&#8208;lived zwitterionic intermediate. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the alkenes and the amide moiety in the ligand was crucial for the enantiocontrol.

         <title>Origins of p&#8208;Doping and Nonradiative Recombination in CsSnI3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn vacancies have long been thought to be the key defects inducing high p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping in Sn&#8208;based perovskites, such as CsSnI3. However, by performing rigorous first&#8208;principles calculations, it is revealed that the defects dominating p&#8208;doping are Cs vacancies instead of Sn vacancies.







Abstract
It is commonly believed that the spontaneous p&#8208;doping in Sn&#8208;based perovskites is caused by Sn vacancies. By performing rigorous first&#8208;principles calculations for a prototypical Sn&#8208;based perovskite CsSnI3, we reveal that, in fact, the defects dominating p&#8208;doping are Cs vacancies. The reason that adding extra Sn2+ could reduce p&#8208;doping is that Cs and Sn present the same changing trend in terms of chemical potentials, and thus inhibiting the formation of Sn vacancies will also limit the formation of Cs vacancies. Moreover, we show that I vacancies are the dominant nonradiative recombination centers, and can result in sizable nonradiative losses, which explains why the experimentally measured carrier lifetime is only a few nanoseconds even if p&#8208;doping is suppressed. This work provides new insights into the origins of p&#8208;doping and nonradiative recombination in CsSnI3, and suggests that minimizing the formation of Cs and I vacancies is critical to realizing the best device performance.

         <title>A Bifunctional CdS/MoO2/MoS2 Catalyst Enhances Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and Pyruvic Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated electrons and holes in CdS hollow spheres loaded with MoS2 and MoO2 dual cocatalysts are applied to hydrogen evolution and selective pyruvic acid production, respectively. This bifunctional strategy can fully utilize the redox abilities of photogenerated electrons and holes to enhance photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The best use of photogenerated electrons and holes is crucial to boosting photocatalytic activity. Herein, a bifunctional dual&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;modified photocatalyst is constructed based on CdS/MoO2/MoS2 hollow spheres for hydrogen evolution coupled with selective pyruvic acid (PA) production from lactic acid (LA) oxidation. MoS2 and MoO2 are simultaneously obtained from the conversion of CdMoO4 in one step. In a photocatalytic process, the MoS2 and MoO2 function as the reduction and oxidation centers on which photogenerated electrons and holes accumulate and are used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and PA synthesis, respectively. By monitoring the intermediates, a two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron route for PA production is proposed, initiated by the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the LA. The conversion of LA and the selectivity of PA can reach ca. 29&#8201;% and 95&#8201;% after a five&#8208;hour reaction, respectively.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Trap Engineering toward Remarkable Crystallographic Reorientation and Efficient Cation Migration of Zn Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special design of anion&#8208;trap additive can greatly enhance the stability and capacity of the Zn ion batteries via modulating preferred Zn crystal plane and enabling fast Zn ion migration.







Abstract
Zn batteries are considered as potential candidates in future power sources, however suffer problems of rampant dendrite/by&#8208;product on Zn anodes, torpid Zn2+ transfer/diffusion and poor energy density. Inspired by the host&#8208;guest interaction chemistry, an anion&#8208;trap agent &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) is introduced into the Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte to induce dominant Zn (002) deposition and improve Zn2+ migration behaviors. The anion ClO4&#8722; is revealed to be trapped inside the cavity of &#946;&#8208;CD, impairing barriers for Zn2+ migration and significantly elevating the Zn2+ transference number to 0.878. Meanwhile, the &#946;&#8208;CD@ClO4&#8722; complex shows the function in preferential growth of the Zn (002), blocking the approach of dendrite growth. Above combined functions lead to substantial enhancement in long&#8208;term stability and cell capacity, as proved by 10&#8197;times longer life of Zn||Zn symmetric cells and 57&#8201;% capacity increasement of Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cells (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) compared with that of pure Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte.

         <title>The Continuum Between Hexagonal Planar and Trigonal Planar Geometries
</title>

The isolation and bonding analysis of a series of heterometallic hydride complexes shows they have subtly different bonding geometries. These compounds can be described as snapshots along a continuum of bonding between trigonal and hexagonal planar geometries.







Abstract
New heterometallic hydride complexes that involve the addition of {Mg&#8722;H} and {Zn&#8722;H} bonds to group 10 transition metals (Pd, Pt) are reported. The side&#8208;on coordination of a single {Mg&#8722;H} to Pd forms a well&#8208;defined &#963;&#8208;complex. In contrast, addition of three {Mg&#8722;H} or {Zn&#8722;H} bonds to Pd or Pt results in the formation of planar complexes with subtly different geometries. We compare their structures through experiment (X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, multinuclear NMR), computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, NCIPlot), and theoretical analysis (MO diagram, Walsh diagram). These species can be described as snapshots along a continuum of bonding between ideal trigonal planar and hexagonal planar geometries.

         <title>Unraveling the Complex Chirality Evolution in DNA&#8208;Assembled High&#8208;Order, Hybrid Chiroplasmonic Superstructures from Multi&#8208;Scale Chirality Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;scale chirality evolution was observed from DNA&#8208;assembled hybrid chiroplasmonic superstructures comprised of metal nanoparticles and organic chromophores, as a result of distinct fundamental chiral interactions at different hierarchical levels. The findings present new challenges to current theoretical frameworks to describe chiral hybrid systems, and will motivate computational and theoretical advances.







Abstract
Hierarchical, chiral hybrid superstructures of chromophores and nanoparticles are expected to give rise to intriguing unveiled chiroptical responses originating from the complex chiral interactions among the components. Herein, DNA origami cavity that could self&#8208;assemble into one&#8208;dimensional (1D) DNA tubes was employed as a scaffold to accurately organize metal nanoparticles and chromophores. The chiral interactions were studied at the level of individual hybrid particles and their 1D hybrid superstructures. Complex chirality mechanisms involving global structural chirality, plasmon&#8208;induced circular dichroism (PICD) and exciton&#8208;coupled circular dichroism (ECCD) were disentangled. The multiplexed CD spectrum superposition revealed the chirality evolution at different length scales. These results can offer a model for boosting the theoretical understanding of classical&#8208;quantum hybrid systems, and would inspire the future design of optically&#8208;active substances across length scales.

         <title>Programmable Assembly of Multivalent DNA&#8208;Protein Superstructures for Tumor Imaging and Targeted Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable multivalent DNA nanomaterials are designed through the biomimetic assembly of DNA with Food and Drug Administration&#8208;approved protamine, providing biocompatible and stable drug carriers with high avidity in a simpler method. This practical approach achieves sensitive tumor imaging and targeted cancer therapy, and offers new clinical translation opportunities.







Abstract
Programmable DNA materials hold great potential in biochemical and biomedical researches, yet the complicated synthesis, and the low stability and targeting efficacy in complex biological milieu limit their clinical translations. Here we show a one&#8208;pot assembly of DNA&#8208;protein superstructures as drug vehicles with specifically high affinity and stability for targeted therapy. This is achieved by biomimetic assembly of programmable polymer DNA wire into densely packed DNA nanosphere with an alkaline protein, protamine. Multivalent DNA nanostructures encoded with different types and densities of aptamers exhibit high affinity to targeted cells through polyvalent interaction. Our results show high cancer cell selectivity, reduced side effect, excellent therapeutic efficacy, and sensitive tumor imaging in both subcutaneous and orthotopic non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer murine models. This biomimetic assembly approach provides practical DNA nanomaterials for further clinical trials and may advance oligonucleotide drug delivery.

         <title>Synergistic Interfacial Bonding in Reduced Graphene Oxide Fiber Cathodes Containing Polypyrrole@sulfur Nanospheres for Flexible Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a synergistic interface bonding strategy to construct novel flexible fiber&#8208;shaped composite cathodes, in which polypyrrole@sulfur (PPy@S) nanospheres (&#8776;500&#8197;nm) are homogeneously implanted into the built&#8208;in cavity of self&#8208;assembled reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOFs) by a facile microfluidic assembly method. The PPy@S/rGOFs cathode exhibits good mechanical property, excellent electronic conductivity and enhanced cycling performance and outstanding high&#8208;rate capacity.







Abstract
Flexible lithium sulfur batteries with high energy density and good mechanical flexibility are highly desirable. Here, we report a synergistic interface bonding enhancement strategy to construct flexible fiber&#8208;shaped composite cathodes, in which polypyrrole@sulfur (PPy@S) nanospheres are homogeneously implanted into the built&#8208;in cavity of self&#8208;assembled reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOFs) by a facile microfluidic assembly method. In this architecture, sulfur nanospheres and lithium polysulfides are synergistically hosted by carbon and polymer interface, which work together to provide enhanced interface chemical bonding to endow the cathode with good adsorption ability, fast reaction kinetics, and excellent mechanical flexibility. Consequently, the PPy@S/rGOFs cathode shows enhanced electrochemical performance and high&#8208;rate capability. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to elucidate the enhanced electrochemical performance. In addition, a flexible Li&#8722;S pouch cell is assembled and delivers a high areal capacity of 5.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our work offers a new strategy for preparation of advanced cathodes for flexible batteries.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Solid Superprotonic Supramolecular Polymer Electrolytes Based on Deep Eutectic Solvents and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate nanoclusters are used as supramolecular cross&#8208;linkers to solidify deep eutectic solvents, which creates semi&#8208;solid supramolecular polymer electrolytes with superprotonic conductivity. Upon mild heating, these electrolytes can infiltrate into the voids in supercapacitor electrodes, form highly stable interfaces, and lead to improved electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) exhibit intriguing benefits in functional soft materials due to their dynamic bonding feature. However, most SPs can only exist in the solution state and fail to form bulk materials, which limits their applications. Here, we report the fabrication of semi&#8208;solid bulk SP materials by using polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters as supramolecular cross&#8208;linkers to solidify a deep eutectic solvent (DES). The abundant protons and strong hydrogen bonds afforded by POMs enable these SP materials as superprotonic conductive electrolytes with sufficient mechanical strength, showing a proton conductivity more than 1&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a breaking strength exceeding 1&#8197;MPa at room temperature. Moreover, the thermodynamic reversibility of the SP electrolytes allows them to form a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface by a facile melt&#8208;infiltration strategy upon mild heating, which leads to improved performance in supercapacitors. This work presents an innovative DES/POM hybrid system as a promising platform to develop functional supramolecular materials for energy and electronic applications.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;heterolepticity in Low&#8208;Symmetry Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroleptic metal&#8208;organic cages are prized for their structural complexity and multi&#8208;functionality. Controlling integrative self&#8208;sorting processes necessary to achieve defined self&#8208;assembly of these supramolecular hosts is a significant design challenge. In this work, ligand&#8208;tethering strategies are described that allow access to metal&#8208;organic cages with highly anisotropic cavities described by two inequivalent, unsymmetrical ligand scaffolds.







Abstract
Heteroleptic metal&#8208;organic cages, formed through integrative self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, are highly attractive as reduced symmetry supramolecular hosts. Ensuring high&#8208;fidelity, non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly, however, presents a significant challenge in molecular engineering due to the inherent difficulty in predicting thermodynamic energy landscapes. In this work, two conceptual strategies are described that circumvent this issue, using ligand design strategies to access structurally sophisticated metal&#8208;organic hosts. Using these approaches, it was possible to realise cavity environments described by two inequivalent, unsymmetrical ligand frameworks, representing a significant step forward in the construction of highly anisotropic confined spaces.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Preparation of Twisted Graphene Nanoribbons by Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly twisted and fully armchair&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) have been synthesized by Cu&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling. These twisted AGNRs have lengths up to 2.65&#8197;nm and display strong emission with a fluorescence quantum yield up to 81&#8201;%.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising in organic optoelectronic materials, and their properties largely depend on the size, edge, and conformation. Herein, the fully armchair&#8208;edged GNRs (AGNRs) with lengths up to 2.65&#8197;nm by using a Cu&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling as a key step. The resulting AGNRs (2HBT, 3HBT, and 4HBT) possess highly twisted &#960;&#8208;scaffolds, and the torsion angles between the adjacent triphenylene moieties are larger than 32&#176;, as proved by crystallographic analyses. Theoretical and spectroscopic studies show that the butoxy groups endow AGNRs with electron&#8208;rich features, the extension of the &#960;&#8208;system from 2HBT to 4HBT reinforces S0&#8594;S1 excitation, and the distortion of the &#960;&#8208;scaffold enhances the fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F). In particular, 4HBT has the lowest oxidation potential (Eox1=0.55&#8197;V vs. SCE) and displays red fluorescence with a &#934;F value of 81&#8201;%.

         <title>The First Chiro&#8208;Inositol Organosilicon Ferroelectric Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;component organosilicon ferroelectric D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol&#8208;SiMe3 is designed by using the chemical strategy of introducing quasi&#8208;spherical [&#8208;Si(CH3)3] groups into D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol. It exhibits stable and electrically switchable spontaneous polarization on the thin film, which has extremely low hardness of 72.8&#8197;MPa and small elastic modulus of 5.04&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Organosilicons have been used extensively in aerospace, electronics, food, medicine and other fields, due to their low viscosity, hydrophobicity, corrosion resistance, non&#8208;toxic, and physiologically inert features. Despite extensive interest, however, organosilicon ferroelectric crystals have never been found. Here, by using the chemical design strategy, we successfully obtained a molecular ferroelectric D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol&#8208;SiMe3 with polar P43 symmetry, whose spontaneous polarization can be electrically switchable on thin film. The introduction of organosilicon groups endows the thin films with excellent softness, ductility and flexibility (extremely low hardness of 72.8&#8197;MPa and small elastic modulus of 5.04&#8197;GPa) that are desirable for biomedical and human&#8208;compatible applications. As the first case of organosilicon ferroelectric crystal to date, this work offers a new structural paradigm for molecular ferroelectrics, and highlights their potential for flexible bio&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>Differential Peptide Multi&#8208;Macrocyclizations at the Surface of a Helical Foldamer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of different macrocycles can be implemented using Cys residues within a peptide and chloroacetamides at the surface of a foldamer helix by placing the latter at precise locations. Helix rigidity and faster formation of smaller macrocycles make the favored product largely predictable.







Abstract
Hybrid sequences comprising a peptide with several Cys residues and an aromatic foldamer helix with several chloroacetamide functions at its surface were synthesized. Such products may in principle form numerous macromulticyclic thioether products by intramolecularly combining all Cys residues and all chloroacetamide functions. However, we show that the reactive sites on the structurally defined helix can be placed at such locations that the peptide selectively stitches itself to form a series of different macrocycles within mostly one preferred product. Reactions were monitored by HPLC and products with two, three or four macrocycles were identified using LC&#8211;MS and NMR. The series of selective macrocyclizations define a sort of reaction trail where reaction sites otherwise identical are involved successively because of their precise positioning in space. The trails can be predicted to a large extent based on structural considerations and the assumption that smaller macrocycles form faster.

         <title>Activity&#8208;based Photoacoustic Probes Reveal Elevated Intestinal MGL and FAAH Activity in a Murine Model of Obesity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based sensing probes and whole&#8208;body photoacoustic imaging have enabled the selective detection of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity in the context of obesity and gastrointestinal tract inflammation.







Abstract
Obesity is a chronic health condition characterized by the accumulation of excessive body fat which can lead to and exacerbate cardiovascular disease, type&#8208;II diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer through systemic inflammation. Unfortunately, visualizing key mediators of the inflammatory response, such as monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), in a selective manner is a profound challenge owing to an overlapping substrate scope that involves arachidonic acid (AA). Specifically, these enzymes work in concert to generate AA, which in the context of obesity, has been implicated to control appetite and energy metabolism. In this study, we developed the first selective activity&#8208;based sensing probes to detect MGL (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;MGL) and FAAH (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;FAAH) activity via photoacoustic imaging. Activation of PA&#8208;HD&#8208;MGL and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;FAAH by their target enzymes resulted in 1.74&#8208;fold and 1.59&#8208;fold signal enhancements, respectively. Due to their exceptional selectivity profiles and deep&#8208;tissue photoacoustic imaging capabilities, these probes were employed to measure MGL and FAAH activity in a murine model of obesity. Contrary to conflicting reports suggesting levels of MGL can be attenuated or elevated, our results support the latter. Indeed, we discovered a marked increase of both targets in the gastrointestinal tract. These key findings set the stage to uncover the role of the endocannabinoid pathway in obesity&#8208;mediated inflammation.

Indeed, we discovered a marked increase of both targets in the gastrointestinal tract. These key findings set the stage to uncover the role of the endocannabinoid pathway in obesity-mediated inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Excited Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Silyl&#8208;Radical&#8208;Mediated Direct Activation of Carbamoyl Chlorides To Access (Hetero)aryl Carbamides

         <dc:description>
Photoexcited nickel catalysis enabled silyl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated activation of carbamoyl chlorides. This process provides an operationally simple and widely applicable amidation reaction of a plethora of aryl and heteroaryl halides. Mechanistic understanding suggests that the reaction involves an energy&#8208;transfer mechanism for aryl bromide; while a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism is operating for aryl chlorides.







Abstract
Amide bonds connect the amino acids in proteins and exist as a prevalent structural motif in biomolecules. Herein, we have exploited the concept of cross&#8208;electrophile coupling by merging the photo&#8208;redox and transition&#8208;metal catalysis to construct carbamides from superabundant (hetero)aryl halides along with commercially feasible carbamoyl chlorides. The success of this method relies on the prior formation of NiII&#8208;aryl halide intermediates, which involves in a photoexcited Ni&#8208;halide homolysis event by energy transfer from aryl bromide and single&#8208;electron transfer from aryl chloride to assist generation of the vital carbamoyl radical. The breadth of application of this technique is demonstrated both in inter&#8208; as well as intramolecular routes for the synthesis of a plethora of (hetero)aryl carbamides with diverse functionalities, and biologically important benzolactams.

         <title>Conservation of Nickel Ion Single&#8208;Active Site Character in a Bottom&#8208;Up Constructed &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecular Network</title>

The on&#8208;surface synthesis of covalent nickel tetraphenylporphyrin network on Au(111) is studied by a multitechnique approach combining local microscopic insights with space&#8208;averaging synchrotron radiation&#8208;based methods. Even though the porphyrin nanomesh is not perfectly ordered extending the &#960;&#8208;system results in the appearance of energy&#8208;dispersive electronic features while the Ni cores remain in the characteristic single&#8208;molecule configuration.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface chemistry holds the potential for ultimate miniaturization of functional devices. Porphyrins are promising building&#8208;blocks in exploring advanced nanoarchitecture concepts. More stable molecular materials of practical interest with improved charge transfer properties can be achieved by covalently interconnecting molecular units. On&#8208;surface synthesis allows to construct extended covalent nanostructures at interfaces not conventionally available. Here, we address the synthesis and properties of covalent molecular network composed of interconnected constituents derived from halogenated nickel tetraphenylporphyrin on Au(111). We report that the &#960;&#8208;extended two&#8208;dimensional material exhibits dispersive electronic features. Concomitantly, the functional Ni cores retain the same single&#8208;active site character of their single&#8208;molecule counterparts. This opens new pathways when exploiting the high robustness of transition metal cores provided by bottom&#8208;up constructed covalent nanomeshes.

         <title>2,4,6&#8208;Trimethylpyridine&#8208;Derived Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Confined Catalytic Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knoevenagel condensation at the methyl groups of a 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine monomer was promoted by in situ acylation of the nitrogen atom, yielding highly crystalline vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks. The resultant Lewis basic, pyridine&#8208;decorated, regular, nanoporous structures catalyzed spatially confined organic esterification with good selectivity.







Abstract
Knoevenagel condensation is a powerful tool for the construction of vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks. Herein, we established a concise approach to vinylene&#8208;linked COFs by Knoevenagel condensation at the multi&#8208;methyl groups of a pyridine ring through in situ formation of an N&#8208;acyl pyridinium cation in the presence of various acylating reagents. Following this strategy, two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed using 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine and multi&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;substituted aromatic derivatives as monomers. The resultant COFs are highly crystalline and assembled into hexagonal lattices with specific surface areas as large as 1915&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (vs. 1972&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 of the theoretical value). The stable and abundant pyridine&#8208;decorated regular nanochannels within the COFs allow for catalyzing the esterification of several pharmaceutical intermediates with distinct spatially confined selectivity and recyclability, representing an environmentally friendly catalytic organic transformation.

         <title>Intranuclear Nanoribbons for Selective Killing of Osteosarcoma Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon the dephosphorylation of ALP, the leucine&#8208;rich phosphopeptides self&#8208;assemble into micelles and then convert into nanoribbons. The phosphopeptides/assemblies first aggregate on the cell membrane of osteosarcoma cells, and then enter cells via endocytosis, disrupt the nuclear membrane, and finally accumulate in nuclei by interaction with histone proteins to induce cell death.







Abstract
Herein, we show intranuclear nanoribbons formed upon dephosphorylation of leucine&#8208;rich L&#8208; or D&#8208;phosphopeptide catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to selectively kill osteosarcoma cells. Being dephosphorylated by ALP, the peptides are first transformed into micelles and then converted into nanoribbons. The peptides/assemblies first aggregate on cell membranes, then enter cells via endocytosis, and finally accumulate in nuclei (mainly in nucleoli). Proteomics analysis suggests that the assemblies interact with histone proteins. The peptides kill osteosarcoma cells rapidly and are nontoxic to normal cells. Moreover, the repeated stimulation of the osteosarcoma cells by the peptides sensitizes the cancer cells rather than inducing resistance. This work not only illustrates a novel mechanism for nucleus targeting, but may also pave a new way for selectively killing osteosarcoma cells and minimizing drug resistance.

         <title>Regulating Surface Reaction Kinetics through Ligand Field Effects for Fast and Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>

The boron acid additive can alleviate the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction by modulating the solvation sheath. The formed solvation structure with moderate ligand field strength enables fast and highly reversible Zn deposition.







Abstract
Designing water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath of Zn2+ by ligand substitution is a widely used strategy to protect Zn metal anode, yet the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the side hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a huge challenge. Herein, we find boric acid (BA) with moderate ligand field interaction can partially replace H2O molecules in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, forming a stable water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath. It enables fast Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and substantially suppressed HER. Crucially, by systematically comparing the ligand field strength and solvation energies between BA and the ever&#8208;reported electrolyte additives, we also find that the solvation energy has a strong correlation with Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and HER inhibition ability, displaying a classic volcano behavior. The modulation map could provide valuable insights for solvation sheath design of zinc batteries and beyond.

It enables fast Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and substantially suppressed HER. Crucially, by systematically comparing the ligand field strength and solvation energies between BA and the ever-reported electrolyte additives, we also find that the solvation energy has a strong correlation with Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and HER inhibition ability, displaying a classic volcano behavior. The modulation map could provide valuable insights for solvation sheath design of zinc batteries and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Blockage Mapping for Identifying Familial Point Mutations in Single Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptides with a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of single&#8208;point mutants of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide associated with familial Alzheimer's disease were simultaneously identified with aerolysin nanopores assisted by a 3D blockage mapping strategy. This is based on the combination of the conventional current blockage (Ib/I0), duration time (tD) and the reliable standard deviation of current blockade fluctuations (&#963;b).







Abstract
Accurate discrimination of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides containing familial point mutations would advance the knowledge of their roles in early&#8208;onset Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we simultaneously identified the mutant A21G, E22G, E22Q, and the wild&#8208;type (WT) A&#946;18&#8211;26 peptides with aerolysin nanopore using a 3D blockage mapping strategy. The standard deviation of current blockade fluctuations (&#963;b) was proposed as a new supplement to current blockage (Ib/I0) and duration time (tD) to profile the blockage characteristics of single molecules. Although the WT and A21G A&#946;18&#8208;26 are indistinguishable in a traditional Ib/I0&#8208;tD 2D description, &#8764;87&#8201;% of the blockade events can be accurately classified with half reduction of false identification using a combination of Ib/I0, tD, and &#963;b. This work offers an easy and reliable strategy to promote nanopore sensitivity of peptide mutants, leading to a more precise analysis of pathogenic mutations for developing effective diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Ultrastable Anti&#8208;Acid &#8220;Shield&#8221; in Layered Silver Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid resistance (12&#8197;M HCl) was made possible for two isomorphic two&#8208;dimensional silver&#8208;based coordination polymers. Protection is provided by a hydrophobic organic shell and a dynamic proton buffer layer via a thiolate&#8208;thione tautomerism of 2&#8208;thiobenzimidazole ligands. Thus, these ligands are promising surface inhibitors, acting as a dual protective shield against metal corrosion.







Abstract
Surface passivation technology provides noble&#8208;metal materials with limited chemical stability, especially under highly acidic condition. To design effective strategy to enhance stability of noble&#8208;metal particles, an understanding of their surface anticorrosion mechanism at the atomic level is desirable by using two&#8208;dimensional (2D) noble&#8208;metal coordination polymer (CP) as an ideal model for their interfacial region. With the protection of 2&#8208;thiobenzimidazole (TBI), we isolated two Ag&#8208;based 2D CPs, {Ag14(TBI)12X2}n (S&#8722;X, where S denotes sheet and X=Cl or Br). These compounds exhibited excellent chemical stability upon immersion in various common solvents, boiling water, boiling ethanol, 10&#8201;% hydrogen peroxide, concentrated acid (12&#8197;M HCl), and concentrated alkali (19&#8197;M NaOH). Systematic characterization and DFT analyses demonstrate that the superior stability of S&#8722;X was attributed to the hydrophobic organic shell and dynamic proton buffer layer acting as a double protective &#8220;shield&#8221;.

         <title>sp2 to sp3 Hybridization Transformation in Ionic Crystals under Unprecedentedly Low Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To promote the sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 hybridization transformation in ionic crystals, the realization of internal&#8208;lattice stress&#8208;transfer from ionic groups to covalent groups is proposed. It is demonstrated in a crystal of LiBO2 which undergoes the transformation at unprecedentedly low pressure of only 2.85&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Under cold pressure sp1/sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 hybridization transformation has been exclusively observed in covalent or molecular crystals overwhelmingly above &#8776;10&#8197;GPa, and the approaches to lower the transition pressure are limited on external heat&#8208;treatment and/or catalyzers. Herein we demonstrate that, by internal&#8208;lattice stress&#8208;transfer from ionic to covalent groups, the transformation can be significantly prompted, as shown in a crystal of LiBO2 under 2.85&#8197;GPa for the first case in ionic crystals. This unprecedentedly low transformation pressure is ascribed to the enhanced localized stress on covalent B&#8722;O frames transferred from ionic Li&#8722;O bonds in LiBO2, and accordingly the corresponding structural feature is summarized. This work provides an internal structural regulation strategy for pressure&#8208;reduction of the s&#8208;p orbital hybridization transformation and extends the sp1/sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 transformation landscape from molecular and covalent compounds to ionic systems.

         <title>Oxidative Radical NHC Catalysis: Divergent Difunctionalization of Olefins through Intermolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented oxidative radical NHC catalytic system is reported that allows an efficient difunctionalization of olefins for the divergent synthesis of various ketones. Key to success is the use of peroxyesters as &#8220;dual&#8208;role&#8221; reagents to achieve a sequential single&#8208;electron oxidation and intermolecular hydron atom transfer.







Abstract
Oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis, typically leading to the formation of acyl azolium reactive intermediates, constitutes one of the most important activation strategies for the NHC&#8208;catalyzed chemical transformations. Here, we report an unprecedented oxidative radical NHC catalysis by using peroxyester as the external single&#8208;electron oxidant to realize divergent difunctionalization of olefins. The key to success of this chemistry is the catalytic generation of oxygen radicals that could trigger an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer to activate the inert C&#8722;H bonds, thereby enabling the productive radical relay process. With this protocol, commonly used general chemicals could serve as radical precursors to allow efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added products in a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective manner. Preliminary mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and DFT calculations, shed light on the NHC organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

         <title>Polymerisation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Graft Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of branching on polymer self&#8208;assembly is investigated by conducting polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of sparsely grafted poly(lauryl methacrylate)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate) in n&#8208;dodecane. Electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray scattering techniques are used to characterise the resulting materials.







Abstract
We report the polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of poly(lauryl methacrylate)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate) copolymers during reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) grafting from polymerisation in a backbone&#8208;selective solvent. Electron microscopy images suggest the phase separation of grafts to result in a network of spherical particles, due to the ability of the branched architecture to freeze chain entanglements and to bridge core domains. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering data suggest the architecture promotes the formation of multicore micelles, the core morphology of which transitions from spheres to worms, vesicles, and inverted micelles with increasing volume fraction of the grafts. A time&#8208;resolved SAXS study is presented to illustrate the formation of the inverted phase during a polymerisation. The grafted architecture gives access to unusual morphologies and provides exciting new handles for controlling the polymer structure and material properties.

         <title>The Linkage of Sulfonimidoyl Fluorides and Unactivated Alkenes via Hydrosulfonimidoylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free linkage chemistry of unactivated alkenes and sulfonimidoyl fluorides via hydrosulfonimidoylation to construct sulfoximines within minutes is presented. An intermolecular hydride transfer process is the key step in the reaction.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI) fluoride cleavage and exchanging linkage, a new generation of linkage chemistry, exhibits enormous potential for combining a range of functional molecules in an increasing number of fields. Herein, we established a metal&#8208;free linkage of unactivated alkenes and sulfonimidoyl fluorides via hydrosulfonimidoylation to construct sulfoximines within minutes. An intermolecular hydride transfer process is the key step, and it occurs via overlap of the LUMO in the sulfonimidoyl cation and HOMO in the unactivated alkene, which was confirmed via control experiments with deuterated compounds. DFT calculations further demonstrated the concerted process involving formation of the S&#8722;C(sp3) bond and hydride transfer. Remarkably, abundant natural products and pharmaceuticals with multiple heteroatoms and sensitive functional groups have been subjected to the current linkage reaction to achieve various sulfoximine linkages, furnishing the basis for drug discovery and drug conjugation.

         <title>In Vivo Olefin Metathesis in Microalgae Upgrades Lipids to Building Blocks for Polymers and Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>

Catalytic olefin metathesis can be performed in live microalgae, converting the fatty acids stored in lipid organelles to polymer building blocks and chemicals in vivo.







Abstract
Sustainable sources are key to future chemicals production. Microalgae are promising resources as they fixate carbon dioxide to organic molecules by photosynthesis. Thereby they produce unsaturated fatty acids as established raw materials for the industrial production of chemical building blocks. Although these renewable feedstocks are generated inside cells, their catalytic upgrading to useful products requires in vitro transformations. A synthetic catalysis inside photoautotrophic cells has remained elusive. Here we show that a catalytic conversion of renewable substrates can be realized directly inside living microalgae. Organometallic catalysts remain active inside the cells, enabling in vivo catalytic olefin metathesis as new&#8208;to&#8208;nature transformation. Stored lipids are converted to long&#8208;chain dicarboxylates as valuable building blocks for polymers. This is a key step towards the long&#8208;term goal of producing desired renewable chemicals in microalgae as living &#8220;cellular factories&#8221;.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Fused Acenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusion of azulene to acenes of various length led to unexpected properties such as aromaticity and photophysical properties, and they are more stable than the respective isoelectronic acenes. Their dications showed aromaticity shift and one of them exhibited open&#8208;shell diradical character.







Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant non&#8208;benzenoid &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) are expected to exhibit very different electronic properties from the all&#8208;benzenoid PHs. Herein, we report the synthesis and physical properties of three azulene&#8208;fused acene molecules (1, 2 and 3), which are isoelectronic to the pentacene, hexacene and heptacene, respectively. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, NMR spectra, and theoretical calculations reveal a localised aromatic backbone comprising all the six&#8208; and five&#8208;membered rings while the seven&#8208;membered ring remains non&#8208;aromatic. They display properties of both azulene and acenes and are much more stable than the respective acenes. The dications of 1, 2 and 3 were formed by chemical oxidation. Notably, 32+ exhibited an open&#8208;shell diradical character (y0=30.2&#8201;%) as confirmed by variable&#8208;temperature NMR and ESR measurements, which can be explained by recovery of aromaticity of an 2,6&#8208;anthraquinodimethane unit annulated with two aromatic tropylium rings.

         <title>Conferring BiVO4 Nanorods with Oxygen Vacancies to Realize Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoetching can confer BiVO4 with oxygen vacancies and enhance the catalytic performance of BiVO4. The photoetched BiVO4 can catalyze water splitting to generate oxygen and hydroxyl radicals under the mediation of ultrasound. The generated oxygen can relieve tumor hypoxia, thereby improving the sonodynamic cancer therapy performance of BiVO4.







Abstract
Owing to the high depth of tissue penetration, non&#8208;invasiveness, and controllability, ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown broad application prospects for tumor treatment. However, the electron&#8208;hole separation inefficiency of sonosensitizers and the tumor hypoxia remain two major challenges limiting the effect of SDT. Here, ultrafine photoetched bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanorods modified with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000 (PEBVO@PEG NRs) were fabricated to achieve in situ self&#8208;supply of oxygen (O2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) for hypoxic tumor therapy. The photoetching approach could enhance the charge separation by inducing enriched oxygen vacancies on the surface of BiVO4, thereby improving the generation efficiency of ROS and O2. The PEBVO@PEG overcome the main obstacles of traditional sonosensitizers in the SDT process and show promising sonodynamic therapeutic effects, thus providing new strategies for improving the performance of sonosensitizer and hypoxic tumor elimination.

         <title>Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 Stabilized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium Catalyst for Selective and Stable CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed single&#8208;atom Rh embedded on Ti&#8208;doped CeO2, which exhibited record&#8208;breaking TOF of 493.1&#8197;h&#8722;1, 99.1&#8201;% ethanol selectivity and outstanding stability in CO2 hydrogenation. Synergistic effects of Ti&#8208;doping and single&#8208;atom Rh favor CHx*/CO* formation and their subsequent coupling into ethanol. Ti&#8208;doping&#8208;induced crystal reconstruction leads to the stabilization of single&#8208;atom Rh site and catalytic stability.







Abstract
Development of effective and stable catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol remains a challenge. Herein, we report that Rh1/CeTiOx single&#8208;atom catalyst constructed by embedding monoatomic Rh onto Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 support has shown a super high ethanol selectivity (&#8776;99.1&#8201;%), record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency (493.1&#8197;h&#8722;1), and outstanding stability. Synergistic effects of Ti&#8208;doption and monoatomic Rh contribute to this excellent catalytic performance by firstly facilitating oxygen vacancies formation to generate oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;Rh Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;base pairs, which favor CO2 adsorption and activation, cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds in CHxOH* and COOH* into CHx* and CO* species, subsequent C&#8722;C coupling and hydrogenation into ethanol, and secondly generating strong Rh&#8722;O bond by Ti&#8208;doping&#8208;induced crystal reconstruction, which contributes to striking stability. This work highlights the importance of support elaborating regulation for single&#8208;atom catalyst design to substantially improve the catalytic performance.

         <title>Regioselective Access to Vicinal Diamines by Metal&#8208;Free Photosensitized Amidylimination of Alkenes with Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free, photosensitized regioselective diamination of alkene is reported. The keys to this advance are: 1)&#8197;rational design of bifunctional diamination reagent, 2)&#8197;simultaneous generation of long&#8208;lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical with significantly differed reactivities, and 3)&#8197;involvement of photoinduced energy transfer reaction mode.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free photosensitized protocol for regioselective diamination of alkene feedstocks over a single step was developed based on the rationally designed bifunctional diamination reagent, thus affording a range of differentially protected 1,2&#8208;diamines in moderate to high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction is initiated with a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer between thioxanthone catalyst and diamination reagent, followed by fragmentation to simultaneously generate long&#8208;lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical. The excellent regioselectivity presumably stems from the large reactivity difference between two different N&#8208;centered radical species. This protocol is characterized by excellent regioselectivity, broad functional group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions, which would enrich the diversity and versatility of facilitate the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diamine&#8208;containing complex molecule scaffolds.

         <title>Unique Double Intramolecular and Intermolecular Exciton Coupling in Ethene&#8208;Bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY Dimers for High&#8208;Efficiency Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion and Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aza&#8208;BODIPY dimer exhibits unique double intra&#8208; and intermolecular exciton couplings, resulting in a dramatic red&#8208;shift of the absorption to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region. Its self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles have high photothermal conversion ability and are ultra&#8208;photostable, which can efficiently lead to complete tumor ablation under 915&#8197;nm laser irradiation with ultralow power density.







Abstract
Spatial electronic communications of chromophores are both theoretically and practically fascinating. Despite intramolecular or intermolecular exciton coupling was observed in multichromophoric oligomers and J&#8208;aggregates, respectively, it is unusual that they both occur in the same molecule. Herein, ethene&#8208;bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY dimers with intramolecular exciton splitting have been developed. By encapsulating the dimer into F&#8208;127 polymer, J&#8208;type aggregated nanoparticles were produced, which showed obvious intermolecular exciton coupling and dramatically redshifted absorption and emission peaks at 936 and 1003&#8197;nm, respectively. The fabricated nanoagents have high photothermal conversion ability (&#951;=60.3&#8201;%) and are ultra&#8208;photostable, leading to complete tumor ablation with 915&#8197;nm laser irradiation. This phototherapeutic nanoplatform through modulating both intra&#8208; and intermolecular exciton couplings is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor treatment.

         <dc:description>
An adaptable strategy toward a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material with stage&#8208;by&#8208;stage responsive behavior was developed. This strategy ensures the compatibility of different stimuli&#8208;responses and the adjustability of stimulus&#8208;response behavioral logic. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent materials exhibited strong accessibility and adaptability for information encryption.







Abstract
A versatile strategy for smart fluorescent materials is lacking due to their diverse responding mechanisms and incompatibility of responsive behaviors. Herein an adaptable strategy is presented toward a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material with stage&#8208;by&#8208;stage responsive behavior by blending linear polymers modified with different stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties and AIE cross&#8208;linker. Under stimuli, the linear polymer can cross&#8208;link with the cross&#8208;linker to form networks, which intrinsically restrict the intramolecular rotation of the AIE molecule to induce strong emission. A unified stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanism is involved in that various stimuli are transferred through the organized &#8220;stimulus&#8208;crosslink&#8208;emission&#8221; process. This strategy ensures the compatibility of different stimuli&#8208;responses and the adjustability of stimulus&#8208;response behavioral logic. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent materials exhibited strong accessibility and adaptability for information encryption.

         <dc:description>
A chiral Lewis acid catalysed asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allenyl imide and alkenes was developed by Xiaohua Liu, Xiaoming Feng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202211596). This protocol provided a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A stepwise mechanism was proposed based on experimental studies and DFT calculations, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions were identified as crucial for the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Back Cover: Single&#8208;Product Faradaic Efficiency for Electrocatalytic of CO2 to CO at Current Density Larger than 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in Neutral Aqueous Solution by a Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 44/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of CO2 to CO is a promising approach for the cyclic use of CO2, but still suffers from impractical current density and durability. A single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C) that achieves industrial&#8208;scale performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202210985). Compared with the planar Ni&#8722;N4 site, the square&#8208;pyramidal Ni&#8722;N5 site has significant differences in the dz&#178; and dxz/yz orbital energy levels. Thus the Ni&#8722;N5 catalytic site has superior properties in activating CO2 molecules and promoting CO desorption.

Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) face several challenges, such as unstable Zn anodes and a low Zn ion transference number. A unique anion&#8208;trap strategy based on the host&#8211;guest interaction between &#946;&#8208;CD and anions is proposed by Chunyi Zhi, Wenjie Mai, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202210979) to greatly improve the overall performance in terms of both capacity and stability of ZIBs via promoting the Zn ion transfer ability and assisting the formation of reorientated dominant Zn(002) facets on the Zn anode.

The precise co&#8208;conformation regulation of topologically chiral [2]catenanes under two different external stimuli led to the construction of a bidirectional circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch, as reported by Xiao He, Wei Wang, Hai&#8208;Bo Yang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202210542). The results provide not only an attractive approach towards the construction of multistate CPL switches for practical uses but also a promising platform for the construction of novel chiral materials.

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework micro/nanoparticles (MOF MNPs) are reviewed with a focus on their morphological anisotropy, which plays a unique role in producing innovative structures and regulating properties with enhanced performance.







Abstract
Anisotropy plays a unique role in the structural regulation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites, especially at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale. However, there is a lack of a understanding of MOF micro/nanoparticles (MNPs) from the perspective of morphological anisotropy. In this Minireview, recent advances in anisotropic MOF MNPs are summarized, with a focus on how morphological anisotropy leads to innovative structures and modulates properties. First, anisotropic pristine MOF MNPs with diverse morphologies are introduced and classified by their morphology&#8208;dependent and morphology&#8208;independent anisotropy. Secondly, the anisotropy&#8208;enabled site&#8208;selective higher&#8208;order construction of MOF&#8208;based materials is highlighted. Finally, challenges and prospects for anisotropic MOFs are discussed, aiming to provide inspiration for further developments in this interesting research field.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Metal Complexes for Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction: From Adjustment of Intrinsic Activity to Molecular Immobilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review focuses on molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) including metal bipyridines and macrocycle complexes, and summarizes the molecular engineering strategies developed to regulate the intrinsic catalytic efficiency and modify the electrode. Guidelines are provided for the rational design of ECO2RR catalytic systems.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is one promising method for storing intermittent clean energy in chemical bonds and producing fuels. Among various kinds of catalysts for ECO2RR, molecular metal complexes with well&#8208;defined structures are convenient for studies of their rational design, structure&#8211;reactivity relationships, and mechanisms. In this Review, we summarize the molecular engineering of several N&#8208;based metal complexes including Re/Mn bipyridine compounds and metal macrocycles, concluding with general modification strategies to devise novel molecular catalysts with high intrinsic activity. Through physical adsorption, covalent linking, and formation of a periodic backbone, these active molecules can be heterogenized into immobilized catalysts with more practical prospects. Finally, significant challenges and opportunities based on molecular catalysts are discussed.

         <title>Regioselective Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C(sp2)&#8722;H Borylation: A Subject of Practical and Ongoing Interest in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in strategies for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective C&#8722;H borylation are summarized in this Review. Strategies developed to control the regioselectivity of the electrophilic borylation, such as approaches controlled by electronic effects, auxiliaries, and steric factors, are also discussed. EDG=electron donating group, DG=directing group, TM=transition metal.







Abstract
Considerable advances have been made in the area of C&#8722;H functionalization in the last few decades. A number of approaches including both directed and nondirected strategies have been developed thus far. Among the various C&#8722;H functionalizations, C&#8722;H borylation is of special interest due to the wide applications of organoboron compounds. In this regard, various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regioselective strategies have been developed. However, the major concern regarding metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation procedures is the requirement of a precious metal as well as the contamination by metal precursors in the desired products, which limit the application of this process in large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, recent trends have involved the use of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems. We summarize recent developments in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective C&#8722;H borylation. We believe that this Review will help to increase interest in this field and stimulate further progress.

         <title>Big (Bio)Chemical Data Mining Using Chemometric Methods: A Need for Chemists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big (Bio)Chemical Data Mining: Large and complex chemical data sets generated by modern analytical technologies have led to the so&#8208;called Big (Bio)Chemical Data era. These data sets can be produced using modern analytical instruments such as multi&#8208;dimensional chromatography, high&#8208;resolution and multi&#8208;dimensional spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging and DNA/RNA microarrays. Chemometric methods have shown potential to analyze BBCD especially in omics sciences and chemical toxicology/drug discovery.







Abstract
This Review summarizes how big (bio)chemical data (BBCD) can be analyzed with multivariate chemometric methods and highlights some of the important challenges faced by modern analytical researches. Here, the potential of chemometric methods to solve BBCD problems that are being encountered in chromatographic, spectroscopic and hyperspectral imaging measurements will be discussed, with an emphasis on their applications to omics sciences. In addition, insights and perspectives on how to address the analysis of BBCD are provided along with a discussion of the procedures necessary to obtain more reliable qualitative and quantitative results. In this Review, the importance of &#8220;big data&#8221; and of their relevance to (bio)chemistry are first discussed. Thereafter, analytical tools which can produce BBCD are presented as well as the theoretical background of chemometric methods and their limitations when they are applied to BBCD. Finally, the importance of chemometric methods for the analysis of BBCD in different chemical disciplines is highlighted with some examples. In this work, we have tried to cover many of the current applications of big data analysis in the (bio)chemistry field.

         <title>Polycyclic Hydrocarbons from [4n]Annulenes: Correlation versus Hybridization Forces in the Formation of Diradicaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptual electronic structure trip from [4n] H&#252;ckel antiaromatics to diradicaloids and to more hierarchical complex molecular shapes made by internal covalent hybridization of the peripheral [4n] &#960;&#8208;electron circuit is described. Focus is on the underlying physical organic chemistry implications.







Abstract
The conceptual connections between [4n] H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, disjoint orbitals, correlation energy, pro&#8208;aromaticity and diradical character for a variety of extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, including some salient recent examples of nanographenes and polycyclic aromatic radicals, are provided based on their [4n]annulene peripheries. The realization of such structure&#8211;property relationships has led to a beneficial pedagogic exercise establishing design guidelines for diradicaloids. The antiaromatic fingerprint of the [4n]annulene peripheries upon orbital interactions due to internal covalent connectors gives insights into the diradicaloid property of a diversity of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules that have fascinated chemists recently.

         <title>Optically Controlled Thermochromic Switching for Multi&#8208;Input Molecular Logic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We ideally design azobenzenes with alkyl chains (AZO(n)) as a photo trigger in the leuco dye based thermochromic system. The color developer in this system can be reversibly locked by Z&#8208;AZO(n), so that the leuco dye cannot capture the proton from the color developer to form the larger conjugate structure, while it can be released upon Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization. This new strategy can be considered as a possible multi&#8208;input molecular logic system.







Abstract
Leuco dye&#8208;based thermochromic materials offer enormous potential for visible molecular logic due to the appealing reversible color&#8208;changing effect. The stable color state is uncontrollable as it depends only on the spontaneous protonation of the leuco dye and color developer. There is still a challenge to propose an effective approach to control bistable color function at required temperature. A family of azobenzenes with various alkyl chains (AZO(n)) is designed for protonation competition with leuco dye. The hydrogen bond and Van der Waals forces are formed between color developer and AZO(n). The color developer can be locked to provide the proton for the leuco dye by Z&#8208;AZO(n), while it can be released upon Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization. The locked state can be lasted for more than 16&#8197;hours. This optically controlled leuco dye&#8208;based system demonstrates a visible sequential logic operation with four&#8208;input signals, and provides a new type of protonation&#8208;based optical control.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Cascade Reactions of Cyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Olefins for the Synthesis of Fused gem&#8208;Difluorooxetanes</title>

A combination of photoredox catalysis and energy transfer catalysis/direct photo&#8208;excitation enables cascade reactions of cyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;olefins, in which two rings and three bonds are constructed in one reaction, affording fused gem&#8208;difluorooxetanes. The reaction shows broad substrate scope, complete cis&#8208;selectivity, and downstream transformations of the products demonstrated the synthetic potential.







Abstract
Fluorinated fused rings are challenging to construct from simple starting materials. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade reactions of readily available cyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted olefins for the synthesis of fused gem&#8208;difluorooxetanes. Two rings and three bonds were efficiently constructed in one reaction. The reaction showed broad substrate scope and the downstream transformations of the products demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction. The mechanistic study supported the presence of cascade photoredox catalysis and energy transfer catalysis/direct photo&#8208;excitation processes.

         <title>Heteroatoms Induce Localization of the Electric Field and Promote a Wide Potential&#8208;Window Selectivity Towards CO in the CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin heteroatoms on a silver catalyst generate very strong and atomically localized electric fields, as disclosed by differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (DPC&#8208;STEM). This results in a 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO at a wide range of potentials (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE).







Abstract
Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2RR) is a sustainable way of producing carbon&#8208;neutral fuels. Product selectivity in CO2RR is regulated by the adsorption energy of reaction&#8208;intermediates. Here, we employ differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (DPC&#8208;STEM) to demonstrate that Sn heteroatoms on a Ag catalyst generate very strong and atomically localized electric fields. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR) results verified that the localized electric field enhances the adsorption of *COOH, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR. The Ag/Sn catalyst exhibits an approximately 100&#8201;% CO selectivity at a very wide range of potentials (from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, versus reversible hydrogen electrode), and with a remarkably high energy efficiency (EE) of 76.1&#8201;%.

         <title>Scalable Electrosynthesis of Formamide through C&#8722;N Coupling at the Industrially Relevant Current Density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2</title>

Boron&#8208;doped diamond catalyst is adopted for electrooxidation synthesis of formamide from methanol and ammonia with high activity and durability. A scale&#8208;up 8&#8197;L electrolyzer with an external renewable power supply for the production of formamide is designed to enable its scalable production (FE: 33.5&#8201;%, output: 36.9&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1), which shows the potential for the large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of formamide.







Abstract
The scalable and durable electrosynthesis of high&#8208;valued organonitrogen compounds from carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules, especially operating at a high current density, is highly desirable. Here, a one&#8208;pot electrooxidation method to synthesize formamide (HCONH2) from methanol and ammonia over a commercial boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) catalyst is reported. The formamide selectivity from methanol and formamide Faradaic efficiency (FE
) achieve 73.2&#8201;% and 41.2&#8201;% at the current density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with high durability. The C&#8722;N bond originates from the nucleophilic attack of ammonia on an aldehyde&#8208;like intermediate. Impressively, an 8&#8197;L electrolyzer is employed for the pilot plant test over a 2200&#8197;cm2 BDD electrode, which exhibits 33.5&#8201;% FE
 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (current: 264&#8197;A) with a yield rate of 36.9&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the potential of this technique for large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of formamide.

         <title>Silicon Catalyzed C&#8722;O Bond Ring Closing Metathesis of Polyethers</title>

         <dc:description>
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane is applied in the selective catalytic C&#8722;O ring&#8208;closing metathesis of challenging oligo&#8208; and polyethers, enabling upcycling of polyethylene glycol. Based on detailed investigations of the reaction mechanism by DFT calculations, an improved second&#8208;generation silicon&#8208;based Lewis superacid is developed.







Abstract
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane catalyzes C&#8722;O bond metathesis of alkyl ethers with an efficiency outperforming all earlier reported systems. Chemoselective ring contractions of macrocyclic crown ethers enable substrate&#8208;specific transformations, and an unprecedented ring&#8208;closing metathesis of polyethylene glycols allows polymer&#8208;selective degradation. Quantum chemical computations scrutinize a high Lewis acidity paired with a simultaneous low propensity for polydentate substrate binding as critical for successful catalysis. Based on these mechanistic insights, a second&#8208;generation class of silicon Lewis superacid with enhanced efficacy is identified and demonstrated.

         <title>Rapid and Economical Chemoselective Metabolomics Using Boronate Ester Formation on a Monolithic Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and economical chemoselective labeling strategy was established involving a boronate ester reaction on a monolithic substrate. Only 15&#8197;minutes is required to complete the strategy and boron allows for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need for expensive additional isotopic encoding. The sensitivity was enhanced up to 1&#8201;600 times compared with non&#8208;labeled liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry methods.







Abstract
Although chemoselective labeling strategies show great potential in in&#8208;depth description of metabolomics, the associated time and expense limit applications in high&#8208;throughput and routine analysis. We report a fast and effective chemoselective labeling strategy based on multifunctionalized monolithic probes. A rapid pH&#8208;responsive boronate ester reaction was employed to immobilize and release probe molecules from substrate in 5&#8197;min. The mesoporous surface and hierarchically porous channels of the substrate allowed for accelerated labeling reactions. Moreover, the discernible boron beacons allowed for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need for expensive isotopic encoding. This new strategy has been successfully used for submetabolome analysis of yeast cells, serum, and faeces samples, with improved sensitivity for short chain fatty acids up to 1&#8201;600 times compared with non&#8208;labeled liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) methods.

The sensitivity was enhanced up to 1&#8201;600 times compared with non-labeled liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although chemoselective labeling strategies show great potential in in-depth description of metabolomics, the associated time and expense limit applications in high-throughput and routine analysis. We report a fast and effective chemoselective labeling strategy based on multifunctionalized monolithic probes. A rapid pH-responsive boronate ester reaction was employed to immobilize and release probe molecules from substrate in 5&#8197;min. The mesoporous surface and hierarchically porous channels of the substrate allowed for accelerated labeling reactions. Moreover, the discernible boron beacons allowed for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need for expensive isotopic encoding. This new strategy has been successfully used for submetabolome analysis of yeast cells, serum, and faeces samples, with improved sensitivity for short chain fatty acids up to 1&#8201;600 times compared with non-labeled liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bi&#8208;polaron Transport and Magnetic Field Induced Pauli Spin Blockade in Redox&#8208;Active Molecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bi&#8208;polaron transport and magnetic field induced Pauli spin&#8208;blockade were revealed in redox&#8208;active molecules in molecular junctions (MJs), as evidenced by the magnetoresistance (MR) effect, which may bring new magnetic&#8208;electronic functionality to molecular scale electronic devices.







Abstract
We report the bi&#8208;polaron transport and magnetic field induced Pauli spin&#8208;blockade in solid&#8208;state molecular junctions (MJs) evidenced by a positive magnetoresistance (MR). The junction was made of thin layers of redox&#8208;active ruthenium polypyridyl&#8208;oligomers Ru(tpy)2 sandwiched between conducting amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) electrodes. The redox&#8208;active Ru(tpy)2 molecule, which enables small polaron and deep traps in the charge transport of the Ru(tpy)2 MJ as revealed by the temperature&#8208;dependent current&#8211;voltage response, leads to the formation of the bi&#8208;polaron and magnetic field induced Pauli spin blockade, resulting into the MR. At the meantime, the reliable and controllable device performance renders a rigid thickness&#8208;dependent MR evolution. The bi&#8208;polaron transport revealed in our study underscores the importance of the multi&#8208;particle transport by molecular design in MJs and laid the foundation for magnetic&#8208;electronic function in molecular&#8208;scale devices.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Regulated Conformational Change of Disulfide&#8208;Rich Assembling Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disulfide bond formation is usually used in nature for the regulation and stabilization of protein conformations. This principle has now been expanded to control the conformational change of thiol&#8208;rich peptides into an amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation, which undergoes a subsequent self&#8208;assembly to form a mechanically rigid hydrogel. Such a stimuli&#8208;responsive feature allows the biomedical application of such peptides.







Abstract
Disulfide bond formation is a common mechanism for regulating conformational changes in proteins during oxidative folding. Despite extensive studies of the use of multiple disulfide bonds to constrain peptide conformation, few studies have explored their usage in developing self&#8208;assembling peptides. Herein, we report that a thiol&#8208;rich peptide could fold into an amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation through the formation of two hetero&#8208;disulfide bonds upon oxidation, subsequently self&#8208;assembling into a mechanically rigid hydrogel. Breaking disulfide bonds under reductive condition, the hydrogel exhibited a transition from hydrogel to solution. Molecular simulation revealed that intermolecular interaction between two tryptophan residues was indispensable for hydrogelation. This work is the first case of the use of multiple disulfide bonds to control conformational change and self&#8208;assembly, and provides a cell&#8208;compatible hydrogel material for potential biomedical application.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV) Reveals Behaviorally Evoked Dopamine Release by Sugar Feeding in the Adult Drosophila Mushroom Body</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry was developed to measure behaviorally evoked dopamine release in the mushroom body of adult Drosophila melanogaster during sugar feeding. Sugar feeding stimulated robust dopamine release and its release was pharmacologically characterized. Dopamine release was increased after applying flupentixol and nisoxetine, demonstrating D2 receptors and dopamine transporters mediate sugar&#8208;evoked dopamine signaling.







Abstract
Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is an excellent model organism for studying dopaminergic mechanisms and simple behaviors, but methods to measure dopamine during behavior are needed. Here, we developed fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to track in vivo dopamine during sugar feeding. First, we employed acetylcholine stimulation to evaluate the feasibility of in vivo measurements in an awake fly. Next, we tested sugar feeding by placing sucrose solution near the fly proboscis. In the mushroom body medial tip, 1&#8197;pmol acetylcholine and sugar feeding released 0.49&#177;0.04&#8197;&#956;M and 0.31&#177;0.06&#8197;&#956;M dopamine, respectively but sugar&#8208;evoked release lasted longer than with acetylcholine. Administering the dopamine transporter inhibitor nisoxetine or D2 receptor antagonist flupentixol significantly increased sugar&#8208;evoked dopamine. This study develops FSCV to measure behaviorally evoked release in fly, enabling Drosophila studies of neurochemical control of reward, learning, and memory behaviors.

A novel dual&#8208;network structured hydrogel realizes stable and rechargeable solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries.







Abstract
As a key component of batteries, the electrolyte determines the ion transport and interface chemistry of the cathode and anode. In this work, we develop a dual&#8208;network structured hydrogel electrolyte composed of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium alginate (SA) and potassium iodide (KI) for solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries. The assembled hybrid battery shows excellent renewability and a long cycling life of 110&#8197;h with a high energy efficiency of 80&#8201;%. The ion&#8208;crosslinked dual&#8208;network structure endows the material with improved mechanical strength and increased ionic conductivity. More importantly, the introduction of iodine species not only offers more favorable cathodic kinetics of iodide/iodate redox than oxygen electrocatalysis but also regulates the solvation structure of zinc ions to ensure better interface stability. This work provides significant concepts for developing novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes to realize high&#8208;performance energy devices and technologies.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8722;N Bisindole Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers based on the de novo construction of one indole skeleton is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N axially chiral bisindoles were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole, indole&#8208;carbazole and non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were accessed using this protocol.







Abstract
N&#8722;N Atropisomers are a common motif in natural products and represent a significant dimension for exploration in modern pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. However, the catalytic atroposelective synthesis of such molecules remains challenging, hampering meaningful development. In particular, an enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers is unprecedented. Herein, the first enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed de novo construction of one indole skeleton is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N axially chiral bisindoles were generated in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities via a cascade condensation/N&#8208;arylation reaction. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole, indole&#8208;carbazole, and non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were accessed using this protocol. Moreover, investigations using density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the reaction mechanism and enantiocontrol.

     alt="Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8722;N Bisindole Atropisomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers based on the de novo construction of one indole skeleton is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N axially chiral bisindoles were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Structurally diverse indole-pyrrole, indole-carbazole and non-biaryl-indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were accessed using this protocol.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&#8722;N Atropisomers are a common motif in natural products and represent a significant dimension for exploration in modern pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. However, the catalytic atroposelective synthesis of such molecules remains challenging, hampering meaningful development. In particular, an enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers is unprecedented. Herein, the first enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers via the palladium-catalyzed de novo construction of one indole skeleton is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N axially chiral bisindoles were generated in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities via a cascade condensation/N-arylation reaction. Structurally diverse indole-pyrrole, indole-carbazole, and non-biaryl-indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were accessed using this protocol. Moreover, investigations using density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the reaction mechanism and enantiocontrol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dramatically Enhanced Reactivity of Fullerenes and Tetrazine towards the Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction inside a Porous Porphyrinic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a dramatic enhancement in the reactivity of fullerenes (C60/C70)&#8208;tetrazine reaction inside a porous Zn&#8208;porphyrinic cage (Zn&#8208;PB) under sustainable conditions. Moreover, hydration&#8208;induced rearrangement of C60&#8208;LA inside Zn&#8208;PB facilitates its release from the Zn&#8208;PB cavity, thus enabling Zn&#8208;PB to catalyze fullerene&#8208;pyrazoline adduct formation without product inhibition.







Abstract
Inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (IEDDA) between fullerenes and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine generally requires harsh conditions and long reaction times due to their strong electron&#8208;accepting nature. Herein, we report a dramatic enhancement in the reactivity of the fullerenes (C60/C70)&#8208;tetrazine reaction inside a porous Zn&#8208;porphyrinic cage (Zn&#8208;PB) under sustainable conditions by installing a tetrazine&#8208;based axle (LA) via metal&#8208;ligand coordination bond, which modulates the cavity size to facilitate the encapsulation of fullerenes. Upon encapsulation, the close proximity of fullerenes and the tetrazine group of LA dramatically increase their reactivity towards the IEDDA reaction to form fullerene&#8208;tetrazine adducts. Furthermore, the C60&#8208;tetrazine adduct is rearranged upon hydration to a bent&#8208;shaped C60&#8208;pyrazoline adduct that can be released from the Zn&#8208;PB cavity in the presence of excess LA, thus catalyzing the formation of C60&#8208;pyrazoline adduct inside Zn&#8208;PB without product inhibition.

         <title>Substrate Tumbling in a Chemisorbed Diastereomeric &#945;&#8208;Ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;Naphthyl)ethylamine Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and adsorption forces, an &#945;&#8208;ketoester tumbles between two prochiral states in a chemisorbed diastereomeric complex.







Abstract
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data for &#945;&#8208;ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine complexes on Pt(111) reveal a tumbling motion that couples two neighboring binding states. The interconversion, resulting in prochiral inversion of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester, occurs in single complexes without breaking them apart. This is a surprising observation because the overall motion requires rotation of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester away from the surface without branching exclusively into diffusion away from the complex or desorption. The multi&#8208;step interconversion is rationalized in terms of sequences of bound states that combine transient H&#8208;bond interactions with the chiral molecule and weakened adsorption interactions with the metal. The observation of tumbling in single long&#8208;lived complexes is of relevance to self&#8208;assembly and directed molecular motion on surfaces, to ligand&#8208;controlled surface reactions, and most directly to stereocontrol in asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>A Reactivity&#8208;Tunable Self&#8208;Immolative Design Enables Histone Deacetylase&#8208;Targeted Imaging and Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a reactivity&#8208;tunable self&#8208;immolative design that enables activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and HDAC&#8208;responsive prodrug release in vivo. Our design highlights the potential for HDAC&#8208;targeted cancer diagnosis and drug development.







Abstract
Histone deacetylase (HDAC)&#8208;targeted probes and prodrugs are crucial for cancer theranostics. We developed a self&#8208;immolative design that enables in vivo activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and prodrug release in response to HDAC.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a reactivity-tunable self-immolative design that enables activatable near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and HDAC-responsive prodrug release in vivo. Our design highlights the potential for HDAC-targeted cancer diagnosis and drug development.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histone deacetylase (HDAC)-targeted probes and prodrugs are crucial for cancer theranostics. We developed a self-immolative design that enables in vivo activatable near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and prodrug release in response to HDAC. This design comprises a phenyl ester linker with tunable reactivity, facilitating efficient release of caged fluorophores/drugs upon deacetylation. We engineered a new fluorophore using a spirocyclic xanthene scaffold with ring-open property, affording NIRF/PA detection with high contrast. We showed that a nitro-substituted self-immolative linker allows sensitive NIRF/PA in vivo imaging of HDAC with minimal interference. A highly efficient prodrug system was further developed for targeted therapy in HDAC-overexpressed triple negative breast tumors in mice.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed PIDA&#8208;Mediated &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Acetoxylation of Amino Acid Derivatives: Overriding Competitive Intramolecular Amination</title>

         <dc:description>
Selective &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acetoxylation of amino acid derivatives has been achieved by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) as terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The N&#8208;SO2Py protecting/directing group plays a key role in enabling control of chemoselectivity (intermolecular C&#8722;O over intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation) and regioselectivity (favoring &#948;&#8208;CH3 over &#947;&#8208;CH2 activation).







Abstract
The selective &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acetoxylation of N&#8208;(SO2Py)&#8208;protected amino acid derivatives has been accomplished by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) as both terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The distinct structural and electronic features of the SO2Py compared to more traditional carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups is essential to override the otherwise more favourable competitive intramolecular C&#8722;H amination. The &#948;&#8208;site selectivity predominates over traditionally more favorable 5&#8208;membered cyclopalladation at competitive &#947;&#8208;CH2. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies provide important insights about the mechanism and the underlying factors controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

         <title>Luciferase&#8208;free Luciferin Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spectral tuning&#8212;from green to red&#8212;of luciferase&#8208;free luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) was demonstrated by means of electrolyte engineering. The color change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and brings evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state by double layer electric fields. Visual mapping of ECL and fluorescence fronts enables the optical quantitation of superoxide and oxyluciferin diffusivities.







Abstract
Luciferin is one of Nature's most widespread luminophores, and enzymes that catalyze luciferin luminescence are the basis of successful commercial &#8220;glow&#8221; assays for gene expression and metabolic ATP formation. Herein we report an electrochemical method to promote firefly's luciferin luminescence in the absence of its natural biocatalyst&#8212;luciferase. We have gained experimental and computational insights on the mechanism of the enzyme&#8208;free luciferin electrochemiluminescence, demonstrated its spectral tuning from green to red by means of electrolyte engineering, proven that the colour change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and gained evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer excited state by double layer electric fields. Luciferin's electrochemiluminescence, as well as the in situ generation of fluorescent oxyluciferin, are applied towards an optical measurement of diffusion coefficients.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Benzylation with Photogenerated Hydroxy&#8208;o&#8208;Quinodimethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic benzylation with 2&#8208;methylbenzophenone derivatives under light irradiation is described. The corresponding nucleophilic photoenols generated under light irradiation, enabled the reaction to take place in reasonable yields (up to 77&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, without the need for strong bases, or pre&#8208;decoration of the substrates.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic benzylation of aryl vinyl carbinols under light irradiation is described. 2&#8208;Methylbenzophenone derivatives are employed and activated to hydroxy&#8208;o&#8208;quinodimethanes by an ultraviolet (UV) light. This approach enables asymmetric allylic benzylation with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) from readily available 2&#8208;methylbenzophenones without the utilization of strong bases, and pre&#8208;activation or pre&#8208;functionalization of the substrates. Moreover, deuterium experiments reveal the generation of nucleophilic benzyl species from 2&#8208;methylbenzophenone under UV irradiation.

         <title>Competitive Non&#8208;Radical Nucleophilic Attack Pathways for NH3 Oxidation and H2O Oxidation on Hematite Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish H2O oxidation kinetics on photoanodes severely obstructs the overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;energy efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Herein, we find a 10 to 55&#8208;fold increase of photocurrent by conducting ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) on hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3) photoanodes under near&#8208;neutral pH (9~11) and moderate applied potentials (1.0~1.4 VRHE) compared to H2O oxidation. By rate law analysis and operando spectroscopic studies, we confirm the non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack of NH3 molecules on high&#8208;valent surface Fe&#8722;O species (e.g., FeIV=O) and Fe&#8722;N species that produces NOx&#8208; and N2, respectively, which overwhelms the nucleophilic attack of H2O on surface FeIV=O and contributes to a high Faradaic efficiency of above 80% for AOR. This work reveals a novel non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack strategy, which is significantly different from the conventional indirect radical&#8208;mediated AOR mechanism, for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AOR photoelectrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Alkene Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkene metathesis catalyzed by enantiopure metal alkylidene complexes enables exceptionally versatile strategies to products with configurationally&#8208;defined stereocenters. Desymmetriza&#173;tion processes thereby provide reliable stereoselective routes to aliphatic structures, while the differentiation of aromatic stereogenic units remained an outstanding challenge. Herein, we describe the feasibility of alkene metathesis to catalytically control stereogenic axes by traceless arene formation. Stereodynamic trienes are selectively converted into corresponding binaphthalene atropisomers upon exposure to a chiral molybdenum catalyst. Remarkably, stereo&#173;selective arene&#8208;forming metathesis allows enantioselectivities of up to 98:2 e.r. and excellent yields. As the disconnection of each bond of an aromatic target is retrosynthetically conceivable, it is anticipated that forging arenes by means of stereoselective metathesis will enable versatile approaches for the synthesis of a broad range of molecular topologies with precisely defined configuration.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiazole Imide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Acceptor Homopolymer with Branched Ethylene Glycol Side Chains for Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>n&#8208;Type semiconducting polymers with high thermoelectric performance remain challenging due to the scarcity of molecular design strategy, limiting their applications in organic thermoelectric (OTE) devices. Herein, we provide a new approach to enhance the OTE performance of n&#8208;doped polymers by introducing acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;A) type backbone bearing branched ethylene glycol (EG) side chains. When doped with 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI), the A&#8208;A homopolymer PDTzTI&#8208;TEG exhibits n&#8208;type electrical conductivity (&#963;) up to 34 S cm&#8208;1 and power factor value of 15.7 &#956;W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2. The OTE performance of PDTzTI&#8208;TEG is far greater than that of homopolymer PBTI&#8208;TEG (&#963; = 0.27 S cm&#8208;1), indicating that introducing electron&#8208;deficient thiazole units in the backbone further improves the n&#8208;doping efficiency. These results demonstrate that developing A&#8208;A type polymers with EG side chains is an effective strategy to enhance n&#8208;type OTE performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A 2.75 V ammonium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The popular metal&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) suffer from environmental and economic issues because of their heavy dependency on nonrenewable metals. Here, we propose a metal&#8208;free&#160;ammonium (NH4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery with a record&#8208;breaking operation voltage of 2.75 V. The working mechanism of this sustainable battery involves the reversible anion (PF6&#8722;) intercalation chemistry in graphite cathode and NH4+ intercalation behavior in PTCDI (3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide) anode. This new battery configuration successfully circumvented the reduction susceptibility of NH4+ and the lack of mature NH4+&#8208;rich cathodes for NH4+ion batteries (AIBs). The customized organic NH4+ electrolyte endows the graphite||PTCDI full battery with durable longevity (over 1000 cycles) and a high energy density (200 Wh kg&#8722;1). We show that the development of AIBs should be high&#8208;voltage&#8208;oriented while circumventing low operation potential to avoid NH4+ reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Dissolution of Precious Metals by TiO2 through Photogenerated Free Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring the pathways for photocatalytic dissolution of precious metals (PMs) is crucial for optimizing recovery. In this work, we systematically investigated the selectivity and solvation effects observed for dissolution by focusing on photocatalysis, precious metals and solvents. By combining transient characterization, reaction kinetics, and density functional theory, we determined that the radicals generated in photocatalysis were the key active species in the entire reaction. The cyano functional group in the solvent was the driving factor for dissolution of gold, and the importance of chlorine radicals for dissolution of platinum group precious metals was further confirmed. In addition, the catalytic properties of different precious metals can promote different transformations of functional groups, leading to selective dissolution. The structures of photocatalytic precious metal leaches also precisely explains the special coordination forms of precious metals and functional group ligands.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates, anionic metal&#8722;oxygen nanoclusters that possess composition&#8208;dependent various properties, are widely used to modify the existing properties of metal nanoparticles and to endow them with new ones. Herein, we present a review of recent advances in hybrid materials that consist of metal nanoparticles and polyoxometalates. Following a brief introduction on the inception of this area and its development, representative properties and applications of these materials in various fields such as electrochemistry, photochemistry, and catalysis are introduced. We discuss that the combination of two classic inorganic materials facilitates cooperative and synergistic behavior, and we also express personal perspectives on the future development in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization Enabled Mimetic Synthesis of Axially Chiral B,N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral molecules bearing multiple stereogenic axes is of great importance in the field of organic chemistry. However, the efficient construction of atropisomers featuring two different types of stereogenic axes has largely unexplored. Herein, we report the novel atroposelective synthesis of configurationally stable axially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles. By using stepwise asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (AASI) strategy, diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles bearing B&#8208;C and C&#8208;N axes that are related to the moieties of axially chiral enamines and arylborons were also obtained. In this case, all four stereoisomers of diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles were stereodivergently afforded in high enantioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NH&#8230;&#960; interactions played a unique effect on the promotion of stereospecific isomerization, thereby leading to the highly efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Synthesis of B/N&#8208;Doped Calix[4]arene Exhibiting Narrowband Multiple Resonance Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel macrocycle of B/N&#8208;doped calix[4]arene (C&#8208;BN)&#160;was synthesized by a one&#8208;shot double boronation. Owing to the structural tension and electron&#8208;donating properties of the nitrogen atoms in the macrocycle, reaction selectively proceeds between the adjacent benzene rings outside the macrocycle. C&#8208;BN shows a highly centrosymmetric structure with two multiple resonance (MR) fragments bridged by tertiary amine groups at the 1,3 positions of the benzene ring. Benefiting from the large intermolecular distance (&gt; 4.6 &#197;) between adjacent MR&#8208;emitting cores, C&#8208;BN also exhibits excellent narrowband emitting features against aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and spectrum broadening. Optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices based on C&#8208;BN exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6% and small full width at half maximums of 25&#8211;28 nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12 wt %.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Proton Rectifier Using a Heterogeneous Membrane Composed of Coordination Polymer and Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational control of unidirectional proton transport is highly challenging, primarily owing to the difficulty in introducing an asymmetric factor into proton conducting media. In this study, freestanding membranes of a proton&#8208;conducting two&#8208;dimensional porous coordination polymer, Cu  2  (CuTCPP) (H  2  TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and a hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide, Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;LDH(NO  3  ), were combined to generate a pH gradient in the conducting media. The current&#8211;voltage measurements revealed that the heterogeneous membrane exhibits a significant unidirectional proton transport with a proton rectification ratio exceeding 200 under 90% relative humidity in the initial voltage scan. This value is the highest among the reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state proton rectifiers. The high designability of both components with well&#8208;defined structures, which is in contrast to the organic polymers used so far, provides a new avenue for developing and understanding the protonrectifying behavior in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>The Single&#8208;Component Flavin Reductase/Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenase AetF is a Versatile Catalyst for Selective Bromination and Iodination of Arenes and Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) natively catalyze selective halogenation of electron rich aromatic and enolate groups. Nearly all FDHs reported to date require a separate flavin reductase to supply them with FADH2&#173;, which complicates biocatalysis applications. In this study, we establish that the single component flavin reductase/flavin dependent halogenase AetF catalyzes halogenation of a diverse set of substrates using a commercially available glucose dehydrogenase to drive its halogenase activity. High site selectivity, activity on relatively unactivated substrates, and high enantioselectivity for atroposelective bromination and bromolactonization was demonstrated. Site&#8208;selective iodination and enantioselective cycloiodoetherification was also possible using AetF. The substrate and reaction scope of AetF suggest that it has the potential to greatly improve the utility of biocatalytic halogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of C(13)/C(13&#8217;)&#8208;Bis(desmethyl)disorazole Z</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the total synthesis of the macrodiolide C(13)/C(13')&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole Z via double inter&#8208;/intramolecular Stille cross&#8208;coupling of a monomeric vinyl stannane/vinyl iodide precursor to achieve macrocycle formation. The key step in the synthesis of this precursor was a stereoselective aldol reaction of a formal Evans acetate aldol product with crotonaldehyde. As demonstrated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the binding mode of C(13)/C(13')&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole Z to tubulin is virtually identical with that of the natural product disorazole Z. Likewise, C(13)/C(13')&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole Z inhibits tubulin assembly with at least the same potency as disorazole Z and it appears to be a more potent cell growth inhibitor.</dc:description>

         <title>CAPturAM, a Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Strategy for Selective Enrichment and Detection of Physiological CAPAM&#8208;Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modified nucleotides impact all aspects of eukaryotic mRNAs and contribute to regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional and translational level. At the 5&#8242; cap, adenosine as first transcribed nucleotide is often  N  6  &#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;  O  &#8208;methyl adenosine (m  6  A  m  ). This modification is tissue dependent and reversible, pointing to a regulatory function. CAPAM was recently identified as methyltransferase responsible for m  6  A  m  formation, however, the direct assignemnt of its target transcripts proves difficult. Antibodies do not discriminate between internal  N  6  &#8208;methyl adenosine (m  6  A) and m  6  A  m  . Here we present CAPturAM, an antibody&#8208;free chemical biology approach for direct enrichment and probing of physiological CAPAM&#8208;targets. We harness CAPAM&#8217;s cosubstrate promiscuity to install propargyl groups on its targets. Subsequent functionalization with an affinity handle allows for their enrichment. Using wildtype and CAPAM  &#8211;/&#8211;  cells, we successfully applied CAPturAM to confirm or disprove CAPAM&#8208;targets, facilitating the verification and identification of CAPAM targets.</dc:description>
