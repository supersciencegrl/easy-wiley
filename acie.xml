         <title>Supramolecularly Engineered Reporters with Superoxide Anion&#8208;Triggered Chemiluminescence for Early Diagnosis and Efficient Amelioration of Acute Kidney Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; preparation of kidney injury molecule&#8208;1&#8208;targeting supramolecular chemiluminescence (CL) reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid (PLGA)&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate (CPPO), chlorin e6 (Ce6) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), for early diagnosis and amelioration of acute kidney injury (AKI). In this system, O2&#8226;&#8208;, a biomarker of AKI, triggers the oxidation of CPPO to 1,2&#8208;dioxetanedione and subsequent CL emission via CL resonance energy transfer to Ce6. The L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA stabilizes CPPO and Ce6 via noncovalent interactions, promoting long&#8208;lived CL (half&#8208;lives: ~1000 s). Transcriptomics analysis shows that PCCS reporters reduce the inflammatory response through glutathione metabolism and inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway. The reporters are able to non&#8208;invasively detect AKI at least 12 h earlier than current assays, and their antioxidant properties allow simultaneous treatment of AKI.</dc:description>

         <title>Modeling the Enzyme Specificity by Molecular Cages through Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species&#160;Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking the active site and the substrate binding cavity of the enzyme to achieve specificity in catalytic reactions is an essential challenge. Herein, porous coordination cages (PCCs) with intrinsic cavities and tunable metal centers have proved the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating pathways as evidenced by multiple photo&#8208;induced oxidations. Remarkably, in the presence of the Zn4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center, PCC converted dioxygen molecules from triplet to singlet excitons, whereas the Ni4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center promoted the efficient dissociation of electrons and holes to conduct electron transfer towards substrates. Accordingly, the distinct ROS generation behavior of PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Zn and PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Ni enables the conversion of O2 to 1O2 and O2&#8226;&#8722;, respectively. In contrast, the Co4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center combined the 1O2 and O2&#8226;&#8722; together to generate carbonyl radicals, which in turn reacted with the oxygen molecules. Harnessing the three oxygen activation pathways, PCC&#8208;6&#8208;M (M = Zn/Ni/Co) display specific catalytic activities in thioanisole oxidation (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Zn), benzylamine coupling (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Ni), and aldehyde autoxidation (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Co). This work not only provides fundamental insights into the regulation of ROS generation by a supramolecular catalyst but also demonstrates a rare example of achieving reaction specificity through mimicking natural enzymes by PCCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemo&#8208;enzymatic Approach to Produce a Cyclic Analogue of the Analgesic Drug MVIIA (Ziconotide)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ziconotide (&#969;&#8208;conotoxin MVIIA) is an approved analgesic for the treatment of chronic pain. However, the need for intrathecal administration and adverse effects have limited its widespread application. Backbone cyclization is one way to improve the pharmaceutical properties of conopeptides, but so far chemical synthesis alone has been unable to produce correctly folded and backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA. In this study, an asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP)&#8208;mediated cyclization was used to generate backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA for the first time. Cyclization using six to nine&#8208;residue linkers did not perturb the overall structure of MVIIA, and the cyclic analogues of MVIIA showed inhibition of voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) and substantially improved stability in human serum and stimulated intestinal fluid. Our study reveals that AEP transpeptidases are capable of cyclizing structurally complex peptides that chemical synthesis cannot achieve and paves the way for further improving the therapeutic value of conotoxins.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Olefinic C&#8722;H Bonds by an Aryl&#8208;to&#8208;Vinyl 1,4&#8208;Nickel Migration/Reductive Coupling Sequence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An attractive approach to selective functionalization of remote C&#8211;H bonds is a metal/hydride shift/cross&#8208;coupling reaction sequence. Complimentary to the heavily exploited 1,2&#8208;nickel/hydride shift along an sp3 chain, a chain&#8208;walking process, the 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift along an sp2 chain is more complex. Here we report an unprecedented aryl&#8208;to&#8208;vinyl 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift reaction, in which the migratory alkenylnickel species generated in situ is selectively trapped by one of various coupling partners, such as isocyanates, alkyl bromides, aryl chlorides or alkynyl bromides, allowing regio&#8208; and stereoselective access to trisubstituted alkenes. In contrast to the well&#8208;reported ipso&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, this strategy provides remote alkenyl C&#8211;H functionalized products with good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E/Z&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Assisted Microfluidic Platform Enables Single&#8208;Cell Metabolite Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colonization of cancer cells at secondary sites, a decisive step in tumor metastasis, is strongly dependent on the formation of metastatic microenvironments regulated by intrinsic single&#8208;cell metabolism traits. Herein, we report a single&#8208;cell microfluidic platform for high&#8208;throughput dynamic monitoring of tumor cell metabolites to evaluate tumor malignancy. This microfluidic device empowers efficient isolation of single cells (&gt;99%) in a squashed state similar to tumor extravasation, and employs enzyme&#8208;packaged metal&#8211;organic frameworks to catalyze tumor cell metabolites for visualization. The microfluidic evaluation was confirmed by in vivo assays, suggesting that the platform allowed predicting the tumorigenicity of captured tumor cells and screening metabolic inhibitors as anti&#8208;metastatic drugs. Furthermore, the platform efficiently detected various aggressive cancer cells in unprocessed whole blood samples with high sensitivity, showing potential for clinical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Self&#8208;sorting in Molecular and Polymeric Architectures Enabled by Spiroborate Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;sorting is commonly observed in complex reaction systems, which has been utilized to guide the formation of single major by&#8208;design molecules. However, most studies have been focused on non&#8208;covalent systems, and using self&#8208;sorting to achieve covalently bonded architectures is still relatively less explored. In this work, we first demonstrated the dynamic nature of spiroborate linkage and systematically studied the self&#8208;sorting behavior observed in the transformation between spiroborate&#8208;linked well&#8208;defined polymeric and molecular architectures, which are enabled by spiroborate bond exchange. The scrambling between a macrocycle and a 1D helical covalent polymer led to the formation of a molecular cage, whose structures are all unambiguously elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The results indicate that the molecular cage is the thermodynamically favored product in this multi&#8208;component reaction system. This work represents the first example that a 1D polymeric architecture transforms into a shape&#8208;persistent molecular cage, driven by dynamic covalent self&#8208;sorting. This study will further guide the design of spiroborate&#8208;based materials and open the possibilities for the development of novel complex yet responsive dynamic covalent molecular or polymeric systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Step Nucleation of A Crystalline Silicate Framework via A Structurally Precise Prenucleation Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical nucleation pathways are ubiquitous in the synthesis of minerals and materials. In the case of open framework lattices such as zeolites and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, pre&#8208;organized multi&#8208;ion &#8220;secondary building units&#8221; (SBUs) have long been proposed as fundamental building blocks of the forming crystals. However, detailing the progress of multi&#8208;step reaction mechanisms in going from monomeric species to stable crystals and defining the structures of the intermediate SBUs remains an unmet challenge. Combining in situ nuclear magnetic resonance, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy, we show that crystallization of the framework silicate, cyclosilicate hydrate, occurs through an assembly of cubic octameric Q38&#160;polyanions formed through cross&#8208;linking and polymerization of smaller silicate monomers and other oligomers. These Q38 are stabilized by hydrogen bonds with surrounding H2O and tetramethylammonium ions (TMA+). When Q38 levels reach a threshold of&#160;~32% of the total silicate species nucleation within these clathrates occurs. Further growth proceeds through the incorporation of [(TMA)x(Q38)&#183;nH2O](x&#8208;8) clathrate complexes into step edges on the crystals. These findings provide a clear picture of the multi&#8208;step nucleation process by which SBUs build a framework silicate lattice with implications for the synthesis of both functional materials and natural minerals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The aryl&#8208;to&#8208;vinyl nickel 1,4&#8208;migration (1,4&#8208;Ni migration) reaction has been reported for the first time. The generated alkenyl Ni species undergo a reductive coupling reaction with unactivated brominated alkanes affording a series of trisubstituted olefins. This tandem reaction exhibits mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, high regioselectivity, and excellent Z/E stereoselectivity. A series of controlled experiments have shown that the critical 1,4&#8208;Ni migration process is reversible. In addition, the alkenyl nickel intermediates obtained after migration are highly Z/E stereoselective and do not undergo Z/E isomerization. The obtained trace isomerization products are caused by the instability of the product.</dc:description>

         <title>Significant Acceleration of Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface of Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is largely constrained by the sluggish mass transfer and fast combination of photogenerated charge carriers. Herein, we find that the photocatalytic CO2RR efficiency at the abundant gas&#8208;liquid interface provided by microdroplets is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding bulk phase reaction. Even in the absence of sacrificial agents, the production rates of HCOOH over WO3&#183;0.33H2O mediated by microdroplets reaches 2536 &#956;mol h&#8208;1g&#8208;1 (vs. 13 &#956;mol h&#8208;1g&#8208;1 in bulk phase), which is significantly superior to the previously reported photocatalytic CO2RR in bulk phase reaction condition. Beyond the efficient delivery of CO2 to photocatalyst surfaces within microdroplets, we reveal that the strong electric field at the gas&#8208;liquid interface of microdroplets essentially promotes the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. &#160;This study provides a deep understanding of ultrafast reaction kinetics promoted by the gas&#8208;liquid interface of microdroplets and a novel way of addressing the low efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to fuel.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into Iron Leaching from an Ascorbate&#8208;Oxidase&#8208;like&#160;Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Nanozyme and Oxygen Reduction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ascorbate (H2A) is a well&#8208;known antioxidant to protect cellular components from free radical damage, meanwhile it is also emerged as a pro&#8208;oxidant in cancer therapies. However, such &#8220;contradictory&#8221; mechanisms underlying H2A oxidation are not well understood. Herein, we report Fe leaching during catalytic H2A oxidation using an Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C nanozyme as a ferritin mimic and its influence on the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the heterogeneity, the Fe&#8208;Nx sites in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C primarily catalyzed H2A oxidation and 4e&#8722; ORR via an iron&#8208;oxo intermediate. Nonetheless, trace O2&#8226;&#8722; produced by marginal N&#8208;C sites via 2e&#8722; ORR accumulated and attacked Fe&#8208;Nx sites, leading to the linear leakage of unstable Fe ions up to 420 ppb when the H2A concentration increased to 2 mM. As a result, a substantial fraction (~40%) of the N&#8208;C sites on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C was activated, and a new 2+2e&#8722; ORR path was finally enabled, along with Fenton&#8208;type H2A oxidation. Consequently, after Fe ions diffused into the bulk solution, the ORR at the N&#8208;C sites stopped at H2O2 production, which was the origin of the pro&#8208;oxidant effect of H2A.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanobody Loop Mimetics Enhance Son of Sevenless 1&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleotide Exchange on RAS
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides based on the interacting loop of a nanobody were designed as downsized mimetics, by considering interactions with the RAS&#8201;:&#8201;son of sevenless&#8197;1 (SOS1) protein complex observed in their co&#8208;crystal structure. A biochemical assay, flanked by X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystal structures and kinetic studies, demonstrated the modulation of nucleotide exchange activity of the RAS&#8201;:&#8201;SOS1 complex, together with high structural mimicry of the nanobody paratope.







Abstract
RAS proteins control various intracellular signaling networks. Mutations at specific locations were shown to stabilize their active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)&#8208;bound state, which is associated with the development of multiple cancers. An attractive approach to modulate RAS signaling is through its regulatory guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) son of sevenless 1 (SOS1). With the recent discovery of Nanobody14 (Nb14), which potently enhances SOS1&#8208;catalyzed nucleotide exchange on RAS, we explored the feasibility of developing peptide mimetics by structurally mimicking the complementarity&#8208;determining region&#8197;3 (CDR3). Guided by a biochemical GEF assay and X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystal structures, successive rounds of optimization and gradual conformational rigidification led to CDR3 mimetics showing half of the maximal activation potential of Nb14 with an EC50 value of 29&#8197;&#956;M. Altogether, this study demonstrated that peptides able to modulate a protein&#8208;protein interaction can be obtained by structural mimicry of a Nb paratope.

         <title>Chemical Communication and Protocell&#8208;Matrix Dynamics in Segregated Colloidosome Micro&#8208;Colonies</title>

Janus&#8208;like covalent/ionic crosslinked hydrogel microspheres with spatially partitioned populations of enzyme&#8208;loaded protocells were constructed and used as integrated platforms for domain&#8208;mediated chemical communication and programmable protocell&#8208;matrix dynamics.







Abstract
Despite an emerging catalogue of collective behaviours in communities of homogeneously distributed cell&#8208;like objects, microscale protocell colonies with spatially segregated populations have received minimal attention. Here, we use microfluidics to fabricate Janus&#8208;like calcium alginate hydrogel microspheres with spatially partitioned populations of enzyme&#8208;containing inorganic colloidosomes and investigate their potential as integrated platforms for domain&#8208;mediated chemical communication and programmable protocell&#8208;matrix dynamics. Diffusive chemical signalling within the segregated communities gives rise to increased initial enzyme kinetics compared with a homogeneous distribution of protocells. We employ competing enzyme&#8208;mediated hydrogel crosslinking and decrosslinking reactions in different domains of the partitioned colonies to undertake selective expulsion of a specific protocell population from the community. Our results offer new possibilities for the design and construction of spatially organized cytomimetic consortia capable of endogenous chemical processing and protocell&#8208;environment interactivity.

&lt;p&gt;Despite an emerging catalogue of collective behaviours in communities of homogeneously distributed cell-like objects, microscale protocell colonies with spatially segregated populations have received minimal attention. Here, we use microfluidics to fabricate Janus-like calcium alginate hydrogel microspheres with spatially partitioned populations of enzyme-containing inorganic colloidosomes and investigate their potential as integrated platforms for domain-mediated chemical communication and programmable protocell-matrix dynamics. Diffusive chemical signalling within the segregated communities gives rise to increased initial enzyme kinetics compared with a homogeneous distribution of protocells. We employ competing enzyme-mediated hydrogel crosslinking and decrosslinking reactions in different domains of the partitioned colonies to undertake selective expulsion of a specific protocell population from the community. Our results offer new possibilities for the design and construction of spatially organized cytomimetic consortia capable of endogenous chemical processing and protocell-environment interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing Abundant Chirality Inversion of Supramolecular Nanohelices by Multiply Manipulating the Binding Sites in Molecular Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abundant chirality inversion has been realized by 1) manipulating the co&#8208;assembled binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives with different naphthalene derivatives (Mode&#8197;A or B), 2) synergistically manipulating the carboxy and amide binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives to simultaneously interact with two kind of naphthalene derivatives (Mode&#8197;A+B), and 3) switching the interaction modes by varying solvent.







Abstract
The induction of diverse chirality regulation in nature by multiple binding sites of biomolecules is ubiquitous and plays an essential role in determining the biofunction of biosystems. However, mimicking this biological phenomenon and understanding at a molecular level its mechanism with the multiple binding sites by establishing an artificial system still remains a challenge. Herein, abundant chirality inversion is achieved by precisely and multiply manipulating the co&#8208;assembled binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives (D/LPPF) with different naphthalene derivatives (NA, NC, NP, NF). The amide and hydroxy group of naphthalene derivatives prefer to bind with the carboxy group of LPPF, while carboxylic groups and fluoride atoms tend to bind with the amide moiety of LPPF. All these diverse interaction modes can precisely trigger helicity inversion of LPPF nanofibers. In addition, synergistically manipulating the carboxy and amide binding sites from a single LPPF molecule to simultaneously interact with different naphthalene derivatives leads to chirality regulation. Typically, varying the solvent may switch the interaction modes and the switched new interaction modes can be employed to further regulate the chirality of the LPPF nanofibers. This study may provide a novel approach to explore chirality diversity in artificial systems by regulating the intermolecular binding sites.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Conversion of Carbon&#8208;Sequestrated Seawater into Stoichiometric CO and HClO with Nitrogen&#8208;Doped BiOCl Atomic Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped BiOCl atomic layers can directly split carbon&#8208;sequestrated natural seawater into stoichiometric CO and HClO under visible light with selectivities greater than 90&#8201;%. The produced HClO can effectively kill typical bacteria in the ballast water of ocean&#8208;going cargo ships.







Abstract
Seawater is one of the most important CO2 sequestration media for delivering value&#8208;added chemicals/fuels and active chlorine; however, this scenario is plagued by sluggish reaction rates and poor product selectivity. Herein, we first report the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped BiOCl atomic layers to directly split carbon&#8208;sequestrated natural seawater (Yellow Sea, China) into stoichiometric CO (92.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and HClO (83.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) under visible light with selectivities greater than 90&#8201;%. Photoelectrons enriched on the exposed BiOCl{001} facet kinetically facilitate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction via surface&#8208;doped nitrogen bearing Lewis basicity. Photoholes, mainly located on the lateral facets of van der Waals gaps, promote the selective oxidation of Cl&#8722; into HClO. Sequestrated CO2 also maintains the pH of seawater at around 4.2 to prevent the alkaline earth cations from precipitating. The produced HClO can effectively kill typical bacteria in the ballast water of ocean&#8208;going cargo ships, offering a green and safe way for onsite sterilization.

         <title>Structure and Bonding in Amorphous Red Phosphorus
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous red phosphorus (a&#8208;P) can be described on the atomic scale by combining emerging machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based and dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT approaches. The a&#8208;P models reported here complete the first&#8208;principles stability range of the phosphorus allotropes, and they allow for new insight into chemical bonding and electronic states.







Abstract
Amorphous red phosphorus (a&#8208;P) is one of the remaining puzzling cases in the structural chemistry of the elements. Here, we elucidate the structure, stability, and chemical bonding in a&#8208;P from first principles, combining machine&#8208;learning and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) methods. We show that a&#8208;P structures exist with a range of energies slightly higher than those of phosphorus nanorods, to which they are closely related, and that the stability of a&#8208;P is linked to the degree of structural relaxation and medium&#8208;range order. We thus complete the stability range of phosphorus allotropes [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 11629] by now including the previously poorly understood amorphous phase, and we quantify the covalent and van der Waals interactions in all main phases of phosphorus. We also study the electronic densities of states, including those of hydrogenated a&#8208;P. Beyond the present study, our structural models are expected to enable wider&#8208;ranging first&#8208;principles investigations&#8212;for example, of a&#8208;P&#8208;based battery materials.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Unactivated Alkenes via Enantio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Regioselective Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective catalysis using a chiral nickel complex has been developed via kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;substituted unconjugated carbonyl alkenes. This hydroamination protocol produces a wide range of syn&#8208;&#946;2,3&#8208;amino acid derivatives derivatives and &#945;&#8208;alkylated unconjugated carbonyl olefins with high enantiomeric purity.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution is a powerful strategy for the isolation of enantioenriched compounds from racemic mixtures, and the development of selective catalytic processes is an active area of research. Here, we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;substituted unconjugated carbonyl alkenes via the enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselective hydroamination. This protocol affords both chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted butenamides and syn&#8208;&#946;2,3&#8208;amino acid derivatives with high enantiomeric purity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and selectivity factor up to &gt;684. The key to the excellent kinetic resolution efficiency is the distinctive architecture of the chiral nickel complex, which enables successful resolution and enantioselective C&#8722;N bond construction. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the unique structure of the chiral ligand facilitates a rapid migratory insertion step with one enantiomer. This strategy provides a practical and versatile approach to prepare a wide range of chiral compounds.

         <title>Methylation of Unactivated Alkenes with Engineered Methyltransferases To Generate Non&#8208;natural Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terpenoids are applied in various ways, in flavors and fragrances as well as in pharmaceuticals and plant protection. Through diversification of the carbon scaffold, non&#8208;natural terpenoids can be generated and screened for improved properties. The identification and engineering of methyltransferases for late&#8208;stage C&#8208;methylation of unactivated alkenes with high selectivity provided access to methylated derivatives of readily available terpenoids.







Abstract
Terpenoids are built from isoprene building blocks and have numerous biological functions. Selective late&#8208;stage modification of their carbon scaffold has the potential to optimize or transform their biological activities. However, the synthesis of terpenoids with a non&#8208;natural carbon scaffold is often a challenging endeavor because of the complexity of these molecules. Herein we report the identification and engineering of (S)&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent sterol methyltransferases for selective C&#8208;methylation of linear terpenoids. The engineered enzyme catalyzes selective methylation of unactivated alkenes in mono&#8208;, sesqui&#8208; and diterpenoids to produce C11, C16 and C21 derivatives. Preparative conversion and product isolation reveals that this biocatalyst performs C&#8722;C bond formation with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The alkene methylation most likely proceeds via a carbocation intermediate and regioselective deprotonation. This method opens new avenues for modifying the carbon scaffold of alkenes in general and terpenoids in particular.

Selective late-stage modification of their carbon scaffold has the potential to optimize or transform their biological activities. However, the synthesis of terpenoids with a non-natural carbon scaffold is often a challenging endeavor because of the complexity of these molecules. Herein we report the identification and engineering of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-adenosyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-methionine-dependent sterol methyltransferases for selective &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-methylation of linear terpenoids. The engineered enzyme catalyzes selective methylation of unactivated alkenes in mono-, sesqui- and diterpenoids to produce &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; derivatives. Preparative conversion and product isolation reveals that this biocatalyst performs &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; bond formation with high chemo- and regioselectivity. The alkene methylation most likely proceeds via a carbocation intermediate and regioselective deprotonation. This method opens new avenues for modifying the carbon scaffold of alkenes in general and terpenoids in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Simple Approach to Solution&#8208;Processible Small&#8208;Molecule Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters for High&#8208;Performance Narrowband OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple approach for solution&#8208;processible small&#8208;molecule multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is developed, and the resulting narrowband emissive organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) exhibit state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 27.1&#8201;% and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 31&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Most multi&#8208;resonance (MR) induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters generally exhibit strong aggregation and relatively worse solubility due to their rigid and planar molecule structures, which is highly undesirable for solution&#8208;processible devices. Herein, a simple but feasible approach for solution&#8208;processible small&#8208;molecule MR&#8208;TADF emitters is developed by incorporating two MR&#8208;TADF units onto carbazole bridge bearing long alkyl chains. The obtained emitters demonstrate supreme film&#8208;forming capability and narrowband emissions with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 22&#8197;nm. The resulting solution&#8208;processed narrowband electroluminescent devices achieve maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.1&#8201;%, which represents the highest efficiency among the solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters. This simple approach reveals great potential of developing solution&#8208;processible emitters for rigid and planar molecular structures.

         <title>Decoding the Fucose Migration Product during Mass&#8208;Spectrometric analysis of Blood Group Epitopes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass&#8208;spectrometric techniques frequently show fucose&#8208;containing chimeric fragments that obfuscate the analysis of glycans. Here, ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, radical&#8208;directed dissociation mass spectrometry, cryogenic IR spectroscopy of ions, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations are used to deduce the product of the internal glycan rearrangement of two model trisaccharides.







Abstract
Fucose is a signaling carbohydrate that is attached at the end of glycan processing. It is involved in a range of processes, such as the selectin&#8208;dependent leukocyte adhesion or pathogen&#8208;receptor interactions. Mass&#8208;spectrometric techniques, which are commonly used to determine the structure of glycans, frequently show fucose&#8208;containing chimeric fragments that obfuscate the analysis. The rearrangement leading to these fragments&#8212;often referred to as fucose migration&#8212;has been known for more than 25&#8197;years, but the chemical identity of the rearrangement product remains unclear. In this work, we combine ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, radical&#8208;directed dissociation mass spectrometry, cryogenic IR spectroscopy of ions, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations to deduce the product of the rearrangement in the model trisaccharides Lewis x and blood group H2. The structural search yields the fucose moiety attached to the galactose with an &#945;(1&#8594;6) glycosidic bond as the most likely product.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small&#8208;Bandgap Conjugated Polymers Based on an N&#8722;B&#8592;N Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homopolymer based on resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit exhibits ultra&#8208;small band gap of 0.82&#8197;eV and excellent stability. The selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property with high transparency in visible region makes the polymer suitable for transparent thermal&#8208;shielding coating layer on glass.







Abstract
Since the breakthrough of conductive polymers in 1977, scientists have made great efforts to create small band gap (Eg) conjugated polymers. Two general strategies to design small Eg conjugated polymers are quinoid structure and donor&#8208;acceptor structure. Ultrasmall Eg conjugated polymers (Eg&lt;1.0&#8197;eV) always suffer from poor air stability because of high&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels. In this work, we report a new strategy to design ultrasmall Eg conjugated polymers by N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). The resulting polymer exhibits an Eg of 0.82&#8197;eV and an onset absorption wavelength of &gt;1500&#8197;nm. Moreover, the polymer exhibits excellent air stability because of its low&#8208;lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels. An unprecedented property of this polymer is the selective light absorption in the infrared range (800&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) and high transparency in the visible range (400&#8211;780&#8197;nm). Using this property, for the first time, we demonstrate the application of conjugated polymers as transparent thermal&#8208;shielding coating layer on glass, which reduces indoor solar irradiation through window and consequently reduces power consumption for cooling of buildings and cars in summer.

         <title>Bifunctional Interphase with Target&#8208;Distributed Desolvation Sites and Directionally Depositional Ion Flux for Sustainable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF&#8208;based interphase with target&#8208;distributed desolvation sites and ionic channels is strategically designed for restricting side reactions and zinc dendrites. This layer accurately regulates active water and induces Zn2+ oriented deposition, achieving highly reversible zinc anodes.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) feature high safety and low cost, but intricate anodic side reactions and dendrite growth severely restrict their commercialization. Herein, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) grafted metal organic framework (MOF&#8208;E) is proposed as a dually&#8208;functional anodic interphase for sustainable Zn anode. Specifically, the target&#8208;distributed EDTA serves as an ion&#8208;trapped tentacle to accelerate the desolvation and ionic transport by powerful chemical coordination, while the MOFs offer suitable ionic channels to induce oriented deposition. As a result, MOF&#8208;E interphase fundamentally suppresses side reactions and guides horizontally arranged Zn deposition with (002) preferred orientations. The Zn|MOF&#8208;E@Cu cell exhibits a markedly improved Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% over 2500 cycles, and the MOF&#8208;E@Zn|KVOH (KV12O30&#8208;y&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O) cell yields a steady circulation of 5000 cycles@90.47&#8201;% at 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Charge Separation in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enables Heterogeneous Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon photoactivation, the fast and efficient charge separation along metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) scaffold facilitates the formation of the thiyl radical, a powerful hydrogen atom transfer catalyst. The corresponding MOF competently catalyzed the borylation, silylation, phosphorylation, and thiolation of organic molecules. This research highlights the versatility and practical application potential of MOF&#8208;based heterogeneous thiyl&#8208;radical catalysis.







Abstract
Photoinduced metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) enabled heterogeneous thiol catalysis has been achieved for the first time. MOF Zr&#8208;TPDCS&#8208;1, consisting of Zr6&#8208;clusters and TPDCS linkers (TPDCS=3,3&#8242;&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetramercapto[1,1&#8242;:4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate), effectively catalyzed the borylation, silylation, phosphorylation, and thiolation of organic molecules. Upon irradiation, the fast electron transfer from TPDCS to Zr6&#8208;cluster is believed to facilitate the formation of the thiyl radical, a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, which competently abstracts the hydrogen from borane, silane, phosphine, or thiol for generating the corresponding element radical to engender the chemical transformations. The elaborate control experiments evidenced the generation of thiyl radicals in MOF and illustrated a radical reaction pathway. The gram&#8208;scale reaction worked well, and the product was conveniently separated via centrifugation and vacuum with a turnover number (TON) of &#8776;3880, highlighting the practical application potential of heterogeneous thiyl&#8208;radical catalysis.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed and biomimetic cyclization of 1&#8208;aryl terpenols as a platform strategy for the synthesis of &#916;9&#8208;cis&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinoids is described. This synthesis features the most direct synthetic access to this product class and requires only 3 steps from readily available precursors with exceptionally low catalyst loadings of as low as 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% (MOM=methoxymethyl, IDPi=imidodiphosphorimidates).







Abstract
We report herein the catalytic asymmetric cyclization of 1&#8208;aryl terpenols to afford enantiomerically highly enriched &#916;9&#8208;cis&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinoid scaffolds in a single step. As powerful chiral catalysts strongly acidic imidodiphosphorimidates (IDPis) have been identified which furnish the products with good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. Upon MOM&#8208;deprotection some naturally occurring cannabimimetica such as (&#8722;)&#8208;cis&#8208;&#916;9&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinol and (&#8722;)&#8208;perrottetinene as well as some unnatural analogues were made accessible along a merely 3&#8208;step biomimetic sequence (MOM=methoxymethyl).

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Mediated &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Enhances the Photodynamic Properties of a NIR&#8208;II Emitting Photosensitizer with Extended Conjugation</title>

         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting photosensitizers show promising applications in imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the PDT efficiency of such photosensitizers with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths still needs improvement. In this work, we demonstrate that the chlorination&#8208;mediated &#960;&#8211;&#960; organizing strategy can facilitate energy/charge transfer, subsequently improving the PDT performance of NIR&#8208;II emitting photosensitizers.







Abstract
NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting photosensitizers (PSs) have attracted great research interest due to their promising clinical applications in imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, it is still challenging to realize highly efficient PDT on NIR&#8208;II PSs. In this work, we develop a chlorination&#8208;mediated &#960;&#8211;&#960; organizing strategy to improve the PDT of a PS with conjugation&#8208;extended A&#8208;D&#8208;A architecture. The significant dipole moment of the carbon&#8208;chlorine bond and the strong intermolecular interactions of chlorine atoms bring on compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the chlorine&#8208;substituted PS, which facilitates energy/charge transfer and promotes the photochemical reactions of PDT. Consequently, the resultant NIR&#8208;II emitting PS exhibits a leading PDT performance with a yield of reactive oxygen species higher than that of previously reported long&#8208;wavelength PSs. These findings will enlighten the future design of NIR&#8208;II emitting PSs with enhanced PDT efficiency.

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Detection of Trace Benzene Vapor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) exhibits significant and sensitive fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; behavior for benzene vapor by virtue of unique &#8220;bilateral &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8221; interactions, enabling visual detection of a trace level of benzene for the first time.







Abstract
Indoor detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) concentration is necessary due to the serious toxicity hazards even at trace level. However, physisorbents usually exhibit weak interactions especially in the presence of trace concentrations of VOCs, thus exhibiting poor responsive signal. Herein, we report a new flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that exhibits interesting pore&#8208;opening behavior after immersing in H2O. The pore&#8208;opening phase shows significant (&#8776;116 folds) and extremely fast (&lt;1&#8197;minute) fluorescence enhancement after being exposed to saturated benzene vapor. The limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor can be calculated as 0.133&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1. Thus this material represents the first MOF to achieve visual detection of trace benzene vapor by the naked eyes. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure reveal that the special &#8220;bilateral &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8221; interactions between the host and guest, which facilitate electron transfer and greatly enhance the intensity of fluorescence.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Essential Amino Acids from Nitric Oxide Using Atomically Dispersed Fe on N&#8208;doped Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creative strategy is established to convert NOx from exhaust gas and nitrate&#8208;laden wastewater into amino acids by electrochemistry with atomically dispersed Fe supported on N&#8208;doped carbon. It is significantly important for NOx removal and efficient activated hydrogen utilization from water splitting directly to synthesize high&#8208;valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compounds, promoting the development of energy and environment.







Abstract
How to transfer industrial exhaust gases of nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;values product is significantly important and challenging. Herein, we demonstrate an innovative method for artificial synthesis of essential &#945;&#8208;amino acids from nitric oxide (NO) by reacting with &#945;&#8208;keto acids through electrocatalytic process with atomically dispersed Fe supported on N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (AD&#8208;Fe/NC) as the catalyst. A yield of valine with 32.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 is delivered at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, corresponding a selectivity of 11.3&#8201;%. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and synchrotron radiation infrared spectroscopy analyses show that NO as nitrogen source converted to hydroxylamine that promptly nucleophilic attacked on the electrophilic carbon center of &#945;&#8208;keto acid to form oxime and subsequent reductive hydrogenation occurred on the way to amino acid. Over 6 kinds of &#945;&#8208;amino acids have been successfully synthesized and gaseous nitrogen source can be also replaced by liquid nitrogen source (NO3&#8722;). Our findings not only provide a creative method for converting nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;valued products, which is of epoch&#8208;making significance towards artificial synthesis of amino acids, but also benefit in deploying near&#8208;zero&#8208;emission technologies for global environmental and economic development.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Kinetic Boron Conjugate Addition of &#947;&#8208;Substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>

A Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric kinetic boron conjugate addition of &#947;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams followed by oxidation is reported with good results. This strategy provides an efficient access to valuable enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing simple &#947;&#8208;alkyl or aryl substituents, which showed inhibitory activities against cisplatin&#8208;sensitive ovarian cancer cells A2780. A new Lewis acid Cu&#8208;catalyzed mechanism was put forward.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing simple &#947;&#8208; substituents are found in biologically active molecules and natural products, however, their synthesis still remains difficult. Herein, we report an efficient kinetic resolution (KR) of &#947;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams via a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric boron conjugate addition, which also leads to the efficient synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;stereogenic carbon centers. The KR proceeded smoothly with a wide range of &#947;&#8208;alkyl or aryl substituted substrates including those bearing aromatic heterocycles and different N&#8208;protected substrates in up to 347 of s value. Their highly versatile transformations, synthetic utility in biologically active molecules, and inhibitory activities against cisplatin&#8208;sensitive ovarian cancer cell A2780 have also been demonstrated. Differing from the well&#8208;known mechanism involving Cu&#8722;B species in Cu&#8208;catalyzed boron conjugate additions, our mechanistic studies using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments indicate that a Lewis acid CuI&#8208;catalyzed mechanism is the likely pathway in the catalytic reaction.

         <title>Ordered Mesoporous Intermetallic Ga&#8208;Pt Nanoparticles: Phase&#8208;Controlled Synthesis and Performance in Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered mesoporous intermetallic Ga&#8208;Pt nanoparticles, including Ga3Pt5 with an orthorhombic phase and Ga1Pt1 with a non&#8208;symmorphic chiral cubic phase, were successfully synthesized by a concurrent template method in presence of different Ga sources. The resulted mesoporous intermetallic Ga&#8208;Pt disclosed remarkably phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance in oxygen reduction electrocatalysis, with unexpected high activity of Ga1Pt1 compared to the Ga3Pt5 counterpart.







Abstract
The intermetallic phase control is a promising strategy to optimize the physicochemical properties of ordered intermetallic compounds and engineer their performance in various (electro)catalytic reactions. However, the intermetallic phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance is still rarely reported because of the difficulty in synthesizing ordered intermetallics with precisely controlled phase structures at atomic level, especially having ordered mesoscopic structure/morphology. Here, we successfully reported a precise synthesis of two phase&#8208;pure mesoporous intermetallic gallium&#8208;platinum (meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt) nanoparticles, including meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga3Pt5 with an orthorhombic space group and meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga1Pt1 with a non&#8208;symmorphic chiral cubic space group. The intermetallic phase control of ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt nanoparticles was realized by carefully tuning the induced Ga salts with different anions that optimized the free energies during the synthesis. The intermetallic phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance of ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt was systematically evaluated for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis, with completely opposite catalytic performance in alkaline media. Interestingly, ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga1Pt1 catalyst with chiral atomic arrangements disclosed unexpected high ORR activity and stability with 5.9 and 3.2 enhancement factors in mass activity compared to those of meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga3Pt5 and commercial Pt/C.

         <title>Sculpting In&#8208;plane Fractal Porous Patterns in Two&#8208;Dimensional MOF Nanocrystals for Photoelectrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;controlled crystal lattice&#8208;guided anisotropic etching of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOF surfaces gives perforated hierarchical pore patterns that allow high&#8208;loading of molecular catalysts exposed at the pore&#8208;edges for efficient and stable photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Herein, by choosing few&#8208;nm&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals of MOF&#8208;5 containing in&#8208;planner square lattices as a modular platform, a crystal lattice&#8208;guided wet&#8208;chemical etching has been rationally accomplished. As a result, two attractive pore patterns carrying Euclidean curvatures; precisely, plus(+)&#8208;shaped and fractal&#8208;patterned pores via &#10216;100&#10217; and &#10216;110&#10217; directional etching, respectively, are regulated in contrast to habitually formed spherical&#8208;shaped random etches on MOF surface. In agreement with the theoretical calculations, a diffusion&#8208;limited etching process has been optimized to devise high&#8208;yield of size&#8208;tunable fractal&#8208;pores on the MOF surface that tenders for a compatibly high payload of catalytic ReI&#8208;complexes using the existing large edge area once modified into a free amine&#8208;group&#8208;exposed inner pore surface. Finally, on benefiting from the long&#8208;range fractal opening in 2D MOF support structure, while loaded on an electrode surface, a facilitated cross&#8208;interface charge&#8208;transportation and well&#8208;exposure of immobilized ReI&#8208;catalysts are anticipated, thus realizing enhanced activity and stability of the supported catalyst in photoelectrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction.

         <title>Modulation of Colloidal Assembly Behavior Enables Printable Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In combination with in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, the assembly behavior of organic cations involved in perovskite frameworks is visualized by investigating the precursor species. The feasibility of modulating the quantum wells structure for the fabrication of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite photovoltaics is further verified.







Abstract
The multiple quantum wells (QWs) distribution in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films hinders charge transport due to the fundamental difficulty of controlling crystal growth from precursor solutions, yielding poorly homogeneous low&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially in upscaling fabrication. Here, efficient low&#8208;dimensional PSCs are realized by modulating the colloidal assembly behavior in the precursor solution to induce intermediate structures. In combination with in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, the assembly behavior of organic cations involved lead iodide&#8208;dominated colloidal soft framework is visualized by investigating the precursor species differences under hydrogen bonding interactions. Subsequently, solid&#8208;state reactions emerge and the formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite films exhibit significantly suppressed multiple QWs distribution. Encouragingly, the FA device (n=9, by meniscus&#8208;assisted coating) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.28&#8201;% for a size of 0.04&#8197;cm2 and a PCE of 15.35&#8201;% for a mini&#8208;module of 16.94&#8197;cm2 with superior stability.

         <title>Covalent Scrambling in Porous Polyarylthioethers through a Stepwise SNAr for Tunable Bandgap and Porosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conventional polycondensation reaction can provide the simplest route to generating porous poly(aryl thioether)s. Controlling the temperature orients the reaction toward the regioselective multi&#8208;substitution of aryl fluorides, demonstrating a stepwise change in the porosity and optical band gap of the poly(aryl thioether)s.







Abstract
Porous poly(aryl thioether)s offer stability and electronic tunability by robust sulfur&#8208;aryl conjugated architecture, but synthetic access is hindered due to limited control over the nucleophilic nature of sulfides and the air sensitivity of aromatic thiols.

     alt="Covalent Scrambling in Porous Polyarylthioethers through a Stepwise SNAr for Tunable Bandgap and Porosity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conventional polycondensation reaction can provide the simplest route to generating porous poly(aryl thioether)s. Controlling the temperature orients the reaction toward the regioselective multi-substitution of aryl fluorides, demonstrating a stepwise change in the porosity and optical band gap of the poly(aryl thioether)s.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous poly(aryl thioether)s offer stability and electronic tunability by robust sulfur-aryl conjugated architecture, but synthetic access is hindered due to limited control over the nucleophilic nature of sulfides and the air sensitivity of aromatic thiols. Here, we report a simple, one-pot, inexpensive, regioselective synthesis of highly porous poly(aryl thioether)s through polycondensation of perfluoroaromatic compounds with sodium sulfide. The unprecedented temperature-dependent para-directing formation of thioether linkages leads to a stepwise transition of the polymer extension into a network, thereby allowing fine control of the porosity and optical band gaps. The obtained porous organic polymers with ultra-microporosity (&amp;lt;1&#8197;nm) and sulfur as the surface functional groups show size-dependent separation of organic micropollutants and selective removal of mercury ions from water. Our findings offer easy access to poly(aryl thioether)s with accessible sulfur functionalities and higher complexity, which will help in realizing advanced synthetic designs in applications such as adsorption, (photo)catalysis, and (opto)electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Geometric Isomerisation of Bifunctional Vinyl Fluoride Linchpins: Stereodivergence in Amide and Polyene Bioisostere Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide groups are pervasive across the chemical space continuum, where their structural and pharmacological importance, juxtaposed with the hydrolytic vulnerabilities, continues to fuel bioisostere development. Vinyl fluorides have a venerable history as effective mimics (&#936;[CF=CH]) owing to the planarity of the motif and intrinsic polarity of the C(sp2)&#8208;F bond. However, emulating the s&#8208;cis to the s&#8208;trans isomerisation of a peptide bond with fluoro&#8208;alkene surrogates remains challenging, and current synthetic solutions only enable access to a single configuration. Through the design of an ambiphilic linchpin based on a fluorinated &#946;&#8208;borylacrylate, it has been possible to leverage energy transfer catalysis to affect this unprecedented isomerisation process: this provides geometrically&#8208;programmable building blocks that can be functionalized at either terminus. Irradiation at &#955;max = 402 nm with inexpensive thioxanthone as a photocatalyst enables rapid, effective isomerisation of tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted species (up to E/Z 98:2 in 1 h), providing a stereodivergent platform for small molecule amide and polyene isostere discovery. Application of the methodology in target synthesis and initial laser spectroscopic studies are disclosed together with crystallographic analyses of representative products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluid Multivalent Magnetic Interface for High&#8208;Performance Isolation and Proteomic Profiling of Tumor&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluid multivalent magnetic interface was engineered in a microfluidic chip to improve the kinetics and thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition for efficient isolation of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (T&#8208;EVs). With the assistance of magnetic and flow fields, this interface balanced affinity, selectivity, reversibility, and extendibility, enabling high&#8208;throughput recovery of T&#8208;EVs for protein profiling.







Abstract
Isolation and analysis of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (T&#8208;EVs) are important for clinical cancer management. Here, we develop a fluid multivalent magnetic interface (FluidmagFace) in a microfluidic chip for high&#8208;performance isolation, release, and protein profiling of T&#8208;EVs. The FluidmagFace increases affinity by 105&#8208;fold with fluidity&#8208;enhanced multivalent binding to improve isolation efficiency by 13.9&#8201;% compared with a non&#8208;fluid interface. Its anti&#8208;adsorption property and microfluidic hydrodynamic shear minimize contamination, increasing detection sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its reversibility and expandability allow high&#8208;throughput recovery of T&#8208;EVs for mass spectrometric protein analysis. With the chip, T&#8208;EVs were detected in all tested cancer samples with identification of differentially expressed proteins compared with healthy controls. The FluidmagFace opens a new avenue to isolation and release of targets for cancer diagnosis and biomarker discovery.

         <title>Monitoring the Reversibility of GPCR Signaling by Combining Photochromic Ligands with Label&#8208;free Impedance Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>

Combining photochromic agonists of GPCR receptors with label&#8208;free impedance analysis of cells expressing this receptor allows monitoring and controlling dynamics and reversibility of intracellular signaling cascades in real time.







Abstract
G protein&#8208;coupled cell surface receptors (GPCR) trigger complex intracellular signaling cascades upon agonist binding. Classic pharmacological assays provide information about binding affinities, activation or blockade at different stages of the signaling cascade, but real time dynamics and reversibility of these processes remain often disguised. We show that combining photochromic NPY receptor ligands, which can be toggled in their receptor activation ability by irradiation with light of different wavelengths, with whole cell label&#8208;free impedance assays allows observing the cell response to receptor activation and its reversibility over time. The concept demonstrated on NPY receptors may be well applicable to many other GPCRs providing a deeper insight into the time course of intracellular signaling processes.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Introduction of Bioorthogonal Handles to Nanopores by Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the genetic code expansion strategy, an azido amino acid was site&#8208;specifically incorporated into a biological nanopore and served as a &#8220;chemical clasp&#8221;, enabling bioorthogonal conjugation of DNA or proteins to generate nanopore sensors with novel sensing capacities. The lysozyme&#8208;conjugated pore was further demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the discrimination of different oligosaccharides.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific functionalization of natural amino acid&#8208;containing biological nanopores is pivotal in single molecule sensing. However, pore engineering methodologies are restricted to a limited choice and introduction of unnatural chemical components is extremely difficult. Herein we report the genetic code expansion (GCE) strategy to introduce unnatural amino acid (UAA) to an octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. GCE allows for rapid and efficient introduction of bioorthogonal reactive site (i.e., azide) to the pore rim, and conjugation of single stranded DNA or lysozyme was demonstrated. The lysozyme&#8208;conjugated pore was further used for the discrimination of different oligosaccharides, demonstrating a sensing capacity that a bare MspA nanopore does not possess. GCE with bioorthogonal handles, which has never been previously applied in the preparation of nanopores, is a versatile strategy for pore engineering and may further expand the application scenarios of nanopores.

         <title>Tailoring Active Cu2O/Copper Interface Sites for N&#8208;Formylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines with CO2/H2</title>

N&#8208;formylation of aliphatic primary amines with CO2/H2 to formamide is achieved with a heterogeneous non&#8208;noble metal Cu&#8208;based catalyst containing Cu2O/Cu interface sites.







Abstract
Heterogeneously catalyzed N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamide with CO2/H2 is highly attractive for the valorization of CO2. However, the relationship of the catalytic performance with the catalyst structure is still elusive. Herein, mixed valence catalysts containing Cu2O/Cu interface sites were constructed for this transformation. Both aliphatic primary and secondary amines with diverse structures were efficiently converted into the desired formamides with good to excellent yields. Combined ex and in situ catalyst characterization revealed that the presence of Cu2O/Cu interface sites was vital for the excellent catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that better catalytic activity of Cu2O/Cu(111) than Cu(111) is attributed to the assistance of oxygen at the Cu2O/Cu interface (Ointer) in formation of Ointer&#8208;H moieties, which not only reduce the apparent barrier of HCOOH formation but also benefit the desorption of the desired N&#8208;formylated amine, leading to high activity and selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneously catalyzed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-formylation of amines to formamide with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is highly attractive for the valorization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the relationship of the catalytic performance with the catalyst structure is still elusive. Herein, mixed valence catalysts containing Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu interface sites were constructed for this transformation. Both aliphatic primary and secondary amines with diverse structures were efficiently converted into the desired formamides with good to excellent yields. Combined ex and in situ catalyst characterization revealed that the presence of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu interface sites was vital for the excellent catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that better catalytic activity of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu(111) than Cu(111) is attributed to the assistance of oxygen at the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu interface (O&lt;sub&gt;inter&lt;/sub&gt;) in formation of O&lt;sub&gt;inter&lt;/sub&gt;-H moieties, which not only reduce the apparent barrier of HCOOH formation but also benefit the desorption of the desired &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-formylated amine, leading to high activity and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Immobilization of Nickel Ions on Covalent Organic Frameworks for Panchromatic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking a stacked layered structure of a two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) is achieved by solvothermal conditions to enable stable coordination with Ni(II) ions via the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine moiety. This COF&#8208;Ni(II) complex exhibits an improved light absorption ability and boosts photocatalytic H2 generation (51,300 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1) in a total visible spectrum, even under 700&#8208;nm irradiation.







Abstract
Post&#8208;coordination design on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is an efficient strategy for elevating the photocatalytic activity of organic moiety. However, the rigid skeletons and densely layered stacking of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs cannot be flexibly adapted for specific conformations of metal complexes, thereby impairing the metal&#8208;COF cooperation. Here, we adopt a solvothermal method to immobilize nickel(II) ions into a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;containing 2D COF, forming a stable coordination motif. Such the complex remarkably enhances the photocatalytic performance, giving an optimized H2 evolution rate of as high as 51&#8201;300&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, 2.5&#8197;times higher than the pristine COF. The evolved hydrogen gas can also be detected upon 700&#8208;nm light irradiation, while its analog synthesized by the traditional coordination method is photo&#8208;catalytically inert. This work provides a strategy for optimizing the metal&#8208;COF coordination system and strengthening a synergy for electronic regulation in photocatalysis.

         <title>Electrochemical&#8208;Mediated Regenerable FeII Active Sites for Efficient Uranium Extraction at Ultra&#8208;Low Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work coupled electrochemical mediated FeII/FeIII redox with uranium extraction and realized high efficiency uranium extraction under ultra&#8208;low cell voltage (&#8722;0.1&#8197;V) in seawater with 20&#8197;ppm UO2(NO3)2. The findings also provide inspiration for other metal resource recovery applications.







Abstract
Nano&#8208;reduced iron (NRI) is a promising uranium adsorbent due to its strong reducibility and good selectivity, but it still faces the challenges of slow kinetics, limited and non&#8208;renewable active sites. In this work, we realized high efficiency uranium extraction under ultra&#8208;low cell voltage (&#8722;0.1&#8197;V) in seawater with 20&#8197;ppm UO2(NO3)2 solution by coupling electrochemical mediated FeII/FeIII redox and uranium extraction. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency of NRI after electrochemical uranium extraction (EUE) could reach 452&#8197;mg/g and 99.1&#8201;%, respectively. Combined with quasi&#8208;operando/operando characterization technologies, we clarified the mechanism of EUE and revealed that continuously regenerating FeII active sites by electroreduction could significantly enhance the property of EUE. This work here provides a new electrochemical mediated and low energy consumption uranium extraction strategy which also provides a reference for other metal resource recovery.

         <title>Mechanochemical Approach for Air&#8208;Tolerant and Extremely Fast Lithium&#8208;Based Birch Reductions in Minutes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical Birch reduction is reported for the first time. The newly developed ball&#8208;milling method does not require an inert atmosphere or other special precautions. Notably, the reaction reached completion within one minute for most of the investigated substrates. The present study thus provides a novel, operationally simple, rapid, and scalable alternative to conventional solution&#8208;based Birch reduction.







Abstract
Birch reduction has been widely used in organic synthesis for over half a century as a powerful method to dearomatize arenes into 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives. However, the conventional Birch reduction reaction using liquid ammonia requires laborious procedures to ensure inert conditions and low temperatures. Although several ammonia&#8208;free modifications have been reported, the development of an operationally simple, efficient, and scalable protocol remains a challenge. Herein, we report an ammonia&#8208;free lithium&#8208;based Birch reduction in air without special operating conditions using a ball&#8208;milling technique. This method is characterized by its operational simplicity and an extremely short reaction time (within 1&#8197;min), probably owing to the in situ mechanical activation of lithium metal, broad substrate scope, and no requirement for dry bulk solvents. The potential of our flash Birch reaction is also demonstrated by the efficient reduction of bioactive target molecules and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Origin of Surface Reconstruction in Lattice Oxygen Oxidation Mechanism Based&#8208;Transition Metal Oxides: A Spontaneous Chemical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface reconstruction of Lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)&#8208;based metal oxides in alkaline medium was unveiled to be triggered by a spontaneous chemical reaction, instead of an electrochemical reaction. During the chemical process, the activated lattice oxygen atoms were attacked by adsorbed water molecules firstly, leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;). Then, the metal&#8208;site soluble atoms leached from the oxygen&#8208;deficient surface.







Abstract
A fundamental understanding of surface reconstruction process is pivotal to developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based electrocatalysts. Traditionally, the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is believed as an irreversible oxygen redox behavior, due to the much slower rate of OH&#8722; refilling than that of oxygen vacancy formation. Here, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is a spontaneous chemical reaction process, instead of an electrochemical reaction process. During the chemical process, the lattice oxygen atoms were attacked by adsorbed water molecules, leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;). Subsequently, the metal&#8208;site soluble atoms leached from the oxygen&#8208;deficient surface. This work also suggests that the enhancement of surface hydrophilicity could accelerate the surface reconstruction process. Hence, such a finding could add a new layer for the understanding of surface reconstruction mechanism.

         <dc:description>
Enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N indole&#8208;pyrrole and bisindole atropisomers was achieved by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed TDG&#8208;enabled C&#8722;H functionalization. A wide variety of the N&#8722;N atropisomers were produced in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities by C&#8722;H alkenylation, alkynylation, allylation or arylation reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric construction of N&#8722;N atropisomeric biaryls remains a formidable challenge. Studies of them lag far behind studies of the more classical carbon&#8208;carbon biaryl atropisomers, hampering meaningful development. Herein, the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation of pyrroles for the synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were produced with good yields and high enantioselectivities by alkenylation, alkynylation, allylation, or arylation reactions. Furthermore, the kinetic resolution of trisubstituted N&#8722;N heterobiaryls with more sterically demanding substituents was also achieved. Importantly, this versatile C&#8722;H functionalization strategy enables iterative functionalization of pyrroles with exquisite selectivity, expediting the formation of valuable, complex, N&#8722;N atropisomers.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Azulene&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Knoevenagel&#8208;Type Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and modular method has been developed for the construction of novel azulene&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with good structure versatility. The chemical structures, aromaticity, and photophysical properties of the synthesized non&#8208;alternant PAHs are fully investigated. This strategy provides straightforward access and rapid construction of unexplored non&#8208;alternant PAHs, and possibly graphene nanoribbons with multiple azulene units.







Abstract
The research interest in azulene&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has significantly increased recently, but the lack of efficient synthetic strategies impedes the investigation of their structure&#8208;property relationships and further opto&#8208;electronic applications. Here we report a modular synthetic strategy towards diverse azulene&#8208;embedded PAHs by a tandem Suzuki coupling and base&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel&#8208;type condensation with good yields and great structural versatility, including non&#8208;alternant thiophene&#8208;rich PAHs, butterfly&#8208; or Z&#8208;shaped PAHs bearing two azulene units, and the first example of a two&#8208;azulene&#8208;embedded double [5]helicene. The structural topology, aromaticity and photophysical properties were investigated by NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy assisted by DFT calculations. This strategy provides a new platform for rapidly synthesizing unexplored non&#8208;alternant PAHs or even graphene nanoribbons with multiple azulene units.

         <title>Giving Gold Wings: Ultrabright and Fragmentation Free Mass Spectrometry Reporters for Barcoding, Bioconjugation Monitoring, and Data Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are highly tunable and bright mass spectrometry reporters. NHC ligands fragment less and achieve higher ion yield than conventional thiol systems, which enables bioconjugation monitoring, mass spectrometry imaging, and data storage applications.







Abstract
The widespread application of laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS) highlights the need for a bright and multiplexable labeling platform. While ligand&#8208;capped Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as a promising LDI&#8208;MS contrast agent, the predominant thiol ligands suffer from low ion yields and extensive fragmentation. In this work, we develop a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand platform that enhances AuNP LDI&#8208;MS performance. NHC scaffolds are tuned to generate barcoded AuNPs which, when benchmarked against thiol&#8208;AuNPs, are bright mass tags and form unfragmented ions in high yield. To illustrate the transformative potential of NHC ligands, the mass tags were employed in three orthogonal applications: monitoring a bioconjugation reaction, performing multiplexed imaging, and storing and reading encoded information. These results demonstrate that NHC&#8208;nanoparticle systems are an ideal platform for LDI&#8208;MS and greatly broaden the scope of nanoparticle contrast agents.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Phase Regulation to Restrain Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination for Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite LEDs with EQE Exceeding 15&#8201;%</title>

The high&#8208;performing sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with peak external quantum efficiency exceeding 15&#8201;% are attained by the use of a synergetic modulation strategy, regarding defect passivation and phase distribution regulation, via the incorporation of a bifunctional molecular additive.







Abstract
Achieving efficient blue electroluminescence (EL) remains the fundamental challenge that impedes perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) towards commercial applications. The bottleneck accounting for the inefficient blue PeLEDs is broadly attributed to the poor&#8208;emissive blue perovskite emitters based on either mixed halide engineering or reduced&#8208;dimensional strategy. Herein, we report the high&#8208;performing sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs (490&#8197;nm) with the maximum EQE exceeding 15&#8201;% by incorporating a molecular modifier, namely 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Difluorophenone, for significantly suppressing the non&#8208;radiative recombination and tuning of the low&#8208;dimensional phase distribution of quasi&#8208;2D blue perovskites, which represents a remarkable paradigm for developing the new generation of blue lighting sources.

         <title>Achieving High Single&#8208;Pass Carbon Conversion Efficiencies in Durable CO2 Electroreduction in Strong Acids via Electrode Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrode&#8208;structure&#8208;engineering strategy is developed to achieve efficient, selective, and stable CO2 reduction (CO2R) with high CO2 utilization. This strategy creates a near&#8208;neutral pH and enriches K+ near catalyst surfaces during CO2R in strong acids. A stratified SiC&#8208;NafionTM/SnBi/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) electrode consistently produces formic acid with a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of &gt;75&#8201;% and Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, lasting over 125&#8197;h at pH&#8197;1.







Abstract
Acidic CO2 reduction (CO2R) holds promise for the synthesis of low&#8208;carbon&#8208;footprint chemicals using renewable electricity. However, the corrosion of catalysts in strong acids causes severe hydrogen evolution and rapid deterioration of CO2R performance. Here, by coating catalysts with an electrically nonconductive nanoporous SiC&#8208;NafionTM layer, a near&#8208;neutral pH was stabilized on catalyst surfaces, thereby protecting the catalysts against corrosion for durable CO2R in strong acids. Electrode microstructures played a critical role in regulating ion diffusion and stabilizing electrohydrodynamic flows near catalyst surfaces. This surface&#8208;coating strategy was applied to three catalysts, SnBi, Ag, and Cu, and they exhibited high activity over extended CO2R operation in strong acids. Using a stratified SiC&#8208;NafionTM/SnBi/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) electrode, constant production of formic acid was achieved with a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of &gt;75&#8201;% and Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 125&#8197;h at pH&#8197;1.

Using a stratified SiC-Nafion&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;/SnBi/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) electrode, constant production of formic acid was achieved with a single-pass carbon efficiency of &amp;gt;75&#8201;% and Faradaic efficiency of &amp;gt;90&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 125&#8197;h at pH&#8197;1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Supported Copper Photoredox Catalysts for Iminyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binap&#8208;ligated copper dimer has been heterogenized on a pillar&#8208;layered MOF surface for the first time using a hydroxamic acid linker. This MOF&#8208;supported dimeric copper photocatalyst demonstrates much higher activity and recyclability than its homogeneous counterparts in intra&#8208; and intermolecular radical reactions of N&#8208;acyloxy imidates and O&#8208;acyl oximes.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light copper photocatalysis has recently emerged as a viable technology for building sustainable synthetic processes. To broaden the applications of phosphine&#8208;ligated copper(I) complexes, we describe herein an effective metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported copper(I) photocatalyst for multiple iminyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions. Due to site isolation, the heterogenized copper photosensitizer has a significantly higher catalytic activity than its homogeneous counterpart. Using a hydroxamic acid linker to immobilize copper species on MOF supports affords the heterogeneous catalysts with high recyclability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification sequence on MOF surfaces allows for the preparation of previously unavailable monomeric copper species. Our findings highlight the potential of using MOF&#8208;based heterogeneous catalytic systems to address fundamental challenges in the development of synthetic methodologies and mechanistic investigations of transition&#8208;metal photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Surfactant Directed Synthesis of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanostructures and Precise Tuning of their Optical Activity through Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile protocol is demonstrated for the synthesis of intrinsically chiral dog&#8208;bone shaped gold nanostructures that displayed optical activity in the visible and NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The controlled assembly of the nanostructures resulted in the enhancement and precise tuning of plasmonic chirality offering potential for application in the fields of enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and spintronics.







Abstract
Fabrication and transmission of plasmonic chirality is a rapidly developing area of research. While nanoscale chirality is reasonably well explored, research on intrinsically chiral nanostructures, that has ramifications to origin of homochirality, is still in its infancy. Herein, we report the synthesis of dog&#8208;bone shaped chiral gold nanostructures using a chiral cationic surfactant with excess ascorbic acid. Chiral growth is attributed to the specific binding and structure breaking ability of chiral surfactant and ascorbic acid. The controlled assembly of particles facilitated tuning and enhancement of chiral signals. Experimental observations were validated with theoretical simulations modelled in frequency domain with a surface integral&#8208;equation parameterization. Work highlighting the generation and tuning of plasmonic chirality provides new insights into the understanding of intrinsic chirality and paves way for their application in enantioselective catalysis and biosensing.

         <title>Contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis for Direct Synthesis of H2O2 under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to prepare H2O2 in a green, safe, simple and efficient way under ambient conditions. We proposed a facile approach for the direct production of H2O2, relying on contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis between Polytetrafluoroethylene particles and deionized water without any other traditional catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an indispensable basic reagent in various industries, such as textile bleach, chemical synthesis, and environmental protection. However, it is challenging to prepare H2O2 in a green, safe, simple and efficient way under ambient conditions. Here, we found that H2O2 could be synthesized using a catalytic pathway only by contact charging a two&#8208;phase interface at room temperature and normal pressure. Particularly, under the action of mechanical force, electron transfer occurs during physical contact between polytetrafluoroethylene particles and deionized water/O2 interfaces, inducing the generation of reactive free radicals (&#8901;OH and &#8901;O2&#8722; ), and the free radicals could react to form H2O2, yielding as high as 313&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. In addition, the new reaction device could show long&#8208;term stable H2O2 production. This work provides a novel method for the efficient preparation of H2O2, which may also stimulate further explorations on contact&#8208;electrification&#8208;induced chemistry process.

         <title>A Facile Strategy for the Development of Recyclable Multifunctional Liquid Crystal Polymers via Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification and Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new synthetic strategy to combine the post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) and the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) for designing multifunctional linear liquid crystal polymers (LLCPs). A photo&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsive LLCP is demonstrated to show the potential of this synthetic strategy to offer broader opportunities to structurally diversify LCPs.







Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) offers a versatile approach for engineering multifunctional polymers, but this advantage has not been fully exploited to fabricate multifunctional liquid crystal polymers (LCPs). Here, we design a facile synthetic approach towards multifunctional LCP by combining the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) with PPM, in which ROMP helps to prepare a reactive LCP precursor with high molecular weight, and PPM provides a facilitation to introduce functional groups into the precursor. Consequently, a photo&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsive linear LCP (LLCP) is demonstrated to show the potential of this synthetic strategy to diversify functions of the LCPs. Under light irradiation and humidity changes, the deformation modes of the LLCP films are converted to complex shapes (bending, twisting, and curling). The obtained dual&#8208;responsive LLCP with high molecular weight possesses excellent processability and recyclability, making it possible to construct 3D shape actuators with programmable deformation behaviors under light/humidity.

         <title>Cyclopentylmethyl Ether, a Non&#8208;Fluorinated, Weakly Solvating and Wide Temperature Solvent for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original molecular design is reported to tailor the solvating power and physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fluorinated ether solvents. Eliminating one O atom and increasing steric hinderance in DME leads to cyclopentylmethyl ether (CPME) with significantly weakened solvating power and well extended temperature range of liquid phase from &#8722;140&#8201;&#176;C and 106&#8201;&#176;C, showing a great prospect for wide temperature lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
While recent work demonstrates the advantages of weakly solvating solvents in enhancing the cyclability of LMBs, both new designs and design strategies for high performance weakly solvating solvent, especially physicochemical properties, are still lacking. Here, we propose a molecular design to tune the solvating power and physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fluorinated ether solvent. The resulting cyclopentylmethyl ether (CPME) have a weak solvating power and wide liquid&#8208;phase temperature range.

     alt="Cyclopentylmethyl Ether, a Non-Fluorinated, Weakly Solvating and Wide Temperature Solvent for High-Performance Lithium Metal Battery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An original molecular design is reported to tailor the solvating power and physicochemical properties of non-fluorinated ether solvents. Eliminating one O atom and increasing steric hinderance in DME leads to cyclopentylmethyl ether (CPME) with significantly weakened solvating power and well extended temperature range of liquid phase from &#8722;140&#8201;&#176;C and 106&#8201;&#176;C, showing a great prospect for wide temperature lithium metal batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While recent work demonstrates the advantages of weakly solvating solvents in enhancing the cyclability of LMBs, both new designs and design strategies for high performance weakly solvating solvent, especially physicochemical properties, are still lacking. Here, we propose a molecular design to tune the solvating power and physicochemical properties of non-fluorinated ether solvent. The resulting cyclopentylmethyl ether (CPME) have a weak solvating power and wide liquid-phase temperature range. By optimizing the salt concentration, the CE is further promoted to 99.4&#8201;%. Besides, the improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S battery in CPME-based electrolytes is obtained at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The Li||LFP (17.6&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) battery with developed electrolyte maintains &amp;gt;90&#8201;% of the original capacity over 400 cycles. Our design concept for solvent molecule provides a promising pathway to non-fluorinated electrolytes with weakly solvating power and wide temperature window for high-energy-density LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric and Regiodivergent N1&#8208; and C3&#8208;Allenylic Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first direct catalytic asymmetric N1&#8208;functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles via an allenylic alkylation strategy. This transformation produces N&#8208;alkylated indoles bearing axial chirality with a stereocenter non&#8208;adjacent (&#946;) to the nitrogen. The regioselectivity (N1/C3) of this process can be switched efficiently. We also introduce a new class of tri&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles.







Abstract
Herein we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allenylic alkylation strategy for the direct functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles by employing P&#8208;chiral BIBOP&#8208;type ligands. The regioselectivity (N1/C3) of this process can be switched efficiently. Using Cs2CO3 at elevated temperatures in MeCN, N1&#8208;alkylated indoles bearing axial chirality with a stereocenter non&#8208;adjacent (&#946;) to the nitrogen are produced in good yields with high enantioselectivity and complete N1&#8208;regioselectivity regardless of the electronic properties and substitution patterns of diverse indoles. Using K2CO3 at room temperature in CH2Cl2, chiral C3&#8208;alkylated indoles can also be obtained. Notably, we introduce a new class of tri&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles that proceeded through different pathways from di&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles.

         <title>Mobile Molecules: Reactivity Profiling Guides Faster Movement on a Cysteine Track</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical stepping of biopolymers within a protein nanopore suggests an enzymeless means of sequence characterization. Using a nanoreactor approach, we elucidated the reactivity profile of cysteine footholds along a protein track. Faster chemical stepping was achieved by rational mutagenesis and optimization of reaction conditions. In the future, the system has the potential for directional molecular motion at milliseconds per step.







Abstract
We previously reported a molecular hopper, which makes sub&#8208;nanometer steps by thiol&#8208;disulfide interchange along a track with cysteine footholds within a protein nanopore. Here we optimize the hopping rate (ca. 0.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 in the previous work) with a view towards rapid enzymeless biopolymer characterization during translocation within nanopores. We first took a single&#8208;molecule approach to obtain the reactivity profiles of individual footholds. The pKa values of cysteine thiols within a pore ranged from 9.17 to 9.85, and the pH&#8208;independent rate constants of the thiolates with a small&#8208;molecule disulfide varied by up to 20&#8208;fold. Through site&#8208;specific mutagenesis and a pH increase from 8.5 to 9.5, the overall hopping rate of a DNA cargo along a five&#8208;cysteine track was accelerated 4&#8208;fold, and the rate&#8208;limiting step 21&#8208;fold.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Induced Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence of Copper Nanoclusters Using DNA Nanoribbon Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of self&#8208;assembly induced enhanced electrochemiluminescence (SIEECL) using programmable DNA nanoribbon was proposed for the first time. This novel concept is confirmed in various ECL emitters, such as copper nanoclusters, gold nanoclusters and Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA system. Accelerated electron transfer reaction and reduced energy gap contribute to the enhancement of ECL.







Abstract
Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are attractive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters as Cu is comparatively inexpensive, nontoxic, and highly abundant. However, their ECL yield is relatively low. Herein, we report that orderly self&#8208;assembly of CuNCs using DNA nanoribbon as the template (DNR/CuNCs) conferred the CuNCs with improved ECL properties compared with individual CuNCs in both annihilation and co&#8208;reactant processes. The DNR/CuNCs resulted in a high ECL yield of 46.8&#8201;% in K2S2O8, which was &#8776;68 times higher than that of individual CuNCs. This strategy was successfully extended to other ECL emitters, such as gold nanoclusters and the Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA system. Furthermore, as an application of DNR/CuNCs, a DNR/CuNC&#8208;based ECL biosensor with higher sensitivity was constructed for dopamine determination (two orders of magnitude lower than that previously reported), showing that DNR/CuNCs have a potential for application in ECL bioanalysis as a new type of superior luminophore candidate.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Manipulated p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; Synergy Enables Efficient Ultralong Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; synergy is realized by combining phosphine and carbazole groups in three hybrid molecules (xCzTPP). The harmonized p&#8208;electronic feature and steric effect of the phosphine group result in RTP efficiency and lifetime of para&#8208;substituted pCzTPP up to 13.8&#8201;% and 645&#8197;ms, respectively, owing to its sequential and complementary triplet p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; components in intersystem crossing and triplet energy&#8208;transfer processes.







Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) attracts extensive attentions, but still faces the challenge of achieving both high RTP efficiencies (&#951;RTP) and long lifetimes (&#964;RTP), due to the intrinsic contradiction between triplet radiation and stabilization. In this work, we developed three carbazole&#8208;triphenylphosphine hybrids named xCzTPP, in which phosphine groups provide nonbonding electrons and steric hindrance to modulate intermolecular p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. With the rational orientations and spatial positions of functional groups, para&#8208;substituted pCzTPP achieves high &#951;RTP over 10&#8201;% and more than twofold increased &#964;RTP (&gt;600&#8197;ms), compared to ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208; isomers. Theoretical simulation and photophysical investigation indicate that the strongest intermolecular p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; electronic interplays of pCzTPP harmonize high transition probability of 3p&#960; state and triplet stability of 3&#960;&#960; state, reflecting the p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; synergy in RTP process.

         <title>A Universal Synthesis Strategy for Tunable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanohybrids

Here, we show a versatile, general synthesis strategy using a representative set of seven MOF&#8208;shells (ZIF&#8208;zni, ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;67, FJU&#8208;30, MIL&#8208;88(Fe), HKUST&#8208;1, and MOF&#8208;74(Co)) and six cores (Ag, Au, NaYF4, &#946;&#8208;FeOOH, Fe2O3 and Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2) that are fine&#8208;tuned such that from single to hundreds of cores are incorporated in mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208; and quaternary composites.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) enjoy a vastly expanded application potential in catalysis, filtration, and sensing. The selection of particular modified core&#8208;NPs has yielded partial successes in overcoming lattice mismatch. However, restrictions on the choice of NPs not only limit the diversity, but also affect the properties of the hybrid materials. Here, we show a versatile synthesis strategy using a representative set of seven MOF&#8208;shells and six NP&#8208;cores that are fine&#8208;tuned to incorporate from single to hundreds of cores in mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208; and quaternary composites. This method does not require the presence of any specific surface structures or functionalities on the pre&#8208;formed cores. Our key point is to regulate the diffusion rate of alkaline vapors that deprotonate organic linkers and trigger the controlled MOF&#8208;growth and encapsulation of NPs. This strategy is expected to pave the way for the exploration of more sophisticated MOF&#8208;nanohybrids.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Pairing&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement from Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diads Decorated with Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane as an Electrochemical Protector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of electrochemical protectors was demonstrated with a classical Lewis acid B(C6F5)3, which was mounted on donor&#8208;acceptor emitters to greatly stabilize electrogenerated radicals and enhance the Lewis&#8208;pairing&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Electrochemical doping in segregated emitter&#8208;B(C6F5)3 co&#8208;assemblies afforded a crystalline film showing ECL through singlet exciton delocalization derived from columnar &#960;&#8208;stacks.







Abstract
This study reports an effective peripheral decoration of organic donor&#8208;acceptor diads with B(C6F5)3 for stabilizing electrogenerated radical ions. By employing a common p&#8208;type organic semiconductor benzothienobenzothiophene (BTBT) as the donor, tetracoordinate boron complexes showed improved solution electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensity, reaching a 156&#8208;fold increase compared to that of the parent diad. The unprecedented Lewis&#8208;pairing&#8208;induced ECL enhancement is attributed to the multiple roles of B(C6F5)3: 1)&#8197;redistributing frontier orbitals, 2)&#8197;facilitating electrochemical excitation, and 3)&#8197;restricting molecular motions. Furthermore, B(C6F5)3 converted the molecular arrangement of BTBT from conventional 2D herringbones into 1D &#960;&#8208;stacks. This robust, highly ordered columnar nanostructure allowed red&#8208;shifting of the crystalline film ECL with electrochemical doping through the electronic coupling pathways of BTBT. Our approach will facilitate the development of elaborate metal&#8208;free ECL systems.

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Orderly Assembly of Ir&#8208;atomic Chains to Integrate a Dynamic Reaction Pathway for Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we propose an intriguing light&#8208;driven orderly assembly strategy for implanting Ir&#8208;chains and clusters onto catalyst surfaces with different order degrees. Interestingly, the dynamic orbital interaction between orderly Ir&#8208;atomic chains and clusters can be regulated by balancing the dissolution and redisposition rate. As a result, the activation energy in acidic OER can be effectively reduced by integrating a dynamic reaction pathway. 







Abstract
This work suggests an intriguing light&#8208;driven atomic assembly proposal to orderly configure the distribution of reactive sites to optimize the spin&#8208;entropy&#8208;related orbital interaction and charge transfer from electrocatalysts to intermediates. Herein, the introduced fluorine (F) atoms acting as photo&#8208;corrosion centres in MnO1.9F0.1 effectively soften the bonding interaction of Mn&#8722;O bonds in the IrCl3 solution. Therefore, partial Mn atoms can be successively replaced to form orderly atomic&#8208;hybridized catalysts with a spin&#8208;related low entropy due to the coexistence of Ir&#8208;atomic chains and clusters. The time&#8208;related elemental analysis demonstrates that the dynamic dissolution/redeposition of Ir clusters in acidic oxygen evolution leads to a reintegration of the reaction pathway to seek the switchable rate&#8208;limiting step with a lower activation energy.

         <title>Precise Epitope Organization with Self&#8208;adjuvant Framework Nucleic Acid for Efficient COVID&#8208;19 Peptide Vaccine Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Framework nucleic acids (FNAs)&#8208;based peptide vaccines with different structures and sizes were constructed to understand the effect of peptide spacing and carrier rigidity on B&#8197;cell activation, and reveal the significance of precise peptide organization. Epitopes from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 were assembled on the preferred FNA to construct a COVID&#8208;19 peptide vaccine prototype which effectively triggered humoral immune responses in mice.







Abstract
Peptide vaccines have advantages in easy fabrication and high safety, but their effectiveness is hampered by the poor immunogenicity of the epitopes themselves. Herein, we constructed a series of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) with regulated rigidity and size to precisely organize epitopes in order to reveal the influence of epitope spacing and carrier rigidity on the efficiency of peptide vaccines. We found that assembling epitopes on rigid tetrahedral FNAs (tFNAs) with the appropriate size could efficiently enhance their immunogenicity. Further, by integrating epitopes from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 on preferred tFNAs, we constructed a COVID&#8208;19 peptide vaccine which could induce high titers of IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and increase the ratio of memory B and T cells in mice. Considering the good biocompatibility of tFNAs, our research provides a new idea for developing efficient peptide vaccines against viruses and possibly other diseases.

The Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;amination of arylamines with aliphatic, heterocyclic and aromatic amines is reported based on a one&#8208;pot procedure. The strategy is based on direct C&#8722;N bond formation for the practical synthesis of meta&#8208;substituted anilines, thus reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity. A concise and efficient synthesis of anti&#8208;psychotics and in particular of anti&#8208;schizophrenic drugs is shown.







Abstract
Reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity of C&#8722;H activation provides efficient retrosynthetic disconnections to otherwise unreactive bonds. Described herein is the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction that selectively performs meta&#8208;amination of anisidines with aliphatic&#8208;, heterocyclic&#8208; and aromatic amines in a one&#8208;pot procedure. In addition to dramatically simplifying the synthesis of meta&#8208;substituted anilines, our approach has the advantage of the scalability and remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds and natural products. The control experiments and detailed computational analysis provide insight into the reaction mechanism and the origin of meta&#8208;selectivity. The protocol extended to the synthesis of challenging tri&#8208;aminated arenes and successfully applied for the efficient synthesis of 5&#8208;HT6 receptor antagonists, the anti&#8208;psychotic drugs viz.. SB&#8208;214111, SB&#8208;258510, and specifically, anti&#8208;schizophrenic drug SB&#8208;271046.

         <title>Vinyl Halide&#8208;Modified Unsaturated Cyclitols are Mechanism&#8208;Based Glycosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclohexene&#8208;based carbohydrate mimics have been shown to react with glycoside hydrolases via positively charged, allylic cation&#8208;like transition states. By incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing halogens at the vinyl position of the allyl ethers of these sugar mimics, potent inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases were prepared. This approach is orthogonal to existing strategies and offers a new tool to probe glycosidase active sites.







Abstract
Suitably configured allyl ethers of unsaturated cyclitols act as substrates of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases, reacting via allylic cation transition states. Incorporation of halogens at the vinylic position of these carbasugars, along with an activated leaving group, generates potent inactivators of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases. Enzymatic turnover of these halogenated cyclitols (F, Cl, Br) displayed a counter&#8208;intuitive trend wherein the most electronegative substituents yielded the most labile pseudo&#8208;glycosidic linkages. Structures of complexes with the Sulfolobus &#946;&#8208;glucosidase revealed similar enzyme&#8208;ligand interactions to those seen in complexes with a 2&#8208;fluorosugar inhibitor, the lone exception being displacement of tyrosine 322 from the active site by the halogen. Mutation of Y322 to Y322F largely abolished glycosidase activity, consistent with lost interactions at O5, but minimally affected (7&#8208;fold) rates of carbasugar hydrolysis, yielding a more selective enzyme for unsaturated cyclitol ether hydrolysis.

         <title>An Electron&#8208;Deficient CpE Iridium(III) Catalyst: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application to Ether&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadienyl iridium(III) complex was developed ([CpEIrI2]2). This complex effectively catalyzed weakly coordinating ether&#8208;directed C&#8722;H amidation reactions under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations indicated that the high catalytic activity of the [CpEIrI2]2 complex is attributed to its highly electron&#8208;deficient nature.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance of an iridium(III) catalyst with an electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadienyl ligand ([CpEIrI2]2) are reported. The [CpEIrI2]2 catalyst was synthesized by complexation of a precursor of the CpE ligand with [Ir(cod)OAc]2, followed by oxidation, desilylation, and removal of the COD ligand. The electron&#8208;deficient [CpEIrI2]2 catalyst enabled C&#8722;H amidation reactions assisted by a weakly coordinating ether directing group. Experimental mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggested that the high catalytic performance of [CpEIrI2]2 is due to its electron&#8208;deficient nature, which accelerates both C&#8722;H activation and IrV&#8208;nitrenoid formation.

         <title>Interaction between Divalent Copper Fluoride and Carboxamide Group Enabling Stereoretentive Fluorination of Tertiary Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific fluorination reaction allowed to achieve the synthesis of molecules bearing F&#8208;containing tertiary carbon stereogenic center that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. Based on the use of enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;halocarboxamides and inexpensive CsF, the reaction could be controlled by efficient divalent&#8208;Cu/carboxamide interactions. This new methodology enables to generate the tert&#8208;alkyl fluorides in a stereoretentive manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific fluorination involving CsF and &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides as tertiary alkyl sources that, unlike traditional stereospecific routes involving stereoinversive SN2 reactions, proceeds with retention of stereochemistry. The developed stereospecific Cu&#8208;catalyzed reaction is among the most efficient methods for synthesizing fluorinated molecules that possess highly congested stereogenic carbon centers. Mechanistic studies revealed that the combined reactivity of CuF2 and Cs salt is essential for completing the catalytic cycle. Our catalytic system underwent fluorination exclusively with tertiary alkyl bromides and did not react with primary alkyl bromides, indicating that this stereospecific fluorination methodology is suitable for synthesizing fluorinated building blocks possessing stereo&#8208;defined F&#8208;containing tertiary carbon stereogenic center.

         <title>Heptagon&#8208;Containing Nanographene Embedded into [10]Cycloparaphenylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A saddle&#8208;shaped heptagon&#8208;containing nanographene and a [10]cycloparaphenylene are merged into a single nanohoop. The intrinsic curvature of the nanographene diminishes the strain energy of the hoop, increases the binding constant and enables a fast electron transfer toward fullerenes.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of a novel type of nanohoop, consisting of a cycloparaphenylene derivative incorporating a curved heptagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) unit. We demonstrate that this new macrocycle behaves as a supramolecular receptor of curved &#960;&#8208;systems such as fullerenes C60 and C70, with remarkably large binding constants (ca. 107&#8197;M&#8722;1), as estimated by fluorescence measurements. Nanosecond and femtosecond spectroscopic analysis show that these host&#8208;guest complexes are capable of quasi&#8208;instantaneous charge separation upon photoexcitation, due to the ultrafast charge transfer from the macrocycle to the complexed fullerene. These results demonstrate saddle&#8208;shaped PAHs with dibenzocycloheptatrienone motifs as structural components for new macrocycles displaying molecular receptor abilities and versatile photochemical responses with promising electron&#8208;donor properties in host&#8208;guest complexes.

These results demonstrate saddle-shaped PAHs with dibenzocycloheptatrienone motifs as structural components for new macrocycles displaying molecular receptor abilities and versatile photochemical responses with promising electron-donor properties in host-guest complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Approaching Theoretical Performances of Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation by Cobalt&#8208;Nitrogen Moieties</title>

A series of CoNx/carbon nanotube hybrids as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts were studied through electrochemical and operando spectroscopic methods. When cathodically biased, a reconstruction in the symmetry of Co&#8722;Nx active sites is discovered, which leads to a shift in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction selectivity from producing water to hydrogen peroxide.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been intensively studied for environmentally benign applications. However, insufficient understanding of ORR 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;pathway mechanism at the atomic level inhibits rational design of catalysts with both high activity and selectivity, causing concerns including catalyst degradation due to Fenton reaction or poor efficiency of H2O2 electrosynthesis. Herein we show that the generally accepted ORR electrocatalyst design based on a Sabatier volcano plot argument optimises activity but is unable to account for the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;pathway selectivity. Through electrochemical and operando spectroscopic studies on a series of CoNx/carbon nanotube hybrids, a construction&#8208;driven approach based on an extended &#8220;dynamic active site saturation&#8221; model that aims to create the maximum number of 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR sites by directing the secondary ORR electron transfer towards the 2&#8201;e&#8722; intermediate is proven to be attainable by manipulating O2 hydrogenation kinetics.

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;Induced Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in a Supported Copper/ZnO Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of formation of alcohol&#8208;induced strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) on the surface of a Cu/ZnO catalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) in metal catalysts is a promising strategy to improve their catalytic performance. In this article, we systematically investigated the influences of different alcohol/water mixtures on the evolution of the interfacial structure of Cu/ZnO catalysts in the reduction stage. A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of alcohol induced SMSI. It was found that when methanol/water is added to H2 during the reduction pretreatment, more oxygen vacancies are formed on the ZnO support, which facilitates the dissociation of H2O and the hydroxylation of ZnO species. Such promotion eventually favors the SMSI between Cu and ZnO and increases the catalytic activity for the methanol steam reforming reaction. In contrast, the addition of ethanol/water and 1&#8208;propanol/water during reduction leads to a physical blockage of the catalyst by alcohol molecules, poisoning the active Cu sites and limiting the migration of ZnO species.

         <title>Dearomatization&#8208;Rearomatization Reaction of Metal&#8208;Polarized Aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three sequential dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization reactions of benzoxazinones with aza&#8208;sulfur ylides were developed under transition metal catalysis. Pharmaceutically significant bis&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles, benzimidazolines and dibenzodiazepines, were produced with high efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, detailed mechanism studies were carried out to explain the proposed mechanism and reaction selectivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs) are a unique and efficient handle for azaheterocycle synthesis. Despite great achievements, the potential of these reactive intermediates has not yet been fully exploited, especially the new reaction modes. Herein, we disclosed an unprecedented dearomatization process of metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs, affording transient dearomatized spiroaziridine intermediates. Based on this serendipity, we accomplished three sequential dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization reactions of benzimidazolines with aza&#8208;sulfur ylides, enabling the divergent synthesis of bis&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles with high efficiency and flexibility. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies were performed to explain the proposed mechanisms and observed selectivity. Further cellular evaluation of the dibenzodiazepine products identified a hit compound for new antitumor drugs.

         <title>Hemin as a General Static Dark Quencher for Constructing Heme Oxygenase&#8208;1 Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemin was identified as a broad&#8208;spectrum (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) and highly efficient (quenching efficiency &gt;97&#8201;%) dark quencher for designing &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent probes. Based on this initial discovery, the first live cell&#8208;applicable fluorescent probe of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1) was disclosed and a convenient fluoroassay was developed for determining HO&#8208;1 activity in biological samples.







Abstract
The development of small&#8208;molecule probes suitable for live&#8208;cell applications remains challenging yet highly desirable. We report the first fluorescent probe, RBH, for imaging the heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1) activity in live cells after discovering hemin as a universal dark quencher. Hemin works via a static quenching mechanism and shows high quenching efficiency (&gt;97&#8201;%) with fluorophores across a broad spectrum (&#955;ex=400&#8211;700&#8197;nm). The favorable properties of RBH (e.g. long excitation/emission wavelengths, fast response rate and high magnitude of signal increase) enable its use for determining HO&#8208;1 activity in complex biological samples. As HO&#8208;1 is involved in regulating antioxidant defence, iron homeostasis and gasotransmitter carbon monoxide production, we expect RBH to be a powerful tool for dissecting its functions. Also, the discovery of hemin as a general static dark quencher provides a straightforward strategy for constructing novel fluorescent probes for diverse biological species.

         <title>A Hydrogel Microneedle Assay Combined with Nucleic Acid Probes for On&#8208;Site Detection of Small Molecules and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have developed a versatile microneedle (MN) biosensor applicable for detecting various clinical biomarkers, present in interstitial fluid, on&#8208;site and near a patient's point of care. Our MN&#8208;based biosensor has displayed accurate and reliable results at in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo settings when compared to benchmark assays. The developed MN paves the way for better health management and timely treatment.







Abstract
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of clinical biomarkers is critical to health monitoring and timely treatment, yet biosensing assays capable of detecting biomarkers without the need for costly external equipment and reagents are limited. Blood&#8208;based assays are, specifically, challenging as blood collection is invasive and follow&#8208;upprocessing is required. Here, we report a versatile assay that employs hydrogel microneedles (HMNs) to extract interstitial fluid (ISF), in a minimally invasive manner integrated with graphene oxide&#8208;nucleic acid (GO.NA)&#8208;based fluorescence biosensor to sense the biomarkers of interest in situ. The HMN&#8208;GO.NA assay is supplemented with a portable detector, enabling a complete POCT procedure. Our system could successfully measure four clinically important biomarkers (glucose, uric acid (UA), insulin, and serotonin) ex vivo, in addition, to accurately detecting glucose and UA in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we have developed a versatile microneedle (MN) biosensor applicable for detecting various clinical biomarkers, present in interstitial fluid, on-site and near a patient's point of care. Our MN-based biosensor has displayed accurate and reliable results at in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo settings when compared to benchmark assays. The developed MN paves the way for better health management and timely treatment.

         <title>Detachable Porous Organic Polymers Responsive to Light and Heat</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous material was prepared based on the detachment mechanism. The detachable porous polymer, namely DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1, was fabriated by the polymerization of anthracene&#8208;containing monomer with 365&#8197;nm UV light and it can detach into the monomer upon irradiation with 275&#8197;nm UV light or heat. The detachment results in a large difference in porosity and adsorption capacity.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials have captured much attention due to the on&#8208;demand tunable properties. Most reported stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials are based on molecule isomerism or host&#8208;guest interaction, and it is highly desired to develop new types based on different responsive mechanism. Herein, inspired by natural cells which have the ability to fuse and divide induced by external stimulation, we report a new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous material based on detachment mechanism. A detachable porous organic polymer, namely DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1, is fabricated from the polymerization of anthracene&#8208;containing monomer (AnMon) when irradiated by 365&#8197;nm UV light. DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1 can detach into the monomer AnMon when irradiated with 275&#8197;nm UV light or heat. Such polymerization/detachment is reversible. The detachment results in a big difference in porosity and adsorption capacity, making the present detachable porous polymer highly promising in adsorptive separation and drug delivery.

         <title>Revealing the Interfacial Chemistry of Fluoride Alkyl Magnesium Salts in Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>

Fluoride alkyl magnesium salts reconstructing the solvation structure of Mg2+ not only improve the high voltage tolerance of the electrolyte, but also facilitate the in situ generation of a robust solid electrolyte interface enabling a steady Mg metal anode.







Abstract
Exploring promising electrolyte&#8208;system with high reversible Mg plating/stripping and excellent stability is essential for rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs). Fluoride alkyl magnesium salts (Mg(ORF)2) not only possess high solubility in ether solvents but also compatible with Mg metal anode, thus holding a vast application prospect. Herein, a series of diverse Mg(ORF)2 were synthesized, among them, perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol magnesium (Mg(PFTB)2)/AlCl3/MgCl2 based electrolyte demonstrates highest oxidation stability, and promotes the in situ formation of robust solid electrolyte interface. Consequently, the fabricated symmetric cell sustains a long&#8208;term cycling over 2000&#8197;h, and the asymmetric cell exhibits a stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.5&#8201;% over 3000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, the Mg||Mo6S8 full cell maintains a stable cycling over 500&#8197;cycles. This work presents guidance for understanding structure&#8211;property relationships and electrolyte applications of fluoride alkyl magnesium salts.

         <title>Nickel(II) Nitrate Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Single&#8208;Junction Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with a Record 19.02&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

A facile strategy was developed to improve the film quality of a solution processed nickel(II) nitrate hole transporting layer, which realized a record efficiency of 19.02&#8201;% for the binary blend bulk heterojunction organic solar cells.







Abstract
A facile strategy was developed here to improve the film quality of nickel&#8208;based hole transporting layer (HTL) for efficient organic solar cell (OSC) applications. To prevent the agglomeration of Ni(NO3)2 during film deposition, acetylacetonate was added into the precursor solution, which led to the formation of an amorphous and glass&#8208;like state. After thermal annealing (TA) treatment, the film&#8208;forming ability could be further improved. The additional UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatment continuously improved the film quality and increased the work function and conductivity of such HTL. The resulting TA &amp; UVO modified Ni(NO3)2 &amp; Hacac HTL produced highly efficient organic solar cells with exciting power conversion efficiencies of 18.42&#8201;% and 19.02&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 and D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Th devices, respectively, much higher than the control PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS devices.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Pure Isotropic Proton Solid State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;learning on three&#8208;dimensional variable spinning rate datasets provides a powerful method to obtain high resolution 1H&#8208;1H two&#8208;dimensional NMR spectra in rigid organic solids by removing broadening due to dipolar interactions.







Abstract
One key bottleneck of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is that 1H NMR spectra of organic solids are often very broad due to the presence of a strong network of dipolar couplings. We have recently suggested a new approach to tackle this problem. More specifically, we parametrically mapped errors leading to residual dipolar broadening into a second dimension and removed them in a correlation experiment. In this way pure isotropic proton (PIP) spectra were obtained that contain only isotropic shifts and provide the highest 1H NMR resolution available today in rigid solids. Here, using a deep&#8208;learning method, we extend the PIP approach to a second dimension, and for samples of L&#8208;tyrosine hydrochloride and ampicillin we obtain high resolution 1H&#8208;1H double&#8208;quantum/single&#8208;quantum dipolar correlation and spin&#8208;diffusion spectra with significantly higher resolution than the corresponding spectra at 100&#8197;kHz MAS, allowing the identification of previously overlapped isotropic correlation peaks.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Induced Planar Chirality of Soft&#8208;Bridged Binuclear Platinum(II) Complexes: 100&#8201;% Phosphorescence Quantum Yields, Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting, and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemic (R)/(S) and enantiopure (D,R,D)/(L,S,L) binuclear PtII complexes with metal&#8208;induced planar chirality were designed and prepared by using soft&#8208;bridged achiral and chiral ligands, respectively. Their phosphorescence quantum yields up to 100&#8201;% can be achieved by shortening intramolecular Pt&#8722;Pt distance for highly efficient solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized OLEDs.







Abstract
PtII complexes have attracted a great deal of interest due to their rich phosphorescent properties. However, these square&#8208;planar PtII complexes are far more likely to encounter the problems of lack of metal&#8208;induced chirality and emission &#8220;aggregation&#8208;caused quenching&#8221;. Herein, soft&#8208;bridged binuclear PtII complexes bearing metal&#8208;induced planar chirality were synthesized and characterized. These soft bridging ligands with smaller conjugated system would help to not only improve solubility for synthesis and enantioseparation but also introduce point chirality from amino acid for highly efficient diastereoselectivity. Furthermore, the intramolecular Pt&#8722;Pt distances could be well regulated by soft bridging ligands, and consequently the phosphorescence quantum yield up to 100&#8201;% could be achieved by shortening intramolecular Pt&#8722;Pt distance for first time. These complexes can be used as emitters in highly efficient solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Manipulating Local Lattice Distortion for Spectrally Stable and Efficient Mixed&#8208;halide Blue Perovskite LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new local lattice distortion (LLD) manipulation strategy was demonstrated to suppress the halide migration in mixed&#8208;halide perovskite. DFT simulation and experimental data confirm that the LLD manipulation effectively suppresses the halide migration in perovskites. Mixed&#8208;halide blue PeLED with champion EQE of 14.2&#8201;% at 475&#8197;nm and impressive T50 of 72&#8197;min has been achieved, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide perovskites are considered the most straightforward candidate to realize blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, they suffer severe halide migration, leading to spectral instability, which is particularly exaggerated in high chloride alloying perovskites. Here, we demonstrate energy barrier of halide migration can be tuned by manipulating the degree of local lattice distortion (LLD). Enlarging the LLD degree to a suitable level can increase the halide migration energy barrier. We herein report an &#8220;A&#8208;site&#8221; cation engineering to tune the LLD degree to an optimal level. DFT simulation and experimental data confirm that LLD manipulation suppresses the halide migration in perovskites. Conclusively, mixed&#8208;halide blue PeLEDs with a champion EQE of 14.2&#8201;% at 475&#8197;nm have been achieved. Moreover, the devices exhibit excellent operational spectral stability (T50 of 72&#8197;min), representing one of the most efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs reported yet.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Supramolecular Polymers Based on Selectively Recognized Aromatic Cation&#8208;&#960; and Donor&#8208;Acceptor Motifs for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first demonstration of an aromatics&#8208;selective recognition strategy for cation&#8208;&#960; and donor&#8208;acceptor motifs that avoid their mutual interference, thus enabling the construction of two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers (2DSPs), which exhibit boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic polymers have recently received considerable interest, especially those whose architectures are held together via supramolecular engineering. However, current approaches toward supramolecular 2D structures usually suffer from mutual interference of noncovalent interactions and lack of intrinsic functions. Herein, we report well&#8208;regulated 2D supramolecular polymers (2DSPs) through an aromatics&#8208;selective recognition strategy of cation&#8208;&#960; and donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) motifs, which are derived from C4&#8208;symmetric cationic monomers and electron&#8208;withdrawing molecules. By subtly designing the strength and direction of noncovalent driving forces, the mutual interference between cation&#8208;&#960; and D&#8208;A interactions is effectively avoided, enabling the construction of 2DSPs in aqueous solution. On this basis, the resultant 2DSPs possess boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity at a rate of 600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is mainly ascribed to the specific stacking mode of cation&#8208;&#960;/D&#8208;A motifs and the ordered 2D structures.

         <title>Regulating the Inner Helmholtz Plane with a High Donor Additive for Efficient Anode Reversibility in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries is improved by regulating the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) chemistry. Pyridine (Py) as high donor number organic electrolyte additive (only 1&#8197;vol.&#8201;% addition) is used to efficiently regulate the solvation sheath structure, which results in depressed H2O activity at the IHP interface. The thus&#8208;formed IHP interface enables a superior stable Zn anode with high reversibility and utilization rate.







Abstract
The performance of aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) is highly dependent on inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) chemistry. Notorious parasitic reactions containing hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and Zn dendrites both originate from abundant free H2O and random Zn deposition inside active IHP. Here, we report a universal high donor number (DN) additive pyridine (Py) with only 1&#8197;vol.&#8201;% addition (Py&#8208;to&#8208;H2O volume ratio), for regulating molecule distribution inside IHP. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation verify that incorporated Py additive could tailor Zn2+ solvation sheath and exclude H2O molecules from IHP effectively, which is in favor of preventing H2O decomposition. Consequently, even at extreme conditions such as high depth of discharge (DOD) of 80&#8201;%, the symmetric cell based on Py additive can sustain approximately 500&#8197;h long&#8208;term stability. This efficient strategy with high DN additives furnishes a promising direction for designing novel electrolytes and promoting the practical application of AZIBs, despite inevitably introducing trace organic additives.

         <title>Loading of Amino Acids onto RNA in a Putative RNA&#8208;Peptide World</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The loading of RNAs with amino acids constitutes the first step toward RNA&#8208;based peptide synthesis in a putative prebiotic RNA&#8208;peptide world. The efficient loading of RNA strands incorporating N&#8208;methylcarbamoyl nucleotides with a series of amino acids is reported. The loaded RNA strands also underwent RNA&#8208;based amino acid transfer reactions.







Abstract
RNA is a molecule that can both store genetic information and perform catalytic reactions. This observed dualism places RNA into the limelight of concepts about the origin of life. The RNA world concept argues that life started from self&#8208;replicating RNA molecules, which evolved toward increasingly complex structures. Recently, we demonstrated that RNA, with the help of conserved non&#8208;canonical nucleosides, which are also putative relics of an early RNA world, had the ability to grow peptides covalently connected to RNA nucleobases, creating RNA&#8208;peptide chimeras. It is conceivable that such molecules, which combined the information&#8208;coding properties of RNA with the catalytic potential of amino acid side chains, were once the structures from which life emerged. Herein, we report prebiotic chemistry that enabled the loading of both nucleosides and RNAs with amino acids as the first step toward RNA&#8208;based peptide synthesis in a putative RNA&#8208;peptide world.

The efficient loading of RNA strands incorporating &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylcarbamoyl nucleotides with a series of amino acids is reported. The loaded RNA strands also underwent RNA-based amino acid transfer reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA is a molecule that can both store genetic information and perform catalytic reactions. This observed dualism places RNA into the limelight of concepts about the origin of life. The RNA world concept argues that life started from self-replicating RNA molecules, which evolved toward increasingly complex structures. Recently, we demonstrated that RNA, with the help of conserved non-canonical nucleosides, which are also putative relics of an early RNA world, had the ability to grow peptides covalently connected to RNA nucleobases, creating RNA-peptide chimeras. It is conceivable that such molecules, which combined the information-coding properties of RNA with the catalytic potential of amino acid side chains, were once the structures from which life emerged. Herein, we report prebiotic chemistry that enabled the loading of both nucleosides and RNAs with amino acids as the first step toward RNA-based peptide synthesis in a putative RNA-peptide world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Mavacuran Alkaloids through Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;Addition of an Organolithium Reagent
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent to a readily accessible Michael acceptor enabled the synthesis of six mavacuran alkaloids with a highly strained pentacyclic cagelike framework. The chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the reaction was rationalized by DFT calculations. Dihydroxylation and pinacol rearrangement of the indole nucleus completed the first total syntheses of C&#8208;profluorocurine and C&#8208;fluorocurine.







Abstract
We report a synthetic endeavor towards the highly strained pentacyclic caged framework of the mavacuran alkaloids which culminated with the concise total synthesis of C&#8208;fluorocurine, C&#8208;profluorocurine, C&#8208;mavacurine, normavacurine, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;pleiocarpamine and taberdivarine H. We designed a strategy involving late&#8208;stage construction of the D ring by Michael addition of a vinylic nucleophile to a 2&#8208;indolyl acrylate moiety. While the intramolecular Michael addition did not succeed, we were able to perform a diastereoselective unusual intermolecular 1,4&#8208;addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent to a readily accessible Michael acceptor with the assistance of the piperidine nitrogen atom through the formation of a complex as suggested by DFT computations. Final cyclization was achieved by nucleophilic substitution to form an ammonium intermediate. The first total syntheses of C&#8208;profluorocurine and C&#8208;fluorocurine were finalized by the dihydroxylation of C&#8208;mavacurine and a pinacol rearrangement, respectively.

         <title>A Microporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Unique Aromatic Pore Surfaces for High Performance C2H6/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the unblocked unique aromatic pore surfaces, suitable pore spaces and pore volumes, Ni&#8208;MOF 2 displays high separation performance for C2H6/C2H4 separation and produces polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 with high productivity (12&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1) by a single separation process.







Abstract
Developing adsorptive separation processes based on C2H6&#8208;selective sorbents to replace energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation is a promising alternative for C2H4 purification from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures, which however remains challenging. During our studies on two isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOF 1 and Ni&#8208;MOF 2), we found that Ni&#8208;MOF 2 exhibited significantly higher performance for C2H6/C2H4 separation than Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1, as clearly established by gas sorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments. Density&#8208;Functional Theory (DFT) studies showed that the unblocked unique aromatic pore surfaces within Ni&#8208;MOF 2 induce more and stronger C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; with C2H6 over C2H4 while the suitable pore spaces enforce its high C2H6 uptake capacity, featuring Ni&#8208;MOF 2 as one of the best porous materials for this very important gas separation. It generates 12&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 product from equimolar C2H6/C2H4 mixtures at ambient conditions.

         <title>Graphene Mediates Charge Transfer between Lead Chromate and a Cobalt Cubane Cocatalyst for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially oxidized graphene (pGO) operates as a charge&#8208;transfer mediator between the water oxidation cocatalyst (Co4O4) and the hole&#8208;accumulating {&#8722;101} facets of PbCrO4. Unimpeded transfer of photogenerated holes from PbCrO4 to Co4O4 via the pGO mediator is demonstrated. The resulting Co4O4/pGO/PbCrO4 photocatalyst oxidizes water with an apparent quantum efficiency exceeding 10&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The interfacial barrier of charge transfer from semiconductors to cocatalysts means that the photogenerated charges cannot be fully utilized, especially for the challenging water oxidation reaction. Using cobalt cubane molecules (Co4O4) as water oxidation cocatalysts, we rationally assembled partially oxidized graphene (pGO), acting as a charge&#8208;transfer mediator, on the hole&#8208;accumulating {&#8722;101} facets of lead chromate (PbCrO4) crystal. The assembled pGO enables preferable immobilization of Co4O4 molecules on the {&#8722;101} facets of the PbCrO4 crystal, which is favorable for the photogenerated holes transferring from PbCrO4 to Co4O4 molecules. The surface charge&#8208;transfer efficiency of PbCrO4 was boosted by selective assembly of pGO between PbCrO4 and Co4O4 molecules. An apparent quantum efficiency for photocatalytic water oxidation on the Co4O4/pGO/PbCrO4 photocatalyst exceeded 10&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm. This strategy of rationally assembling charge&#8208;transfer mediator provides a feasible method for acceleration of charge transfer and utilization in semiconductor photocatalysis.

         <title>Facile Access to Cyclopropylboronates via Stereospecific Deborylative Cyclization: A Leaving Group&#8208;Assisted Activation of Geminal Diborons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free deborylative cyclization strategy led to the efficient synthesis of racemic and enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates. The cyclization of geminal&#8208;bis(boronates) bearing a leaving group was highly diastereoselective and stereospecific, tolerating various functional groups and heterocycles. Mechanistic studies indicated that the leaving group at the &#947;&#8208;position significantly promoted the activation of the gem&#8208;diboron moiety.







Abstract
Herein we reported a transition metal&#8208;free deborylative cyclization strategy, based on which two routes have been developed, generating racemic and enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates. The cyclization of geminal&#8208;bis(boronates) bearing a leaving group was highly diastereoselective, tolerating a few functional groups and applicable to heterocycles. When optically active epoxides were used as the starting materials, enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates could be efficiently prepared with &gt;99&#8201;% stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies showed that the leaving group at the &#947;&#8208;position played a crucial role and significantly promoted the activation of the gem&#8208;diboron moiety.

Mechanistic studies indicated that the leaving group at the &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-position significantly promoted the activation of the &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diboron moiety.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we reported a transition metal-free deborylative cyclization strategy, based on which two routes have been developed, generating racemic and enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates. The cyclization of geminal-bis(boronates) bearing a leaving group was highly diastereoselective, tolerating a few functional groups and applicable to heterocycles. When optically active epoxides were used as the starting materials, enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates could be efficiently prepared with &amp;gt;99&#8201;% stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies showed that the leaving group at the &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-position played a crucial role and significantly promoted the activation of the &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diboron moiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Three&#8208;Component Coupling of Cyclic Diaryliodoniums and Sodium Cyanate Enabled by the Dual&#8208;Role of Phenol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atroposelective copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of cyclic diaryliodonium, cyanate and phenols is used to synthesize axially chiral carbamates. The success of this coupling is attributed to the key dual role of phenols, which are capable of activating the copper catalyst and trapping the isocyanate intermediate.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic diaryliodoniums, sodium cyanate (NaOCN) and phenols is reported. The reaction chemoselectively affords axially chiral carbamates by sequential coupling of cyclic diaryliodonium and NaOCN, followed by phenol. Mechanistic investigations revealed that phenol is not only a reagent to trap highly active intermediate isocyanates, but it also activates the copper catalyst as a standby ligand. The carbamates were readily transformed into highly functionalized urea derivatives within a simple nucleophilic substitution reaction.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanographenes with Joined Nonhexagons via a Ring Expansion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, novel nanographenes bearing N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs were synthesized through a facile ring expansion strategy. Modifications of heptagon spacers have endowed N&#8208;doped nanographenes with tunable physicochemical properties. This ring expansion method was further explored to synthesize diverse N&#8208;doped nanographenes containing pentagon&#8208;octagon pairs, demonstrating the high efficiency of the proposed method.







Abstract
Synthetic methodology is considered a holy grail in both organic chemistry and materials science. Over the past few decades, researchers have explored graphene&#8208;type molecules (or nanographenes) through classic Scholl oxidative cyclodehydrogenation. Despite the successes achieved with various nanographenes, the development of new methods to synthesize these highly desired molecules lags behind. Herein, we developed a facile and effective method to produce a series of nanographenes bearing nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs in acceptable yields. Modification of the heptagonal ring endowed the resultant nanographenes with tunable physicochemical properties; for instance, M9 exhibited both aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Most strikingly, novel nanographenes containing N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;octagon pairs were also obtained using the same synthetic strategy, demonstrating the superior versatility and efficiency of the proposed ring expansion method.

         <title>Fast Isomerization Before Isomerization&#8208;Hydroformylation: Probing the Neglected Period with A Novel Microfluidic Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to limits in heat and mass transfer, the acquisition of kinetic data of fast reactions has been historically challenging, especially for multiphasic reactions. Inspired by the concept of flash chemistry and radial synthesis, a novel microreactor was designed to study the initial fast isomerization process (within the first minute) in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation. A new type of isomerization pathway without the coordination of CO to rhodium center was found, which is dramatically faster than the known one.







Abstract
By combining the concept of flash chemistry and radial synthesis, a novel microreactor (Flashstop reactor) was designed to study isomerization process of hydroformylation by a Rh/tetraphosphite catalyst in a time scale of seconds. It was found that in the initial 313&#8197;seconds, 60&#8211;99&#8201;% of 1&#8208;octene was isomerized to 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;octenes before the formation of aldehydes. Within this period, two different types of isomerization reactions were observed. It was proposed that a monohydride complex without CO ligand accounts for the ultrafast isomerization in the initial 30&#8197;seconds. The isomerization rate with such monohydride species was calculated much faster than that with the well&#8208;known H(CO)Rh(P&#8722;P) species. Both experimental and DFT computational studies were carried out to support this assumption. Fast transformations early on in catalytic cycles have been rarely studied due to the lack of proper tools. We believe that the Flashstop reactor is a powerful tool for analysis of kinetics in gas&#8208;liquid biphasic reactions within a time scale of seconds to minutes.

         <title>A Direct Formaldehyde Fuel Cell for CO2&#8208;Emission Free Co&#8208;generation of Electrical Energy and Valuable Chemical/Hydrogen</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly selective 1&#8208;electron oxidation of formaldehyde enables co&#8208;generation of electricity and H2 with valuable formate in a direct formaldehyde fuel cell without CO2 pathway. This approach not only avoids greenhouse gas emissions but also eliminates negative effects of CO poisoning and carbonate generation.







Abstract
Converting carbon&#8208;based molecular fuels into electricity efficiently and cleanly without emitting CO2 remains a challenge. Conventional fuel cells using noble metals as anode catalysts often suffer performance degradation due to CO poisoning and a host of problems associated with CO2 production. This study provides a CO2&#8208;emission&#8208;free direct formaldehyde fuel cell. It enables a flow of electricity while producing H2 and valuable formate. Unlike conventional carbon&#8208;based molecules electrooxidation, formaldehyde 1&#8208;electron oxidation is performed on the Cu anode with high selectivity, thus generating formate and H2 without undergoing CO2 pathway. In addition, the fuel cell produces 0.62&#8197;Nm3 H2 and 53&#8197;mol formate per 1&#8197;kWh of electricity generated, with an open circuit voltage of up to 1&#8197;V and a peak power density of 350&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This study puts forward a zero&#8208;carbon solution for the efficient utilization of carbon&#8208;based molecule fuels that generates electricity, hydrogen and valuable chemicals in synchronization.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Efficient Ion Gating through Self&#8208;Assembled Two&#8208;Dimensional Photothermal Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane is shown to be an excellent nanofluidic platform for the smart regulation of transverse ion transport. It exhibits extremely high ion gating ratios (up to 104) due to its good photothermal performance. This approach may lead to applications of MOF membranes which have a variety of stimuli responsive properties in ion sieving, biosensing, and energy conversion.







Abstract
Biological ion channels regulate the ion flow across cell membrane via opening or closing of the pores in response to various external stimuli. Replicating the function of high ion gating effects with artificial porous materials has been challenging. Herein, we report that the self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane can serve as an excellent nanofluidic platform for smart regulation of ion transport. The MOF membrane with good photothermal performance exhibits extremely high ion gating ratio (up to 104), which is among the highest values in MOF membrane nanochannels for light&#8208;controlled ion gating reported so far.

     alt="Highly-Efficient Ion Gating through Self-Assembled Two-Dimensional Photothermal Metal-Organic Framework Membrane"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-assembled 2D metal-organic framework (MOF) membrane is shown to be an excellent nanofluidic platform for the smart regulation of transverse ion transport. It exhibits extremely high ion gating ratios (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) due to its good photothermal performance. This approach may lead to applications of MOF membranes which have a variety of stimuli responsive properties in ion sieving, biosensing, and energy conversion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological ion channels regulate the ion flow across cell membrane via opening or closing of the pores in response to various external stimuli. Replicating the function of high ion gating effects with artificial porous materials has been challenging. Herein, we report that the self-assembled two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF) membrane can serve as an excellent nanofluidic platform for smart regulation of ion transport. The MOF membrane with good photothermal performance exhibits extremely high ion gating ratio (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), which is among the highest values in MOF membrane nanochannels for light-controlled ion gating reported so far. By repeatedly turning on and off the light, the nanofluidic device shows outstanding stability and reversibility that can be applied in the remote light-switching system. This work may spark promising applications of MOF membrane with variety of stimuli responsive properties in ion sieving, biosensing, and energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic pH Buffer for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic pH buffer strategy is proposed. N&#8208;containing organic molecules simultaneously control electrolyte pH, suppress hydrogen evolution, enable uniform Zn deposition, and inhibit shuttle of polyiodine compounds, achieving highly reversible and stable, long&#8208;cycle Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;Iodine (I2) batteries are attractive for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, drawbacks include, Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion and, cathode &#8220;shuttle&#8221; of polyiodines. Here we report a class of N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds as organic pH buffers to obviate these. We evidence that addition of pyridine /imidazole regulates electrolyte pH, and inhibits HER and anode corrosion. In addition, pyridine and imidazole preferentially absorb on Zn metal, regulating non&#8208;dendritic Zn plating /stripping, and achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;% and long&#8208;term cycling stability of 3200&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It is also confirmed that pyridine inhibits polyiodines shuttling and boosts conversion kinetics for I&#8722;/I2. As a result, the Zn&#8208;I2 full battery exhibits long cycle stability of &gt;25&#8201;000&#8197;cycles and high specific capacity of 105.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. We conclude organic pH buffer engineering is practical for dendrite&#8208;free and shuttle&#8208;free Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Complexes Featuring a cis&#8208;[M
U
M] Core (M=Rh, Ir): A New Route to Uranium&#8208;Metal Multiple Bonds</title>

Complexes featuring two U
M double dative bonds are prepared from the reaction of heterometallic chlorine&#8208;bridged precursors with MeMgBr or MeLi. This study shows a novel synthetic method for complexes with U&#8722;M multiple bonds, and also provides new examples with which to investigate the bonding of 5&#8201;f&#8208;block actinide elements.







Abstract
Although examples of multiple bonds between actinide elements and main&#8208;group elements are quite common, studies of the multiple bonds between actinide elements and transition metals are extremely rare owing to difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here we report the first example of molecular uranium complexes featuring a cis&#8208;[M
U
M] core (M=Rh, Ir), which exhibits an unprecedented arrangement of two M
U double dative bond linkages to a single U center. These complexes were prepared by the reactions of chlorine&#8208;bridged heterometallic complexes [{U{N(CH3)(CH2CH2NPiPr2)2}(Cl)2[(&#956;&#8208;Cl)M(COD)]2}] (M=Rh, Ir) with MeMgBr or MeLi, a new method for the construction of species with U&#8722;M multiple bonds. Theoretical calculations including dispersion confirmed the presence of two U
M double dative bonds in these complexes. This study not only enriches the U
M multiple bond chemistry, but also provides a new opportunity to explore the bonding of actinide elements.

The first intermolecular enantioselective addition of nitroalkanes to unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters is described, catalyzed by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase. This fundamental synthetically relevant transformation proceeds with high enantiomeric excesses and yields over a wide range of feedstock substrates, providing pharmaceutically relevant building blocks in a single step.







Abstract
Herein we describe the enantioselective intermolecular conjugate addition of nitroalkanes to unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, catalyzed by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase. The transformation provides the most direct access to pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;nitroesters, utilizing feedstock chemicals, with unprecedented selectivity. The methodology exhibits a broad substrate scope, including &#946;&#8208;(fluoro)alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl substituted electrophiles, and was successfully applied on a gram scale with reduced catalyst loading, and, additionally, catalyst recovery was carried out. The formal synthesis of a range of drug molecules, and an enantioselective synthesis of (S)&#8208;rolipram were achieved. Additionally, computational studies revealed key reaction intermediates and transition state structures, and provided rationale for high enantioselectivities, in good agreement with experimental results.

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Induced Site&#8208;Specific Etching Boosts Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen (1O2) specifically targets the N&#8208;adjacent atoms and acts as an etchant to realize site&#8208;specific etching of topological carbon defects neighboring the N&#8208;dopants, leading to a boosted intrinsic catalytic activity of the N&#8722;C sites in the resultant N&#8208;doped carbon (1O2&#8722;N/C). The 1O2&#8722;N/C exhibits the highest half&#8208;wave potential of 0.915&#8197;VRHE toward oxygen reduction reaction among all the metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts reported to date.







Abstract
Targeted construction of carbon defects near the N dopants is an intriguing but challenging way to boost the electrocatalytic activity of N&#8208;doped carbon toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel site&#8208;specific etching strategy that features targeted anchoring of singlet oxygen (1O2) on the N&#8208;adjacent atoms to directionally construct topological carbon defects neighboring the N dopants in N&#8208;doped carbon (1O2&#8722;N/C). This 1O2&#8722;N/C exhibits the highest ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.915&#8197;VRHE among all the reported metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts. Pyridinic&#8208;N bonded with a carbon pentagon of the neighboring topological carbon defects is identified as the primary active configuration, rendering enhanced adsorption of O2, optimized adsorption energy of the ORR intermediates, and a significantly decreased total energy barrier for ORR. This 1O2&#8208;induced site&#8208;specific etching strategy is also applicable to different precursors, showing a tremendous potential for targeted construction of high&#8208;efficiency active sites in carbon&#8208;based materials.

Pyridinic-N bonded with a carbon pentagon of the neighboring topological carbon defects is identified as the primary active configuration, rendering enhanced adsorption of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, optimized adsorption energy of the ORR intermediates, and a significantly decreased total energy barrier for ORR. This &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced site-specific etching strategy is also applicable to different precursors, showing a tremendous potential for targeted construction of high-efficiency active sites in carbon-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectroscopic Identification of Active Sites of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Selective Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>

         <dc:description>
The quinone&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable onset potential of 0.83&#8197;eV vs. RHE in 0.1&#8197;M KOH and over 95&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. The effectiveness of chair&#8208;form quinone groups as the most efficient active sites is highlighted by the reverse verification method, compared with other oxygen functional groups.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via a two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process provides a promising alternative to replace the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. Herein, we develop a facile template&#8208;protected strategy to synthesize a highly active quinone&#8208;rich porous carbon catalyst for H2O2 electrochemical production. The optimized PCC900 material exhibits remarkable activity and selectivity, of which the onset potential reaches 0.83&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1&#8197;M KOH and the H2O2 selectivity is over 95&#8201;% in a wide potential range. Comprehensive synchrotron&#8208;based near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy combined with electrocatalytic characterizations reveals the positive correlation between quinone content and 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR performance. The effectiveness of chair&#8208;form quinone groups as the most efficient active sites is highlighted by the molecule&#8208;mimic strategy and theoretical analysis.

Combining N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with gold nanoparticles provides an ultrabright and fragment&#8208;free ionization platform for laser&#8208;desorption mass spectrometry. In their Research Article (e202219182), David&#8197;M. Jenkins, Jon&#8197;P. Camden, and co&#8208;workers show that NHC&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles can &#8220;give gold wings&#8221; in the mass spectrometer, enabling next&#8208;generation applications of mass barcoding, data storage, and bioconjugation reaction monitoring.

Elaborate metal&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems require highly robust organic emitters in the radical form. In their Research Article (e202301109), Keishiro Tahara, Masaaki Abe, and co&#8208;workers used the classical Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 as an electrochemical protector of donor&#8211;acceptor emitters, leading to the discovery of Lewis&#8208;pairing&#8208;induced ECL enhancement. The Lewis acid also converted the molecular arrangements of the emitters, playing a unique role in crystalline&#8208;film ECL.

A binap&#8208;ligated copper iodide dimer embedded on a metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) was designed as an effective photoredox catalyst by Dan Li, Jian He, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202300233). Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, this heterogenized copper(I) complex promotes multiple iminyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions initiated by N&#8722;O bond cleavage, with significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to its homogeneous counterparts. The use of a hydroxamic acid linker for post&#8208;synthetic modification renders the catalyst recyclable.

A modified seed&#8208;mediated approach using a chiral co&#8208;surfactant as capping ligand has been developed for the synthesis of intrinsically chiral gold dog&#8208;bone&#8208;shaped nanoparticles. The shape anisotropy at the edges was found to play a crucial role in driving the optical activity of these nanostructures, as reported by Jatish Kumar and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202300461). The intense plasmonic chirality observed in the visible and NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum can be of potential use in biosensing and enantioselective catalysis.

         <title>Electrochemical Reactors Enable Divergent Site Selectivity in the C&#8722;H Carboxylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general electrochemical strategy for the direct C&#8722;H carboxylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes with CO2 by simply choosing different electrochemical setups has been reported by Yu, Lin, and co&#8208;workers, providing high&#8208;yielding access to divergent carboxylated products with excellent site selectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic and switchable C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarenes under easily tunable conditions is a robust but challenging tool for the construction of biologically relevant compounds. Recently, a general electrochemical strategy has been developed for the direct C&#8722;H carboxylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes with CO2, and by simply choosing different types of cell setups, carboxylated products are furnished with excellent and tunable site selectivity. This study also paves the way for regulating the reactivity modes in electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>Harnessing the Structure&#8208;Performance Relationships in Designing Non&#8208;Fused Ring Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused ring acceptors for organic solar cells are presented in this Review from the viewpoint of materials design. The cencepts of noncovalent interactions, insertion of sterically hindered side chains, and planarization of the molecular backbone by conformational locking are summarized toward the design of high&#8208;performance materials.







Abstract
The prerequisite for commercially viable organic solar cells (OSC) is to reduce the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;cost gap. Therefore, the cost of organic materials should be reduced by minimizing the synthetic steps, yet maintaining the molecular planarity and efficiencies achieved by the fused ring acceptors (FRA). In this respect, developing non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRA) with suitable functionalization to favor conformational planarity and effective molecular packing is beneficial and cost&#8208;effective. Presently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for NFRAs is around 16&#8201;%, yet lower than the 19&#8201;% achieved for FRAs. Despite their potential, a thorough understanding of the effective structural design of NFRAs is necessary for developing efficient OSCs. This article pays special attention to the molecular design concept for NFRAs developed in the last years and analyzed the approach toward materials design and efficiency improvement, an important step toward technological application.

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Amorphization in 2D Materials: Mechanism and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent achievements in the fabrication of amorphous nanomaterials with the assistance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2) and discusses the underlying amorphization mechanism. The application of amorphous nanomaterials in different fields is summarized, thus demonstrating the prospects of SC CO2.







Abstract
Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2)&#8208;assisted chemical and material processing has shown great success in the fabrication of 2D amorphous materials, while the amorphization mechanism in SC CO2 is quite complicated to be understand. In this review, we introduce different kinds of 2D amorphous materials prepared with SC CO2 and discuss the possible amorphization mechanism and how they affect the structures and properties of 2D materials. Their applications are further presented and discussed. In addition, the prospective of future development of SC CO2&#8208;assisted fabrication of 2D amorphous materials is also involved. The investigation of SC CO2 induced amorphization not only provides theoretic understanding of amorphization process, but also directs to the preparation and application of 2D amorphous materials with specific structure and property, suggesting the promising future of SC CO2&#8208;assisted process in material design and engineering.

Metastases and tumor relapse are the leading causes of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. Among other approaches, much research interest has been devoted to immunogenic cell death inducing agents that are able to trigger localized cell death of the cancer cells as well as induce an immune response inside the whole organism. Herein, the application of metal complexes as immunogenic cell death triggering compounds is systematically reviewed.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Recent statistics have shown that metastases and tumor relapse are the leading causes of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. While traditional treatments are able to efficiently remove the primary tumor, secondary tumors remain poorly accessible. Capitalizing on this there is an urgent need for novel treatment modalities. Among the most promising approaches, increasing research interest has been devoted to immunogenic cell death inducing agents that are able to trigger localized cell death of the cancer cells as well as induce an immune response inside the whole organism. Preliminary studies have shown that immunogenic cell death inducing compounds could be able to overcome metastatic and relapsing tumors. Herein, the application of metal complexes as immunogenic cell death inducing compounds is systematically reviewed.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Polymerization via C&#8722;H Activation for the Synthesis of Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) via C&#8722;H activation is the latest addition in the repertoire of synthetic strategies towards conjugated polymers. This article captures the development of this polymerization strategy in the light of background small molecule reactions and highlights how its approach is greener than the previous methods. Arene&#8211;arene and arene&#8211;alkene couplings via transition metal catalysts have been explored for CDC polymerization.







Abstract
Owing to their versatile (opto)electronic properties, conjugated polymers have found application in several organic electronic devices. Cross&#8208;coupling reactions such as Stille, Suzuki, Kumada couplings, and direct arylation reactions have proved to be effective for their synthesis. More atom&#8208;efficient oxidative direct arylation polymerization has also been reported for making homopolymers. However, growing interest toward donor&#8208;acceptor polymers has led to the recent emergence of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) polymerization to synthesize alternating copolymers without any prefunctionalization of monomers. Metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two simple arenes via double C&#8722;H activation, or of an arene with an alkene via oxidative Heck&#8208;type reaction have been used so far for CDC polymerization. In this article, we discuss the development of CDC polymerization protocols along with the relevant small molecule CDC reactions for an improved understanding of these reactions.

         <title>Lipophilicity Modulations by Fluorination Correlate with Membrane Partitioning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid&#8208;state 19F MAS&#8197;NMR method was developed to accurately and easily measure water&#8208;membrane partitioning values (Kp). Given the very different octanol and membrane environments, a remarkable correlation between logKp and logP was found, but only for a given compound series. This work indicates that even minor lipophilicity modulations by aliphatic fluorination can have true relevance for the drug discovery optimization process.







Abstract
Bioactive compounds generally need to cross membranes to arrive at their site of action. The octanol&#8208;water partition coefficient (lipophilicity, logPOW) has proven to be an excellent proxy for membrane permeability. In modern drug discovery, logPOW and bioactivity are optimized simultaneously, for which fluorination is one of the relevant strategies. The question arises as to which extent the often subtle logP modifications resulting from different aliphatic fluorine&#8208;motif introductions also lead to concomitant membrane permeability changes, given the difference in molecular environment between octanol and (anisotropic) membranes. It was found that for a given compound class, there is excellent correlation between logPOW values with the corresponding membrane molar partitioning coefficients (logKp); a study enabled by novel solid&#8208;state 19F NMR MAS methodology using lipid vesicles. Our results show that the factors that cause modulation of octanol&#8208;water partition coefficients similarly affect membrane permeability.

         <title>Bifunctional NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type Reaction of 5&#8208;(Chloromethyl)furfural via Trienolate Intermediates</title>

NHC&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type reactions of 5&#8208;(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF), an important biomass&#8208;derived platform chemical, with aldimines afford chiral amines in good yields with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The use of a bifunctional NHC bearing a free hydroxy group enabled the remote addition of the trienolate intermediate to the imine to occur in a highly stereocontrolled manner.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type reactions of the biomass&#8208;derived platform compound 5&#8208;(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) with imines were developed. A series of high&#8208;value&#8208;added chiral amines were afforded in good to high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The bifunctional NHC derived from &#671;&#8208;pyroglutamic acid efficiently steered the remote addition of the trienolate intermediate to the imine in a highly stereocontrolled manner. This represents the first enantioselective reaction proceeding via an NHC&#8208;bound trienolate intermediate.

         <title>Synthesis of Erythrocyte Nanodiscs for Bacterial Toxin Neutralization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanodiscs are small discoidal lipid bilayer assemblies and represent an attractive nanomedicine platform. While most nanodiscs are made with synthetic lipid bilayers, this work reports on a nanodisc formulation made with natural human red blood cell membrane and demonstrates its robust application for bacterial toxin neutralization.







Abstract
Nanodiscs are a compelling nanomedicine platform due to their ultrasmall size and distinct disc shape. Current nanodisc formulations are made primarily with synthetic lipid bilayers and proteins. Here, we report a cellular nanodisc made with human red blood cell (RBC) membrane (denoted &#8220;RBC&#8208;ND&#8221;) and show its effective neutralization against bacterial toxins. In vitro, RBC&#8208;ND neutralizes the hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity caused by purified &#945;&#8208;toxin or complex whole secreted proteins (wSP) from methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. In vivo, RBC&#8208;ND confers significant survival benefits for mice intoxicated with &#945;&#8208;toxin or wSP in both therapeutic and prevention regimens. Moreover, RBC&#8208;ND shows good biocompatibility and biosafety in vivo. Overall, RBC&#8208;ND distinguishes itself by inheriting the biological functions of the source cell membrane for bioactivity. The design strategy of RBC&#8208;ND can be generalized to other types of cell membranes for broad applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organometallic lighthouse molecule Cp*2SiII was always the odd one out of the heavier homologues. In the solid&#8208;state counterintuitively there is a linear molecule next to two bent ones. While the latter is more stable, the linear conformer was mainly attributed to fuzzy packing effects. Now it is clear that the linearity has to be attributed to entropy in the room temperature phase while the bending is due to dispersion of the rings in the 80&#8197;K phase.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;state structure of decamethylsilicocene Cp*2Si with a bent and a linear molecule in the same unit cell was so far considered an exception in relation to the structures of its all&#8208;bent heavier analogues Cp*2E with E=Ge, Sn, Pb. Here, we present the solution to this conundrum by reporting a low&#8208;temperature phase, where all three symmetrically independent molecules are present in a bent formation. This reversible enantiotropic phase transition occurs in the temperature range between 80&#8197;K and 130&#8197;K and provides a rationale for the unexpected linear molecule based in entropy beyond hand&#8208;waving explanations such as electronic reasons or packing effects.

         <title>Synthesis of Cationic Biphen[4, 5]arenes as Biofilm Disruptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic biphen[n]arenes were designed and synthesized, which could inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate stubborn mature biofilms. Moreover, their effective complexation with the conventional antibiotic cefazolin sodium could further enhance the biofilm disruption efficacy in vitro and synergistically improve the healing effect in E.&#8197;coli&#8208;infected mice.







Abstract
Since bacteria in biofilms are inherently resistant to antibiotics and biofilm&#8208;associated infections pose a serious threat to global public health, new therapeutic agents and schemes are urgently needed to meet clinical requirements. Here two quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized biphen[n]arenes (WBPn, n=4, 5) were designed and synthesized with excellent anti&#8208;biofilm potency. Not only could they inhibit the assembly of biofilms, but also eradicate intractable mature biofilms formed by Gram&#8208;positive S.&#8197;aureus and Gram&#8208;negative E.&#8197;coli bacterial strains. Moreover, they could strongly complex a conventional antibiotic, cefazolin sodium (CFZ) with complex stability constants of (7.41&#177;0.29)&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 for CFZ/WBP4 and (4.98&#177;0.49)&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 for CFZ/WBP5. Combination of CFZ by WBP4 and WBP5 synergistically enhanced biofilm eradication performance in vitro and statistically improved healing efficacy on E.&#8197;coli&#8208;infected mice models, providing a novel supramolecular strategy for combating biofilm&#8208;associated infections.

         <title>Morphological Profiling Identifies the Motor Protein Eg5 as Cellular Target of Spirooxindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional group&#8208;controlled, RhIII&#8208;catalyzed scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis of spirooxindole&#8211;isooxindoles and spirooxindole&#8211;oxindoles in combination with unbiased morphological bioactivity profiling reveal a unique Eg5 inhibitor chemotype.







Abstract
Oxindoles and iso&#8208;oxindoles are natural product&#8208;derived scaffolds that provide inspiration for the design and synthesis of novel biologically relevant compound classes. Notably, the spirocyclic connection of oxindoles with iso&#8208;oxindoles has not been explored by nature but promises to provide structurally related compounds endowed with novel bioactivity. Therefore, methods for their efficient synthesis and the conclusive discovery of their cellular targets are highly desirable. We describe a selective RhIII&#8208;catalyzed scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis of spirooxindole&#8211;isooxindoles and spirooxindole&#8211;oxindoles from differently protected diazooxindoles and N&#8208;pivaloyloxy aryl amides which includes a functional group&#8208;controlled Lossen rearrangement as key step. Unbiased morphological profiling of a corresponding compound collection in the Cell Painting assay efficiently identified the mitotic kinesin Eg5 as the cellular target of the spirooxindoles, defining a unique Eg5 inhibitor chemotype.

         <title>Catalyst Control over Threefold Stereogenicity: Selective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Sulfones with Stereogenic C&#8722;S Axes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of catalyst control over threefold stereogenic C&#8722;S atropisomers is reported. A catalytic oxidation sequence of triptycyl thioethers via sulfoxides to sulfones with a stereogenic C(sp3)&#8722;S axis proceeds with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol, while stereodivergence was possible to address each of the three atropisomers.







Abstract
Catalyst control over higher&#8208;order stereogenicity addresses significantly extended stereochemical space, but selective methods to govern threefold stereogenic units remained elusive. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of threefold stereogenic triptycyl sulfones with atropisomerism arising from a C(sp3)&#8722;S bond. An oxidation of a stereodynamic thioether controlled by a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst allowed selective access to enantioenriched triptycyl sulfoxides. The ensuing enantiospecific and diastereoselective catalytic oxidation to a threefold stereogenic sulfone provided overall control over the stereogenic C&#8722;S axis. All three stereoisomers were addressable with enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergence and a stereoselectivity of up to (&#8722;sc):&#8201;(+sc)&#8201;:&#8201;(ap)=94&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8201;:&lt;1.

         <title>A Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for OER and ORR based on a Cobalt(II) Triazole Pyridine Bis&#8208;[Cobalt(III) Corrole] Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing the structure of the catalyst, possessing CoII and CoIII reaction centers, we achieve nearly 100&#8201;% selective activity during ORR to H2O2. Similarly, promising results are obtained when applied in OER catalysis. A relatively low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 412&#8197;mV, a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% for oxygen evolution, and an outstanding Tafel slope of 64&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 are combined with a superior stability.







Abstract
As alternative energy sources are essential to reach a climate&#8208;neutral economy, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as futuristic energy carrier gains enormous awareness. However, seeking for stable and electrochemically selective H2O2 ORR electrocatalyst is yet a challenge, making the design of&#8212;ideally&#8212;bifunctional catalysts extremely important and outmost of interest. In this study, we explore the application of a trimetallic cobalt(II) triazole pyridine bis&#8208;[cobalt(III) corrole] complex CoIITP[CoIIIC]2 3 in OER and ORR catalysis due to its remarkable physicochemical properties, fast charge transfer kinetics, electrochemical reversibility, and durability. With nearly 100&#8201;% selective catalytic activity towards the two&#8208;electron transfer generated H2O2, an ORR onset potential of 0.8&#8197;V vs RHE and a cycling stability of 50&#8201;000&#8197;cycles are detected. Similarly, promising results are obtained when applied in OER catalysis. A relatively low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 412&#8197;mV, Faraday efficiency 98&#8201;% for oxygen, an outstanding Tafel slope of 64&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 combined with superior stability.

In this study, we explore the application of a trimetallic cobalt(II) triazole pyridine bis-[cobalt(III) corrole] complex Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;TP[Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;C]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; in OER and ORR catalysis due to its remarkable physicochemical properties, fast charge transfer kinetics, electrochemical reversibility, and durability. With nearly 100&#8201;% selective catalytic activity towards the two-electron transfer generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an ORR onset potential of 0.8&#8197;V vs RHE and a cycling stability of 50&#8201;000&#8197;cycles are detected. Similarly, promising results are obtained when applied in OER catalysis. A relatively low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; of 412&#8197;mV, Faraday efficiency 98&#8201;% for oxygen, an outstanding Tafel slope of 64&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; combined with superior stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of Glutaconamides Within [2]Rotaxanes: Mechanical Bond Controlled Chemoselective Synthesis of Highly Reactive &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides and their Light&#8208;Triggered Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical interlocking of glutaconamides is crucial for their chemoselective oxidation to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. These unprecedented species were satisfactorily employed in blue&#8208;light&#8208;driven cyclizations to divergently provide hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;azetidinones or oxazolidinones through two modes of the Norrish/Yang type&#8208;II reaction. This behavior starkly differs from that of the non&#8208;interlocked substrates under the same reaction conditions.







Abstract
Glutaconamide&#8208;based [2]rotaxanes are efficiently oxidized to the respective interlocked &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, whereas their non&#8208;interlocked threads afford hydroxycyclohexene tetraamides under similar reaction conditions. These results showcase the mechanically interlocking of highly reactive substrates as a powerful tool for controlling their chemical behavior. Inside the macrocycle and under irradiation with light, the &#945;&#8208;ketoamide threads convert, in a divergent manner, into the corresponding interlocked hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams or oxazolidinones by two modes of Norrish/Yang type&#8208;II intramolecular cyclizations, processes that are efficiently chemocontrolled by the mechanical bond.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Oxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation is reported. A broad range of alkoxylated phosphinamides were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A cobalt(III) alcohol complex was prepared and characterized, and was found to be a key intermediate in this reaction. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxidation of CoIII to CoIV was facilitated by a base.







Abstract
Metalla&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H oxygenation represents one of the most straightforward and sustainable approaches to access valuable oxygenated molecules. Despite the significant advances, the development of enantioselective electrochemical C&#8722;H oxygenation reaction is very challenging and remains elusive. Herein, we described the first electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation. A broad range of enantioenriched alkoxylated phosphinamides were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). An unusual cobalt(III) alcohol complex was prepared and fully characterized, which was proven to be a key intermediate of this C&#8722;H alkoxylation reaction. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxidation of CoIII to CoIV was facilitated by a base and the whole process proceeded through a cobalt(III/IV/II) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropanes from Carbon Pronucleophiles and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for diastereoselective cyclopropanation from unactivated alkenes and acidic carbon pronucleophiles is reported. The method is scalable and amenable to synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are desirable structural motifs with valuable applications in drug discovery and beyond. Established alkene cyclopropanation methods give rise to cyclopropanes with a limited array of substituents, are difficult to scale, or both. Herein, we disclose a new cyclopropane synthesis through the formal coupling of abundant carbon pronucleophiles and unactivated alkenes. This strategy exploits dicationic adducts derived from electrolysis of thianthrene in the presence of alkene substrates. We find that these dielectrophiles undergo cyclopropanation with methylene pronucleophiles via alkenyl thianthrenium intermediates. This protocol is scalable, proceeds with high diastereoselectivity, and tolerates diverse functional groups on both the alkene and pronucleophile coupling partners. To validate the utility of this new procedure, we prepared an array of substituted analogs of an established cyclopropane that is en route to multiple pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Dimer Acceptor Adopting a Flexible Linker for Efficient and Durable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimer acceptor with flexible linker was designed and synthesized, which not only acts as the third component to enhance the intermolecular packing, but also stabilizes the morphology by suppressing the molecular diffusion. As a result, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;dT9TBO based organic solar cells exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 18.41&#8201;% with excellent thermal/photo stability and mechanical performance.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have advanced rapidly due to the development of new photovoltaic materials. However, the long&#8208;term stability of OSCs still poses a severe challenge for their commercial deployment. To address this issue, a dimer acceptor (dT9TBO) with flexible linker is developed for incorporation into small&#8208;molecule acceptors to form molecular alloy with enhanced intermolecular packing and suppressed molecular diffusion to stabilize active layer morphology. Consequently, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;dT9TBO&#8208;based device displays an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.41&#8201;% with excellent thermal stability and negligible decay after being aged at 65 &#176;C for 1800&#8197;h. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;dT9TBO&#8208;based flexible OSC also exhibits excellent mechanical durability, maintaining 95&#8201;% of its initial PCE after being bended repetitively for 1500&#8197;cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way to fine&#8208;tune the molecular packing with stabilized morphology to overcome the trade&#8208;off between OSC efficiency and stability.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical/polar crossover manifold permits annulations between allylarenes and Giese&#8208;type accepters, providing a route to functionalized tetralins. The reaction conditions are mild and therefore exhibit significant functional group tolerance. The annulation products are formally cycloadducts of styrenes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, and they can be used to form a variety of strained ring products.







Abstract
A radical/polar crossover annulation between allyl&#8208;substituted arenes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is described. Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) facilitates tandem radical C&#8722;C bond formation that generates functionalized tetralin products in the face of potentially problematic hydrofluorination, hydroalkoxylation, hydrogenation, alkene isomerization, and radical polymerization reactions. The reactions proceed under mild conditions that tolerate many functional groups, leading to a broad substrate scope. This powerful ring&#8208;forming reaction very quickly assembles complex tetralins that are the formal products of the largely infeasible Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions of styrenes.

&#8220;Experience in both catalyst and reaction design is required to solve remaining limitations and to set new standards &#8230; In contrast to previous studies, we aimed at the design of new catalysts based on data rather than on chemical intuition.&#8220; Find out more about the collaborative work in the Gessner and Goo&#223;en groups on accelerating catalyst and reaction development.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Gessner and Goo&#223;en research groups at Ruhr&#8208;University Bochum (Germany). They recently published a series of articles in Angewandte Chemie on the application of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphines (YPhos) in palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. Owing to their inherently strong sigma&#8208;donating ability and their modular synthesis, YPhos ligands can be tailored to fit the demands of various catalytic transformations. In the most recent article, machine learning methods were applied to identify a YPhos catalyst that enables the previously elusive Hiyama coupling of aryl chlorides. &#8220;Computer&#8208;Driven Development of Ylide Functionalized Phosphines for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hiyama Couplings&#8221;, J.&#8197;F.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Azahelicenes through Organocatalyzed Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed an efficient modular asymmetric synthesis of azahelicenes through an organocatalyzed asymmetric multicomponent reaction from readily available polycyclic aromatic amines, aldehydes, and (di)enamides, by employing a central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion strategy. A series of aza[5]&#8208; and aza[4]helicenes bearing various substituents were readily afforded through this one&#8208;pot sequential enantioselective Povarov reaction/oxidative aromatization process, with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The fruitful and diverse derivatizations of the chiral azahelicene products demonstrated the potential of this method, and a preliminary application of the azahelicene derivative as a chiral organocatalyst was showcased. The photophysical and chiroptical properties of these azahelicenes, particularly the acid/base&#8208;triggered switching of these properties, were also well studied, which may find potential applications in the development of novel organic optoelectronic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Role of Vacancies on the Thermoelectric Properties of EuCuSb&#8208;Eu2ZnSb2 Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AMX compounds with the ZrBeSi structure type tolerate a vacancy concentration of up to 50% on the M&#8208;site in their planar honeycomb MX&#8208;layers. Here, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermal and electronic properties across the full EuCu1&#8722;xZn0.5xSb solid solution. The transition from a fully&#8208;occupied honeycomb (EuCuSb) to one with a quarter of the atoms missing (EuZn0.5Sb) has wide&#8208;ranging structural consequences; we observe a significant non&#8208;linear expansion of the average bond lengths in the honeycomb, consistent with anion&#8208;anion repulsion, and increasing atomic displacement parameters on the M and Sb&#8208;sites. Increasing the vacancy concentration causes lattice softening and a corresponding decrease in sound velocity, as well as a rapid increase in point defect scattering, leading to a drop in room temperature lattice thermal conductivity from 3 W/mK to 0.5 W/mK. The effect of increasing Zn and vacancy concentration on the electronic properties is more nuanced, leading to a small increase in effective mass, large increase in band gap, and decrease in carrier concentration. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as the composition varies from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycosidic&#8208;bond&#8208;based mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;cleavable cross&#8208;linker has been developed that enables in vivo cross&#8208;linking for analyzing protein complexes. The MS&#8208;cleavable glycosidic bond of trehalose disuccinimidyl ester (TDS) improves the accuracy of identification while increasing the search throughput. In addition, in vivo cross&#8208;linking is enabled in the living cell microenvironment because of the high biocompatibility, bioorthogonality, and amphipathicity of TDS.







Abstract
Chemical cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (CXMS) has emerged as a powerful technology to analyze protein complexes. However, the progress of in vivo CXMS studies has been limited by cross&#8208;linking biocompatibility and data analysis. Herein, a glycosidic bond&#8208;based MS&#8208;cleavable cross&#8208;linker of trehalose disuccinimidyl ester (TDS) was designed and synthesized, which was fragmented in MS under CID/HCD to simplify the cross&#8208;linked peptides into conventional single peptides via selective cleavage between glycosidic and peptide bonds under individual MS collision energy. Consequently, the cross&#8208;linking identification accuracy and throughput were significantly enhanced, and the popular MS mode of stepped HCD was allowed. In addition, TDS showed proper cell&#8208;penetrating properties while being highly water&#8208;soluble, making it non&#8208;DMSO dependent during solubilization. Collectively, TDS provides a promising toolkit for CXMS characterization of living systems with high biocompatibility and accuracy.

         <title>Covalently Linked Hexakis(m&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Macrocycles as Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of nanotubular structures with non&#8208;deformable inner pores is of both fundamental and practical significance. Herein we report a strategy for creating molecular nanotubes with defined lengths. Macrocyclic (MC) units based on shape&#8208;persistent hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (m&#8208;PE) macrocycle MC&#8208;1, which are known to stack into hydrogen&#8208;bonded tubular assemblies, are tethered by oligo(&#946;&#8208;alanine) linkers to give tubular stacks MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 that have two and four MC units, respectively. The covalently linked MC units in MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 undergo face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking via intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions that furtherresults in the helical stacks of these compounds. Oligomer MC&#8208;4 can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60 seconds, which is among the longest open durations for synthetic ion channels, indicating that the thermodynamic stability of the self&#8208;assembling channels can be drastically enhanced by reducing the number of molecular components involved. This study demonstrates that covalently tethering shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units is a feasible and reliable approach for building molecular nanotubes that otherwise are difficult to create de novo. The extraordinarily long lifetimes of the ion channels formed by MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 suggest the likelihood of constructing the next&#8208;generation synthetic ion channels with unprecedented stability.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When early transition metal complexes are molecularly grafted onto catalyst supports, well&#8208;defined, surface&#8208;bound species are created, which are highly active and selective single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalysts (SSHCs) for diverse chemical transformations. In this minireview, we analyze and summarize a less conventional type of SSHC in which molybdenum dioxo species are grafted onto unusual carbon&#8208;unsaturated scaffolds, such as activated carbon, reduced graphene oxide, and carbon nanohorns. The choice of earth&#8208;abundant, low&#8208;toxicity, versatile metal constituents, and various carbon supports illustrates &#8220;catalyst by design&#8221; principles and yields insights into new catalytic systems of both academic and technological interest. Here, we summarize experimental and computational investigations of the bonding, electronic structure, reaction scope, and mechanistic pathways of these unusual catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organocatalyzed reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerizations (RDRPs) are attractive for many applications. Here, we developed photoredox&#8208;mediated RDRP by activating (hetero)aryl sulfonyl chloride (ArSO2Cl) initiators with pyridines and designing a novel bis(phenothiazine)arene catalyst. The in&#8208;situ formed sulfonyl pyridinium intermediates effectively promote controlled chain&#8208;growth from ArSO2Cl, enabling access to various well&#8208;defined polymers with high initiation efficiencies and controlled dispersities under mild conditions. This versatile method allows &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; temporal control, chain&#8208;extension, facile synthesis of different polymer brushes via organocatalyzed grafting reactions from linear chains. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence decay studies and calculations support the reaction mechanism. This work provides a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free RDRP to tailor polymers with readily available aromatic initiators, and will promote the design of polymerization leveraged from photoredox catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Insertion Polymerization of Ionic Monomers: Rapid Production of Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited number of methods to directly polymerize ionic monomers currently hinders rapid diversification and production of ionic polymeric materials, namely anion exchange membranes (AEMs) which are essential components in emerging alkaline fuel cell and electrolyzer technologies. Herein, we report a direct coordination&#8208;insertion polymerization of cationic monomers, providing the first direct synthesis of aliphatic polymers with high ion incorporations and allowing facile access to a broad range of materials. We demonstrate the utility of this method by rapidly generating a library of solution processable ionic polymers for use as AEMs. We investigate these materials to study the influence of cation identity on hydroxide conductivity and stability. We found that AEMs with piperidinium cations exhibited the highest performance, with high alkaline stability, hydroxide conductivity of 87 mS/cm at 80 &#176;C, and a peak power density of 730 mW/cm2 when integrated into a fuel cell device.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Monosubstituted Sulfondiimines by Metal&#8208;free Iminations of Sulfiliminium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfondiimines are marginalized entities among nitrogencontaining organosulfur compounds, despite offering promising properties for applications in various fields including medicinal and agrochemical. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid synthetic procedure for the synthesis of N&#8208;monosubstituted sulfondiimines that overcomes current limitations in their synthetic accessibility. Particularly, S,S&#8208;dialkyl substrates, which are commonly difficult to convert by existing methods, react well with a combination of iodine, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;en (DBU), and iminoiodanes (PhINR) in acetonitrile (MeCN) to furnish the corresponding sulfondiimines in yields up to 85% (25 examples). Valuable &#8220;free&#8221; NH&#8208;N&#8217;Hsulfondiimines can then be accessed by N&#8208;deprotection under mild reaction conditions. Several experimental observations suggest a mechanistic pathway diverging from the common radical&#8208;based iodine/iminoiodane mechanism. Based on the experimental results in combination with data obtained by 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, and crystallographic analysis we propose a direct amination from PhINNs and a reaction path via a cationic iodonitrene.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Blocks and COFs Formed in Concert &#8211; Three Component Synthesis of Pyrene&#8208;Fused Azaacene Covalent Organic Framework in the Bulk and as Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component synthesis methodology is described for the formation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing extended aromatics. Notably, this approach enables synthesis of the building blocks and COF along parallel reaction landscapes, on a similar timeframe. The use of fragmental building block components, namely pyrene dione diboronic acid as aggregation&#8208;inducing COF precursor and the diamines o&#8209;phenylenediamine (Ph), 2,3&#8209;diaminonaphthalene (Naph), or (1R,2R)&#8209;(+)&#8209;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine (2Ph) as extending functionalization units in conjunction with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene, resulted in the formation of the corresponding pyrene&#8208;fused azaacene, i.e., Aza&#8208;COF series with full conversion of the dione moiety, long&#8208;range order, and high surface area. In addition, the novel three&#8208;component synthesis was successfully applied to produce highly crystalline, oriented thin films of the Aza&#8208;COFs with nanostructured surfaces on various substrates. The Aza&#8209;COFs exhibit light absorption maxima in the blue spectral region, and each Aza&#8208;COF presents a distinct photoluminescence profile. Transient absorption measurements of Aza&#8208;Ph&#8208; and Aza&#8209;Naph&#8208;COFs suggest the occurrence of charge transfer processes within these COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Formal &#946;&#8208;Allylation of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Cooperative Nickel and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction between carbonyl compounds and allylic precursors has been widely used in the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. As the &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond is far more acidic than the &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond, carbonyl compounds undergo highly regioselective allylation at the &#945;&#8208;position and their &#946;&#8208;allylation is therefore highly challenging. This innate &#945;&#8208;reactivity conversely hampers diversity, especially if the corresponding &#946;&#8208;allylation product is targeted. Herein, we present a formal intermolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;C bond formation reaction of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with different allyl electrophiles through cooperative nickel and photoredox catalysis. &#946;&#8208;Selectivity is achieved via initial transformation of the aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding silyl enol ethers. The overall transformation features mild conditions, excellent regioselectivity, wide functional group tolerance and high reaction efficiency. The introduced facile and regioselective &#946;&#8208;allylation of carbonyl compounds proceeding through cooperative catalysis allows the preparation of valuable building blocks that are difficult to access from aldehydes and ketones using existing methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Maldistribution of Chemical Bond Strength Inducing Exceptional Anisotropy of Thermal Conductivity in Non&#8208;layered Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the efforts to find materials with high &#954; anisotropy ratios mainly focus on layered materials, however, the limited quantity and lower workability comparing to non&#8208;layered ones boost the exploration of non&#8208;layered materials with high &#954; anisotropy ratios. Here, taking PbSnS3, a typical non&#8208;layered orthorhombic compound, as an example, we propose that maldistribution of chemical bond strength can lead to large anisotropy of &#954; in non&#8208;layered materials. Our result reveals that the maldistribution of Pb&#8208;S bonds lead to obvious collective vibrations of dioctahedron chain units, resulting in an anisotropy ratio up to 7.1 at 200 K and 5.5 at 300 K, respectively, which is one of the highest ever reported in non&#8208;layered materials and even surpasses many classical layered materials such as Bi2Te3 and SnSe. Our findings can not only broaden the horizon for exploring high anisotropic &#954; materials but also provide new opportunities for the application of thermal management.</dc:description>

         <title>The Nephelauxetic Effect Becomes an Important Design Factor for Photoactive First&#8208;Row Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nephelauxetic (cloud&#8208;expanding) effect emerges from covalent character in the chemical bonds between a transition metal (TM) and its coordinated ligands. It alters the repulsion between individual d&#8208;electrons, and this can change the electronic structure of the complex. Now, it becomes increasingly clear how this effect can be used to tune the photophysical and photochemical behavior of coordination compounds made from Earth&#8208;abundant TMs.







Abstract
The expansion of d&#8208;orbitals as a result of metal&#8208;ligand bond covalence, the so&#8208;called nephelauxetic effect, is a well&#8208;established concept of coordination chemistry, yet its importance for the design of new photoactive complexes based on first&#8208;row transition metals is only beginning to be recognized. Until recently, much focus has been on optimizing the ligand field strength, coordination geometries, and molecular rigidity, but now it becomes evident that the nephelauxetic effect can be a game changer regarding the photophysical properties of 3d metal complexes in solution at room temperature. In CrIII and MnIV complexes with the d3 valence electron configuration, the nephelauxetic effect was exploited to shift the well&#8208;known ruby&#8208;like red luminescence to the near&#8208;infrared spectral region. In FeII and CoIII complexes with the low&#8208;spin d6 electron configuration, charge&#8208;transfer excited states were stabilized with respect to detrimental metal&#8208;centered excited states, to improve their properties and to enhance their application potential. In isoelectronic (3d6) isocyanide complexes of Cr0 and MnI, the nephelauxetic effect is likely at play as well, enabling luminescence and other favorable photoreactivity. This minireview illustrates the broad applicability of the nephelauxetic effect in tailoring the photophysical and photochemical properties of new coordination compounds made from abundant first&#8208;row transition metals.

         <title>Combining MN6 Octahedra and PN5 Trigonal Bipyramids in the Mica&#8208;like Nitridophosphates MP6N11 (M=Al, In)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered silicate minerals are extremely versatile. The mica&#8208;like nitrides MP6N11 (M=Al, In) presented herein, containing the rare structural motifs of PN5 trigonal pyramids and MN6 octahedra, expand the sparse topic of nitridic layered silicate analogues. This opens a new field of research mimicking natural abundant minerals, promising a vast amount of new nitrides with intriguing materials properties.







Abstract
Layered silicates are a very versatile class of materials with high importance to humanity. The new nitridophosphates MP6N11 (M=Al, In), synthesized from MCl3, P3N5 and NH4N3 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction at 1100&#8201;&#176;C and 8&#8197;GPa, show a mica&#8208;like layer setup and feature rare nitrogen coordination motifs. The crystal structure of AlP6N11 was elucidated from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal diffraction data (space group Cm (no. 8), a=4.9354(10), b=8.1608(16), c=9.0401(18)&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=98.63(3)&#176;), enabling Rietveld refinement of isotypic InP6N11. It is built up from layers of PN4 tetrahedra, PN5 trigonal bipyramids and MN6 octahedra. PN5 trigonal bipyramids have been reported only once and MN6 octahedra are sparsely found in the literature. AlP6N11 was further characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX), IR and NMR spectroscopy. Despite the vast amount of known layered silicates, there is no isostructural compound to MP6N11 as yet.

The mica-like nitrides &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;=Al, In) presented herein, containing the rare structural motifs of PN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; trigonal pyramids and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra, expand the sparse topic of nitridic layered silicate analogues. This opens a new field of research mimicking natural abundant minerals, promising a vast amount of new nitrides with intriguing materials properties.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered silicates are a very versatile class of materials with high importance to humanity. The new nitridophosphates &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;=Al, In), synthesized from &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in a high-pressure high-temperature reaction at 1100&#8201;&#176;C and 8&#8197;GPa, show a mica-like layer setup and feature rare nitrogen coordination motifs. The crystal structure of AlP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; was elucidated from synchrotron single-crystal diffraction data (space group &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; (no. 8), &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;=4.9354(10), &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;=8.1608(16), &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;=9.0401(18)&#8197;&#197;, &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;=98.63(3)&#176;), enabling Rietveld refinement of isotypic InP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;. It is built up from layers of PN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra, PN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; trigonal bipyramids and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra. PN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; trigonal bipyramids have been reported only once and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra are sparsely found in the literature. AlP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; was further characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), IR and NMR spectroscopy. Despite the vast amount of known layered silicates, there is no isostructural compound to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; as yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction for Preparing Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was developed to construct a fused multicyclic linkage with high rigidity and a large contortion. A novel stoichiometric imbalance&#8208;promoted step&#8208;growth polymerization was developed based on this reaction to prepare PIMs with high molecular weights, high specific surface areas, and H2 separation performance.







Abstract
It is a formidable challenge in polycondensation to simultaneously construct multiple covalent bonds to prepare double&#8208;stranded polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with fused multicyclic linkages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction for successfully preparing double&#8208;stranded PIMs with fused multicyclic backbone structures. A self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was developed based on the [4+2] cycloaddition of sym&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;3,7&#8208;diyne (DIBOD) and ortho&#8208;quinone compounds. In this reaction, the cycloaddition of ortho&#8208;quinone with the first alkyne of DIBOD activates the second alkyne, which reacts with ortho&#8208;quinone at a rate constant 192 times larger than that of the original alkyne. Using this self&#8208;accelerating reaction to polymerize DIBOD and spirocyclic/cyclic difunctional ortho&#8208;quinone monomers, a novel stoichiometric imbalance&#8208;promoted step&#8208;growth polymerization method was developed to prepare PIMs. The resultant PIMs possess intrinsic ultramicropores with pore sizes between 0.45 to 0.7&#8197;nm, high specific surface areas above 646&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and good H2 separation performance.

         <title>Minimizing Temperature Bias through Reliable Temperature Determination in Gas&#8208;Solid Photothermal Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of temperature determination bias in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic reactions was systematically uncovered. Further, a universal protocol was developed, including the reasonable system optimization for ameliorating the temperature distribution and temperature control of the catalyst layer, accompanied by cross&#8208;corroboration of multiple thermometry for reliable temperature assessment in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalysis.







Abstract
Enormous advances in photothermal catalysis have been made over the years, whereas the temperature assessment still remains controversial in the majority of photothermal catalytic systems. Herein, we methodically uncovered the phenomenon of temperature determination bias arising from prominent temperature differences in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic systems, which extensively existed yet has been overlooked in most relevant cases. To avoid the interference of temperature bias, we developed a universal protocol for reliable temperature evaluation of gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic reactions, with emphasis on eliminating the temperature gradient and temperature fluctuation of catalyst layer via optimizing the reaction system. This work presents a functional and credible practice for temperature detection, calling attention to addressing the effects of temperature differences, and reassessing the actual temperature&#8208;based performances in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalysis.

         <title>Shape&#8208; and Size&#8208;Tunable Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages through Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have established the Rh&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;yielding and highly 1,3,5&#8208;selective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of push&#8208;pull internal alkynes. This reaction allows for the shape&#8208; and size&#8208;tunable synthesis of covalent organic cages (aryl ether cages) using push&#8208;pull internal diynes. Some aryl ether cages encapsulated isolated water molecules in their hydrophobic cavity by hydrogen bonding with the multiple ester moieties.







Abstract
Covalent organic cages have potential applications in molecular inclusion/recognition and porous organic crystals. Bridging arene units with sp3 atoms enables facile construction of rigid isolated internal vacancies, and various prismatic arene cages have been synthesized by kinetically controlled covalent bond formation. However, the synthesis of a tetrahedral one, which requires twice as much bond formation as prismatic ones, has been limited to a thermodynamically controlled dynamic SNAr reaction, and this reversible covalent bond formation made the resulting cage product chemically unstable. Here we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;yielding and highly 1,3,5&#8208;selective room temperature [2+2+2] cycloaddition of push&#8208;pull alkynes and its application to the synthesis of chemically stable aryl ether cages of various shapes and sizes, including prismatic and tetrahedral forms. These aryl ether cages are highly crystalline and intertwine with each other to form regular packing structures. Some aryl ether cages encapsulated isolated water molecules in their hydrophobic cavity by hydrogen bonding with the multiple ester moieties.

         <title>Electrode&#8208;Potential&#8208;Driven Dissociation of N&#8208;Heterocycle/BF3 Adducts: A Possible Manifestation of the Electro&#8208;Inductive Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a non&#8208;redox fashion, applied potential dissociates acid&#8208;base N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;BF3 couples in the diffusion layer near an electrode. This effect was probed using scanning electrochemical microscopy and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Recently, non&#8208;Faradaic effects were used to modify the electronic structure and reactivity of electrode&#8208;bound species. We hypothesize that these electrostatic perturbations could influence the chemical reactivity of electrolyte species near an electrode in the absence of Faradaic electron transfer. A prime example of non&#8208;Faradaic effects is acid&#8208;base dissociation near an interface. Here, we probed the near&#8208;electrode dissociation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;BF3 Lewis adducts upon electrode polarization, well outside of the redox potential window of the adducts. Using scanning electrochemical microscopy and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy, we detected a potential&#8208;dependent depletion of the adduct near the electrode. We propose an electro&#8208;inductive effect where a more positive potential leads to electron withdrawal on the N&#8208;heterocycle. This study takes a step forward in the use of electrostatics at electrochemical interfaces for field&#8208;driven electrocatalytic and electro&#8208;synthetic processes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art of rational design in photopharmacology is analyzed with a focus on E&#8208;Z molecular photoswitches and on computer&#8208;aided approaches. By meticulously examining the design strategies of photopharmacology through the lens of medicinal chemistry, this review identifies existing trends and novel opportunities for the development of photoswitchable ligands.







Abstract
Photopharmacology is an attractive approach for achieving targeted drug action with the use of light. In photopharmacology, molecular photoswitches are introduced into the structure of biologically active small molecules to allow for the optical control of their potency. Going beyond trial and error, photopharmacology has progressively applied rational drug design methodologies to devise light&#8208;controlled bioactive ligands. In this review, we categorize photopharmacological efforts from the standpoint of medicinal chemistry strategies, focusing on diffusible photochromic ligands modified with photoswitches that operate through E&#8208;Z bond isomerization. In the vast majority of cases, photoswitchable ligands are designed as analogs of existing compounds, through a variety of approaches. By analyzing in detail a comprehensive list of instructive examples, we describe the state of the art and discuss future opportunities for rational design in photopharmacology.

         <title>Performance&#8208;Advantaged Stereoregular Recyclable Plastics Enabled by Aluminum&#8208;Catalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Dithiolactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum complexes have appropriate binding affinity with sulfide propagating species, avoiding catalyst poisoning and minimizing epimerization reactions. By proper ligand design and modification, the aluminum catalysts enabled the production of highly isotactic, stereocomplexed polythioester. The obtained dithiolactone&#8208;based plastic is a tough semicrystalline material, and exhibits complete recyclability.







Abstract
Chemically recyclable polymers that can depolymerize into their constituent monomers are attractive candidates to replace non&#8208;recyclable petroleum&#8208;derived plastics. However, the physical properties and mechanical strengths of depolymerizable polymers are commonly insufficient for practical applications. Here we demonstrate that by proper ligand design and modification, aluminum complexes can catalyse stereoretentive ring&#8208;opening polymerization of dithiolactone, yielding highly isotactic polythioesters with molar masses up to 45.5&#8197;kDa. This material can form crystalline stereocomplex with a Tm of 94.5&#8201;&#176;C, and exhibits mechanical performances comparable to petroleum&#8208;based low density polyethylene. Exposure of the polythioester to aluminum precatalyst used to synthesized it resulted in depolymerization to pristine chiral dithiolactone. Experimental and computational studies suggest that aluminum complexes have appropriate binding affinity with sulfide propagating species, thereby avoiding catalyst poisoning and minimizing epimerization reactions, which has not been accessible using other metal catalysts. Overall, aluminum catalysis provides access to performance&#8208;advantaged stereoregular recyclable plastics as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, thus incentivizing improved plastic sustainability.

         <title>DOPA Residues Endow Collagen with Radical Scavenging Capacity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;bound dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) is a component of tendon and meniscus tissue and originates from tyrosine oxidation. Both in situ and in vitro, DOPA proved to be a highly efficient radical scavenger, with the products of radical degradation being hydrogen peroxide and DOPA quinone. Thus, we suggest that the DOPA pathway is part of a tissue&#8208;inherent redox buffer system.







Abstract
Here we uncover collagen, the main structural protein of all connective tissues, as a redox&#8208;active material. We identify dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) residues, post&#8208;translational oxidation products of tyrosine residues, to be common in collagen derived from different connective tissues. We observe that these DOPA residues endow collagen with substantial radical scavenging capacity. When reducing radicals, DOPA residues work as redox relay: they convert to the quinone and generate hydrogen peroxide. In this dual function, DOPA outcompetes its amino acid precursors and ascorbic acid. Our results establish DOPA residues as redox&#8208;active side chains of collagens, probably protecting connective tissues against radicals formed under mechanical stress and/or inflammation.

         <title>Regioselective Difunctionalization and Annulation of Ynamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ynamides, a class of unsymmetrical electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;bearing alkynes, have attracted considerable attention for regioselective synthesis applications to build highly functionalized heterocycles. In this review, a concise, yet detailed and thoroughly discussed overview of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalizations and annulations strategies applied to ynamides including intermolecular difunctionalizations, cyclizations, and radical&#8208;transformations is provided.







Abstract
The use of ynamides in organic synthesis has gained significant attention due to their ability to provide access to complex molecular structures through transformations such as 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization and annulation reactions. These reactions enable the formation of highly functionalized N&#8208;bearing olefins and unusual N&#8208;bearing heterocycles. In this minireview, we present a systematic overview of the regioselective difunctionalization and annulation reactions of ynamides. We discuss the multi&#8208;component reactions, and radical&#8208;triggered functionalizations across the ynamides carbon&#8211;carbon multiple bonds and the use of bifunctional reagents in annulation of ynamides, highlighting their potential in expanding the substrate scope. Furthermore, we provide insights into the mechanistic breakthroughs that have been achieved in recent years in the development of these reactions. Finally, we emphasize the promising future prospects of ynamides as versatile building blocks for the synthesis of complex molecular architectures.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Response with Radical Afterglow by Regulation of Spin Populations and Hole&#8208;Electron Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive radical materials with afterglow were developed. Spin populations and hole&#8208;electron analyses revealed that appropriate introduction of carboxylic groups to three nonadjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring was the best for stability and electronic transitions of cyclohexadienyl&#8208;type radicals. Further on, the stimulus&#8208;responsive behaviors and multistage energy transfers were fully explored to expand the radical emisison property.







Abstract
No matter photoinduced organic radicals have been reported frequently, they are usually non&#8208;luminescent at ambient conditions. The internal mechanism on stability and electronic transitions of photoinduced radicals, is thus crucial for the development of relevant materials. Herein, a series of photoinduced radical emission systems were developed conveniently through doping benzoic acids into the hydrogen donor polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. Visual photoinduced radical emission and photochromism could be observed on Ph&#8208;3COOH@PVA film with the formation of cyclohexadienyl&#8208;type structure. For the first time, radical afterglow appeared with energy transfer from triplet state. The appropriate introduction of carboxylic groups to three nonadjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring was the best for decreasing spin population and promoting electronic transitions of the radical. This study largely expands the radical emission property from both internal mechanism and practical application.

         <title>The Telluraboranes closo&#8208;TeB5Cl5 and closo&#8208;TeB11Cl11 with Exceptionally Long Body Diagonals: Synthetic and Bonding Motifs for Innovative Octahedral and Icosahedral Geometries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the first small&#8208;sized polyhedral telluraborane, i.e. closo&#8208;TeB5Cl5, has been achieved in a two&#8208;component, one&#8208;pot thermal reaction of diboron tetrachloride and tellurium tetrachloride. The co&#8208;pyrolysis also generates the icosahedral closo&#8208;TeB11Cl11. The assembly of electron&#8208;deficient polyhedral frameworks from small, electron&#8208;precise precursory molecules provides a unique entry into the field of heteroatom&#8208;containing boranes.







Abstract
Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;TeB5Cl5 (1) and twelve&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;TeB11Cl11 (2) telluraboranes have been prepared via co&#8208;pyrolysis of B2Cl4 with TeCl4 in vacuo at temperatures between 360&#8201;&#176;C and 400&#8201;&#176;C. Both compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids, and they have been characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B&#8197;NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectroscopy. Both ab initio/GIAO/NMR and DFT/ZORA/NMR computations support octahedral and icosahedral geometries for 1 and 2, respectively, as expected due to their closo&#8208;electron counts. The octahedral structure of 1 has been confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction on an incommensurately modulated crystal. The corresponding bonding properties have been analyzed in terms of the intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) approach. 1 is the first example of a polyhedral telluraborane with a cluster size smaller than 10 vertices.

&lt;p&gt;Six-vertex &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-TeB&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and twelve-vertex &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-TeB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) telluraboranes have been prepared via co-pyrolysis of B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with TeCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in vacuo at temperatures between 360&#8201;&#176;C and 400&#8201;&#176;C. Both compounds are sublimable, off-white solids, and they have been characterized by one- and two-dimensional &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B&#8197;NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy. Both ab initio/GIAO/NMR and DFT/ZORA/NMR computations support octahedral and icosahedral geometries for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, respectively, as expected due to their &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-electron counts. The octahedral structure of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; has been confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction on an incommensurately modulated crystal. The corresponding bonding properties have been analyzed in terms of the intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) approach. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is the first example of a polyhedral telluraborane with a cluster size smaller than 10 vertices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mercaptoamine&#8208;assisted Post&#8208;encapsulation of Metal Nanoparticles within Preformed Zeolites and their Analogues for Hydroisomerization and Methane Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general synthetic strategy for the post&#8208;encapsulating of metal nanoparticles within preformed zeolites by using 2&#8208;aminoethanethiol as the bi&#8208;grafting agent. Thiol groups are coordinated to metal centers, whereas amine moieties are dynamically attached to micropore walls via acid&#8208;base interactions. The zeolite&#8208;encapsulated catalysts demonstrated high resistance to sintering and fouling in hydroisomerization and methane decomposition.







Abstract
We report a general synthetic strategy for post&#8208;encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within preformed zeolites using post&#8208;synthetic modification. Both anionic and cationic precursors to metal nanoparticle are supported on 8&#8208; and 10&#8208;membered ring zeolites and analogues during wet impregnation using 2&#8208;aminoethanethiol (AET) as a bi&#8208;grafting agent. Thiol groups are coordinated to metal centers, whereas amine moieties are dynamically attached to micropore walls via acid&#8208;base interactions. The dynamic acid&#8208;base interactions cause the even distribution of the metal&#8208;AET complex throughout the zeolite matrix. These processes encapsulate Au, Rh, and Ni precursors within the CHA, *MRE, MFI zeolite, and SAPO&#8208;34 zeolite analogues, for which small channel apertures preclude the post&#8208;synthesis impregnation of metal precursors. Sequential activation forms small and uniform nanoparticles (1&#8211;2.5&#8197;nm in diameter), as confirmed through electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Containment within the small micropores protected the nanoparticles against harsh thermal sintering conditions and prevented the fouling of the metal surface by coke, thus resulting in a high catalytic performance in n&#8208;dodecane hydroisomerization and methane decomposition. The remarkable specificity of the thiol to metal precursors and the dynamic acid&#8208;base interaction make these protocols extendable to various metal&#8208;zeolite systems, suitable for shape&#8208;selective catalysts in challenging chemical environments.

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Exchange by Homogeneous Iridium Catalysis in Aqueous Buffers with Deuterium or Tritium Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed, highly selective, hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) in water or buffers is a new powerful tool for deuterium or tritium labelling of highly polar compounds and aqueous formulated targets.







Abstract
We have studied the highly selective homogeneous iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) with deuterium or tritium gas as an isotope source in water and buffers. With an improved water&#8208;soluble Kerr&#8208;type catalyst, we have achieved the first insight into applying HIE reactions in aqueous media with varying pH. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations gave consistent insights in the calculated energies of transition states and coordination complexes, further explaining the observed reactivity and guidance on the scope and limitations for HIE reactions in water. Finally, we successfully adapted these findings to tritium chemistry.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lucidumone through Convenient One&#8208;pot Preparation of the Tetracyclic Skeleton by Claisen Rearrangement and Subsequent Intramolecular Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique strategy for the synthesis of lucidumone is described. Key transformation is a one&#8208;pot construction of a complex tetracyclic skeleton using a sequential Claisen rearrangement and an intramolecular aldol reaction. Other key features are stereocontrolled manipulations of functional groups on the bicyclo structure and efficient ether cyclization. An enantioselective synthesis is also described via a chiral transfer strategy in the Claisen rearrangement.







Abstract
The total synthesis of lucidumone (1), a Ganoderma meroterpenoid, was accomplished in racemic form from easily prepared 6 and 7 in 10 steps as the longest linear sequence. The synthesis was completed through one&#8208;pot preparation of the tetracyclic core skeleton by Claisen rearrangement followed by an intramolecular aldol reaction. The intramolecular aldol reaction allowed for the stereocontrolled construction of the bicyclo [2.2.2] octane skeleton fused to an indanone structure. The enantioselective total synthesis of 1 was also described via a chiral transfer strategy in the Claisen rearrangement.

         <title>Efficient Transformation of Polymer Main Chain Catalyzed by Macrocycle Metal Complexes via Pseudorotaxane Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthesis modification of polymers streamlines the synthesis of functionalized polymers, but is often incomplete due to the negative polymer effect. Here, we show macrocycle&#8208;metal&#8208;copmplex&#8208;catalyzed systems for efficient transformation of main chain in polymer substrate, whereby higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers reach completion faster. Mechanistic studies suggest the reactions proceed via the formation of a pseudorotaxane intermediate.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthesis modification of polymers streamlines the synthesis of functionalized polymers, but is often incomplete due to the negative polymer effects. Developing efficient polymer reactions in artificial systems thus represents a long&#8208;standing objective in the fields of polymer and material science. Here, we show unprecedented macrocycle&#8208;metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed systems for efficient polymer reaction that result in 100&#8201;% transformation of the main chain functional groups presumably via a processive mode reaction. The complete polymer reactions were confirmed in not only intramolecular reaction (hydroamination) but also intermolecular reaction (hydrosilylation) by using Pd&#8208; and Pt&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;catalyzed systems. The most fascinating feature of the both reactions is that higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers reach completion faster. Various studies suggested that the reactions occur in the catalyst cavity via the formation of a supramolecular complex between the macrocycle catalyst and polymer substrate like pseudorotaxane, which should be of characteristic of the efficient polymer reactions progressing in a processive mode.

         <title>Photocatalysis as an Effective Tool for Upcycling Polymers into Value&#8208;Added Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis has recently evolved to a powerful tool to convert plastics directly into value&#8208;added organic molecules. Researchers developed distinct light&#8208;driven depolymerization strategies for various polymers, ranging from hydroxylated (bio)polymers to real&#8208;life polystyrene. These methods operate under mild conditions, show high efficiency, and thus constitute a promising alternative to traditional recycling methods.







Abstract
Shaping a sustainable future is closely tied to the development of advanced plastic recycling technologies. As global recycling rates remain low, the lion's share of post&#8208;consumer plastics is either incinerated or disposed of in landfills. This unbalanced plastic waste management not only poses severe environmental risks, but also entails an irrevocable loss of chemical resources that are embedded in synthetic polymers. To give plastic waste a new life, a series of photocatalytic methods has recently been reported that convert polymers directly into value&#8208;added organic molecules. These approaches operate at ambient temperature, show high reactivity/selectivity, and provide alternative reaction pathways as compared to thermal depolymerizations. This Minireview highlights the scientific breakthroughs in upcycling polymers through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysis under environmentally benign conditions.

         <title>Cooperative Sensitization Upconversion in Solution Dispersions of Co&#8208;Crystal Assemblies of Mononuclear Yb3+ and Eu3+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;crystal assemblies of mononuclear Yb3+ and Eu3+ complexes enable cooperative sensitization upconversion from Eu3+ in non&#8208;deuterated solution dispersions. Upconversion quantum yields of 0.67&#8201;% were obtained under 980&#8197;nm excitation.







Abstract
Lanthanide upconversion luminescence in nanoparticles has prompted continuous breakthroughs in information storage, temperature sensing, and biomedical applications, among others. Achieving upconversion luminescence at the molecular scale is still a critical challenge in modern chemistry. In this work, we explored the upconversion luminescence of solution dispersions of co&#8208;crystals composed of discrete mononuclear Yb(DBM)3Bpy and Eu(DBM)3Bpy complexes (DBM: dibenzoylmethane, Bpy: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine). The 613&#8197;nm emission of Eu3+ was observed under excitation of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm. From the series of molecular assemblies studied, the most intense luminescence was obtained for a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio of Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;Eu3+, resulting in a high quantum yield of 0.67&#8201;% at 2.1&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The structure and energy transfer mechanism of the assemblies were fully characterized. This is the first example of an Eu3+&#8208;based upconverting system composed of two discrete mononuclear lanthanide complexes present as co&#8208;crystals in non&#8208;deuterated solution.

         <title>Reversible Ammonium Ion Intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation with Crystal Water Promotion Effect in Layered VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O with a layered framework and two&#8208;dimensional channels has been demonstrated as the high&#8208;performance cathode material for aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion batteries, which delivered very stable discharge potential plateau at 0.4&#8197;V and a high specific capacity of 154.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The crystal water in the layered host plays a key role in the structural stability and significantly promotes the NH4+ ion storage behavior.







Abstract
The non&#8208;metal NH4+ carrier has attracted tremendous interests for aqueous energy storage owing to its light molar mass and fast diffusion in aqueous electrolytes. Previous study inferred that NH4+ ion storage in layered VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O is impossible due to the removal of NH4+ from NH4VOPO4 leads to a phase change inevitably. Herein, we update this cognition and demonstrated highly reversible intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation behavior of NH4+ in layered VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O host. Satisfactory specific capacity of 154.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and very stable discharge potential plateau at 0.4&#8197;V based on reference electrode was achieved in VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O. A rocking&#8208;chair ammonium&#8208;ion full cell with the VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O//2.0&#8197;M NH4OTf//PTCDI configuration exhibited a specific capacity of 55&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, an average operating voltage of about 1.0&#8197;V and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability over 500&#8197;cycles with a coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99&#8201;%. Theoretical DFT calculations suggest a unique crystal water substitution process by ammonium ion during the intercalation process. Our results provide new insight into the intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of NH4+ ions in layered hydrated phosphates through crystal water enhancement effect.

         <title>Insights into the Oxidative Degradation Mechanism of Solid Amine Sorbents for CO2 Capture from Air: Roles of Atmospheric Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Processes for direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 uniquely operate outdoors in different weather conditions. The oxidative stability of amine&#8208;based sorbents is a critical parameter with economic and environmental impacts on DAC processes. Here we elucidate the impact of ubiquitous atmospheric water vapor on the oxidative stability of DAC sorbents, providing insights into the design of robust sorbents for the practical deployment of DAC technology.







Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) processes for extraction of CO2 from ambient air are unique among chemical processes in that they operate outdoors with minimal feed pretreatments. Here, the impact of humidity on the oxidative degradation of a prototypical solid supported amine sorbent, poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) supported on Al2O3, is explored in detail. By combining CO2 adsorption measurements, oxidative degradation rates, elemental analyses, solid&#8208;state NMR and in situ IR spectroscopic analysis in conjunction with 18O labeling of water, a comprehensive picture of sorbent oxidation is achieved under accelerated conditions. We demonstrated that the presence of water vapor can play an important role in accelerating the degradation reactions. From the study we inferred the identity and kinetics of formation of the major oxidative products, and the role(s) of humidity. Our data are consistent with a radical mediated autooxidative degradation mechanism.

         <title>Peroxygenase&#8208;Catalysed Selective Oxidation of Silanes to Silanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) efficiently hydroxylates organosilanes to the corresponding silanols. The methodology proposed here excels by its simplicity and high productivity. Protein Energy Landscape Exploration (PELE) simulations provide a rationale for the selectivities observed and put the basis for future AaeUPO engineering.







Abstract
A peroxygenase&#8208;catalysed hydroxylation of organosilanes is reported. The recombinant peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) enabled efficient conversion of a broad range of silane starting materials in attractive productivities (up to 300&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1), catalyst performance (up to 84&#8197;s&#8722;1 and more than 120&#8201;000 catalytic turnovers). Molecular modelling of the enzyme&#8208;substrate interaction puts a basis for the mechanistic understanding of AaeUPO selectivity.

         <title>Multi&#8208;layer 3D Chirality and Double&#8208;Helical Assembly in a Copper Nanocluster with a Triple&#8208;Helical Cu15 Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;precise copper nanocluster containing a chiral triple&#8208;stranded helical core has been synthesized and structurally characterized. The nanocluster shows unique multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality and assembles into double&#8208;helical secondary structure with emergent distinct optical and catalytic properties.







Abstract
Conceptually mimicking biomolecules&#8217; ability to construct multiple&#8208;helical aggregates with emergent properties and functions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here we report an atom&#8208;precise 18&#8208;copper nanocluster (NC), Cu18H(PET)14(TPP)6(NCS)3 (Cu18H) which contains a pseudo D3&#8208;symmetrical triple&#8208;helical Cu15 core. Structurally, Cu18H may be also viewed as sandwich type of sulfur&#8208;bridged chiral copper cluster units [Cu6&#8722;Cu6&#8722;Cu6], endowing three&#8208;layered 3D chirality. More importantly, the chiral NCs are aggregated into an infinite double&#8208;stranded helix supported by intra&#8208;strand homonuclear C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C dihydrogen contacts and inter&#8208;strand C&#8722;H/&#960; and C&#8722;H/S interactions. The unique multi&#8208;layered 3D chirality and the double&#8208;helical assembly of Cu18H are evocative of DNA. Moreover, the collective behaviours of the aggregated NCs not only exhibit crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) effects in the deep&#8208;red region, but also efficiently catalyze electron transfer (ET) reaction. This study thus presents that hierarchical assemblies of atomically defined copper NCs could be intricate as observed for important biomolecules like DNA with emergent properties arising from aggregated behaviours.

         <title>Supercooled Liquids with Dynamic Room Temperature Phosphorescence Using Terminal Hydroxyl Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise strategy to develop a series of stable supercooled liquids (SCLs) is presented. The SCLs exhibit repeatable dynamic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence behavior by alternating stimulation with UV light and heat. This unique luminescence behavior is applied to demonstrate erasable data encryption and patterns on flexible substrates.







Abstract
Dynamic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have potential applications in optoelectronics, which inevitably suffer from poor processability, flexibility or stretchability. Herein, we report a concise strategy to develop supercooled liquids (SCLs) with dynamic RTP behavior using terminal hydroxyl engineering. The terminal hydroxyls effectively hinder the nucleation process of molecules for the formation of stable SCLs after thermal annealing. Impressively, the SCLs show reversible RTP emission via alternant stimulation by UV light and heat. Photoactivated SCLs have phosphorescent efficiency of 8.50&#8201;% and a lifetime of 31.54&#8197;ms under ambient conditions. Regarding the dynamic RTP behavior and stretchability of SCLs, we demonstrate the applications in erasable data encryption and patterns on flexible substrates. This finding provides a design principle for obtaining SCLs with RTP and expands the potential applications of RTP materials in flexible optoelectronics.

         <title>Intermolecular Enantioselective Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination by Cationic Copper Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective intermolecular benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond amination by using a chiral cationic copper catalyst and oxidant di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide is reported. This mild, straightforward method can be used to transform an array of feedstock alkylarenes and amides into chiral amines with high enantioselectivities, and it has good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Chiral benzylic amines are privileged motifs in pharmacologically active molecules. Intramolecular enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer has emerged as a straightforward, powerful tool for the synthesis of chiral amines, but methods for intermolecular enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amination remain elusive. Herein, we report a cationic copper catalytic system for intermolecular enantioselective benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H amination with peroxide as an oxidant. This mild, straightforward method can be used to transform an array of feedstock alkylarenes and amides into chiral amines with high enantioselectivities, and it has good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. More importantly, it can be used to synthesize bioactive molecules, including chiral drugs. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the amination reaction involves benzylic radicals generated by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Not So Innocent After All: Interfacial Chemistry Determines Charge&#8208;Transport Efficiency in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial chemistry of a single&#8208;molecule junction plays a pivotal role in determining the final charge&#8208;transport efficiency. Internal charge reorganisation is responsible for the observed behaviour, and the results provide a general, intuitive strategy for the structural design of efficient molecular wires.







Abstract
Most studies in molecular electronics focus on altering the molecular wire backbone to tune the electrical properties of the whole junction. However, it is often overlooked that the chemical structure of the groups anchoring the molecule to the metallic electrodes influences the electronic structure of the whole system and, therefore, its conductance. We synthesised electron&#8208;accepting dithienophosphole oxide derivatives and fabricated their single&#8208;molecule junctions. We found that the anchor group has a dramatic effect on charge&#8208;transport efficiency: in our case, electron&#8208;deficient 4&#8208;pyridyl contacts suppress conductance, while electron&#8208;rich 4&#8208;thioanisole termini promote efficient transport. Our calculations show that this is due to minute changes in charge distribution, probed at the electrode interface. Our findings provide a framework for efficient molecular junction design, especially valuable for compounds with strong electron withdrawing/donating backbones.

         <title>Enhancing Carrier Transport via &#963;&#8208;linkage Length Modulation in D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A Semiconductors for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carrier transport is an equally decisive factor as carrier separation for elevating photocatalytic efficiency. However, limited by indefinite structures and low crystallinities, studies on enhancing carrier transport of organic photocatalysts are still in their infancy. Here, we develop an &#963;&#8208;linkage length modulation strategy to enhance carrier transport in imidazole&#8208;alkyl&#8208;perylene diimide (IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDI, corresponding to D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A) photocatalysts by controlling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance. Ethyl&#8208;linkage can shorten &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance (3.19 &#197;) the most among IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDIs (where alkyl = none, ethyl, and n&#8208;propyl) via minimizing steric hindrance between D and A moieties, which leads to the fastest carrier transport rates. Thereby, IMZ&#8208;ethyl&#8208;PDI exhibits remarkable enhancement in phenol degradation with 32&#8208;fold higher rates than IMZ&#8208;PDI, as well as the oxygen evolution rate (271&#8208;fold increased). In microchannel reactors, IMZ&#8208;ethyl&#8208;PDI also presents 81.5% phenol removal with high&#8208;flux surface hydraulic loading (44.73 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1). Our findings provide a promising molecular design guideline for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts and elucidate crucial internal carrier transport mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Tungstate&#8208;mediated In&#8208;situ Passivation of Grain Boundary Grooves in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a simple &#8220;two&#8208;step&#8221; in situ reaction approach to construct a stable tungstate/perovskite (PVSK) heterointerfaces at grain boundary grooves (GBGs) in perovskite solar cells. The proposed passivation involved strong ionic bonds with explicitly tuned band energetics in the heterointerface. Accordingly, the uncoordinated Pb2+ could be effectively passivated via the tungstate ions, meanwhile the type&#8208;I PVSK/tungstate heterointerfaces could reduce recombination loss via repelling carriers from grain boundaries back to the intra&#8208;grain section. Thus, the resulting sample showed improved device performance both in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n and n&#8208;i&#8208;p structure, which demonstrated the universality and validity of our passivation strategy.







Abstract
Possessed with advantageous optoelectronic properties, perovskites have boosted the rapid development of solution&#8208;processed solar cells. The performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly weakened by the carrier loss at grain boundary grooves (GBGs); however, it receives limited attention and there lacks effective approach to solve this issue. Herein, for the first time, we constructed the tungstate/perovskite heterointerface via a &#8220;two step&#8221; in situ reaction approach that provides effective defect passivation and ensures efficient carrier dynamics at the GBGs. The exposed perovskite at grain boundaries is converted to wide&#8208;band&#8208;gap PbWO4 via an in&#8208;situ reaction between Pb2+ and tungstate ions, which passivate defects due to the strong ionic bonding. Moreover, recombination loss is further suppressed via the heterointerface energetics modification based on an additional transformation from PbWO4 to CaWO4. PSCs based on this groove modification strategy showed good universality in both normal and inverted structure, with an improved efficiency of 23.25&#8201;% in the n&#8208;i&#8208;p device and 23.33&#8201;% in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device. Stable power output of the modified device could maintain 91.7&#8201;% after around 1100&#8197;h, and the device efficiency could retain 92.5&#8201;% after aging in air for around 2110&#8197;h, and 93.1&#8201;% after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C in N2 for 972&#8197;h.

     alt="Tungstate-mediated In-situ Passivation of Grain Boundary Grooves in Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a simple &#8220;two-step&#8221; in situ reaction approach to construct a stable tungstate/perovskite (PVSK) heterointerfaces at grain boundary grooves (GBGs) in perovskite solar cells. The proposed passivation involved strong ionic bonds with explicitly tuned band energetics in the heterointerface. Accordingly, the uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; could be effectively passivated via the tungstate ions, meanwhile the type-I PVSK/tungstate heterointerfaces could reduce recombination loss via repelling carriers from grain boundaries back to the intra-grain section. Thus, the resulting sample showed improved device performance both in the p-i-n and n-i-p structure, which demonstrated the universality and validity of our passivation strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts Derived from a Preorganized Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DAC) are deemed as promising electrocatalysts due to the abundant active sites and adjustable electronic structure, but the fabrication of well&#8208;defined DAC is still full of challenges. Herein, bonded Fe dual&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe2DAC) with Fe2N6C8O2 configuration were developed through one&#8208;step carbonization of a preorganized covalent organic framework with bimetallic Fe chelation sites (Fe2COF). The transition from Fe2COF to Fe2DAC involved the dissociation of the nanoparticles and the capture of atoms by carbon defects. Benefitting from the optimized d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of OOH* intermediates, Fe2DAC exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.898 V vs. RHE. This work will guide more fabrication of dual&#8208;atom and even cluster catalysts from preorganized COF in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Photodissociative Modules that Control Dual&#8208;Emission Properties in Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Organoborane Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diversity of triarylborane&#8208;based donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores has been increased by extensive tuning of the triarylborane moiety. Herein, ortho&#8208;P(=X)R2&#8208;substituted phenyl groups (X=O or S) are introduced onto a boron atom as a photodissociative module to impart the fluorophores with responsiveness to multiple stimuli or environmental parameters. Precise tuning of the substituents led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores that consist of an electron&#8208;donating amino group and an electron&#8208;accepting triarylborane moiety generally exhibit substantial solvatochromism in their fluorescence while retaining high fluorescence quantum yields even in polar media. Herein, we report a new family of this compound class, which bears ortho&#8208;P(=X)R2&#8208;substituted phenyl groups (X=O or S) as a photodissociative module. The P=X moiety that intramolecularly coordinates to the boron atom undergoes dissociation in the excited state, giving rise to dual emission from the corresponding tetra&#8208; and tricoordinate boron species. The susceptibility of the systems to photodissociation depends on the coordination ability of the P=O and P=S moieties, whereby the latter facilitates dissociation. The intensity ratios of the dual emission bands are sensitive to environmental parameters, including temperature, solution polarity, and the viscosity of the medium. Moreover, precise tuning of the P(=X)R2 group and the electron&#8208;donating amino moiety led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric P&#8722;C Coupling of Secondary Phosphine Oxides and Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular dynamic kinetic asymmetric P&#8722;C coupling of secondary phosphine oxides and aryl iodides is catalyzed by copper complexes with a carefully tuned diamine ligand. The reaction features a broad substrate scope and affords the corresponding products with high yields and enantioselectivities. Versatile transformations of these products gave diverse P&#8208;chiral scaffolds, which are valuable in asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective P&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) is an attractive method for synthesizing P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds, but the development of such a dynamic kinetic asymmetric process remains a considerable challenge. Here we report an unprecedented highly enantioselective dynamic kinetic intermolecular P&#8722;C coupling of SPOs and aryl iodides catalyzed by copper complexes ligated by a finely modified chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. The reaction tolerates a wide range of SPOs and aryl iodides, affording P&#8208;stereogenic tertiary phosphine oxides (TPOs) in high yields and with good enantioselectivity (average 89.2&#8201;%&#8201;ee). The resulting enantioenriched TPOs were transformed into structurally diverse P&#8208;chiral scaffolds, which are highly valuable as ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis of Cleavable Polymers via Oxidation of Thioether Moieties and Thiol Click Reactions: A Click&#8208;Declick Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Block copolymers and star&#8208;like polymers are synthesized by click reactions. The polymer chains are cleaved by declick reactions between the oxidized thioethers on the polymer structures and the added thiol compounds.







Abstract
In the past decades click chemistries including thiol chemistries have found wide applications in the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers. In this research, a click&#8208;declick strategy based on the oxidation of heteroaromatic thioethers and the substitution reactions between the oxidized groups and thiols, is proposed for the synthesis of the cleavable polymers. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments, block copolymers (BCPs) and star&#8208;like polymers are synthesized by thiol&#8208;phenylsulfone substitution reactions, and heteroaromatic thioethers are produced at the junction points of the BCP chains or on the crosslinking sites of the star&#8208;like polymer. The thioethers can be oxidized to heteroaromatic sulfoxides or sulfones, depending on the oxidization condition. It is demonstrated that both sulfoxides or sulfones can have base catalyzed nucleophilic substitution reactions with thiols, leading to the cleavage of the polymers.

         <title>Catalytic SNAr Hexafluoroisopropoxylation of Aryl Chlorides and Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium catalyzed SNAr hexafluoroisopropoxylation of unactivated aryl chlorides and bromides was demonstrated. The catalyst activates the aromatic ring via &#951;6&#8208;coordination, dramatically facilitating the attack by weakly nucleophilic hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol. Given that fluoroalkyl aryl ethers are valuable structural motifs in bioactive molecules, this method might find utility in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.







Abstract
Fluoroalkyl aryl ethers are valuable structural motifs in pharmaceuticals because compounds with these motifs are more metabolically stable and more lipophilic than their nonfluorinated analogues. However, hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers have not been extensively studied, presumably because of the lack of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we describe a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic substitution of aryl chlorides or bromides, which act as the limiting reagents, with weakly nucleophilic hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol under mild reaction conditions. This method provides diverse hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers.

&lt;p&gt;A rhodium catalyzed S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar hexafluoroisopropoxylation of unactivated aryl chlorides and bromides was demonstrated. The catalyst activates the aromatic ring via &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-coordination, dramatically facilitating the attack by weakly nucleophilic hexafluoro-2-propanol. Given that fluoroalkyl aryl ethers are valuable structural motifs in bioactive molecules, this method might find utility in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluoroalkyl aryl ethers are valuable structural motifs in pharmaceuticals because compounds with these motifs are more metabolically stable and more lipophilic than their nonfluorinated analogues. However, hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers have not been extensively studied, presumably because of the lack of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we describe a rhodium-catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic substitution of aryl chlorides or bromides, which act as the limiting reagents, with weakly nucleophilic hexafluoro-2-propanol under mild reaction conditions. This method provides diverse hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers. We demonstrated the generality of this method by carrying out reactions of a large array of unactivated aryl halides, and we found that the success of the reactions relied on arene activation by means of &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-coordination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General and Practical Route to Functionalized Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane&#8208;Heteroaryls Enabled by Photocatalytic Multicomponent Heteroarylation of [1.1.1]Propellane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a conceptually different approach to access diverse arylated bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs). A wide variety of alkyl radicals derived from alkyltrifluoroborates and alkylsilicates were successfully incorporated to form a range of synthetically valuable 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized heteroarylated BCPs. Moreover, more electron&#8208;deficient &#8901;CF2H or &#8901;CF3 radicals were also found to be amenable, affording fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted heteroaryl BCPs







Abstract
1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are an important class of BCP derivatives with widespread application in drug development. Most syntheses of these materials require multiple chemical steps via BCP electrophiles or nucleophiles derived from [1.1.1]propellane. Although one&#8208;step, multicomponent radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions could provide a more sustainable and rapid route to access diverse heteroarylated BCPs, current approaches are limited to tertiary alkyl radicals, leading to a decrease in their practical value. In this study, a conceptually different approach enabled by a radical multicomponent heteroarylation of [1.1.1]propellane to access functionalized heteroarylated BCPs is described. Importantly, this protocol is compatible with primary&#8208;, secondary&#8208;, and tertiary aliphatic radicals, as well as various fluoroalkyl radical sources, thus enabling rapid library generation of sought&#8208;after BCP derivatives for drug development.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photodynamic Chemiluminescent Probes for Cancer Therapy and Metastasis Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared photodynamic chemiluminescent probe (DBPOL) is designed to specifically detect the tumor biomarker lysyl oxidase (LOX) for chemiluminescence (CL)&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) and follow&#8208;up monitoring of lung metastasis.







Abstract
There is growing interest in the development of chemiluminescence (CL) probes for phototheranostics because of their minimized tissue autofluorescence. However, due to a lack of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing chemiluminophores, current probes for NIR CL&#8208;guided phototherapy are based on nanoparticles made up of multiple components. We report bright unimolecular chemiluminophores with NIR absorptions and emissions, long CL half&#8208;lives and ideal photodynamic efficiency. One luminophore is modified into an activatable probe, DBPOL, with a turn&#8208;on CL signal and photodynamic activity that are specific to a cancer biomarker. The highly sensitive DBPOL allows CL&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy which completely inhibits tumor growth and lung metastasis in mouse models, and can be applied for noninvasive monitoring of lung metastasis. We provide molecular guidelines for NIR&#8208;absorbing CL probes for imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy.

         <title>Photocatalytic Metal Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer Mediated Allene Functionalization by Cobalt and Titanium Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is on the photo Co metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reaction for chemoselective allene functionalization by using Co&#8208;porphines as catalysts and the Hantzsch ester as an H atom and electron donor. The merger of Co MHAT and Ti catalysis under photoredox conditions enabled successful carbonyl allylation, providing access to valuable &#946;&#8208;functionalized homoallylic alcohols with exceptional regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reactions have proven to be a powerful method for alkene functionalization. This work reports the discovery of Co&#8208;porphines as highly efficient MHAT catalysts with a loading of only 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;% for unprecedented chemoselective allene functionalization under photoirradiation. Moreover, the newly developed bimetallic strategy by the combination of photo Co&#8208;MHAT and Ti catalysis enabled the successful carbonyl allylation with a wide range of amino, oxy, thio, aryl, and alkyl&#8208;allenes providing expedient access to valuable &#946;&#8208;functionalized homoallylic alcohols in over 100 examples with exceptional regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mechanism studies and DFT calculations supported that selectively transferring hydrogen atoms from cobalt hydride to allenes and generating allyl radicals is the key step in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>A Dicyanomethyl Radical Conjugated with a Pyridylamino Group: Combining Radical&#8208;based Dynamic Covalent Chemistry and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we aimed to develop a dicyanomethyl radical that undergoes both reversible C&#8212;C bond formation/dissociation and metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions to combine dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) based on organic radicals with coordination chemistry. We have previously reported a dicyanomethyl radical conjugated with a triphenylamine (1&#8226;) that exhibits a monomer/dimer equilibrium between the &#963;&#8208;bonded dimer (12). We designed and synthesized a novel dicyanomethyl radical with a pyridyl group as a coordination point (2&#8226;) by replacing the phenyl group of 1&#8226; with a 3&#8208;pyridyl group. We showed that 2&#8226; is also in an equilibrium with the &#963;&#8208;bonded dimer (22) in solution and has suitable thermodynamic parameters for application in DCC. 22 coordinates to PdCl2 in a 2:2 ratio to selectively form a metallamacrocycle (22)2(PdCl2)2, and its structure was clarified by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR, ESR, and electronic absorption measurements revealed that (22)2(PdCl2)2 also undergoes the reversible C&#8212;C bond formation/dissociation reaction. Ligand&#8208;exchange experiment showed that 22 was liberated from (22)2(PdCl2)2 by the addition of another ligand with a higher affinity for Pd(II). This work demonstrated that DCC based on dicyanomethyl radicals works orthogonally to metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries Based on an Ultrathin and Respirable Interphase Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries are desirable candidates in pursuit of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, their poor cycling performances originated from the unsatisfactory reversibility of Li plating/stripping remains a grand challenge. Here we show a facile and scalable approach to produce high&#8208;performing anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries using a bioinspired and ultrathin (250 nm) interphase layer comprised of triethylamine germanate. The derived tertiary amine and LixGe alloy showed enhanced adsorption energy that significantly promoted Li&#8208;ion adsorption, nucleation and deposition, contributing to a reversible expansion/shrinkage process upon Li plating/stripping. Impressive Li plating/stripping Coloumbic efficiencies (CEs) of ~99.3% were achieved for 250 cycles in Li/Cu cells. In addition, the anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 full batteries demonstrated maximal energy and power densities of 527 Wh kg&#8208;1 and 1554 W kg&#8208;1, respectively, and remarkable cycling stability (over 250 cycles with an average CE of 99.4%) at a practical areal capacity of ~3 mAh cm&#8208;2, the highest among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 batteries. Our ultrathin and respirable interphase layer presents a promising way to fully unlock large&#8208;scale production of anode&#8208;free batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroalkenylation and Hydroalkynylation of Alkenes Enabled by a Transient Directing Group: Catalyst Generality through Rigidification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkenes and alkynes represents a powerful strategy for rapid generation of molecular complexity. Herein, we report a transient directing group (TDG) strategy to facilitate site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkynylation of alkenylaldehyes using alkenyl and alkynyl bromides, respectively, allowing for construction of a stereocenter at the &#948;&#8208;position with respect to the aldehyde. Computational studies revealed the dual beneficial roles of rigid TDGs, such as L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine, in promoting TDG binding and inducing high levels of enantioselectivity in alkene insertion with a variety of migrating groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperpolarized 13C NMR Spectroscopy of Urine Samples at Natural Abundance by Quantitative Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) offers an ensemble of methods that remarkably address the sensitivity issues of NMR. Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (d&#8208;DNP) provides a unique and general way to detect 13C NMR signals with a sensitivity enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The expanding application scope of d&#8208;DNP now encompasses the analysis of complex mixtures at natural 13C abundance. However, it has in this area been limited to metabolite extracts. Here, we report the first d&#8209;DNP&#8208;enhanced 13C NMR analysis of a biofluid &#8208;urine&#8208; at natural abundance, offering unprecedented resolution and sensitivity for this challenging type of sample. We also show that accurate quantitative information on multiple targeted metabolites can be retrieved through a standard addition procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Bio&#8208;Based Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Furanic Platforms as Biomass Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for new biomass&#8208;derived fine and commodity chemicals propels the discovery of new methodologies and synthons. Whereas furfural and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural are cornerstones of sustainable chemistry, 3&#8208;acetamido&#8208;5&#8208;acetyl furan (3A5AF), an N&#8208;rich furan obtained from chitin biomass, remains unexplored, due to the poor reactivity of the acetyl group relative to previous furanic aldehydes. Here we developed a reactive 3&#8208;acetamido&#8208;5&#8208;furfuryl aldehyde (3A5F) and demonstrated the utility of this synthon as a source of bio&#8208;derived nitrogen&#8208;rich heteroaromatics, carbocycles, and as a bioconjugation reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Methane Carboxylation Using Electrochemically Activated Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct synthesis of CH3COOH from CH4 and CO2 is an appealing approach for the utilization of two potent greenhouse gases that are notoriously difficult to activate. In this Communication, we report an integrated route to enable this reaction. Recognizing the thermodynamic stability of CO2, our strategy sought to first activate CO2 to produce CO (through electrochemical CO2 reduction) and O2 (through water oxidation), followed by oxidative CH4 carbonylation catalyzed by Rh single atom catalysts supported on zeolite. The net result was CH4 carboxylation with 100% atom economy. CH3COOH was obtained at a high selectivity (&gt;80%) and good yield (ca. 3.2 mmol/gcat in 3 h). Isotope labelling experiments confirmed that CH3COOH is produced through the coupling of CH4 and CO2. This work represents the first successful integration of CO/O2 production with oxidative carbonylation reaction. The result is expected to inspire more carboxylation reactions utilizing preactivated CO2 that take advantage of both products from the reduction and oxidation processes, thus achieving high atom efficiency in the synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the SMSI Overlayer Structure in Pt/TiO2 Catalysts Prevents Particle Evaporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum nanoparticles (NPs) supported by titania exhibit a strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI)[1] that can induce overlayer formation and encapsulation of the NP&#180;s with a thin layer of support material. This encapsulation modifies the catalyst's properties, such as increasing its chemoselectivity[2] and stabilizing it against sintering.[3] Encapsulation is typically induced during high&#8208;temperature reductive activation and can be reversed through oxidative treatment.[1] However, recent findings indicate that the overlayer can be stable in oxygen.[4,5] Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we investigated how the overlayer changes with varying conditions. We found that exposure oxygen below 400&#176;C caused disorder and removal of the overlayer upon subsequent hydrogen treatment. In contrast, elevating the temperature to 900&#176;C while maintaining the oxygen atmosphere preserved the overlayer, preventing platinum evaporation when exposed to oxygen. Our findings demonstrate how different treatments can influence the stability of nanoparticles with or without titania overlayers. expanding the concept of SMSI and enabling noble metal catalysts to operate in harsh environments without evaporation associated losses during burn&#8208;off cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Interconversion of Highly Entangled Polyhedra into Concave Polyhedra by Nitrate&#8208;Induced Ternary Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Entangled (M3L2) n  polyhedral complexes represent a unique class of supramolecular architectures that are stabilized by relatively weak metal&#8211;acetylene interactions in cooperation with conventional metal&#8211;pyridyl coordination. Counter&#8208;anion exchange of these complexes with a nitrate (NO3&#8722;) ion triggered formal metal insertion between the metal centers, and a heteroleptic ternary coordination mode with acetylenic, pyridyl, and nitrate donors was generated on the metal centers. As a result, the main frameworks of the polyhedral complexes M18L12 and M12L8 were formally extended into a new series of concave polyhedra having the compositions M21L12 and M13L8, respectively. This transformation also resulted in the local disconnection of the highly entangled trifurcate topology of the framework, providing clues toward the skeletal editing of extended and complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architectures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep sodium extraction/insertion of sodium cathodes usually causes undesired Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and phase transition, both of which will reduce structural stability and lead to poor long&#8208;cycle reliability. Here we report a zero&#8208;strain P2&#8208; Na2/3Li1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2 cathode, in which the lithium/cobalt substitution contributes to reinforcing the host structure by reducing the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox, mitigating the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, and minimizing the lattice change. 94.5% of Na+ in the unit structure can be reversibly cycled with a charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V (vs. Na+/Na). Impressively, a solid&#8208;solution reaction without phase transitions is realized upon deep sodium (de)intercalation, which poses a minimal volume deviation of 0.53%. It attains a high discharge capacity of 178 mAh g&#8722;1, a high energy density of 534 Wh kg&#8722;1, and excellent capacity retention of 95.8% at 1C after 250 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Atomic Fe&#8208;Spin State by Crystal Field and Magnetic Field for Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly&#8208;active and low&#8208;cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution are essential in rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries, and single atom catalysts with Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C are promising candidates. However, the activity still needs to be boosted, and the origination of spin&#8208;related oxygen catalytic performance is still uncertain. Herein, an effective strategy to regulate local spin state of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C through manipulating crystal field and magnetic field is proposed. The spin state of atomic Fe can be regulated from low spin to intermediate spin and to high spin. The cavitation of dxz and dyz orbitals of high spin Fe(&#8546;) can optimize the O2 adsorption and promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*O2 to *OOH). Benefiting from these merits, the high spin Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst displays the highest oxygen electrocatalytic activities. Furthermore, the high spin Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;based rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery displays a high power density of 170 mW cm&#8208;2 and good stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Atom Migration Abilities Affected Anode Performance of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) is commonly induced by irreversible phase conversion and difficult desodiation, especially on transition metal compounds (TMCs). Yet the underlying physicochemical mechanism of poor reaction reversibility is still a controversial issue. Herein, by using in situ transmission electron microscope and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, we demonstrate the irreversible conversion of NiCoP@C is caused by the rapid migration of P in carbon layer and preferential formation of isolated Na3P during discharge. By modifying the carbon coating layer, the migration of Ni/Co/P atoms is inhibited, thus the improvement of ICE and cycle stability is realized. The inhibiting of fast atom migration which induces component separation and rapid performance degradation might be applied to a wide range of electrode materials, and guides the development of advanced SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano&#8208;enabled Quenching of Bacterial Communications for the Prevention of Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofilm formation is a major threat to industry, the environment and human health. While killing of embedded microbes in biofilms may inevitably lead to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), catalytic quenching of bacterial communications by lactonase is a promising antifouling approach. Given the shortcomings of protein enzymes, it&#8217;s attractive to engineer synthetic materials to mimic the activity of lactonase. Herein, an efficient lactonase&#8208;like Zn&#8208;Nx&#8208;C nanomaterial was synthesized by tuning the coordination environment around zinc atoms to mimic the active domain of lactonase for catalytical interception of bacterial communications in biofilm formation. The Zn&#8208;Nx&#8208;C material could selectively catalyze 77.5% hydrolysis of N&#8208;acylated&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine lactone (AHL), a critical bacterial quorum sensing (QS) signal in biofilm construction. Consequently, AHL degradation downregulated the expression of QS&#8208;related genes in antibiotic resistant bacteria and significantly prevented biofilm formation. As a proof of concept, Zn&#8208;Nx&#8208;C&#8208;coated iron plates prevented 80.3% biofouling after a month exposure in river. Overall, our study provides a nano&#8208;enabled contactless antifouling insight to avoid AMR evolutions by engineering nanomaterials for mimicking the key bacterial enzymes (e.g., lactonase) functioning in biofilm construction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite several methodologies established for C(sp2)&#8722;I selective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations, achieving arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons by cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl precursors with bromo(iodo)arenes in a C(sp2)&#8722;I selective manner is rare. Here we report a general Ni&#8208;catalyzed C( sp2 )&#8722;I selective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) reaction, in which, beyond 3&#176; alkyl bromides (for constructing arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons), 2&#176; and 1&#176; alkyl bromides are also demonstrated to be viable coupling partners. Moreover, this mild XEC displays excellent C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and functional group compatibility. The practicality of this XEC is demonstrated in simplifying the routes to several medicinally relevant and synthetically challenging compounds. Extensive experiments show that the terpyridine&#8208;ligated NiI halide can exclusively activate alkyl bromides, forming a NiI&#8211;alkyl complex through a Zn reduction. Attendant density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal two different pathways for the oxidative addition of the NiI&#8211;alkyl complex to the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond of bromo(iodo)arenes, explaining both the high C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and generality of our XEC.</dc:description>

Attendant density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal two different pathways for the oxidative addition of the NiI&#8211;alkyl complex to the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond of bromo(iodo)arenes, explaining both the high C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and generality of our XEC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Mediated Tumor Energy Remodeling for Sensitizing Mild Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metabolic reprogramming of tumors requires ATP to maintain therapeutic resistance, posing a major challenge for photothermal therapy (PTT). Although raising the temperature can help in tumor ablation, it frequently leads to severe side effects such as chronic inflammation and hyper&#8208;immunogenicity. Therefore, improving therapeutic responsiveness and promoting wound healing are crucial considerations in PTT development. In this context, we proposed a gas&#8208;mediated energy remodeling strategy to enhance the efficacy of mild PTT at moderate temperatures while minimizing side effects. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, an FDA&#8208;approved drug&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor was developed to provide a sustained supply of H2S to tumor sites, serving as an adjuvant to mild PTT. This approach proved to be highly effective in disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain, inhibiting ATP generation, and reducing the overexpression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which ultimately amplified the therapeutic outcome. With the ability to reverse tumor thermotolerance, this strategy delivered a greatly potent antitumor response, achieving complete tumor ablation in a single treatment while minimizing harm to healthy tissues. Thus, it holds great promise to overcome the limitations of PTT and may serve as a valuable paradigm for the future clinical translation of photothermal nanoplatforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Biomimetic Synthesis of Dimeric Tetrahydrocarbazoles via a Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization&#8211;[3+2] Cyclodimerization Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclodimerization (homochiral&#8208; and heterochiral&#8208;) of monomomeric units for the construction of stereodefined polycyclic systems is a powerful strategy in both biosynthesis and biomimetic synthesis. Herein we have discovered and developed a Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed, biomimetic, diastereoselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8211;[3+2] cyclodimerization of 1&#8208;(indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ol. This novel strategy operates under very mild conditions, providing access to structurally unprecedented dimeric tetrahydrocarbazoles fused to a tetrahydrofuran unit in excellent yields of the products. Several fruitful control experiments, isolation of the monomeric&#8208;cycloisomerized products and their subsequent conversion into the corresponding cyclodimeric products supported their intermediacy and the possible mechanism as a cycloisomerization&#8211;diastereoselective [3+2] cyclodimerization cascade. The cyclodimerization involves a substituent controlled, highly diastereoselective homochiral [3+2] annulation or heterochiral [3+2] annulation of in situ generated 3&#8208;hydroxytetrahydrocarbazoles. The key and important features of this strategy are: a) construction of three new C&#8211;C bonds &amp; one new C&#8211;O bond; b) creation of three new stereocenters, and c) construction of three new rings, in a single operation; d) low catalyst loading (1&#8208;5 mol%); e) 100% atom economy; and f) rapid construction of structurally unprecedented natural product like polycyclic frameworks. A chiral pool version using an enantio&#8208; and diastereopure substrate was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezochromism in Dynamic Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic materials with pressure&#8208;dependent photoluminescence tuning properties are important in many fields, such as mechanical sensors, security papers, and storage devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as an emerging class of crystalline porous materials (CPMs) with structural dynamics and tunable photophysical properties, are suitable for designing piezochromic materials, but there are few related studies. Herein, we report two dynamic three&#8208;dimensional COFs based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) chromophores, termed JUC&#8208;635 and JUC&#8208;636 (JUC = Jilin University China), and for the first time, study their piezochromic behavior by diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the various luminescent groups, JUC&#8208;635 has completely different solvatochromism and molecular aggregation behavior in the solvents. More importantly, JUC&#8208;635 with AIE effect exhibits a sustained fluorescence upon pressure increase (~3 GPa), and reversible sensitivity with high&#8208;contrast emission differences (&#916;&#955;em = 187 nm) up to 12 GPa, superior to other CPMs reported so far. Therefore, this study will open a new gate to expand the potential applications of COFs as exceptional piezochromic materials in pressure sensing, barcoding, and signal switching.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable Metal Azolate Frameworks Showing Interesting Flexibilities for Highly Effective Bioethanol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As demonstrated by the extraordinary ethanol purification performances of a pore&#8208;opening adsorbent for various ethanol/water mixtures, the guest&#8208;dominated gating process, in which the preferentially&#8208;adsorbed guest serves as the gating component, is critical for achieving ultrahigh adsorption selectivity in large&#8208;pore adsorbents and avoiding the co&#8208;adsorption problem of pore&#8208;opening adsorbents.







Abstract
The ethanol/water separation challenge highlights the adsorption capacity/selectivity trade&#8208;off problem. We show that the target guest can serve as a gating component of the host to block the undesired guest, giving molecular sieving effect for the adsorbent possessing large pores. Two hydrophilic/water&#8208;stable metal azolate frameworks were designed to compare the effects of gating and pore&#8208;opening flexibility. Large amounts (up to 28.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) of ethanol with fuel&#8208;grade (99.5&#8201;%+) and even higher purities (99.9999&#8201;%+) can be produced in a single adsorption process from not only 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 but also 10&#8201;:&#8201;90 ethanol/water mixtures. More interestingly, the pore&#8208;opening adsorbent possessing large pore apertures showed not only high water adsorption capacity but also exceptionally high water/ethanol selectivity characteristic of molecular sieving. Computational simulations demonstrated the critical role of guest&#8208;anchoring aperture for the guest&#8208;dominated gating process.

         <title>Fused Triangulene Dimers: Facile Synthesis by Intramolecular Radical&#8208;Radical Coupling and Application for Near Infrared Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large graphene&#8208;like molecules with four zigzag edges are ideal gain medium materials for organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lasers. However, synthesizing them becomes increasingly challenging as the molecular size increases. In this study, we introduce a new intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling approach and successfully synthesize two fused triangulene dimers (1a/1b) efficiently. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of 1a indicates that there is no intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the solid state. When the more soluble derivative 1b is dispersed in polystyrene thin films, amplified spontaneous emission in the NIR region is observed. Using 1b as the active gain material, we fabricate solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers that exhibit a narrow emission linewidth at around 790 nm. The laser devices also exhibit low thresholds with high photostability. Our study provides a new synthetic strategy for extended nanographenes, which have diverse applications in electronics and photonics.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated High&#8208;Spin State and Constrained Charge Behavior of Active Cobalt Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel type of covalent organic frameworks has been developed by assembling definite cobalt&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon configurations onto carbon nanotubes using linkers that have varying electronic effects. This innovative approach has resulted in an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, which is understood by a combination of in situ spectroelectrochemistry and the bond order theorem. The strong interaction between the electron&#8208;donating carbon nanotubes and the electron&#8208;accepting linker mitigates the trend of charge loss at cobalt sites, while inducing the generation of high spin state. This enhances the adsorption strength and electron transfer between the cobalt center and reactants/intermediates, leading to an improved oxygen reduction capability. This work not only presents an effective strategy for developing efficient non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts through reticular chemistry, but also provides valuable insights into regulating the electronic configuration and charge behavior of active sites in designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel type of covalent organic frameworks has been developed by assembling definite cobalt-nitrogen-carbon configurations onto carbon nanotubes using linkers that have varying electronic effects. This innovative approach has resulted in an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, which is understood by a combination of in situ spectroelectrochemistry and the bond order theorem. The strong interaction between the electron-donating carbon nanotubes and the electron-accepting linker mitigates the trend of charge loss at cobalt sites, while inducing the generation of high spin state. This enhances the adsorption strength and electron transfer between the cobalt center and reactants/intermediates, leading to an improved oxygen reduction capability. This work not only presents an effective strategy for developing efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts through reticular chemistry, but also provides valuable insights into regulating the electronic configuration and charge behavior of active sites in designing high-performance electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Developing Insoluble Polyoxometalate Clusters to Bridge Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Water Oxidation Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cluster catalysts are attractive for their atomically precise structures, defined compositions, tunable coordination environments, uniform active sites, and their multielectron transfer ability, but suffer&#160;from poor stability and recyclability. Here, we report a general approach to the direct insolubilization of a water soluble polyoxometalate (POM) [{(B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PW9O34)Co3(OH)(H2O)2(O3PC(O)&#8208;(C3H6NH3)PO3)}2Co]14&#8211; (Co7) to a series of POM&#8208;based solid catalysts with the counter&#8208;cations Ag+, Cs+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Y3+, and Ce3+, respectively. They exhibit improved catalytic activities for visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation following the trend CsCo7 &gt; SrCo7 &gt; AgCo7 &gt; CeIIICo7 &gt; BaCo7 &gt; YCo7 &gt; PbCo7. While CsCo7 exhibits mainly homogeneous catalysis, the others are predominantly heterogeneous catalysts. An optimal oxygen yield of 41.3% and a high apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 30.6% for SrCo7 is obtained, which is comparable to that of the parent homogeneous POM. Band gap structures, UV&#8208;vis spectra, and real&#8208;time laser flash photolysis experiments collectively suggest that the easier electron transfer from a solid POM catalyst to photosensitizer, the higher photocatalytic water oxidation performance. These solid POM catalysts exhibit good stability, which is directly confirmed by a combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, five cycles of tests and poison experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Nitride Pillared Vanadate Via Chemical Pre&#8208;Intercalation Towards High&#8208;PerformanceAqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium compounds are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their high specific capacity. However, the narrow interlayer spacing, low intrinsic conductivity and the vanadium dissolution still restrict their further application. Herein, we present an oxygen&#8208;deficient vanadate pillared by carbon nitrides (C3N4) as the cathode for AZIBs through a facile self&#8208;engaged hydrothermal strategy. Of note, C3N4 nanosheets can act as both the nitrogen source and pre&#8208;intercalation species to transform the orthorhombic V2O5 into layered NH4V4O10 with expanded interlayer spacing. Owing to the pillared structure and abundant oxygen vacancies, both the Zn2+ ion (de)intercalation kinetics and the ionic conductivity in the NH4V4O10 cathode are promoted. As a result, the NH4V4O10 cathode delivers exceptional Zn&#8208;ion storage ability with a high specific capacity of 398.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1, a high&#8208;rate capability of 194.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 A g&#8208;1 and a stable cycling performance of 10000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208;Imidazole Based Mesoionic Carbenes and Anionic Dicar&#173;benes: Pushing the Limit of Classical N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) featuring the carbene center at the C2&#8208;position of 1,3&#8208;imidazole framework (i.e. C2&#8208;carbenes) are well acknowledged as very versatile neutral ligands in molecular as well as in materials sciences. The efficiency and success of NHCs in diverse areas is essentially attributed to their persuasive stereoelectronics, in particular the potent &#963;&#8208;donor property. The NHCs with the carbene center at the unusual C4 (or C5) position, the so&#8208;called abnormal NHCs (aNHCs) or mesoionic carbenes (iMICs), are however superior &#963;&#8208;donors than C2&#8208;carbenes. Hence, iMICs have substantial potential in sustainable synthesis and catalysis. The main obstacle in this direction is rather demanding synthetic accessibility of iMICs. The aim of this review article is to highlight recent advances, particularly by the author&#8217;s research group, in accessing stable iMICs, quantifying their properties, and exploring their applications in synthesis and catalysis. In addition, the synthetic viability and use of vicinal C4,C5&#8208;anionic dicarbenes (ADCs), also based on an 1,3&#8208;imidazole framework, are presented. As will be apparent on following pages, iMICs and ADCs hold potentials in pushing the limit of classical NHCs by enabling access to conceptually new main&#8208;group heterocycles, radicals, molecular catalysts, ligands sets, and more.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic pathway furnishing the first natural brexane&#8208;type bishomosesquiterpene (chlororaphen, C17H28) was elucidated in the &#947;&#8208;proteobacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6.

         <title>Alkali Metal Dihydropyridines in Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysis of Imines: Amide Basicity versus Hydride Surrogacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic reduction of a representative set of imines, both aldimines and ketimines, to amines has been studied using transfer hydrogenation from 1,4&#8208;dicyclohexadiene. Unusually, this has been achieved using s&#8208;block pre&#8208;catalysts, namely 1&#8208;metallo&#8208;2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 2&#8208;tBuC5H5NM, M(tBuDHP), where M = Li&#8208;Cs. Reactions have been monitored in C6D6 and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;d8 (THF&#8208;d8). A definite trend is observed in catalyst efficiency with the heavier alkali metal tBuDHPs outperforming the lighter congeners. In general, Cs(tBuDHP) is the optimal pre&#8208;catalyst with, in the best cases, reactions producing quantitative yields of amines in minutes at room temperature using 5 mol% catalyst. Supporting the experimental study, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have also been carried out which reveal that Cs has a pathway with a significantly lower rate determining step than the Li congener. In the postulated initiation pathways DHP can act as either a base or as a surrogate hydride.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of H2O2 and Formate by Co&#8208;Electrolysis of Water and CO2 over Bifunctional Zn/SnO2 Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and formate are important chemicals used in various chemical manufacturing industries. One promising approach for the simultaneous production of these chemicals is coupling anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation with cathodic CO2 reduction in an electrolyzer using nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, we report an innovative hybrid electrosynthesis strategy using Zn&#8208;doped SnO2 (Zn/SnO2) nanodots as bifunctional redox electrocatalysts to achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 80.6% and 92.2% for H2O2 and formate coproduction, respectively, along with excellent stability for at least 60 h at a current density of ~ 150 mA cm&#8208;2. Through a combination of physicochemical characterizations, including operando attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), isotope labeling mass spectrometry (MS)/1H NMR and quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we discovered that the Zn dopant facilitates the coupling of *OH intermediates to promote H2O2 production and optimizes the adsorption of *OCHO intermediates to accelerate formate formation. Our findings offer new insights into designing more efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8208;based pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Defective Copper Nanocluster Catalysts for Highly Selective C&#8208;C Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Point defects in nanoparticles have long been hypothesized to play an important role in governing the particle&#8217;s electronic structure and physicochemical properties. However, single point defects in material systems usually exist with other heterogeneities, obscuring the chemical role of the effects. Herein, we report a novel atomically precise, copper hydride nanoclusters (NCs), [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28; TPP: triphenylphosphine; C7H7S: o&#8208;thiocresol) with a defined defect in the gram scale via a one&#8208;pot reduction method. The Cu28 acts as a highly selective catalyst in for C&#8211;C cross&#8208;couplings. The work highlights the potential of defective NCs as model systems for investigating individual defects, correlating defects with physiochemical properties, and rationally designing new nanoparticle catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Domain versus Single&#8208;Domain: A Magnetic Field is Not a Must for Promoting Spin&#8208;Polarized Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction kinetics of spin&#8208;polarized oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be enhanced by ferromagnetic catalysts under an external magnetic field. However, applying a magnetic field necessitates additional energy consumption and creates design difficulties for electrolyzers. Here, we prove that a single&#8208;domain FM catalyst without external magnetic fields exhibits a similar OER increment to its magnetized multi&#8208;domain one. The evidence is given by comparing the pH&#8208;dependent increment of OER on multi&#8208; and single&#8208;domain FM catalysts with or without a magnetic field. The intrinsic activity of a single&#8208;domain catalyst is higher than that of a multi&#8208;domain counterpart. The latter can be promoted to approach the former by the magnetization effect. Reducing the FM catalyst size into the single&#8208;domain region, the spin&#8208;polarized OER performance can be achieved without a magnetic field, illustrating an external magnetic field is not a requirement to reap the benefits of magnetic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control via Binding Sites within the Confined Space of Metal Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Frameworks for Enhanced Shape&#8208;Selectivity Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One striking feature of enzyme is its controllable ability to trap substrates&#160;via&#160;synergistic or cooperative binding in the enzymatic pocket, which renders the shape&#8208;selectivity of product by the confined spatial environment. The success of shape&#8208;selective catalysis relies on the ability of enzyme to tune the thermodynamics and kinetics for chemical reactions. In emulation of enzyme&#8217;s ability, we showcase herein a&#160;targeting strategy&#160;with the substrate being anchored on the internal pore wall of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), taking full advantage of the sterically kinetic control to achieve shape&#8208;selectivity for the reactions. For this purpose, a series of binding site&#8208;accessible metal metalloporphyrin&#8208;frameworks (MMPFs) have been investigated to shed light on the nature of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. They exhibit a different density of binding sites that are well arranged into the nanospace with corresponding distances of opposite binding sites. Such a structural specificity results in a facile switch in selectivity from an exclusive formation of the thermodynamically stable product to the kinetic product. Thus, the proposed targeting strategy, based on the combination of porous materials and binding events, paves a new way to develop highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for shifting selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia Using Tiara&#8208;like Phenylethanethiolated Nickel Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fixing of N2 to NH3 is challenging due to the inertness of the N &#8801; N bond. Commercially, ammonia production depends on the energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch (H&#8208;B) process, which emits CO2&#160;while using fossil fuels as the sources of hydrogen and energy. An alternative method for NH3 production is the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) process as it is powered by renewable energy sources. Here, we report a tiara&#8208;like nickel&#8208;thiolate cluster, [Ni6(PET)12] (where, PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiol)] as an efficient electro&#8208;catalyst for the electrochemical NRR at ambient conditions. Ammonia (NH3: 16.2 &#177; 0.8 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) was the only nitrogenous product over the potential of &#9472;2.3 V vs. Fc+/Fc with a Faradic efficiency of 25 &#177; 1.7 %. Based on theoretical calculations, NRR through [Ni6(PET)12] proceeds through both the distal and alternating pathways with an onset potential of &#8211;1.84 V vs. RHE (i.e., &#8211;2.46 V vs. Fc+/Fc) which corroborates with the experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Cluster Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Containing Copper Iodine Cube with 100% Exciton Utilization Using Host&#8211;Cluster Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clusters combine the advantages of organic molecules and inorganic nanomaterials, which are promising alternatives for optoelectronic applications. Nonetheless, recently emerged cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes require further excited state optimization of cluster emitters, especially to reduce population of the cluster&#8208;centered triplet quenching state (3CC). Here we report that redox&#8208;active ligands enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) of Cu4I4 cluster for triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet conversion, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host can provide an external RISC channel. It indicates that the complementarity between TADF host and cluster in RISC transitions gives rise to 100% triplet conversion efficiency and complete singlet exciton convergence, rendering 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant. We achieve a photoluminescence quantum yield of 99% and a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4%.</dc:description>

We achieve a photoluminescence quantum yield of 99% and a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Microenvironment Modulation of Pd Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical microenvironment modulation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) holds promise in tackling the long&#8208;lasting challenge of trade&#8208;off effect between activity and selectivity in catalysis. Herein, ultrafine PdCu2 NPs incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse groups on their pore walls have been fabricated for semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Cu species as the primary microenvironment of Pd active sites greatly improves the selectivity. The functional groups as the secondary microenvironment around PdCu2 NPs effectively regulate the activity, in which PdCu2 NPs encapsulated in the COF bearing &#8208;CH3 groups exhibit the highest activity with 100% conversion and &gt;96% selectivity. Both experimental and calculation results suggest that the functional group affects the electron&#8208;donating ability of the COFs, which successively impacts the charge transfer between COFs and Pd sites, giving rise to modulated Pd electronic state and excellent catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on PdNiRuIrRh High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy by Machine Learning Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts have been widely studied in electrolysis. However, identifying atomic structure of HEA with complex atomic arrangement is challenging, which seriously hinders the fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanism. Here, we report a HEA&#8208;PdNiRuIrRh catalyst with remarkable mass activity of 3.25 mA &#956;g&#8208;1 for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which is 8&#8208;fold enhancement compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Through machine learning potential&#8208;based Monte Carlo simulation, we reveal that the dominant Pd&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ni/Pd&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pd bonding environments and Ni/Ru oxophilic sites on HEA surface are beneficial to the optimized adsorption/desorption of *H and enhanced *OH adsorption, contributing to the excellent HOR activity and stability. This work provides significant insights into atomic structure and catalytic mechanism for HEA and offers novel prospects for developing advanced HOR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Integration of a Hydrophobic and Fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Inorganic Interphase to Stabilize Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The irreversible issues of Zn anode stemming from dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced erosion have severely hindered the commercialization of rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries. Herein, a hydrophobic and fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conductive zinc hexacyanoferrate (HB&#8208;ZnHCF) interphase layer is in&#8208;situ integrated on Zn by a rapid room&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry method to address these dilemmas. Different from currently proposed hydrophilic inorganic cases, the hydrophobic and compact HB&#8208;ZnHCF interphase effectively prevents the access of water molecules to Zn surface, thus avoiding H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. Moreover, the HB&#8208;ZnHCF with large internal ion channels, strong zincophilicity, and high Zn2+ transference number (0.86) permits fast Zn2+ transport and enables smooth Zn deposition. Remarkably, the resultant HB&#8208;ZnHCF@Zn electrode delivers unprecedented reversibility with 99.88% Coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles, realizes long&#8208;term cycling over 5800 h (&gt; 8 months, 1 mA cm&#8208;2) and 1000 h (10 mA cm&#8208;2), and assures the stable operation of full Zn battery with both coin&#8208; and pouch&#8208;type configurations.</dc:description>

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Rechargeable Air Batteries Using Dihydroxybenzoquinone and Its Polymer as the Negative Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study was conducted on an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable air battery (SSAB) using redox&#8208;active 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DHBQ) and its polymer (PDBM) and a proton&#8208;conductive polymer (Nafion). DHBQ functioned well in the redox reaction with the solid Nafion ionomer at 0.47 and 0.57 V vs. RHE, similar to that in acid aqueous solution. The resulting air battery exhibited an open circuit voltage of 0.80 V and a discharge capacity of 29.7 mAh gDHBQ&#8208;1 at a constant current density (1 mA cm&#8208;2). With PDBM, the discharge capacity was much higher, 176.1 mAh gPDBM&#8208;1, because of the improved utilization of the redox&#8208;active moieties. In the rate characteristics of the SSAB&#8208;PDBM, the coulombic efficiency was 84% at 4 C, which decreased to 66% at 101 C. In a charge/discharge cycle test, the capacity remaining after 30 cycles was 44%, which was able to be significantly improved, to 78%, by tuning the Nafion composition in the negative electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Linear Adsorption Enables NO Selective Electroreduction to Hydroxylamine on Single Co Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxylamine (NH2OH), a vital industrial feedstock, is presently synthesized under harsh conditions with serious environmental and energy concerns. Electrocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) reduction is attractive for the production of hydroxylamine under ambient conditions. However, hydroxylamine selectivity is limited by the competitive reaction of ammonia production. Herein, we regulate the adsorption configuration of NO by adjusting the atomic structure of catalysts to control the product selectivity. Co single&#8208;atom catalysts show state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH2OH selectivity from NO electroreduction under neutral conditions (FENH2OH: 81.3%), while Co nanoparticles are inclined to generate ammonia (FENH3: 92.3%). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical simulations unveil that linear adsorption of NO on isolated Co sites enables hydroxylamine formation and bridge adsorption of NO on adjacent Co sites induces the production of ammonia.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nitride Additive: A Drop&#8208;in Solution for Lithium/Garnet Wetting in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garnet oxides such as Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) are promising solid electrolyte materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries because of high ionic conductivity, low electronic leakage, and wide electrochemical stability window. While LLZTO has been frequently discussed to be stable against lithium metal anode, it is challenging to achieve and maintain good solid&#8208;on&#8208;solid wetting at the metal/ceramic interface in both processing and extended electrochemical cycling. Here we address the challenge by a powder&#8208;form magnesium nitride additive, which reacts with the lithium metal anode to produce well&#8208;dispersed lithium nitride. The in&#8208;situ formed lithium nitride promotes reactive wetting at the Li/LLZTO interface, which lowers interfacial resistance, increases critical current density (CCD), and improves cycling stability of the electrochemical cells. The additive recipe has been diversified to titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, tantalum nitride, and niobium nitride, thus supporting the general concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting. Such a design can be extended to other solid&#8208;state devices for better functioning and extended cycle life.</dc:description>
