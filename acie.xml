         <title>Polysulfamates as &#8220;Macroisosteres&#8221; of Polyurethanes with Improved Degradability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the synthesis of polysulfamates&#8212;sulfur(VI) isomeric analogs of polyurethanes in which the carbonyl group (&#8211;CO&#8211;) in the repeating unit is replaced by a sulfonyl group (&#8211;SO2&#8211;). Analysis of these polyurethane &#8220;macroisosteres&#8221; revealed enhanced hydrolytic degradability, improved thermal stability, and retained mechanical properties.








Abstract
Addressing the environmental persistence of plastics requires the development of next&#8208;generation polymers that combine high performance with enhanced degradability. Progress toward this grand challenge has been impeded, in part, by the absence of a general blueprint for the macromolecular design of such materials. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;macroisostere&#8221; design strategy, where the carbonyl group (&#8211;CO&#8211;) in polyurethanes (PUs) is replaced with a sulfonyl group (&#8211;SO2&#8211;), resulting in a virtually unknown family of polymers called polysulfamates. This approach, inspired by the use of bioisosteres in drug discovery, aims to preserve key interchain interactions that contribute to thermomechanical performance while enhancing the hydrolytic lability of the polymer backbone. The optimization of a Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) polymerization allowed the synthesis of ten polysulfamates structurally analogous to common PUs. Comparative analysis of one PU and its polysulfamate analog showed that this isosteric substitution increases thermal stability, slightly lowers the glass transition temperature, and retains similar hardness and reduced Young's modulus. Notably, the S(VI)&#8208;based polysulfamate demonstrated significantly enhanced hydrolytic degradability. These results highlight the potential of the &#8220;macroisostere&#8221; approach as a generalizable strategy for designing high&#8208;performance, degradable alternatives to traditional plastics.

         <title>Accessing Strain Engineered V&#8208;Fe(O)OH from Prussian Blue Analogue Precatalyst for Efficient Anodic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a d&#8208;d electron complementation strategy to precisely modulate the electronic structure of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst to access a strain&#8208;engineered V&#8208;Fe(O)OH active catalyst for anodic oxidation reactions. 








Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising precatalysts to access active metal oxyhydroxide [M(O)OH] phases for anodic oxidation reactions (AORs). In this study, we have introduced a d&#8208;d electron complementation strategy to fine&#8208;tune the electronic features of a VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst. Spectroscopic studies revealed the altered coordination and electronic features of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst compared to the FeFe&#8208;PBA counterpart. The electrochemical activation of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst led to the formation of a strained V&#8208;Fe(O)OH active catalyst. Notably, V&#8208;Fe(O)OH demonstrated exceptional performance, requiring a potential of only 1.56&#160;V versus RHE for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 1.42&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) at a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, significantly outperforming the Fe(O)OH. When employed in IOR&#8208;assisted water splitting, V&#8208;Fe(O)OH achieved an energy efficiency of 60% compared to overall water splitting. In&#8208;situ Raman studies reflected the potential dependent generation of active reaction intermediates, which participated in IOR to produce iodate. Mechanistic investigations suggested the involvement of a lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) facilitated by a proton&#8208;decoupled electron transfer (PDET) pathway.

Schematic representation of dimensionally confined nanocatalysts (1D to 3D) for electrocatalytic water splitting, which represents a sustainable route for green hydrogen generation. Space&#8208;confined synthesis has emerged as a potential strategy for constructing advanced electrocatalysts.

Abstract
Water splitting represents a sustainable and environmentally benign approach for green hydrogen generation and future clean energy solutions. In this context, space&#8208;confined synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy for engineering high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Recent studies have demonstrated that low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials synthesized via confinement techniques exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties. The confined microenvironment imparts superior electrical conductivity, structural stability, and active site accessibility, while also facilitating elevated catalytic activity and offering potential for scalable production in practical energy applications. In this review, we first present mechanistic insights into nanoconfinement&#8208;enhanced water splitting electrocatalysis and characterization techniques including in&#8208;situ/operando analysis for confined electrocatalysts, emphasizing how the confined architectures from one to three dimensions (1D&#8208;3D) regulate electronic structures, facilitate reactant adsorption, and reduce energy barriers. We then outline nanoscale confinement strategies, including in&#8208;situ and postsynthetic approaches using diverse host materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and MXenes, along with advanced methods for controlling particle dispersion and size. Next, we summarize recent progress in confined electrocatalysts for water splitting, highlighting density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;guided design and structure&#8211;property relationships. Finally, we address current challenges and future opportunities in synthesis control, in&#8208;situ characterization, and scalable deployment for practical hydrogen production.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fused Conjugated Alkylfluorene Bridged Naphthalimides Cathode Interlayer Enables Low&#8208;Noise Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work delivers a universal design strategy of a novel nonfused conjugated small molecule, namely FNA, serving as CILs to realize highly sensitive NIR photodetectors. The FNA&#8208;based OPDs exhibit enhanced interfacial contact and augmented photoresponse, achieving a notably low dark current and high specific detectivity, outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as the CIL. This innovative approach offers profound insights into the development of high&#8208;performance photodetectors.








Abstract
The cathode interface layers (CILs) play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of organic photodiodes (OPDs). However, the poor film formation, the tendency of orientation and aggregation, and contact in the interface of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)/CILs/electrode increase the dark current, leading to a limitation of light detection. In this study, we designed and synthesized a nonfused conjugated small molecule (FNA) with dioctyl fluorene (F) as the &#960;&#8208;bridge and N&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NA) as terminal groups. As the CIL, it significantly modifies the interfaces of BHJ/CILs/electrode and minimizes dark current density (Jd). Using PTB7&#8208;Th:IEICO&#8208;4F as the BHJ, FNA&#8208;based OPDs achieve a remarkably low Jd of 1.12&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8&#160;A cm&#8722;2 (at &#8722;0.5&#160;V) and a peak specific detectivity of 8.23&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones (940&#160;nm), outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as CIL. These improvements are attributed to lower Jd by modified interfacial contact and increased photoresponse by reducing depletion region width in FNA&#8208;based photodiodes. Furthermore, uniform photoresponse in 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 OPD pixel arrays further validates its potential for imaging applications.

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis Through D&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To excite electrons bound in d&#8208;band of Pt under light and thus exhibit photocatalysis function, the colloidosomes structure are designed and fabricated for light confinement. Non&#8208;photoresponsive Pt can be optically excited to generate hot electrons from its d&#8208;band structure and exhibit light&#8208;enhanced catalytic activity. NIR excited hot electrons in Pt colloidosomes can enhance the cascade catalysis efficiency of Pt as nanozymes for tumor therapy.








Abstract
Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by finite&#8208;different&#8208;time&#8208;domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100&#160;nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5&#160;nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.

         <title>Quest for Luminescent Low&#8208;Spin Chromium(I) Complexes with Doublet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States</title>

         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic low&#8208;spin d5 Cr(I) complexes prepared by chemical oxidation from their Cr(0) precursors were found luminescent in solutions and the emissions were tentatively assigned to be doublet MLCT in nature.








Abstract
Two paramagnetic Cr(I) complexes with homoleptic fac&#8208;bis(triarylisocyanide) ligands were prepared by chemical oxidation of the Cr(0) precursors and emission spectra with peak maximum at respective 568 and 525&#160;nm have been recorded with THF solutions of these two low&#8208;spin d5 metal complexes at 298&#160;K. Structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies revealed that the emission of the Cr(I) complexes could be tentatively assigned to be spin&#8208;allowed 2MLCT excited states. Femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra confirmed that the lifetimes of the excited states were in the tens of picoseconds, which could be explained by the fast nonradiative decay of 2MLCT state through low&#8208;lying quartet metal&#8208;centered (4MC) states. The Cr(I) complexes with luminescent 2MLCT excited states were distinct from the previously reported d5 Fe(III) complexes with luminescent 2LMCT excited states, enriching the diversity of emissive excited states of earth&#8208;abundant 3d transition metal complexes.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of &#916;AA&#8208;Peptides Using a Bioorthogonal pro&#8208;Amino Acid and Aqueous Flavin Photocatalyst: Green Light Enhances Catalyst Performance and Product Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We devise a new bioorthogonal amino acid, &#916;Sulf, that can be encoded into peptides and then reacted with carbon radicals, spawned from an aqueous flavin photocatalyst, boronic acids, and green LEDs to produce libraries of &#916;AA peptides. We use this platform to discover inhibitors of A&#946;42 aggregation for treating Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
Dehydroamino acids (&#916;AAs) are vital building blocks in the design and optimization of peptide drugs. The exact olefin geometry, side chain chemotype, and ancillary &#946;&#8208;carbon substituents play a significant role. Unfortunately, general approaches to install these motifs into peptides are lacking, complicated by the instability of unsaturated residues during traditional amide&#8208;bond coupling and failure of divergent protocols, such as oxidative Heck and Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons, to accommodate a complete range of substrate classes. Herein, we conceive and interrogate an original bioorthogonal reagent, &#946;&#8208;sulfonyldehydroamino acid (&#916;Sulf), that can be site&#8208;specifically encoded into standard peptides through solid&#8208; or liquid&#8208;phase synthesis. When combined with an aqueous flavin photocatalyst, myriad boronic acids and 525&#160;nm light&#8212;a more biologically benign portion of the flavin visible absorption spectra that has not previously been exploited for flavin photoredox catalysis,&#8212;this latent residue becomes one of several (Z)&#8208;&#916;AA variants (aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic)&#160;via&#160;stereoretentive radical conjugate addition and &#946;&#8208;scission. The importance of green light is established through mechanistic studies showing that it tempers radical formation and discourages flavin&#8208;catalyzed isomerization, controlling product selectivity. We apply our original reagent and catalytic platform in a brief medicinal chemistry campaign to discover tetrapeptides that modulate A&#946;42 aggregation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Paired Pulse Electrocatalytic Conversion of Phenol for Co&#8208;Production of Cyclohexanol and Para&#8208;Benzoquinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed paired pulse system achieves the selective conversion of phenol in wastewater for co&#8208;production of valuable cyclohexanol and para&#8208;benzoquinone, with an unexpected Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 0.064&#160;kWh&#160;mol&#8722;1.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of organic pollutants in wastewater into value&#8208;added chemicals presents a dual solution for water treatment and sustainable synthesis, yet achieving high Faradaic and energy efficiencies remains challenging. Here we, for the first time, report the paired electrolysis strategy to produce valuable cyclohexanol and para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) simultaneously from phenol in wastewater. More importantly, to address the dilemma of mismatched operation conditions between cathodic hydrogenation and anodic oxidation, we propose a pulse current strategy with alternating high&#8208;/low&#8208;current periods, which ensures the reduction kinetics of phenol at the cathode while effectively preventing the over&#8208;oxidation of generated p&#8208;BQ at the anode. By using tailored PdRu/C and NiRu/C as the cathode and anode, the paired pulse system realizes 84.9% phenol conversion and 83.9% cyclohexanol yield at the cathode, alongside 100% phenol conversion and 68.5% p&#8208;BQ yield at the anode, with an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 0.064&#160;kWh&#160;mol&#8722;1. Carbon emission accounting and techno&#8208;economic analysis highlight its environmental benefits and economic feasibility (US$1.36 profit per kg phenol). This work offers a green and efficient route for environmental remediation and resource recovery.

         <title>Accelerated Porosity Screening Using a Multichannel Colorimetric Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput porosity screening method was developed for rapid porosity evaluation, offering a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach to identifying candidate porous materials that is 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption methods with 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy. A multichannel six&#8208;dye array was used as a proxy measurement for porosity, eliminating false results that would result from the use of a single dye.








Abstract
Porous materials are important for many technologies, but the measurement of porosity by gas adsorption isotherms is slow, taking around one day per sample using a single&#8208;port gas sorption analyzer, even when using a &#8220;quick&#8221; analysis method with relatively few data points. With the increased use of automated platforms for material generation, porosity analysis is now frequently the bottleneck in the discovery of new porous materials. Here, we present a semiautomated pre&#8208;screening strategy that uses dye adsorption to create a colorimetric array that is combined with computer vision analysis for porosity screening. By using a six&#8208;dye multichannel array and a defined porosity threshold, our method rapidly screened 50 candidate materials that spanned molecular solids, polymers, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The method showed a 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy compared with gas uptake measurements. While this method is more qualitative than quantitative, it is more than 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption measurements, and it has the scope to be made much faster with greater parallelization and automation. This makes this colorimetric method suitable for pre&#8208;screening arrays of materials to choose samples that merit more detailed conventional porosity analysis.

&lt;p&gt;Porous materials are important for many technologies, but the measurement of porosity by gas adsorption isotherms is slow, taking around one day per sample using a single-port gas sorption analyzer, even when using a &#8220;quick&#8221; analysis method with relatively few data points. With the increased use of automated platforms for material generation, porosity analysis is now frequently the bottleneck in the discovery of new porous materials. Here, we present a semiautomated pre-screening strategy that uses dye adsorption to create a colorimetric array that is combined with computer vision analysis for porosity screening. By using a six-dye multichannel array and a defined porosity threshold, our method rapidly screened 50 candidate materials that spanned molecular solids, polymers, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The method showed a 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy compared with gas uptake measurements. While this method is more qualitative than quantitative, it is more than 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption measurements, and it has the scope to be made much faster with greater parallelization and automation. This makes this colorimetric method suitable for pre-screening arrays of materials to choose samples that merit more detailed conventional porosity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fe&#8208;Triazolate Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Water Oxidation Catalysts with Dual Photoanode Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;triazolate (Fe(ta)2) and its metal&#8208;substituted derivatives (Fe&#8208;Metal(ta)2) MOFs are reported as dual&#8208;function materials for light absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media, achieving a highest photocurrent of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 A cm&#8722;2 at bias&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is an emerging technology that achieves renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, from sunlight. Its realization depends on finding highly active and stable catalysts of water splitting and photoactive materials for light absorption. To be scalable, these should contain only abundant elements. Here, for the first time, Fe&#8208;triazolate (Fe(ta)2) and its metal substituted derivatives (Fe&#8208;Metal(ta)2) Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are characterized as new dual&#8208;function materials for photo&#8208;absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media. The materials were studied by a range of structural, spectroscopic, and computational density functional theory (DFT) techniques. Fe(ta)2 and Fe&#8208;Mn(ta)2 were found to be highly active and stable in chemical and photochemical water oxidation, and in addition function as photoanodes, with photo&#8208;electrocatalytic currents (&#8764;2.00 x 10&#8722;3 Acm&#8722;2 at&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl) at pH&#160;=&#160;1. The possibility of a unique catalytic mechanism where O&#9472;O bond formation is possible from the coupling of two adjacent FeIV&#160;=&#160;O fragments was demonstrated by DFT analysis. Thus, Fe&#8208;triazolate MOF has been established as a new, stable, scalable, versatile, and efficient platform for sustainable energy conversion in the realm of artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>HerTACs Enable Tumor&#8208;Selective Lysosomal Degradation of Membrane and Extracellular Proteins via HER2 Trafficking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AI&#8208;guided design of HER2&#8208;targeted lysosome&#8208;tethering chimeras (HerTACs) enables selective degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins in HER2+ tumors. These stapled peptide&#8208;based degraders harness HER2&#8208;mediated trafficking to deliver programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), V&#8208;domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) into lysosomes, offering a broadly applicable and clinically promising strategy for targeted protein degradation (TPD). 








Abstract
Targeting extracellular and membrane proteins for degradation remains a frontier challenge in the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD), largely due to the intracellular confinement of existing proteolysis systems and reliance on bulky biologics. Here, we develop a novel TPD platform, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeted lysosome&#8208;tethering chimeras (HerTACs), which co&#8208;opts the tumor overexpressed, endocytic, and lysosomal trafficking capability of HER2. Starting from the HER2&#8208;binding peptide LTVSPWY, we engineered the first&#8208;generation HerTAC (LP), a conjugate of the HER2&#8208;binding peptide and a PD&#8208;L1 ligand, to degrade programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) in HER2&#8208;positive cells. Guided by AlphaFold modeling and alanine scanning, we developed a stapled peptide&#8208;based HerTAC (L2,5P) with enhanced degradative&#160;efficacy (DC50&#160;=&#160;156&#160;nM), stability, and pharmacokinetics. HerTAC L2,5P showed potent antitumor activity and low systemic toxicity in HER2+ breast cancer animal models. The HerTAC strategy was further extended to other clinically relevant inaccessible membrane and extracellular targets (i.e., V&#8208;domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation [VISTA] and macrophage migration inhibitory factor [MIF]), highlighting its generality and broad applicability. This work establishes a tumor&#8208;selective, lysosome&#8208;directed TPD strategy that expands the druggable proteome and offers a clinically transformable approach for precision oncology.

         <title>Preparation of Degradable Polymers Containing Tunable Ratios of Dithioacetals and Disulfides via Mixed Mode Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the preparation of redox degradable polymers containing tunable ratios of dithioacetals and disulfides via a one&#8208;pot mixed&#8208;mode reaction. The amount of dithioacetals is able to be increased by adding more of the methylene source.








Abstract
Degradable polymers hold promise for their recyclability and their potential to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy of plastics. As such, a consecutive di&#8208;SN2 reaction between dithiols and polyhalogenated compounds was used to produce degradable polymers with tunable amounts of redox&#8208;enabled dithioacetal and disulfide linkages. The reaction employed bases of varying strengths and different thiol types, allowing for control over molecular weights ranging from &lt;1&#160;kDa to 16&#160;kDa, with tunable degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to over 75. The ratio of dithioacetals to disulfides was adjusted by manipulating the concentration of the methylene source, enabling the formation of polymers with up to 100% disulfide linkages or up to 93% dithioacetal linkages. This tunability resulted in polymers with multiple redox degradation pathways, capable of being degraded by either reduction or oxidation. Vinyl ether functionalized, telechelic oligomers were used as crosslinkers in network formation, yielding materials with multiple degradation pathways. This di&#8208;SN2 approach provides a promising and straightforward method for creating materials with tailored degradation characteristics.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Step Screening&#8208;Guided Core&#8208;Shell RuO2@TaOx Nanorods Electrocatalyst for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the limitations of conventional experimental method, which are often time&#8208; and resource&#8208;intensive, a multi&#8208;step systematic screening strategy guides the selection of high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides as protective layers for RuO2 in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The relevant core&#8208;shell structures are subsequently designed, where interfacial synergy promotes both catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
In the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the exploration of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts is essential for the environmentally friendly production of hydrogen. Although RuO2 exhibits high catalytic activity, its solubility and corrosion in acidic environments are of concern. In this study, high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides were multi&#8208;step rationally screened as protective layers for RuO2 to identify their roles in the acidic OER process. Among them, Ta&#8208;related oxide was selected as the best candidate. To demonstrate the theoretical predictions, RuO2@TaOx with a core&#8208;shell structure was deployed, which exhibited low overpotentials of 163 and 232&#160;mV at 10&#160; and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In fact, the dense amorphous TaOx layer effectively prevented the dissolution of RuO2 and optimized the charge transfer through interfacial synergy, significantly improving both the activity and durability of OER. Meanwhile, the operando quick X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (Quick&#8208;XAS) confirmed that Ru served as the active site during OER, while Ta inhibited the over&#8208;oxidation of Ru, correlating with theoretical considerations. This study provides a new paradigm using targeted computational screening to guide the design of advanced catalysts, and serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the deployment of high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides as a protective layer for RuO2 in the acidic OER.

Mechanochromic mechanophores function as force&#8208;reporting molecules in polymer materials. In their Research Article (e202510114), Yoshimitsu Sagara et&#160;al. demonstrate the first hinge&#8208;like mechanophore based on [2.2]paracyclophane. Polyurethane films covalently incorporating the mechanophore exhibit excimer&#8208;dominant emission in the force&#8208;free state. Upon mechanical activation, force&#8208;induced separation of the associated fluorophores leads to a change in fluorescence color from excimer&#8208;dominant bright yellow to monomer&#8208;dominant blue&#8208;green.

         <title>Fragment&#8208;Based Drug Discovery of Novel High&#8208;affinity, Selective, and Anti&#8208;inflammatory Inhibitors of the Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed potent and selective noncovalent Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 inhibitors through a structure&#8208;guided fragment&#8208;based approach. These nanomolar inhibitors activate Nrf2&#8208;controlled genes, suppress inflammation via NLRP3 and STING pathways, and exhibit distinct transcriptional profiles compared to covalent Nrf2 activators, offering promising chemical probes and drug leads for oxidative stress&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Activating the cytoprotective response of nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. A promising strategy is to inhibit the protein&#8208;protein interaction between Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein 1 (Keap1) and Nrf2 using noncovalent compounds that target the Keap1 Kelch domain. These compounds may be more specific than covalent Keap1&#8208;reacting Nrf2 activators. However, the development of drug&#8208;like noncovalent Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 inhibitors faces challenges due to the size and polarity of the Kelch binding pocket. Here, we present a new series of noncovalent Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 inhibitors developed from a weak fragment hit identified by crystallographic screening. A two&#8208;step growing strategy and optimization guided by several X&#8208;ray cocrystal structures led to compounds with low nanomolar affinities and complete selectivity for Keap1 in a panel of homologous Kelch domains. In cells, compounds 24 and 28 potently activated the expression of Nrf2&#8208;controlled genes and showed anti&#8208;inflammatory effects by downregulating NLRP3 inflammasome and STING signalling activation. RNA sequencing revealed activation of cytoprotective pathways and a different profile from typical covalent Nrf2 activators. This work highlights the potential of fragment&#8208;based drug discovery for challenging targets like Keap1 and introduces novel Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 inhibitors as chemical probes and drug leads.

         <title>Ensemble of Active Acid Sites on Amorphous Silica&#8211;Alumina Surfaces for Catalytic Cracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous silica&#8211;alumina plays a key role in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), but its active sites are hard to define due to atomic disorder. Here, we analyze its structure&#8211;acidity relationship under FCC conditions and observe that diverse acid sites emerge, including zeolite&#8208;like and pseudo&#8208;bridging Br&#248;nsted sites, influenced by Si content and hydroxylation. Using theory and experiments we confirm Br&#248;nsted acidity peaks at an optimal Si coverage.








Abstract
Amorphous silica&#8211;alumina are critical materials in catalysis, particularly for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). However, the atomic scale understanding of the active sites has been challenging, because of the nonuniform atomic distribution and the material's amorphous nature. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT), machine learning potentials and sampling methods to investigate the relationship between structure and acidity in silica&#8208;modified alumina. Under FCC conditions, we predict an ensemble of acid sites with diverse local structures and a spectrum of acid strengths, including zeolite&#8208;like bridging Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) and pseudo&#8208;bridging silanol BAS. This distribution is influenced by surface structure, Si coverage, and extent of hydroxylation, shaped by synthesis methods and reaction conditions. Experiments using a model Si&#8208;stabilized alumina catalyst confirm that Br&#248;nsted acidity increases with Si content, peaking at an optimal value before declining. These insights provide a foundation for designing efficient solid acid catalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Nonalternant Nanoribbons with up to 29 Linearly&#8208;Fused Rings and High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three triptycene end&#8208;capped N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons with precise length are prepared through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits. The longest one comprises a 29&#8208;linearly&#8208;fused&#8208;ring backbone, setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the reported soluble nonalternant nanoribbons. Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy measurements indicate high intrinsic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities in these nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, one of the highest values reported for graphene nanoribbons and the highest observed to date for non&#8208;alternant ones.








Abstract
The synthesis of nonalternant graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)&#8212;carbon&#8208;based nanostructures featuring fused pentagonal or heptagonal rings that disrupt hexagonal symmetry&#8212;has remained a significant challenge despite their unique electronic properties, such as tunable bandgaps and topological states. Unlike conventional alternant hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene&#8208;derived systems), nonalternant architectures exhibit distinct electron confinement effects, making them promising for nanoscale optoelectronics and quantum materials. However, achieving precise control over their length, solubility, and structural regularity has had limited progress.

&lt;p&gt;Three triptycene end-capped &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-doped nonalternant nanoribbons with precise length are prepared through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits. The longest one comprises a 29-linearly-fused-ring backbone, setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the reported soluble nonalternant nanoribbons. Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy measurements indicate high intrinsic charge-carrier mobilities in these nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, one of the highest values reported for graphene nanoribbons and the highest observed to date for non-alternant ones.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of nonalternant graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)&#8212;carbon-based nanostructures featuring fused pentagonal or heptagonal rings that disrupt hexagonal symmetry&#8212;has remained a significant challenge despite their unique electronic properties, such as tunable bandgaps and topological states. Unlike conventional alternant hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene-derived systems), nonalternant architectures exhibit distinct electron confinement effects, making them promising for nanoscale optoelectronics and quantum materials. However, achieving precise control over their length, solubility, and structural regularity has had limited progress. Herein, we report a versatile solution-phase synthesis of a novel family of structurally precise &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-doped nonalternant nanoribbons (&lt;b&gt;NRs&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;b&gt;NR-11&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;NR-29&lt;/b&gt;) through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits terminated with triptycene end-caps. The longest one comprises 29 linearly fused rings (particularly including 10 pentagonal rings), setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the soluble nonalternant &lt;b&gt;NRs&lt;/b&gt; reported to date. Strategic incorporation of triptycene end-caps and alkoxyphenyl substituents into their molecular backbones confers high solubility and a unique 3D configuration, enabling comprehensive solution-phase structural characterization and systematic investigation of length-dependent optoelectronic properties. Employing terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we infer high intrinsic charge carrier mobilities in nonalternant nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, highlighting this novel family of nanoribbons as promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stopping the Chain: Isolated Molecular Intermediates of Anionic Styrene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the organometallic first&#8208;step carbolithiation products of anionic styrene polymerization with diethyl ether and thf, that have not been isolated so far due to the high reactivity of anionic polymerization. X&#8208;ray solid&#8208;state and NMR solution&#8208;state experiments show different intermediates in the different solvents. In situ FT&#8208;IR and DFT&#8208;calculations present mechanistic proposals for the initiation reaction.








Abstract
Anionic polymerization developed to one of the most used polymerization techniques both in industry and academia in the last 70 years. Due to the required high reactivity of the polymerization, the isolation of the organometallic intermediate in between initiation and propagation step has not been possible so far and its mechanism is still not fully understood. Additionally, deprotonations in benzylic positions remain challenging, which is a prerequisite for a successful living carbanionic polymerization, but also complicating the synthetic access to the intermediates. Herein, we present the synthesis and isolation of the first&#8208;step carbolithiation product of anionic styrene polymerization in diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Characterizations in solid&#8208;state by X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution state by extended nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were carried out. Differing initiation reactivity was observed by in situ fourier transform&#8208;infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, revealing the intermediates to be responsible for polymerization reactivity. A possible mechanistic explanation for the initiation state was presented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By our approach of isolating the chain&#8208;relevant intermediates on a molecular level, we gained new insights on the existing mechanism.

         <title>Green Fluorescent Protein SELEX: Immobilization Chemistry and His&#8208;Tag Epitope Bias</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using green fluorescent proteins (GFP) as a target for SELEX, the untagged protein results in true protein&#8208;binding aptamers, whereas using the His&#8208;tagged protein results in aptamers biased toward the His&#8208;tag epitope. The His&#8208;tagged GFP provides a simple test for potential artifacts in previously selected aptamers for other His&#8208;tagged proteins.








Abstract
Despite numerous DNA aptamers for proteins having been reported, a model system allowing the use of cost&#8208;effective proteins, unmodified DNA, and convenient homogeneous assays is still lacking, which has in turn limited not only fundamental studies of aptamers but also their translation to practical applications. Herein, three separate green fluorescent protein (GFP) selections were carried out using both non&#8208;tagged and His&#8208;tagged GFP immobilized on either NHS&#8208;activated resin or Co2+ affinity resin. Only the GFP/NHS system resulted in aptamers that consistently bind to unmodified GFP, whereas the His&#8208;tagged GFP yielded aptamers biased toward the His&#8208;tag epitope. Sequence alignment and fluorescence polarization assays indicate that many previously published aptamers bound to the His&#8208;tag instead of the intended protein. This work not only obtained a model aptamer for proteins but also revealed critical information on bias toward His&#8208;tags during aptamer selections.

         <title>SmI2&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Housane Ketones and Alkenes in an Approach to Norbornanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Samarium diiodide (Sml2) is an effective catalyst for the mild, atom&#8208;economical coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones, and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes to give functionalized norbornane structural motifs not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches. In addition to aryl&#8208;substituted housane ketones, harder&#8208;to&#8208;reduce alkyl housane ketones are also excellent substrates for the radical cross&#8208;coupling.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;coupling strategies involving strain release have gained significant recent attention for the construction of complex molecular frameworks, particularly in the context of preparing bioisosteres for medicinal chemistry. While the reactivity of cyclopropanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been extensively studied, higher homologues are emerging as valuable substrates for synthesis. For example, methods for the fragmentation and coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones show promise but are currently limited in substrate scope. Here, we describe a mild, atom&#8208;economical, samarium diiodide (Sml2)&#8208;catalyzed fragmentation and coupling of alkyl and aryl housane ketones with alkenes that grants access to functionalized norbornane structural motifs, not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches, and with considerable potential for further manipulation.

With great respect for bears, which, in the past, were used to harvest their bile containing ursodeoxycholic acid &#8211; a key building block in this study &#8211; we developed a flexible and unsymmetric coordination ligand L. L reacts with salts of shiny palladium forming helical Pd6L8 and Pd12L16 cages via flexibility&#8208;aided orientational self&#8208;sorting. The cages undergo structural transformations induced by changing reaction conditions and exhibit toxicity in vitro using spheroids of hepatic cells HepG2. Details of the study are reported by Ond&#345;ej Jur&#269;ek et&#160;al. in their Research Article.

         <title>Highly Flexible Porous Aromatic Frameworks with Exceptional Adsorption Capacity Toward Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a synthetic strategy for flexible porous aromatic frameworks (FPAFs). By Yamamoto&#8208;type copolymerization of a rigid tetrahedral monomer (tetrakis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methane) and a flexible counterpart (tetrakis[(4&#8208;bromophenoxy)methyl]methane), we synthesized a series of flexible PAFs (FPAF&#8208;x, x = 0&#8211;2) with tunable flexibility. Both thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamic volatile organic compound (VOC) vapor adsorption studies showed that FPAFs achieved unprecedented VOC adsorption efficiency, establishing flexibility engineering as a principle for the design of next&#8208;generation adsorbents.








Abstract
In this work we report a novel strategy to enhance the adsorption capacity of conventional porous materials by engineering intrinsic framework flexibility into porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). Through Yamamoto&#8208;type copolymerization of a rigid tetrahedral monomer (tetrakis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methane) and a flexible counterpart (tetrakis[(4&#8208;bromophenoxy)methyl]methane), we synthesized a series of flexible PAFs (FPAF&#8208;x, x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;2) with tunable flexibility. FPAF&#8208;0.5 with moderate flexibility and surface area (854&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) achieves exceptionally high volatile organic compound (VOC) adsorption capacities for various VOCs (e.g., 410.7&#160;wt% for THF and 339.4&#160;wt% for 3&#8208;methylthiophene), outperforming many other porous materials reported to date. Both thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamics VOC vapor adsorption studies reveal that optimal flexibility enables guest&#8208;adaptive structural transformation, allowing pore expansion to accommodate additional VOC molecules after initial pore filling. Moreover, polar and aromatic VOCs induce greater framework expansion than nonpolar analogues, which can also enhance the VOC uptake capacity in FPAFs. This work establishes flexibility engineering as a design principle for next&#8208;generation adsorbents, improving the efficiency of VOC adsorption.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Unprotected Sulfonimidamides and Their Application in Photochemical Nitrene Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, metal&#8208;free nitrene transfer enables the efficient synthesis of unprotected sulfonimidamides from sulfinamides and hydroxylamine&#8208;derived reagents, offering broad substrate scope, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and access to complex sulfur&#8211;nitrogen scaffolds.








Abstract
The selective incorporation of nitrogen into organic molecules remains a central challenge in modern synthetic chemistry, particularly when aiming to access complex, functionalized scaffolds under mild and sustainable conditions. In this report, we describe a photocatalytic method that employs hydroxylamine&#8208;derived nitrene precursors and unprotected sulfinamides under mild conditions, enabling efficient nitrene transfer without the need for stoichiometric amounts of an oxidant. The resulting unprotected sulfonimidamides serve not only as target compounds but also as versatile intermediates for further nitrene&#8208;transfer reactions, affording complex sulfur&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;rich frameworks. Mechanistic studies support a photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer process involving a reactant complex between the photocatalyst and nitrene precursor. This work establishes a general and modular platform for accessing challenging architectures based on sulfonimidamides, expanding the toolkit for late&#8208;stage functionalization and heteroatom&#8208;rich molecule construction.

         <title>SuFEx&#8208;Enabled Polypeptide: Creating Diversified Properties with Minimal Preset Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) moiety can be installed on amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides so that SuFEx click chemistry can be enabled on the corresponding polypeptides. By allowing the use of simple hydroxyl and amino groups on functional moieties of interest with minimal preset conditions, and utilizing the functionalities of SuFEx linkages, high throughput preparation of diverse functional polypeptides can be made possible.








Abstract
Facile but effective synthesis and functionalization of polypeptides has long been a challenge, blocking the way to further explorations of their properties and potential applications. Here, we report the incorporation of sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) moiety in amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides, which grant the resulting polypeptides from ring&#8208;opening polymerization the ability to utilize simple hydroxyl and amino groups on functional moieties of interest without the requirement for the introduction of preset conditions, such as reactive molecular anchors. We prepared series of polypeptides modified with sulfates or amidosulfonates (sulfamates), and importantly, we demonstrate that such linkages derived from SuFEx exhibit unique nature, which possibly benefits future biomaterial designs. In addition, the linkages can synergize with incorporated functionalizing moieties, demonstrated in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example in which the sulfate&#8208;linked, saccharide&#8208;modified polypeptides showed outstanding antiviral activity and biocompatibility.

         <title>Synergistic Chalcogenate and Fluorine Engineering on Metal Oxyhydroxides Breaks the OER Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine bridge on NiFeOOH breaks the OER scaling relationship. It creates a distorted atomic interface that shortens hydrogen bonds and promotes proton transfer kinetics, lowering the theoretical overpotential from 0.37 to 0.27&#160;eV. Guided by theory, the synthesized catalyst achieves a breakthrough performance, delivering an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low overpotential of 304&#160;mV with exceptional stability.









Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a bottleneck in electrochemical water splitting, is fundamentally limited by a scaling relationship between the binding energies of key intermediates (OH* and OOH*), imposing a minimum theoretical overpotential of 0.37&#160;eV. Breaking this scaling relationship is crucial for enhancing OER activity, yet effective strategies remain scarce. We demonstrate that the introduction of high&#8208;electronegativity fluorion on chalcogenate&#8208;adsorbed nickel&#8208;iron oxyhydroxide (NiFeOOH) significantly shortens hydrogen bonds between the chalcogenate and OER intermediates (*OH and *OOH). This shortening promotes proton transfer kinetics and lowers the theoretical overpotential to 0.27&#160;eV. Guided by these calculations, the co&#8208;adsorption of chalcogenate and fluorion on metal oxyhydroxide (NiFeSF&#8208;R) catalyst is synthesized, and it achieves 1.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at an ultralow overpotential of 304&#160;mV in 1.0&#160;M KOH, a substantial improvement of 106 and 182&#160;mV compared to NiFeS&#8208;R and NiFe, respectively. Notably, NiFeSF&#8208;R exhibits exceptional stability, sustaining 1.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 for over 500&#160;h with negligible degradation. In an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the NiFeSF&#8208;R anode stably achieves 1.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at 1.73&#160;V for 700&#160;h at 50&#160;&#176;C. This work highlights the potential of local coordination environment tuning to break scaling relationships for high&#8208;performance OER catalysts.

         <title>Indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene Quasi[8]circulenes Through Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of curved, chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emerges from the fusion of indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene and quasi[8]circulene motifs. These redox&#8208;active, antiaromatic scaffolds offer great synthetic utility, tunable properties, and modular functionalities for organic electronics and functional materials. 








Abstract
The study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has become a cornerstone of chemical sciences, providing crucial guidance for advancing a wide range of fields. Within this context, quasi[8]circulenes and indenofluorenes (IFs) have gained considerable attention due to their rich chiroptical, optoelectronic, supramolecular, and redox properties. However, their combined integration into a single molecular framework has not yet been realized. This work demonstrates that curved indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes are easily accessible through an intramolecular cyclization of a readily available helicene diketone. The cyclization is high yielding and accompanied by an unexpected regioselective triflation that&#8212;alongside both ketones&#8212;allows orthogonal functionalization. This synthetic utility offers great potential for incorporating 8&#8208;membered rings and formally antiaromatic as&#8208;indacene moieties into complex architectures. Herein, a series of fully conjugated antiaromatic indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes were synthesized and studied spectroscopically and electrochemically, showcasing the rich properties of these rare, purely carbon&#8208;based quasi[8]circulenes. It is shown that the studied compounds display multiple accessible redox states at mild potentials, which can be significantly altered through adequate substituents. These substituents additionally induce unprecedented aggregation behavior for one of the compounds. Furthermore, the studied IFs exhibit chirality arising from the curved structure of the quasi[8]circulenes, which allowed studying chiroptical properties for one of the structures.

         <title>Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Reaction of Non&#8208;Activated Oximes Catalyzed by Aldoxime Dehydratases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic mode of aldoxime dehydratases for the abiotic radical ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketoximes is reported. Aldoxime dehydratase from Nocardioides simplex was found to efficiently generate iminyl radicals from challenging &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; cycloketone oximes and to promote radical ring&#8208;opening reactions to produce &#947;&#8208; and &#949;&#8208;sulfinylated nitriles under mild conditions. 








Abstract
The iminyl radical is a distinctive N&#8208;centered radical which serves as a versatile synthon in preparation of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. In principle, iminyl radicals can be directly generated by single electron reduction of oximes through elimination of OH group. However, due to the low reactivity of the oxime N&#9472;OH bonds, direct conversion of the oximes does not proceed efficiently, thereby enforcing chemical activation of the oxime OH group which results in the formation of stoichiometric by&#8208;products. To overcome this problem, we are developing a new biocatalytic system using aldoxime dehydratases. Through a series of enzyme screenings, we identified an aldoxime dehydratase from N. simplex (NsOxd) which is capable of catalyzing iminyl radical&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening reactions. Notably, NsOxd efficiently converts the &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; 2&#8208;phenylcyclobutanone oxime within 10&#160;min under ambient conditions and quantitatively produces the corresponding &#947;&#8208;sulfinylated nitrile in &gt;95% yield. This enzyme activity is even faster than that of previously&#8208;reported chemo&#8208;catalysts. Furthermore, evaluation of the scope of potential substrates indicates that NsOxd has a versatile N&#9472;O bond cleaving activity which efficiently generates iminyl radicals from various &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; oximes. These findings highlight the utility of aldoxime dehydratases for managing the reactivity of &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; oximes and for achieving challenging iminyl radical&#8208;mediated catalytic reactions.

         <title>Bioorthogonal In Situ Formation of AIE Luminogens for Imaging Disease Progression via Sigmoidal Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal strategy featuring a double&#8208;lock mechanism has been developed for the in situ formation of AIEgens, enabling ultralow background, up to 1033&#8208;fold fluorescence turn&#8208;on, and sigmoidal amplification for high&#8208;sensitivity, multiplexed live&#8208;cell imaging and effective disease monitoring.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens are promising tools for biological imaging, yet their utility is often limited by nonspecific aggregation and elevated background fluorescence. Here, we present a bioorthogonal in situ formation strategy that enables precise, organelle&#8208;specific activation of AIEgens within live cells. This system employs a dual&#8208;lock mechanism&#8212;combining tetrazine quenching and twisted intramolecular charge shuttle (TICS) dynamics&#8212;to maintain an ultra&#8208;low fluorescence background in the precursor state, even under aggregating conditions. Upon bioorthogonal reactions and molecular aggregation, the resulting AIEgens exhibit tunable emission peaks ranging from 605 to 665&#160;nm, large Stokes shifts (up to 201&#160;nm), and an exceptional fluorescence enhancement (up to 1033&#8208;fold). Their high biocompatibility and spatial precision allow for multiplexed, simultaneous labeling of intracellular targets. Compared to conventional fluorogenic and bioorthogonal probes, these AIEgens exhibit a sigmoidal amplification response, enabling the sensitive discrimination of subtle biomarker expression differences and the effective identification of injured cells during disease progression. This strategy significantly enhances the specificity and sensitivity of live&#8208;cell imaging, expands the functional utility of AIE luminogens, and offers a versatile platform for high&#8208;resolution, multiplexed bioimaging in biomedical research and diagnostics.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed trans&#8208;Hydrostannation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily accessible and cheap iron complex is capable of catalyzing highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrostannation reactions of terminal alkyl alkynes as well as the stannylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. The addition likely follows a &#8220;modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8221; mechanism; the intervention of iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded.








Abstract
The readily accessible iron complex [Cp*FeCl(tmeda)] is an effective catalyst for the highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrostannylation of terminal alkyl alkynes, affording a type of alkenylstannanes that is difficult to make otherwise. The R3Sn&#8208; moiety is faithfully delivered to the terminal C&#8208;atom, unless a propargylic or homo&#8208;propargylic &#9472;OH or &#9472;NH2 group is present in the substrate, which (partly or fully) inverts the regiochemical course; this steering effect, however, can be switched off upon protection of the protic site. The trans&#8208;addition likely starts by insertion of the [Cp*FeCl] fragment into the R3Sn&#9472;H bond, followed by a migratory insertion of the ligated alkyne into the Fe&#9472;Sn unit of the Fe(IV) species thus formed. This &#8220;modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8221; mechanism is manifested in a stannylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enyne derivatives, which has hardly any precedent either; a pathway via iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded on the basis of deuterium labeling experiments.

In their Research Article (e202502187), Keira Mori, Takahiro Muraoka, and co&#8208;workers developed a bifunctional compound containing metal&#8208;binding ligands and a redox&#8208;active disulfide, namely cyclam&#8208;SS, whose oxidative strength is up&#8208;regulated under metal stress for efficient protein folding. The cover image illustrates the bifunctional feature of cyclam&#8208;SS in the presence of stress&#8208;causing metal cations: suppression of metal&#8208;mediated protein misfolding and promotion of oxidative protein folding.

         <title>Low Symmetry Cage Complexes Formed by Metalation of Symmetric Hexa&#8208;Cationic Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threefold symmetric hexa&#8208;cationic hydrazone cages coordinate a range of transition metal ions upon deprotonation. When the cage contains ethyl solubilising groups the expected threefold symmetric cage complexes are observed, however when the cage contains alkoxy solubilising groups persistent low symmetry cage complexes form.








Abstract
Most metal organic cages are assembled through metal&#8211;ligand coordination, resulting in cages where the metal ions are part of the cage architecture, and thus have limited reactivity. There are only a handful of metal organic cages produced by metalation of a pre&#8208;synthesised organic cage. In this work, we show that hexa&#8208;cationic hydrazone cages coordinate a range of transition metal ions upon deprotonation to give cage complexes with metal ions oriented towards the cage cavity. Remarkably, a cage with ethyl solubilising groups gives the expected three&#8208;fold symmetric metallocage, cages with alkoxy solubilising groups give low&#8208;symmetry zinc metallocages, and a cage without a solubilising group switches between high and low symmetry conformations depending on solvent. These low symmetry arrangements persist on the NMR timescale at temperatures as high as 360&#160;K and in the presence of a wide range of anions.

         <title>A Solid&#8208;State Crystallization Strategy for Direct Enzyme Encapsulation in Zr&#8208;MOFs: Eliminating Harsh pH and Thermal Requirements of Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust Zr&#8208;MOFs synthesized via aqueous solid&#8208;state routes enabling one&#8208;pot enzyme encapsulation and enhanced catalytic stability in harsh conditions.








Abstract
Conventional syntheses of robust Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) rely on harsh solvothermal conditions, precluding the inclusion of fragile functionalities such as enzymes or organisms. Therefore, developing routes to such stable frameworks under ambient conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a mild aqueous solid&#8208;state crystallization (SSC) strategy that enables Zr&#8208;MOF assembly at ambient temperature. This approach transforms an amorphous precursor into a crystalline framework via water&#8208;mediated dynamic ligand exchange. Solid&#8208;state 13C NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal an acid&#8208;catalyzed associative substitution mechanism at Zr6 nodes, in which formate modulators are protonated and displaced by fumarate linkers, driving MOF&#8208;801 crystallization without external heating or organic solvent. We further apply this SSC method to other Zr&#8208;MOFs, including functionalized UiO&#8208;66 analogues, establishing it as a general model for ambient MOF assembly. This amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline transformation represents a new synthetic paradigm for constructing stable porous frameworks under biocompatible conditions and enables the integration of sensitive biomolecules (e.g., enzymes) into robust MOFs. In addition, this method for MOF&#8208;801 formation is universally adaptable for encapsulating various proteins. The enzyme@Zr&#8208;MOF composites significantly enhance enzyme stability in catalytic reactions involving acidic products, demonstrating the necessity of robust Zr&#8208;MOF shells.

         <title>Stabilizing Highly Active Metastable Bi (101) Facet via Covalent Organic Frameworks to Break Activity&#8211;Stability Trade&#8208;off in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH Electrocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
This work breaks the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion by stabilizing the highly active metastable Bi (101) facet for the first time by tuning the electrochemical and thermodynamic steady states leveraging a covalent organic framework, delivering 98.7% selectivity, &gt;230&#160;h stability, and 350&#160;mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 partial current density at &#8722;1.0&#160;V in a flow cell. 








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) offers a sustainable route to convert greenhouse gases into value&#8208;added chemicals. Bismuth (Bi) has emerged as a promising electrocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion due to its low cost, nontoxicity, and favorable adsorption properties for the key *OCHO intermediate. However, its relatively contracted 5d and expanded 6p orbitals lead to inevitable thermodynamically driven structural reconstruction during eCO2RR, resulting in a persistent trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. Here, by tuning the balance between the electrochemical and thermodynamic steady states of layered Bi species leveraging interlayer interactions and spatial confinement provided by a two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF), we achieve the selective exposure and stable maintenance of the highly active, metastable Bi (101) facet during eCO2RR for the first time. The resulting catalyst achieves top&#8208;tier performance with 98.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.1% HCOOH selectivity, exceptional stability over 230&#160;h, and a flow cell HCOOH partial current density exceeding 350&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE, ranking it among the most efficient and stable electrocatalysts reported to date.

         <title>tert&#8208;Butyl Functionalized Ultra&#8208;Microporous Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient SF6/N2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a tert&#8208;butyl functionalized ultra&#8208;microporous three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) with high crystallinity and a large surface area. Static adsorption and dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate excellent SF6 adsorption performance and high SF6/N2 selectivity, underscoring the importance of pore surface engineering for enhanced SF6/N2 separation efficiency.








Abstract
Efficient capture and recovery of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from SF6/N2 mixtures is critical for mitigating greenhouse effects and promoting gas recycling in the electronics industry. Herein, we report a novel ultra&#8208;microporous three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF), termed CPOF&#8208;12, enriched with tert&#8208;butyl groups. CPOF&#8208;12 exhibits a Brunauer&#8722;Emmett&#8722;Teller (BET) surface area of 1,140&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, a pore volume of 0.66&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, and a uniform pore size of 0.59&#160;nm, which closely matches the kinetic diameter of SF6 (0.52&#160;nm). Gas adsorption measurements reveal a high SF6 uptake of 2.20&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, along with an exceptional SF6/N2 selectivity of 149.4, calculated using ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). This study highlights the effectiveness of pore surface engineering in COFs for high&#8208;performance separation of greenhouse gases.

         <title>Probing Host&#8211;Guest Interactions via Conductance and Thermopower Measurements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fullerene encapsulation (C&#8326;&#8320;&#8834;UNMB, C&#8327;&#8320;&#8834;UNMB) in low&#8208;symmetry M&#8328;Lun4 molecular barrel (UNMB) leads to enhancement in conductance (&#8776;1.5 orders) and a lower thermopower with a positive Seebeck coefficient, indicating HOMO&#8208;dominated charge transport modulated by host&#8211;guest interactions.








Abstract
Host&#8211;guest interactions play a crucial role in molecular recognition, self&#8208;assembly, and the development of molecular electronic devices, which requires a fundamental understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationships. Significant progress has been made in studying charge transport within such systems; however, the correlation between molecular structure, conductance, and thermoelectric properties remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the conductance and thermoelectric properties of low&#8208;symmetry M&#8328;Lun4 molecular barrel (UNMB) and its fullerene&#8208;encapsulated derivatives (C&#8326;&#8320;&#8834;UNMB and C&#8327;&#8320;&#8834;UNMB). Conductance measurements performed using EGaIn setup reveal &#8776;1.5&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in current density upon guest&#8208;encapsulation, indicating a strong modulation in the electronic structure of UNMB framework. Additionally, thermopower measurements demonstrates an opposite trend to the conductance values&#8212;a decrease from +174.4&#160;&#177;&#160;19.0&#160;&#181;V K&#8722;1 for pristine UNMB to +85.3&#160;&#177;&#160;9.7&#160;&#181;V K&#8722;1 for C&#8326;&#8320;&#8834;UNMB and +90.9&#160;&#177;&#160;7.0&#160;&#181;V K&#8722;1 for C&#8327;&#8320;&#8834;UNMB. The positive sign of Seebeck coefficient indicates HOMO&#8208;dominated charge transport. We employed Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, which show a reduction in HOMO energy offset upon guest&#8208;encapsulation that validates the trends in conductance and thermopower measurements. To understand the underlying charge transport mechanism, we performed temperature&#8208;dependent conductance measurements that indicated a thermally activated hopping mechanism.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Fluorination in Dual&#8208;Halogen Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: A Case Study of New Li2HfCl6&#8722;xFx Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of dual&#8208;halogen solid electrolytes (SEs), based on a new Pnma phase of Li2HfCl6. By systematically fluorinating it to various degrees, Li2HfCl5.5F0.5 was identified as the optimal formulation. ASSBs assembled using it as the catholyte exhibited greatly enhanced electrochemical stability compared to those employing Li2HfCl6. We explicitly demonstrate that this is due to the formation of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated, LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, not enhanced anodic stability of the catholyte.








Abstract
Lithium metal chlorides are promising superionic conductors for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) due to their favorable mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, and good oxidative stability (up to &gt;4.2&#160;V versus Li/Li+). Nonetheless, chloride solid electrolytes (SEs) still undergo electrochemical degradation when paired with high&#8208;voltage cathodes such as LiNi0.85Co0.1Mn0.05O2. A viable strategy to enhance the intrinsic electrochemical stability of chloride electrolytes is to partially substitute Cl with F. By leveraging complementary insights from neutron and X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS), and electrochemical studies, we investigate the interplay between ionic and electronic conductivity, voltage stability, and overall battery performance of a family of new dual&#8208;halogen SEs&#8212;Li2HfCl6&#8722;xFx. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells utilizing Li2HfCl5.5F0.5 as the electrolyte demonstrate much&#8208;enhanced battery performance compared to Li2HfCl6. This improvement is mainly attributed to the formation of a kinetically stable LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), which inhibits detrimental reactions between the cathode and the SE, as revealed by ToF&#8208;SIMS studies. The findings from this study are applicable to other dual&#8208;halogen solid ionic conductors, offering valuable insights into the relationship between intrinsic electrochemical window (IEW), electronic and ionic conductivity, and battery performance in dual&#8208;halogen solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Exploring Mesoionic Imine&#8208;Carbodiimide (MII&#8208;CDI) Adducts: 1,3 H&#8208;Shift, N(I) Compounds and Guanidinate&#8208;Type Ligands</title>

We demonstrate the unique reactivity of a mesoionic imine with bis&#8208;aryl carbodiimides, forming an MII&#8208;CDI adduct at room temperature via a spontaneous 1,3&#8208;H shift. These MII&#8208;CDI adducts serve as important synthons for mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene&#8208;stabilized nitreones (I) and guanidinate&#8208;type ligands.








Abstract
In this study, we report our recent findings on the synthesis and reactivity of a novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;imine&#8208;type mesoionic imine&#8208;carbodiimide (MII&#8208;CDI) adduct. Unlike reported NHC&#8208;CDI adducts, formed by the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) with CDI, these zwitterionic compounds undergo a spontaneous 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift (1,3&#8208;H shift), resulting in guanidine&#8208;type compounds. The mechanism of this 1,3&#8208;H shift has been investigated through quantum chemical calculations. The MII&#8208;CDI adduct serves as a valuable synthon for the synthesis of mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene (MIC&#8208;ADC)&#8208;based nitreone (N(I)) compounds. We have conducted a detailed investigation into the electronic properties, chemical reactivity, and electrochemical behavior of these nitreone (N(I)) compounds. Additionally, the potential of these MII&#8208;CDI adducts as guanidinate ligands is explored. Our investigations here display the distinct reactivities of MII in contrast to their N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (NHI) congeners.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle Monolayer&#8208;Decorated Nanopipette Enabling in Situ Monitoring of Single&#8208;Cell Redox Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette was developed to visualize single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. Leveraging strong near&#8208;field coupling within the monolayer that forms uniform hotspots, our method enables highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of redox metabolism changes, which deepens the understanding of single&#8208;cell ferroptosis.








Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study of how single cells respond to redox perturbations is pivotal for predicting cell fate decisions. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)&#8208;active nanopipettes hold promise for single&#8208;cell analysis, yet challenges remain in achieving both signal sensitivity and reproducibility. Here, a plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette has been developed, which serves as a biomimetic endoscope to monitor single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. This is accomplished by the conformal transferring of gold nanoparticle monolayer onto the nanopipette followed by the functionalization of redox&#8208;responsive probes. The strong near&#8208;field coupling within monolayer forms uniform hotspots, enabling highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of SERS signals changes triggered by redox species. Modulated by the nanopipette technology, the endoscope allows for in situ monitoring of global redox states with low invasiveness and high spatial resolution. Further, study of ferroptosis events via simultaneous optical and electrical recording elucidates the correlation between redox imbalance and membrane damage during various ferroptosis&#8208;inducers stimulation, which has not been observed at the single&#8208;cell level. This work provides profound insights into the cellular redox dynamics, contributing to a deeper understanding of related physiopathological pathways.

         <title>Linking Metallacycle Transfer with Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis to Generate Polyacetylenes of Unprecedented Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unusual low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap polyacetylenes bearing ring&#8208;fused tellurophene and vinyl side chains were prepared by combining metallacycle transfer (Hf/p&#8208;block element exchange) with ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) into a single modular and efficient protocol. 








Abstract
A hafnium&#8208;based bicyclic precursor (COT&#8208;2B&#8208;Hf) has been prepared that enables tandem Hf/E metallacycle transfer (E&#160;=&#160;main group element) and the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclooctatetraene (COT) units to generate a new family of structurally unique polyacetylenes. Highlights from this work include a tellurophene&#8208;grafted polyacetylene, poly&#8208;COT&#8208;2B&#8208;Te, and a polyacetylene with unsaturated vinyl side chains, poly&#8208;COT&#8208;2B&#8208;vinyl. The resulting polymers can be processed into films that yield optical band gaps as low as 1.6&#160;eV, representing promising new architectures for the optoelectronics community.

         <title>Quantitative Tracking of Apoptotic Caspase&#8208;3 In Vivo for Early Evaluation of Radiation Therapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescence probe was developed to accurately quantify caspase&#8208;3 induced by radiotherapy in vivo by emitting a dual signal at 1550&#160;nm as a reference and response signal, respectively. The detection limit for caspase&#8208;3 was determined to be 9.96 U&#160;mL&#8722;1. The established early efficacy evaluation system can effectively predict the therapeutic outcome of cancer radiotherapy and guide the optimization of treatment plans.








Abstract
Traditional responsive fluorescent probes are predominantly restricted to qualitative biomarker detection, incapable of delivering real&#8208;time quantitative analysis or spatial mapping of protease activity in vivo, which is essential for elucidating disease progression. To overcome this, a ratiometric second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent (FL) probe (DCNP@IR&#8208;806) was developed by conjugating caspase&#8208;3&#8208;specific peptide substrates and sensitizer molecules (IR&#8208;806) to lanthanide&#8208;doped down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNP). DCNP@IR&#8208;806 achieves single&#8208;channel emission at 1550&#160;nm under dual excitation, facilitating self&#8208;calibrated quantification and real&#8208;time monitoring of activated caspase&#8208;3 in vivo. Radiotherapy induces tumor cell apoptosis, thereby activating caspase&#8208;3, which subsequently triggers a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II FL signal change of DCNP@IR&#8208;806. The ratiometric signal demonstrates a linear correlation with caspase&#8208;3 concentration, achieving a detection limit of 9.96 U&#160;mL&#8722;1. Then, an early efficacy assessment system capable of predicting radiotherapy outcomes within 12 h post&#8208;treatment was constructed, markedly expediting evaluation compared to traditional methods that require weeks. This rapid, precise, and user&#8208;friendly assessment facilitates timely optimization of therapeutic regimens to enhance efficacy while minimizing side effects. This platform represents a significant advancement in precision oncology by transitioning from qualitative imaging to in situ quantitative biomarker tracking.

         <title>Amide Chemistry Enables Redox Locking of Cyclic Disulfides for Polypeptide Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of a family of cyclic dichalcogenides derived from cysteine is significantly enhanced against reductants upon acylation of the alpha&#8208;amino group. Amide formation serves as a redox lock, offering a mechanism to achieve selectivity in the assembly of large cyclic polypeptides on a water&#8208;compatible solid support.

A practical strategy in synthetic organic chemistry for shutting down temporarily the nucleophilicity of thiols is to exploit their redox properties by converting them into disulfides. The stability of such a thiol protection in reductive medium can be sensitive to microenvironmental changes, including chemical modifications occurring nearby. Although difficult to achieve, large shifts in disulfide stability might provide a practical mean for bringing selectivity in a reacting system comprising multiple thiol functionalities. Here we report that the stability of a cyclic disulfide increases dramatically upon acylation of an amino group placed in the vicinity of the S&#9472;S bond. The gain in stability is so pronounced that the amide bond formation acts as a redox lock. We describe the application of such a redox switch to the chemoselective assembly of polypeptides by thiol&#8208;based peptide ligation chemistries.

&lt;p&gt;The stability of a family of cyclic dichalcogenides derived from cysteine is significantly enhanced against reductants upon acylation of the alpha-amino group. Amide formation serves as a redox lock, offering a mechanism to achieve selectivity in the assembly of large cyclic polypeptides on a water-compatible solid support.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Delocalized Cu2+ Activates Spin Channels in Spinel Oxides to Selectively Produce 1O2 for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an electron&#8208;delocalized strategy to unlock FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+ spin channel, inducing intermolecular electron transfer of two PMS for selective 1O2 generation. The directed electron transfer behavior not only maintains the catalyst stability, but also immensely reduces the 1O2 generation energy barrier and improves the PMS utilization.








Abstract
Blocked electron transfer in the catalyst during advanced oxidation processes causes sluggish singlet oxygen (1O2) generation efficiency and sacrifices catalyst stability. In this work, we propose an electron&#8208;delocalization strategy that unlocks ATd2+&#9472;O&#9472;BOh3+ electron&#8208;transfer pathways within spinel oxide (Cu0.8Fe2.2O4), inducing the intermolecular electron transfer of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for selective 1O2 generation. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the electron&#8208;delocalized Cu2+ triggers a high spin&#8208;state of O in FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+, thus creating a spin channel for the spontaneous intermolecular electron transfer of PMS from the FeOh3+ adsorption site to the FeTd2+ adsorption site through FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+. This process allows for the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of PMS, thereby reducing the energy barriers for the formation of SO4&#8226;&#8722; and SO5&#8226;&#8722; radicals. Subsequently, the interfacial SO4&#8226;&#8722; rapidly oxidizes SO5&#8226;&#8722; into 1O2, enhancing 1O2 generation efficiency without sacrificing catalyst stability. The selectivity of 1O2 in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system reaches 98.4%. Multiple pollutants are removed in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system without interference from coexisting substances. The scale&#8208;up experiment realizes 100% contaminant removal during the continuous operation process (48&#160;h). This work exhibits a novel strategy for selective 1O2 generation to achieve the goal of practical applications.

         <title>Integrated Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of the mRNA Vaccine Building Block N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Triphosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudouridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (&#936;TP) and its N1&#8208;methylated derivative (m1&#936;TP) are crucial components in mRNA vaccine technology. Here, an atom&#8208;economic, high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route for &#936;TP synthesis is presented. A new chemoenzymatic route for m1&#936;TP synthesis was developed. The method offers enhanced reaction efficiency and sustainability compared to pure chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Pseudouridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (&#936;TP) and its N1&#8208;methylated derivative (m1&#936;TP) are critical monomer building blocks of mRNA therapeutics, yet efficient, scalable methods of their synthesis from readily accessible substrates remain underdeveloped. m1&#936;TP is a major cost factor of production of the current COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. We herein report a notably atom&#8208;economic and high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route toward &#936;TP and present two chemoenzymatic routes for producing m1&#936;TP at &#8764;200&#160;mg scale of isolated compound. Biocatalytic cascade rearrangement of uridine delivered &#936;MP or &#936; in high yields. Acetonide&#8208;protected &#936;MP was selectively N1&#8208;methylated using dimethyl sulfate and subsequently converted to the triphosphate through efficient kinase cascade reaction. Saccharomyces cerevisiae uridine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate kinase was shown for ATP&#8208;dependent phosphorylation of m1&#936;MP to m1&#936;DP and m1&#936;TP synthesis was catalyzed by Escherichia coli acetate kinase which also served to regenerate ATP by acetyl phosphate. Benchmarked against chemical route converting the enzymatically produced &#936; into m1&#936;TP, the novel chemoenzymatic route from &#936;MP offered improved metrics of reaction efficiency and sustainability. The synthetic &#936;TP and m1&#936;TP replaced UTP for mRNA synthesis by in vitro transcription. Overall, this study shows the productive integration of chemical methylation with enzymatic cascade reactions for C&#9472;C coupling and phosphorylation toward an efficient preparation of m1&#936;TP.

         <title>Bone&#8208;Inspired Sustainable Hydrogel Electrolytes for Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a bone&#8208;inspired hydrogel electrolyte (Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel) using Zn&#8208;doped hydroxyapatite (Zn&#8208;HA) nanofibers and a gelatin matrix derived from animal bones. Its bone&#8208;like structural composition ensured excellent sustainability, water retention ability, and mechanical properties, addressing Zn anode issues. The zinc superionic conductor Zn&#8208;HA created dual Zn2&#8314; transport channels, accelerating desolvation and enhancing AZMB performance.








Abstract
Hydrogels are promising electrolytes for use in aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZMBs). However, the problems associated with the Zn anodes cannot be eliminated using current hydrogel electrolytes, and their poor sustainability has also been neglected. We have developed a bone&#8208;inspired hydrogel electrolyte (Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel) composed of Zn&#8208;doped hydroxyapatite (Zn&#8208;HA) nanofibers and a gelatin matrix derived from animal bones. The bone&#8208;like structure and strong molecular interactions in the biodegradable, recyclable, and biocompatible components endow Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel with excellent sustainability, water retention, and mechanical properties, which solves the problems currently associated with Zn anodes. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;HA superionic conductor exhibits an ultrahigh intrinsic ionic conductivity and accelerated Zn2+ desolvation process. The dual&#8208;channels for Zn2+ transport in Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel result in high ionic conductivity (32.5 mS cm&#8722;1) and transference number (0.80), facilitating uniform Zn plating/stripping and durable working stability. As a result, Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel ensures ultrastable cycling performance with a cumulative capacity of 5 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/5 mAh cm&#8722;2 for Zn/Zn cells and a superior cycling performance with a capacity retention of 82.4% after 2000 cycles for full cells, surpassing the capabilities of current hydrogel electrolytes, and has potential applications in sustainable and functional energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Chemoselectivity in the Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Pentafulvenes via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) Alkyne Cyclotrimerization</title>

Chemoselectivity Challenge: A precise catalyst design allows for chemoselectivity control over alkyne reactivity to yield pentafulvenes via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) cyclotrimerization. Operative mechanism has been elucidated by means of stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations.








Abstract
The synthesis of pentafulvenes with varied substituents has been efficiently achieved using novel rhodium&#8208;based catalysts via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) alkyne cyclotrimerization. A rational design of the catalyst structure, including pyridonato, NHC, and CO ligands, ensures the alkyne chemoselectivity and prevents the formation of robust rhodium&#8208;fulvene species. Furthermore, the judicious choice of acidity and steric properties of different alkynes enables the preparation of cross&#8208;coupled fulvene derivatives. Stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations, shed light on the reaction mechanism, showing that it includes an initial alkyne deprotonation, two successive alkyne insertions, cyclization, and protonolysis, the first insertion being the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>A Butterfly&#8208;Like Fluorescent Tracker for Dynamic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamics of reversible polymerization could be visualized using a butterfly&#8208;shaped fluorescent tracker. The emission color showed strong dependence on the microenvironmental confinement within the dynamic polymers, correlating with molecular weight, backbone structure, conformation, and aggregation state. The dynamic polymerization of poly(disulfide)s could be tracked via the multicolored emission of the fluorescent probe, demonstrating high sensitivity to a wide range of poly(disulfide)s.








Abstract
Optically tracking constitutional dynamics provides a time&#8208;resolved, non&#8208;invasive, and visually interpretable approach to unraveling microscopic complexity in system chemistry. Here we report a butterfly&#8208;like fluorescent tracker, featuring excited&#8208;state conformational adaptivity, capable of sensing the subtle microscopic dynamics of polymers as a ratiometric fluorescent probe. The key design is coupling the fluorophore's conformational relaxation dynamics to microenvironmental constraints imposed by polymer structural features&#8212;such as chain length, conformation, and inter&#8208;/intramolecular interactions. By employing the fluorophore as a bifunctional initiator, we grafted two dynamic polymer chains onto its phenyl &#8220;wings&#8221;, creating a single&#8208;fluorophore tracker that dynamically interacts with its environment. This system functions as a highly sensitive ratiometric probe, optically reporting microscopic polymer dynamics in real time, including polymerization kinetics, chain folding/unfolding transitions, and depolymerization processes. Systematic studies demonstrate the broad applicability of this concept across diverse polymeric systems, with distinct emission signatures enabling differentiation between systems. The probe's ability to correlate fluorescence output with microenvironmental changes reveals its utility in both fundamental and applied contexts. We anticipate this conformationally adaptive fluorescent platform will advance research in dynamic chemistry, particularly for real&#8208;time monitoring of polymeric systems and the development of responsive materials.

         <title>Titanium&#8211;Polyoxometalate Crosslinked Metallo&#8211;Supramolecular Polymer as Artificial Interfacial Layer for Highly Persistent and Low&#8211;Temperature Tolerant Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>An advanced metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymer is designed and synthesized by utilizing a titanium&#8211;polyoxometalate (Ti&#8208;POM) to bridge organic and inorganic moieties, and it is utilized as an anodic interfacial protective layer (MSP&#8208;IPL) to stabilize lithium metal anodes. The MSP&#8208;IPL possesses superior ion&#8208;transfer ability and outstanding electrochemical/ambient stability. The uniformly distributed Ti&#8208;POMs can effectively bind with PF6&#8722;, enhancing Li+ transference number (tLi+&#160;= 0.607), promoting uniform distribution of Li+ flux.








Abstract
The uncontrolled lithium (Li) dendrite growth and fragile native solid electrolyte interphase formation have severely hindered the practical development of Li metal batteries. Herein, a coordinatively cross&#8208;linked metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymer as anodic interfacial protective layer (MSP&#8208;IPL) is developed by utilizing titanium(IV)&#8211;polyoxometalates (Ti&#8208;POMs) as hexatopic linkers to bridge organic and inorganic moieties. The constructed MSP&#8208;IPL possesses high electrochemical stability, superior ion&#8208;transfer ability, and good air stability. Due to its high film formation uniformity and mechanical tenacity, the MSP&#8208;IPL can effectively avoid nonuniform Li deposition caused by the tip effect, thus inhibiting Li dendrite proliferation. The uniformly distributed Ti&#8208;POMs in polymer skeleton can efficiently bind with PF6&#8722; anions, thus increasing Li+ transference number and promoting homogeneous Li+ distribution. The reprocessability and self&#8208;healing ability endowed by dynamic coordination bonds enable the MSP&#8208;IPL to accommodate electrode volume changes and maintain good interface contact. Consequently, high&#8208;loading Li||LiFePO4 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries based on MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li anodes demonstrate impressive cyclability and extraordinary rate capability. Even at a low temperature of &#8722;20 &#176;C, the MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li||NCM811 batteries can still cycle stably for over 500 cycles (equivalent to 138 days) with a considerable capacity retention of 86.8%. This work presents a promising solution for developing practical low&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries.

         <title>Reversing Blocking Order of Trithiocarbonate&#8208;Mediated RAFT Polymerizations Using Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acrylic&#8208;methacrylic block copolymers have limited accessibility due to monomer order requirements in reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques leading to a vast landscape of block copolymers being understudied. Using unique PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization conditions, a controlled chain extension of poly(methyl acrylate) with methyl methacrylate could be performed resulting in a high&#8208;molecular weight thermoplastic elastomer.








Abstract
Many acrylic&#8211;methacrylic block copolymer sequences remain inaccessible due to synthetic limitations. Herein, photoinduced electron/energy transfer (PET) catalysis is leveraged to reverse blocking order limitations in trithiocarbonate (TTC)&#8208;mediated reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. We synthesized poly(methyl acrylate&#8208;b&#8208;methyl methacrylate) by PET&#8208;RAFT using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3, achieving predictable, linear increases in molecular weight with conversion. Kinetics studies showed that adding a tertiary amine (triethanolamine) introduced a reversible redox reaction to stabilize the TTC radical during chain extensions, leading to more uniform block copolymers (&#208;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.47) compared to block copolymers synthesized without amine (&#208;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.56). To highlight the utility of this method, triblock copolymers of poly(methyl acrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) blocks were investigated. The order of acrylic and methacrylic blocks impacted the physical properties of compositionally similar polymeric materials. For example, a high molecular weight triblock copolymer (P(MMA&#8208;b&#8208;MA&#8208;b&#8208;MMA), Mn&#160;=&#160;564&#160;kg mol&#8722;1) thermoplastic elastomer showed exceptional strain (&gt;1600%). Overall, we report (i) a new methodology to unlock synthetic access to acrylic&#8211;methacrylic block copolymers using TTCs and photocatalysis, (ii) insight into photocatalyst&#8208;mediated radical polymerization, and (iii) synthesis of new high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Si/Carbon&#8208;dots with Surface N&#8208;C Sites Promoting Proton and Electron Transfers in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH step is considered the rate&#8208;determining step in the oxygen reduction reaction. Silane chain&#8208;grafted carbon dots with N&#8208;C active sites help overcome the energy barrier through promoting proton and electron transfers, thereby enhancing H2O2 production in photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can proceed through either a two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron pathway, both of which are important for a wide range of applications. The intermediate conversion of *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH recognized as the rate&#8208;determining step in ORR, with its efficiency strongly dependent on the nature of active sites at the surface of a catalyst. Herein, Si&#8208;supported carbon dots (Si&#8208;CDs) are introduced as cocatalysts in a photocatalytic system, where their nitrogen&#8211;carbon sites play a pivotal role in lowering the energy barrier for *OOH formation by promoting proton and electron transfers, thus enhancing the H2O2 production rate in ORR. This strategy is broadly applicable across a wide range of photocatalysts, both with and without use of sacrificial agents. The H2O2 production rate for Zn0.5Cd0.5S (30&#160;mg) increased from 13.0 to 40.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 when 0.6&#160;mg of Si&#8208;CDs were added. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulations are conducted to reveal the reaction pathway and the reduced energy requirements for the *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH conversion. This study provides a unique example of overcoming a key barrier in ORR using a metal&#8208;free catalyst and promotes potential applications in various fields.

         <title>Transition Metal Atom&#8211;Cluster Synergistic Modification with Tuned d&#8208;band Center Imparts Longevous Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal atom&#8211;cluster synergistic strategy modifies the aluminum current collector to enhance potassiophilicity, increase nucleation density and induce 3D progressive nucleation mode, thereby ensuring a dendrite&#8208;free potassium anode toward robust potassium metal batteries.








Abstract
The tailored nucleation and growth of potassium metal over a current collector is essential to realize longevous potassium metal anodes. The commercial current collector lacks sufficient nucleation sites and fails to guide uniform deposition, underscoring the request for interfacial modulation maneuvers. Herein, we develop transition metal atom&#8211;cluster moiety decorated N&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanosphere to modify the Al current collector. In a Fe model system, the Fe single atoms provide high surface energy and fast charge transfer, while Fe clusters serve as local electron reservoirs. This cooperative architecture manages to tune the d&#8208;band center, accordingly promoting the potassium capture and minimizing the nucleation overpotential to merely 4&#160;mV. Theoretical simulations and in situ microscopic/spectroscopic characterizations evidence that the synergistic modification markedly accelerates potassium plating/stripping kinetics, enabling prolonged symmetric&#8208;cell cycling (approaching 3000&#160;h) and stabilized full&#8208;cell performance (0.022% decay rate per cycle over 2000 cycles). This strategy could be extended to other transition metals (e.g., Co, Ni, or Cu), offering a paradigm for atomic&#8208;level interfacial engineering toward reversible alkali metal batteries.

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence from Isolated Molecules Through Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a series of highly efficient circularly polarized phosphorescence films were achieved by doping heterocyclic molecules containing a chiral propionic acid group into a polymer matrix, with the highest phosphorescence efficiency reaching up to 68.4% under ambient conditions. Notably, the chiral propionic acid group not only imparts circular polarization to the emitter but also enhances intermolecular interactions between the host and emitter.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with circularly polarization feature attracts considerable attentions owing to its unique exciton and photon properties. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) under ambient conditions remains a major challenge. Herein, we report a series of CPP films by doping heterocyclic molecules with a chiral propionic acid group into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix, achieving a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 68.4% under ambient conditions. The intermolecular interactions between the chiral isolated molecules and PVA simultaneously induce circularly polarized luminescence and enhance phosphorescence efficiency, thereby improving CPP performance. Moreover, the CPP lifetimes of the films can be rationally tuned from 1 to 944&#160;ms by subtle modification of heteroatoms on the heterocyclic chromophores. This study provides a promising approach to developing efficient CPP materials for potential applications in optoelectronics and bioelectronics.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Activity of Cu4 Clusters Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a tetranuclear copper cluster as a model, we modulated coordination microenvironments to boost electrocatalytic nitrate reduction performance, uncovering atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity correlations and offering precise ligand&#8208;engineering strategies for advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Surface ligands play a crucial role in modifying catalytic environments and enhancing performance through various mechanisms. However, the multivariate synergistic mechanisms, dynamic evolution patterns, and universal design principles of ligand effects remain to be thoroughly investigated. Metal clusters, with their atomically precise structures, serve as ideal models for studying ligand regulation mechanisms. Herein, we synthesized two copper clusters of N,S&#8208;bidentate ligand&#8208;protected Cu4(PTI)4 and Cu4(BTT)4 featuring identical metallic core structures but distinct ligand architectures and evaluated their catalytic performance for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). Notably, the Cu4(PTI)4 cluster with stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands achieved near&#8208;100% Faradaic efficiency at optimal potentials, significantly surpassing the Cu4(BTT)4. Through in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we unveiled that enhancing the electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of ligands induces alterations in the local microenvironment and electronic structure of metal active sites, thereby exerting positive impacts on electrocatalytic NO3RR performance.

         <title>Transforming Single&#8208;Atom Site to Dual&#8208;Atom Site in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts: A Universal Strategy for Enhancing Durability in Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a general strategy to transform FeN4 single&#8208;atom sites to Fe2N6 dual&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits highly active, selective, and strong H2O2 decomposition capability for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells. 








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is the most promising non&#8208;noble metal oxygen reduction catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, their practical applications are still limited by unsatisfactory long&#8208;term stability. This is because the N atoms of the active FeN4 moiety are easy to protonate, leading to the leaching of Fe atoms, and the H2O2 generated during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process triggers the Fenton reaction, further accelerating the dissolution of Fe. To address these critical stability challenge, we developed a general strategy to transform FeN4 single&#8208;atom sites to Fe2N6 dual&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. This is achieved by treating the presynthesized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in a H2/Ar atmosphere to break the C&#9472;N bonds near the FeN4 sites while introducing Fe and N precursors to form the Fe2N6 sites. Our theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the newly formed Fe2N6 sites are structurally more stable in acidic ORR and produce negligible H2O2 (&lt;1%). Therefore, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits an extremely low Fe demetalation ratio (0.61 at%) in 0.1&#160;M HClO4 after 80k cycling. More surprisingly, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst can effectively decompose H2O2 with a high decomposition rate of 15.7&#160;mmol min&#8722;1, approaching that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Pt/C catalyst (17&#160;mmol min&#8722;1). As a result, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst assembled PEMFC operates stably for 300&#160;h with only 7% current density attenuation, whereas that of the pristine Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst&#8208;based device declines by 84% within 100&#160;h.

     alt="Transforming Single-Atom Site to Dual-Atom Site in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts: A Universal Strategy for Enhancing Durability in Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work develops a general strategy to transform FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom sites to Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; dual-atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits highly active, selective, and strong H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition capability for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is the most promising non-noble metal oxygen reduction catalyst for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, their practical applications are still limited by unsatisfactory long-term stability. This is because the N atoms of the active FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; moiety are easy to protonate, leading to the leaching of Fe atoms, and the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generated during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process triggers the Fenton reaction, further accelerating the dissolution of Fe. To address these critical stability challenge, we developed a general strategy to transform FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom sites to Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; dual-atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. This is achieved by treating the presynthesized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ar atmosphere to break the C&#9472;N bonds near the FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites while introducing Fe and N precursors to form the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; sites. Our theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the newly formed Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; sites are structurally more stable in acidic ORR and produce negligible H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;lt;1%). Therefore, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits an extremely low Fe demetalation ratio (0.61 at%) in 0.1&#160;M HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; after 80k cycling. More surprisingly, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst can effectively decompose H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a high decomposition rate of 15.7&#160;mmol min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, approaching that of the state-of-the art Pt/C catalyst (17&#160;mmol min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). As a result, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst assembled PEMFC operates stably for 300&#160;h with only 7% current density attenuation, whereas that of the pristine Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst-based device declines by 84% within 100&#160;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coherently Coupled Frustrated Lewis Pairs in In2O3&#8722;x Nanoclusters for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) were constructed on the graphitic carbon nitride support, leveraging the privileged hydrogen&#8208;bond sewing interface. Significantly, the built&#8208;in electric fields and particularly multisite architecture reshape the kinetic landscapes in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The downstream reduction follows the formate pathway, which preferentially inhibits CO production while promotes CH4 formation. 








Abstract
Co&#8208;catalysts integration presents unique opportunities to enhance photoactivity, yet selectivity control and mechanistic understanding within multistep reactions remain fundamental challenges hitherto. In this study, a reshaped kinetic landscape is demonstrated over coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) on carbon nitride matrix, which mediates directed CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion with a selectivity of 65.3% (electron basis). The hydrogen&#8208;bonded interface fosters intimate electronic coupling, generating built&#8208;in electric fields that facilitate cascade charge transfer processes. Particularly, exceptionally robust FLPs sites were identified within the sub&#8208;nanosized In2O3&#8722;x nanoclusters, in contrast to easily deactivated counterparts in oversized crystalline structures. These enduring FLPs sites confer privileged adaptive binding with CO2 and mutative C1 intermediates. Correlated in situ infrared and mass spectroscopic analyses track the formation of FLPs&#8208;CO2 adducts and highlight the predominance of formate (HCOO&#8722;) pathway, surpassing competitive CO evolution. This work opens inspiring prospects for exploring multielectron photochemistry and achievable metrics through distinctive FLPs topologies on sub&#8208;nanostructures.

         <title>Improving Mass Transport and Charge Transfer in COF&#8208;Based Photocatalysts With Three&#8208;Dimensional Ordered Macropores for Benzylamine Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step self&#8208;sacrificing template strategy enables the synthesis of 3DOM&#8208;COFs with ordered macropores. Coupled with ZnCdS, the resulting S&#8208;scheme heterojunction efficiently catalyzes benzylamine oxidation and H&#8322; evolution. The 3DOM structure accelerates mass transfer and charge transfer, enhancing overall photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown promise as photocatalysts for chemical transformations. However, their dense micropores and poor pore connectivity hinder mass transport and charge separation/transfer, limiting their efficiency. Herein, we develop a one&#8208;step self&#8208;sacrificing template strategy to synthesize three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous COFs (3DOM&#8208;COFs). This approach uniquely integrates in situ Tp&#8211;Tta COF crystallization with synchronized degradation of polystyrene templates under solvothermal conditions. This method introduces unreported kinetic match between template decomposition and framework growth. Such a confined growth mechanism leads to structurally robust and highly ordered macroporosity without post&#8208;processing. 3DOM architecture enables uniform dispersion of fine ZnCdS nanoparticles for the generation a 3DOM&#8208;COF based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction, which exhibits remarkable performance in the oxidation of benzylamine (BA) for simultaneous N&#8208;benzylbenzaldimine production with 99% selectivity at a rate of 15.1&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and H2 generation with a rate of 17.8&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. The 3DOM architecture confers 50&#8208;fold faster mass transport than bulk COFs, while the heterojunction facilitates directional charge separation and interface charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the heterojunction optimizes reaction thermodynamics by lowering the potential energy barriers of BA activation. The work pioneers a template&#8208;concurrent synthesis paradigm, resolving COFs' critical pore engineering challenges.

         <title>Merging One&#8208; and Multi&#8208;Photon Processes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Enhanced NIR Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal and Photochemical Conversions</title>

This work demonstrates a paradigm for the development of highly stable and multifunctional HOF materials to enable the full&#8208;spectrum utilization of sunlight, which is achieved through a dual&#8208;process mechanism involving one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitations, facilitated by direct absorption of NIR light within a single HOF platform, for synergistically enhanced performance in photothermal, photochemical, and chiroptical applications.








Abstract
Direct application of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for solar&#8208;thermal and solar&#8208;chemical conversions is of emergent interest to improving efficiency in solar&#8208;energy utilization. Herein, we report a synthetic approach to NIR&#8208;responsive materials by self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;1/2/3) from multifunctionalized Ru&#8208;components incorporating chiral, photoactive, H&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;stacking, and protonation/deprotonation subunits. Significantly, protonation of the imidazole&#8208;subunits in HOF&#8208;3 promotes densified packing to extend NIR absorption tail up to 1100&#160;nm with a narrowed bandgap of 1.41&#160;eV, meanwhile leads to spontaneous resolution of enantiomeric &#916;&#8208;/&#923;&#8208;HOF&#8208;3. Consequently, remarkably enhanced photothermal effect and photocatalytic performance, including chiroptical activity induced by circularly polarized NIR light, are achieved through synergy of direct one&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon NIR absorption, underscoring effectiveness to bring multifunctionalities into ordered HOFs for generation of robust and effective materials with multimode NIR responsiveness.

A ROMP&#8208;RAFT cascade polymerization strategy was designed to synthesize polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers, which were employed as compatibilizers to upcycle mixed plastics.








Abstract
Plastic disposal has become a serious environmental and social problem. Mechanical recycling of waste plastics is the most widely adopted strategy to address this issue, but if used to recycle mixed plastics, it usually requires the addition of amphiphilic block copolymers. Polyolefins account for almost half of all synthetic plastics, making them ubiquitous in the plastic waste stream. Within this perspective, polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers are highly desirable, but they are difficult to access using traditional strategies. In this contribution, a cascade ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization strategy was developed to prepare various polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers with tunable polar segments and microstructures. Using this strategy, tunable amounts of the trithiocarbonate RAFT agents were installed in the polyolefin main chain via ROMP. Subsequent chain extension of various polar vinyl monomers via controlled RAFT polymerization formed various polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers with high molecular weight and good physical properties. These multiblock copolymers were used to compatibilize and upcycle mixtures of high&#8208;density polyethylene/polymethyl methacrylate (HDPE/PMMA) and high&#8208;density polyethylene/polyethylene terephthalate (HDPE/PET).

A butterfly&#8208;like fluorescent molecular tracker is designed to make dynamic polymerization processes visible and colorful. In their Research Article (e202507770), Qi Zhang and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the use of a conformationally flipping fluorescent dye that senses subtle microenvironmental changes and emits multicolor fluorescence to visualize the dynamics in reversible polymerization of cyclic disulfides. This molecular optical tool enables a real&#8208;time and sensitive way to monitor polymeric systems.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Intracellular Delivery of Native Proteins by BioReversible Arginine Modification (BioRAM) on Amino Groups (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 34/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native proteins are typically not cell&#8208;permeable, making intracellular delivery a significant challenge. The cover image illustrates the model protein RNase A, which is transiently modified with polyarginine chains (orange) attached to lysine residues. In combination with the CPP&#8208;Additive technology, the resulting bioconjugate is able to translocate across the lipid membrane of human cells. Details are reported in the Research Article (e202506802) by Christian Hackenberger et&#160;al.

         <title>Anisotropy of Single&#8208;Crystal Semiconductors in Photo(electro)Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes how crystallographic anisotropy in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors governs light absorption, charge separation, and surface reactions, offering mechanistic insights and design guidelines for high&#8208;performance photo(electro)catalysts through material synthesis, theoretical modeling, and advanced characterization techniques.








Abstract
Anisotropy in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors has emerged as a key design principle for understanding and advancing photo(electro)catalytic systems. The exposure of well&#8208;defined facets in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors introduces anisotropic variations in atomic coordination, electronic structure, and surface energetics, giving rise to directional charge transport and facet&#8208;specific reactivity. Such intrinsic differences coordinate the entire photocatalytic process, from charge excitation and separation to interfacial reaction kinetics. In this regard, effective utilization of anisotropy requires clarifying its impact on electronic structure, charge transport, and interfacial reactivity, along with its sensitivity to microenvironmental changes under realistic operando conditions. In this review article, we systematically examine the role of crystallographic anisotropy in light harvesting, charge carrier dynamics, and surface reactivity. We summarize recent advances in anisotropic material design, trace the evolution of the concept, and provide mechanistic insights based on experimental studies, theoretical models, and advanced characterization techniques. We further discuss current challenges and propose strategies to guide the rational application of anisotropy in catalyst design, aiming to expand its scope across a broader range of photo(electro)catalytic systems.

         <title>Rational Design Strategies in DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in rational DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) design, focusing on fragment&#8208;based DELs, covalent DELs, and focused DELs. These innovations shift DELs from empirical screening to a more strategic, hypothesis&#8208;driven approach, enhancing hit quality and drug discovery efficiency.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have emerged as a powerful and cost&#8208;effective platform for high&#8208;throughput screening, enabling the rapid identification of small&#8208;molecule ligands against a wide range of biological targets. However, traditional DEL approaches often rely on empirical and broad&#8208;based library construction, which can lead to low hit rates, off&#8208;target interactions, and limited chemical diversity around pharmaceutically relevant motifs. Recent technological advances have sought to address these limitations, shifting DELs from a largely blind screening tool to a more rational and precision&#8208;oriented strategy. In this review, we systematically examine the evolution of DEL methodologies, with a particular focus on innovations in library design that enhance hit quality and screening efficiency. Specifically, we highlight the emergence of fragment&#8208;based DEL strategies for exploring chemical space with minimal structures, the incorporation of covalent warheads to enable irreversible binding to specific residues, and the development of focused DELs tailored to particular protein families or binding motifs. Together, these advances mark a shift from blind, empirical screening toward a more strategic and hypothesis&#8208;driven application of DEL technology.

         <title>Embracing Complexity: Peptides as Tunable Scaffolds in the Construction of Discrete Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent chirality, tunability, biocompatibility, and robustness of peptides provide an exciting opportunity for supramolecular chemistry. In this mini&#8208;review, we explore uses of peptides in discrete supramolecular systems, how chemists can draw inspiration from larger biological assemblies, and discuss how embracing the complexity of peptide secondary structures in the design of these systems provides opportunities for novel structures and functions.








Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has advanced rapidly, with scientists using fundamental understanding to generate function from simple building blocks. However, synthetic systems are still in their infancy when compared to biology. The increasing use of peptides in supramolecular structures provides a clear roadmap to more complex function, introducing chiral, information&#8208;rich building blocks from a readily available pool. Peptides have historically been incorporated as modular additions to discrete supramolecular architectures to interface with biological systems. More recently, supramolecular chemists have embraced the complexity of secondary and tertiary structures and peptides&#8217; intrinsic propensity for folding to enable the formation of supramolecular architectures built from peptides, leveraging their innate properties. We explore the urgent need to embrace complex, chiral, folded building blocks in discrete supramolecular architectures and illustrate how this will provide opportunities for novel functions and applications.

         <title>Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of oxygen&#8208;doped graphene nanoribbons (O&#8208;doped chevron&#8208;GNR and O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR) were synthesized on Au(111) via in situ formation of pyrans. Both O&#8208;doped GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors but exhibit different sensitivities to oxygen dopants, which is attributed to the difference in the density of states near the Fermi level between the substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts.








Abstract
Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen&#8208;doped GNRs (O&#8208;doped chevron&#8208;GNR and O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, noncontact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O&#8208;doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron&#8208;GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, the band structure of O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2&#8208;hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.

         <title>Encapsulating Ionophores in Zeolite Imidazolate Framework&#8208;8 for Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Ion Fluctuations in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, ionophore was encapsulated in zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticle for long&#8208;term ion recognition with high stability. The mechanical mismatch between implanted electrodes and brain tissue was addressed by sputtering gold nanoparticles (AuNP) on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers as a flexible electrode substrate. This study provides a versatile strategy for developing ion&#8208;selective microsensors that well meet the demands of long&#8208;term in vivo monitoring.








Abstract
Various ions in the brain (e.g., H+, K+, and Ca2+) play essential roles in neural information transmission and physiopathological processes. Real&#8208;time monitoring of these ions will provide critical information for understanding neural functions and diagnosing diseases. However, long&#8208;term monitoring the dynamics of ions with microelectrodes remains a challenge due to the limited availability of sensing strategies capable of in vivo measurements with high stability in the mechanically soft and chemically complex brain of freely moving rats. Here, we develop a flexible and stable ion&#8208;selective microsensor for long&#8208;term monitoring of ions in rat brain, in which zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticles incorporated with ionophores are used for selective ion recognition and flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers sputtered with gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is used as the soft electrode substrate. The flexible microsensors allow long&#8208;term in vivo ion sensing with good stability in the brain of behaving rat, avoiding progressively deteriorating response of traditional polymer&#8208;based rigid ion selective microsensor caused by its instability interface and mechanical mismatch to soft brain tissue.

We introduce an all&#8208;in&#8208;one AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA platform, a novel, rapid, and automated method for absolute quantitation of influenza A and B viruses. This digital microfluidics&#8208;based approach completes the entire workflow from sample preparation to digital read&#8208;out within 60&#160; minutes.








Abstract
Accurate nucleic acid quantification analysis (NQA) is crucial for disease treatment and prevention. However, existing digital NQA methods often lack sufficient automation and speed. In this study, we introduce a novel rapid and automated active&#8208;matrix digital microfluidics&#8208;based droplet digital recombinase polymerase amplification method (AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA). This method can quantify influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) within a mere 60&#160;min, covering the entire workflow from nucleic acid extraction to digital amplification, fluorescence detection, and statistical analysis. We fabricated an AM&#8208;DMF chip equipped with high&#8208;throughput electrodes and optimized its control logic. Leveraging an artificial intelligence droplet navigation algorithm, we successfully achieved motion and mixing operations of high&#8208;throughput droplets (4608 droplets, each with a volume of 0.9&#160;nL). A dual&#8208;target RPA system was designed to detect IAV and IBV, and its detection performance was fine&#8208;tuned. Experiments conducted with clinical samples revealed that this method exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity for single&#8208;molecule detection, with a detection limit of 1.69 copies per reaction, and it achieved 100% concordance with qPCR results. This groundbreaking quantification technology holds tremendous promise for advancing disease diagnosis, treatment, and fundamental research.

         <title>Multiactivity of Nanozyme Liposome Regulates the Homeostasis of Biochemical Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a biomimetic liposome (CeO2@M) with nanozyme multiactivity to regulate the homeostasis of microenvironment. Artificial liposomes with negatively charged liposomes, like endothelial membranes, reduce blood component adhesion. The CeO2 nanozyme hydrolyzes ATP/ADP, lessening platelet aggregation, and regulates the level of biochemical factors such as ROS to maintain the homeostasis of the microenvironment for tissue regeneration.








Abstract
In living systems, cascade reactions involving multiple enzymes, critical for regulating the biochemical microenvironment's homeostasis, are essential to transplantation remodeling. However, for ready&#8208;to&#8208;use purposes, designing and constructing therapeutic liposomes that replicate natural cell functions during the initial transplantation phase remains a significant challenge in synthetic biology for tissue engineering. Herein, we developed a biomimetic liposome with multienzymatic nanozyme activity to regulate proinflammatory factors induced by exogenous implants. The liposomes were fabricated through the self&#8208;assembly of artificial membranes on CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). These membranes, featuring a negatively charged surface analogous to endothelial cell (EC) membranes, effectively attenuate blood component adhesion and aggregation. The CeO2 nanozyme not only hydrolyzes adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), reducing subsequent platelet aggregation, but also regulates biochemical microenvironment homeostasis, thereby promoting tissue regeneration. This work advances the development of cell&#8208;like entities capable of modulating signaling communication between living and abiotic interfaces.

         <title>First Chiral Catalan Solid Based on Molybdenum Halide with Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Deep&#8208;Red Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra was successfully synthesized via a solvothermal method. This unique Catalan solid structure exhibits efficient deep&#8208;red circularly polarized emission, enhanced stability, and improved photoluminescence quantum yield. The proposed system provides a novel platform for advancing the research on chiral metal halides and paves the way for their application toward chiral optoelectronics. 








Abstract
The design of novel chiral metal halides with exceptional chiroptical properties has attracted significant research attention due to their potential applications in chiral optoelectronics and spintronics. However, developing the deep&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters is still challenging. In this work, we presented the first chiral molybdenum halide clusters by incorporating chiral methylbenzylammonium (R/S&#8208;MBA) for the design of (R&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 and (S&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 tetrakis hexahedra, which adopt the unique Catalan solid structure. These chiral tetrakis hexahedra exhibit 24 unique 3c&#8208;2e Mo&#9472;Mo&#9472;Cl bonds, which are scarcely reported. Notably, these (R&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 and (S&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 tetrakis hexahedra demonstrated pronounced circularly polarized luminescence in the deep&#8208;red region, accompanied by an extended emission lifetime of 114.14 &#181;s at room temperature. Additionally, these chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra are optically stable for 3 months. The four&#8208;state spin sublevel model was employed to investigate the emission mechanism and found that the temperature&#8208;dependent exciton dynamics lead to the dual&#8208;band emission of the designed chiral tetrakis hexahedra. Our study expands the family of lead&#8208;free chiral metal halides and develops a novel strategy to design a high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;red CPL emitter.

         <title>Regiodivergent Photocatalytic Annulation for the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent photocatalytic annulation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl urea with olefins or bicyclobutanes (BCBs) has been developed. The regioselectivity is controlled by the proper choice of counteranion of the cationic iridium photocatalyst and solvent. This protocol enables straightforward access to diverse cyclic amino hydrocarbons, including functionalized bicyclic scaffolds of distinct three&#8208;dimensional architectures, with precise deployment of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene groups, cultivating a chemical space for bioisosteres.








Abstract
Regiodivergent synthesis is a powerful strategy for expanding chemical space. Given the significance of fluorine&#8208;containing molecules in pharmaceutical sciences, a regiodivergent [3+2] cycloaddition of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl urea to olefins and [1.1.0]&#8208;bicyclobutanes was developed by employing cationic iridium complexes as photocatalysts under visible&#8208;light irradiation. By properly selecting a counteranion of the photocatalyst and tuning the reaction conditions, each regioisomeric cyclic hydrocarbon with a defined gem&#8208;difluoromethylene disposition was directly assembled with high selectivity. Mechanistic elucidation revealed the critical relevance of the basicity of the photocatalyst counteranion to the regiochemical outcome. The reaction diverges depending on the intervention of deprotonation of the initially generated urea radical cation by the pairing anion to form the corresponding neutral radical; this not only governs the regioselective ring opening of the cyclopropane moiety but also modulates the relative reactivity of the two resulting terminal carbon radicals, thereby dictating the dominant pathway.

         <title>Selective Phosphorylation of Phenols and Benzenediols by the Kinase PsiK and Variants Thereof</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PsiK from Psilocybe cubensis phosphorylates a diverse set of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate. High&#8208;throughput screening of active site mutant libraries using DESI&#8208;MS enabled protein engineering of PsiK, further expanding its substrate scope. The scalability of PsiK&#8208;catalyzed reactions was demonstrated, further highlighting its biocatalytic utility for selective phosphorylation.








Abstract
Phosphorylation plays important roles in biology by modulating the structure, reactivity, and biological function of a broad range of molecules. Biocatalytic phosphorylation has attracted attention from synthetic chemists due to its selectivity and mild reaction conditions using ATP as a phosphate donor. Given the potential synthetic utility of kinases with activity on small molecule substrates, we explored the activity of PsiK, the enzyme responsible for selective 4&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylation of 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamine or psilocin in psylocybin biosynthesis by Psilocybe cubensis. We find that PsiK has good activity on a range of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate, enabling preparative phosphorylation of different substrates, and substantially expands the substrate scope of biocatalytic phosphorylation. We also show that active site mutations can further expand substrate scope and improve site&#8208;selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;PsiK from &lt;i&gt;Psilocybe cubensis&lt;/i&gt; phosphorylates a diverse set of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate. High-throughput screening of active site mutant libraries using DESI-MS enabled protein engineering of PsiK, further expanding its substrate scope. The scalability of PsiK-catalyzed reactions was demonstrated, further highlighting its biocatalytic utility for selective phosphorylation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation plays important roles in biology by modulating the structure, reactivity, and biological function of a broad range of molecules. Biocatalytic phosphorylation has attracted attention from synthetic chemists due to its selectivity and mild reaction conditions using ATP as a phosphate donor. Given the potential synthetic utility of kinases with activity on small molecule substrates, we explored the activity of PsiK, the enzyme responsible for selective 4-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-phosphorylation of 4-hydroxytryptamine or psilocin in psylocybin biosynthesis by &lt;i&gt;Psilocybe cubensis&lt;/i&gt;. We find that PsiK has good activity on a range of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate, enabling preparative phosphorylation of different substrates, and substantially expands the substrate scope of biocatalytic phosphorylation. We also show that active site mutations can further expand substrate scope and improve site-selectivity. This engineering effort was greatly expedited using DESI-MS screening, which enabled analysis of 2688 reactions in only 40&#160;min. Finally, gram-scale phosphorylation of a representative substrate was achieved with a turnover number over 10 000. Together, these results highlight the biocatalytic utility of PsiK and derivatives thereof for selective phosphorylation of phenols and benzenediols under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Cathode Constructed Solely by Carbon Dots for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>

Carbon dots are solely applied as the active cathode material in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries for the first time, which exhibit decent cycling performance, excellent capacity retention, and ultrahigh ion diffusion ability.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have been explored widely in the electrochemistry field, owing to their unique structures and rich properties. However, in the reported devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, CDs are always used as additives to modify the electrodes or regulate the electrolytes because they have been regarded as inert and low&#8208;capacity materials all along. Here, for the first time, o&#8208;phenylenediamine derived CDs are selected as the only protagonist to construct cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Such CDs (p&#8208;CDs) have a special &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenazine&#8208;based structure, with carbon cores for electrical conductivity and active sites for embedding Zn2+ and H+. The p&#8208;CDs solely constructed cathode material delivers a superior capacity of 290&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and a decent capacity of 103&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 10&#160;A g&#8722;1, as well as an ultrahigh ion diffusion coefficient of 10&#8722;8&#160;&#8764;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;cm2 s&#8722;1. The p&#8208;CDs assembled ZIBs exhibit a stable long&#8208;term cycling, retaining 87.4% of the original capacity after 10&#160;000 cycles. Various characterizations and theoretical calculations prove that the electron&#8208;deficient N as the active sites on p&#8208;CDs can embed/release Zn2+ and H+ reversibly.

         <title>Building a Bridge Between Ambient MS and LC&#8208;MS by Non&#8208;Exhaustive Microdesorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential analysis strategy was developed to integrate rapid ambient mass spectrometry (MS) screening with LC&#8208;MS confirmation using a single solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) device. The approach involves an initial non&#8208;exhaustive microdesorption for ambient MS screening, followed by a second desorption for LC&#8208;MS confirmation of only the disputed samples. This workflow enhances throughput while maintaining sensitivity and minimizing matrix effects. The method has been applied for high throughput anti&#8208;doping test.








Abstract
Ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) offers rapid screening but faces challenges in analyzing complex samples due to high matrix effects. The absence of a separation step can also lead to false positives due to the isomers or isobars. In this study, a sequential analysis strategy which combines ambient MS and LC&#8208;MS based on the non&#8208;exhaustive microdesorption in solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) was developed for the first time. By combining coated blade spray (CBS)&#8208;MS with LC&#8208;MS, in the first step, a few microliters of solvent were used for non&#8208;exhaustive desorption with high enrichment factor for rapid screening by CBS&#8208;MS. For the suspicious samples, the remaining analytes on the SPME coating undergo exhaustive desorption, then followed by LC&#8208;MS confirmation. The matrix&#8208;compatible coating used in the SPME device significantly reduces matrix effects while enhancing sensitivity through analyte enrichment. This method is environmentally friendly, utilizing only a few microliters of organic solvents for screening. The approach was rigorously validated, both theoretically and experimentally, and successfully applied to anti&#8208;doping testing, enabling detection of 53 prohibited substances in urine samples by integrating CBS&#8208;MS with LC&#8208;MS.

         <title>Precise Molecular Engineering of Heptamethine Cyanine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Type&#8208;I Photosensitizers for Pro&#8208;Death Autophagy and Hypoxia&#8208;Tolerant Antitumor Treatment</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents precise molecular engineering for conversion of typical heptamethine cyanine dye into a good type&#8208;I photosensitizer. The optimized molecular can produce hydroxyl radicals by electron transfer and alkyl radicals by H&#8208;abstraction reaction. These radicals can induce ferroptosis and necroptosis, providing a crucial strategy for hypoxic solid tumors therapy. 








Abstract
Heptamethine cyanine (Cy7) dyes have excellent near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging capability but competitively inhibit the photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect, especially in hypoxic solid tumors. In this study, a series of aryl&#8208;ketone&#8208;modified Cy7 derivatives (ACy) were constructed to transform Cy7 into a type&#8208;I photosensitizer capable of both hydrogen (H)&#8208;abstraction and electron transfer for the first time. The introduction of an aryl&#8208;ketone group at the C3 position of Cy7 imparted it with H&#8208;abstraction capability and enhanced its intersystem crossing efficiency. Moreover, an increase in the steric hindrance of the aryl&#8208;ketone group promoted the efficiency of the H&#8208;abstraction reaction and electron transfer process. Optimized molecules, 3ACy&#8208;3ipr, not only exhibited bright fluorescence but also generated hydroxyl and alkyl radicals upon NIR light irradiation. These radicals induced mitochondrial autophagy in hypoxic tumor cells, eventually leading to necrosis and ferroptosis. Tumor targeting peptide modified liposomes were used to construct nanocarriers to improve the biocompatibility and tumor retention of 3ACy&#8208;3ipr, which fluoresces at the tumor site and significantly inhibited the growth of solid tumors via PDT. This study provides an excellent platform for the precise development and clinical utilization of NIR theranostic agents.

         <title>Regioselective C&#9472;H Functionalization by the Combination of Enzymatic and Chemocatalytic Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
H3CP contributes to sustainable synthesis by integrating regioselective enzymatic halogenation, Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck coupling, and enzymatic hydrolysis. TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M micelles enable the Pd&#8208;catalyzed step, allowing seamless compatibility with enzymatic reactions in one vessel under aqueous conditions. Using this platform, diverse simple aromatic substrates are readily transformed into valuable acrylic acid building blocks.








Abstract
The combination of bio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalytic processes has tremendous potential for the sustainable production of important synthetic building blocks. Such approaches capitalize on the often&#8208;high selectivity of enzymes and the broad arsenal of synthetic transformations to access highly functionalized molecules from simple precursors. However, the strict requirement of enzymes for an aqueous reaction environment, often combined with their lack of stability under harsh reaction conditions, makes the development of efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions challenging. Within this work, we developed a chemo&#8208;enzymatic platform that combines regioselective enzymatic Halogenation, chemo&#8208;catalytic Heck coupling, and an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Hydrolysis reaction (H3 Catalytic Platform&#160;=&#160;H3CP) in a single reaction vessel. H3CP uses water as a reaction solvent to facilitate the enzymatic transformations, with the cross&#8208;coupling reaction taking place in dynamic and protective super&#8208;molecular reaction vessels composed of the commercially available TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M. Our work utilizes various halogenating enzymes (FDHs and VHPOs), selectively functionalizing diverse substrates, thus enabling subsequent metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. H3CP gives access to a broad range of valuable acrylic acid building blocks with diverse functionalization at the aromatic portion.

Using this platform, diverse simple aromatic substrates are readily transformed into valuable acrylic acid building blocks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of bio- and chemo-catalytic processes has tremendous potential for the sustainable production of important synthetic building blocks. Such approaches capitalize on the often-high selectivity of enzymes and the broad arsenal of synthetic transformations to access highly functionalized molecules from simple precursors. However, the strict requirement of enzymes for an aqueous reaction environment, often combined with their lack of stability under harsh reaction conditions, makes the development of efficient chemo-enzymatic cascade reactions challenging. Within this work, we developed a chemo-enzymatic platform that combines regioselective enzymatic &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;alogenation, chemo-catalytic &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;eck coupling, and an enzyme-catalyzed &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;ydrolysis reaction (H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Catalytic Platform&#160;=&#160;H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CP) in a single reaction vessel. H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CP uses water as a reaction solvent to facilitate the enzymatic transformations, with the cross-coupling reaction taking place in dynamic and protective super-molecular reaction vessels composed of the commercially available TPGS-705-M. Our work utilizes various halogenating enzymes (FDHs and VHPOs), selectively functionalizing diverse substrates, thus enabling subsequent metal-catalyzed cross-coupling followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CP gives access to a broad range of valuable acrylic acid building blocks with diverse functionalization at the aromatic portion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Polyester Waste Using Reconstructed Defective&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemical recycling of polyester waste is a sustainable circular economy strategy. Here, we report a strategy for closed&#8208;loop recycling of polyester waste catalyzed by a reconstructed defective&#8208;MOF (r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT) under mild conditions. The sustainability assessment results verify the ecological, resource, and health advantages of closed&#8208;loop recycling as well as the feasibility of the circular economy.








Abstract
Chemical recycling of polyester waste presents a promising strategy for achieving a sustainable circular economy. However, the development of efficient, low&#8208;cost recycling methods that minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions remains challenging. Here, we report an approach for depolymerization polyester waste to bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) using a reconstructed metal&#8211;organic framework (r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT) catalyst under mild conditions. The r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT exhibited a space&#8208;time yield of 1035.8 gBHET gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 190&#160;&#176;C. Importantly, this is an order of magnitude higher than that reported for similar MOF&#8208;based catalysts. In situ spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the depolymerization pathway involves the activation of oxygen and ethylene glycol adsorbed on r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT, forming nucleophilic intermediates. These intermediates then facilitate the cleavage of the polyester C&#9472;O bond through nucleophilic attack, thereby gradually generating the BHET product. Sustainability evaluation results validated the circular economy feasibility of the recycling approach, with a minimum sales price (MSP) of 498 $/ton, much lower than the MSP of the traditional petroleum&#8208;based production route (1000 $/ton). The approach also achieved a 61% reduction in energy use and a 52% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This work provides a sustainable solution for managing polyester waste accumulation.

A dynamic crystalline bio&#8208;based nanofiber membrane is constructed via a rigid&#8208;flexible coupled supramolecular network strategy. The nanofiber membrane exhibits a three&#8208;stage fracture mechanism during the stress process. demonstrating exceptional mechanical properties. 








Abstract
Bio&#8208;based polyurethanes are promising sustainable elastomers whose polymeric network structure has a decisive impact on their properties. However, existing bio&#8208;based polyurethanes face challenges in simultaneously enhancing mechanical strength and toughness. Inspired by the multilevel heterogeneous structure of articular cartilage, we propose a bionic design strategy of rigid&#8208;flexible coupled supramolecular cross&#8208;linking networks to prepare bio&#8208;based polyurethane elastomers with enhanced strength and toughness. By incorporating the asymmetric coupling of rigid furan rings and flexible aliphatic side chains into the molecular chains, a dynamic hydrogen bond network with a gradient distribution of bond energy was constructed, achieving uniform microphase separation between the soft phase (amorphous) and the hard phase (crystalline). Nanofiber membranes were fabricated by rigid&#8208;flexible coupled polyurethane electrospinning, where the microphase&#8208;separated structure is further transformed into dynamic crystalline domains. Under external force, multilevel energy dissipation is achieved through the breaking and controllable recombination of hydrogen bonds within the crystalline domain. resulting in polyurethane nanofiber membranes with significantly enhanced mechanical strength and toughness (fracture strength: 31.37&#160;MPa, fracture strain: 731.04%, toughness: 102.13&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). This network design strategy expands the potential of bio&#8208;based elastomers in smart wearable textiles, flexible electronic devices, and biomedical applications, thereby advancing the development of sustainable high&#8208;performance polymers.

         <title>Controlled Electrocatalytic Glycerol Upgrading to Glyceraldehyde in Near Neutral Media by Cobalt Oxide Lattice Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co3O4 lattice activation mechanism is proposed by introducing Ru single atom into the Co tetrahedral (CoTd) site, which switches the rate determining step (RDS)&#160;from reconstruction to adsorbed electrophilic oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (AOM&#8208;HAT) process and resultantly enhancing both glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) activity and glyceraldehyde (GAD) selectivity in neutral media.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol driven by renewable electricity offers a greatly attractive green way to produce value&#8208;added chemicals at much reduced global carbon footprint. However, achieving both the enhanced activity and selectivity for the most&#8208;valuable C3 product&#8208;glyceraldehyde (GAD) of glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) in neutral media, though of great importance, is extremely challenging. In this work, we propose a Co3O4 lattice activation mechanism by introducing single atom Ru (0.36&#160;wt%) into the tetrahedral sites (CoTd) of Co3O4 lattice to significantly elevate the GOR activity and the GAD selectivity. The as&#8208;constructed Ru&#8208;Co3O4/NF only needs 1.16&#160;V to achieve the current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 during GOR and maintains &#8764;60% GAD selectivity (&#8764;90% for C3 products) over a broad potential window, which are the highest reported in near neutral media. This excellent performance has been demonstrated to originate from the introduction of Ru atoms, which activates the lattice active sites of Co3O4 by promoting the rapid reconstruction of the catalyst to generate sufficient Co3+&#8208;(OH)ads electrophilic oxygen species, resulting in not only the accelerated GOR kinetics, also largely enhanced selectivity of GAD by the adsorption configuration regulation of glycerol primary alcohols (C&#945;&#8208;OH) favoring the primary alcohol oxidation pathway.

         <title>Counterion&#8208;Mediated Luminophore Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The choice of anion selectively directs the solution&#8208;state aggregation of a cationic luminophore, dictating its photoluminescence. Some anions cause emission from a monomeric state, some induce excimer formation, and others lead to dimers, while the triflate counterion gives multichromatic emission from all three species.








Abstract
Emissive organic salts have long been integral to the discovery of fluorescence phenomena and functional luminescent dyes. Typically, one component of the salt acts as the photoactive unit (luminophore) and its nonemissive counterion is selected to independently tune bulk physical properties, such as solubility. However, the impact of counterion choice on the aggregation and resulting emissive state of organic salts in solution has not been widely investigated. Here, we report that a single cationic luminophore gives rise to either monomer, dimer, excimer, or multichromatic emission under otherwise identical conditions by varying only its counterion. We employ N&#8208;methyl quininium (MeQn+) as a permanently charged cationic luminophore, which we pair with a series of monovalent anions. At low solution&#8208;state concentrations, all the salts give identical absorption and emission spectra that correlate with the MeQn+ monomer. However, at higher concentrations, the emission, excitation, and absorption data differ, revealing the presence of monomer, dimer, excimer, or all three, depending on the structure of the anion. Understanding and modulating the formation of dimeric or other well&#8208;defined aggregated species by specific ion effects could be exploited in the design of molecular probes for biological systems or emissive thin&#8208;film dispersions for optoelectronic devices.

We employ &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl quininium (&lt;b&gt;MeQn&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as a permanently charged cationic luminophore, which we pair with a series of monovalent anions. At low solution-state concentrations, all the salts give identical absorption and emission spectra that correlate with the &lt;b&gt;MeQn&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monomer. However, at higher concentrations, the emission, excitation, and absorption data differ, revealing the presence of monomer, dimer, excimer, or all three, depending on the structure of the anion. Understanding and modulating the formation of dimeric or other well-defined aggregated species by specific ion effects could be exploited in the design of molecular probes for biological systems or emissive thin-film dispersions for optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orchestrating Penta&#8208;Element Interplay in Gradient&#8208;Porous Carbons for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between the active sites induced by promete and the Na+ storage capacity as well as anion adsorption/desorption has been established through a combination of electrochemical analysis, machine learning potentials, and molecular dynamics simulations, which enhances the kinetics and capacity balance of anode and cathode for sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) offer a cutting&#8208;edge synergy between battery&#8208;level energy density and supercapacitor&#8208;like power density, yet face critical challenges in balancing the kinetic and capacity mismatch between Faradaic anodes and capacitive cathodes. Herein, we present a penta&#8208;element doped gradient&#8208;porous carbon (PE&#8208;GPC) with a nanosphere architecture, engineered with high&#8208;entropy principles and a gradual pore density variation to enhance mass transport and charge storage. Operando spectroscopy and machine learning potentials unveil a concerted penta&#8208;element interplay: thiophene&#8208;like S configurations mediate dynamic redox processes, enabling pseudocapacitive Na&#8314; and anion storage, while fluorine functionalities foster a self&#8208;rejuvenating NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), stabilizing long&#8208;term cycling. Meanwhile, the synergistic N/B/P triad engineers a hierarchical defect network that enhances electronic conductivity and fine&#8208;tunes ion adsorption energetics. This orchestrated interplay empowers the SIHC full cell with a high energy density of 196&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, a formidable power density (10.4&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1), and an impressive 88.2% capacity retention after 9000 cycles. By establishing a high&#8208;entropy stabilization paradigm, this work paves the way for multi&#8208;ion storage architectures, offering a universal strategy to bridge the charge&#8208;transfer imbalance in advanced energy devices.

         <title>Branched&#8208;Selective Functionalization of 2&#8208;Alkyl Aziridines Through Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic activation of 2&#8208;alkyl aziridines was reported, enabling unconventional branched&#8208;selective alkyl Heck&#8208;type coupling and defluorinative coupling via cleavage of the more hindered and less favored C&#9472;N bond. This strategy also enables a novel remote desaturation reaction of aziridines through a unique &#8220;self&#8208;terminated&#8221; chain&#8208;walking process. This work offers a modular approach to different alkenyl amine derivatives.








Abstract
Overriding the inherent substrate&#8208;controlled regioselectivity in aziridine activation holds significant potential. It could enable previously inaccessible disconnections from these readily available, strained heterocycles, facilitating the diverse synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing products. In this study, we present a Ni&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic activation of 2&#8208;alkyl (and 2,2&#8208;dialkyl) aziridines, leading to unconventional branched&#8208;selective alkyl Heck&#8208;type coupling with styrenes and reductive defluorinative coupling with trifluoromethyl alkenes. In addition to enabling the functionalization of the N&#8208;adjacent sites of aziridines, this catalyst&#8208;controlled activation strategy triggers an unprecedented reaction framework for aziridines, namely, the remote desaturation via ring&#8208;opening. Notably, detailed mechanistic studies demonstrate the operation of a rare &#8220;self&#8208;terminated&#8221; chain&#8208;walking process, offering a flexible method for remote desaturation that generates alkenyl amines with varying chain lengths. Overall, this study provides a modular approach to access a wide range of alkenyl amine derivatives.

         <title>Zwitterionic Heavier Pnictinidenes in Redox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic pnictinidenes: A new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species stabilized by bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)borate ligands is reported, enabling the isolation of Sb and Bi in multiple oxidation states. These thoroughly characterized systems exhibit cationic character and engage in redox catalysis, facilitating catalytic hydrodefluorination and dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes, expanding the scope of main group redox chemistry.








Abstract
Herein, we describe a new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species with bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)borate as ligands, enabling the isolation of stable Sb and Bi species in multiple oxidation states. Computational analysis of zwitterionic pnictinidenes revealed their cationic character at the metal centre while holding unique electronic properties that contribute to their nucleophilicity and stability. These systems participate in oxidative addition and reductive elimination processes, and display redox catalytic activity in hydrodefluorination reactions, marking a unique example of cationic pnictinidene catalysing a redox transformation and providing reactivity beyond the constraints of pincer ligands. Additionally, we report on a novel dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes. This work expands the scope of low&#8208;valent pnictogen chemistry, providing a novel platform for main group redox catalysis.

         <title>Highly Crystalline and Oriented Thin Films of Fully Conjugated 3D&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a fully conjugated, 3D covalent organic framework (COF) based on cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh); the synthesis employs modulated conditions to achieve thin films with high crystallinity. The COTh&#8208;1P COF shows potential for optoelectronic applications, thanks to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, the preferential film orientation, and charge dynamics insights obtained from optical pump terahertz probe studies.








Abstract
Fully conjugated 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a newly emerged class of materials that expands reticular chemistry to extended electron delocalization for optoelectronic applications. To overcome the limitations of sp3&#8208;connected 3D frameworks, the pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral motif cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh) has gained attention for forming fully conjugated 3D COFs.

&lt;p&gt;This work introduces a fully conjugated, 3D covalent organic framework (COF) based on cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh); the synthesis employs modulated conditions to achieve thin films with high crystallinity. The COTh-1P COF shows potential for optoelectronic applications, thanks to its &#960;-conjugated structure, the preferential film orientation, and charge dynamics insights obtained from optical pump terahertz probe studies.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully conjugated 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a newly emerged class of materials that expands reticular chemistry to extended electron delocalization for optoelectronic applications. To overcome the limitations of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-connected 3D frameworks, the pseudo-tetrahedral motif cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh) has gained attention for forming fully conjugated 3D COFs. We report on a novel COTh building block, featuring functional formyl groups directly attached to the core's conjugated thiophenes. The modulation synthesis approach with mono-functionalized inhibitors enables the formation of COTh-1P COF, which exhibited remarkable crystallinity and permanent porosity. By following this approach and by optimizing the synthesis conditions for the solvothermal growth of thin films, we fabricated the first preferentially oriented conjugated 3D COF films on various substrates without pre-functionalization. With these thin films, optical pump terahertz probe studies allowed us, for the first time with 3D-fully conjugated COFs, to provide insights into the excited state and charge-carrier dynamics of these unique organic frameworks. Low effective masses are discovered for valence and conduction bands by density functional theory simulations. The ability to create crystalline and oriented films of fully &#960;-conjugated 3D COTh-based COFs on non-modified substrates is expected to open the way for integration of such frameworks into diverse optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Active Site Evolution in Lanthanum&#8208;Based Catalysts Dictates Ethane Chlorination Pathways</title>

         <dc:description>
LaOCl&#8208;catalyzed C2H6 chlorination offers a low&#8208;carbon route for polyvinyl chloride synthesis, yet structural evolution occurs under Cl2 conditions. We establish structural sensitivity in La&#8208;catalyzed chlorination, and elucidate the size&#8208;dependent chlorophilicity of LaCl3 and the role of hydroxyl groups in overchlorination, highlighting stabilization of LaOCl and hydroxyl chemistry modulation as key design principles to break selectivity limitations.








Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated chlorination of ethane presents a low&#8208;carbon alternative for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) synthesis, yet selectivity toward 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane remains challenged by uncontrolled over&#8208;chlorination. Lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) has emerged as a promising catalyst, but its structural dynamics under Cl2&#8208;rich conditions and the origin of selectivity loss remain elusive. Here, we integrate advanced spectroscopic techniques with theoretical calculations to address this knowledge gap. Our findings unveil a sequential LaOCl&#160;&#8594;&#160;LaCl3 transformation that dictates product distribution shifting from 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane to trichloroethane. Mechanistic insights reveal that surface hydroxyl groups, generated during catalyst chlorination, promote bidentate adsorption of 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane via hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, thereby activating C&#9472;Cl over&#8208;chlorination. Additionally, by employing Al2O3&#8208;supported LaCl3 model catalysts, the size&#8208;dependent chlorophilicity of the LaCl3 species is demonstrated. The bonding of interfacial oxygen with monolayer&#8208;dispersed LaCl3 species generates empty 4f&#8208;states above the Fermi level, creating strong Lewis acid sites that stabilize Cl radicals and selectively convert chloroethane to 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. In contrast, aggregated nanoparticles are inactive due to their inability to stabilize chlorine radical. Our findings establish important structure sensitivity in lanthanum&#8208;catalyzed chlorination and provide guiding principles for catalyst design, highlighting the importance of stabilizing metastable LaOClx species and modulating surface hydroxyl chemistry to overcome selectivity limitations.

         <title>High Turnover Frequency in the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrous Oxide to Dinitrogen at a Binuclear Copper Complex of 3,5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazole</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by nitrous oxide reductase, a binuclear copper complex supported by carbon black was utilized for the electrocatalytic N&#8322;O reduction under ambient conditions. The binuclear Cu center enables exceptionally high turnover frequency and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for the electrochemical N&#8322;O reduction.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone&#8208;depleting substance. Electrocatalytic N2O reduction (e&#8208;N2ORR) is a promising approach to remove N2O from the air under ambient conditions. However, developing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free e&#8208;N2ORR electrocatalysts with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and turnover frequency (TOF) remains a challenge because of the weak binding of N2O and the high kinetic barrier for deoxygenation reaction. In this work, inspired by the multinuclear copper active site of nitrous oxide reductases, a binuclear copper complex of 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole supported on carbon black of Ketjenblack (CuHdatrz/KB) was utilized for the e&#8208;N2ORR at pH 13 and 298&#160;K. CuHdatrz/KB achieves a high FE of&#160;&#8776;&#160;100% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for the e&#8208;N2ORR to N2 and TOF up to&#160;&#8776;&#160;700&#160;h&#8722;1, which is one&#8211;two orders of magnitude higher than those of the previously reported molecular&#8208;based catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that Cu(II) ions of CuHdatrz/KB are reduced to Cu(I) keeping the binuclear core, suggesting that the multinuclear copper active site is crucial to efficiently catalyze the e&#8208;N2ORR like the nitrous oxide reductase.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated intramolecular dearomatization strategy of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with anthracene and naphthalene was reported. Bicyclo[4.1.1] frameworks could be obtained and (1,2,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs was achieved through this strategy along with further transformations. Mechanistic studies have shown that the key singlet biradical intermediate leads to the generation of two products, and the substituent on BCBs bridgehead position play a decisive role in product selectivity. 








Abstract
Cyclization of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) is an effective way to construct saturated polycyclic 3D structures. Herein we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular dearomative reaction to forge bicyclo[4.1.1] frameworks through (1,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs. Moreover, the unprecedented (1,2,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs through 1,4&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process was also realized along with the further transformations. The mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction was initially carried out by an energy transfer (EnT) process and the key open&#8208;shell singlet biradical intermediate may undergo [4&#960;&#160;+&#160;2&#963;] cycloaddition or 1,4&#8208;HAT process leading to the formation of two products and we found that the selectivity of product is related to the substituents at the BCBs bridgehead position. Our findings are supported by control experiments, deuterium labeling and kinetic studies, cyclic voltammetry, Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Angularly Resolved Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We find that the tip&#8208;enhanced Raman signal (TERS) is angularly distributed and vibrational mode specific. The radiation pattern in the back focal plane (BFP) of vertical or parallel Raman dipoles is strongly influenced by the near&#8208;field in the TERS nanogap, while the emission is guided into the far&#8208;field with high directionality by the tip&#8208;sample antenna; however, with significant differences in the emission angle, intensity, and the divergency.






.

Abstract
Despite intensive research in tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), the angular distribution of Raman scattering in the TERS gap remains experimentally unreported leaving its relevance to the TERS signal formation to be seldomly discussed. Here, we investigate the angular distribution of the tip&#8208;enhanced Raman signal in the Fourier plane using a model system composed of flat&#8208;lying cobalt (II) hexadecafluoro&#8208;phthalocyanine (CoPcF16) molecules physically adsorbed on a smooth gold surface. Both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational modes are observed, where the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Raman modes at about 678 and 740&#160;cm&#8722;1 have different angular intensity distributions than those of in&#8208;plane Raman modes at 1309 and 1373&#160;cm&#8722;1. We interpret the angular spectrum of the TERS signal considering the molecular vibrational modes computed with density functional theory (DFT) for the free and gold&#8208;deposited molecule, and the directed Raman scattering by the gap&#8208;mode predicted by finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain (FDTD) simulations. We contend that the TERS gap directs the Raman vibrational modes differently, leading to distinct angularly distributed Raman scattering intensities. These findings emphasize the nonnegligible role of the TERS detection scheme in understanding spectral features, such as the relative peak intensity ratio variations for studying molecular orientations, or for monitoring chemical reactions.

&lt;p&gt;We find that the tip-enhanced Raman signal (TERS) is angularly distributed and vibrational mode specific. The radiation pattern in the back focal plane (BFP) of vertical or parallel Raman dipoles is strongly influenced by the near-field in the TERS nanogap, while the emission is guided into the far-field with high directionality by the tip-sample antenna; however, with significant differences in the emission angle, intensity, and the divergency.

         <title>Introducing Steric Bulk Into Silylboranes: Enhanced Bench Stability and Novel Chemical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following initial experimental and theoretical studies that indicated that silylboranes decompose via oxygenation, bulky silyl anions were used to synthesize silylboranes with enhanced bench stability and novel reactivity. These kinetically stabilized silylboranes are stable in air and moderately activate carbon monoxide (CO) to form spirocyclic compounds. DFT calculations suggested that the activation of CO is driven by hyperconjugation.








Abstract
Silylboranes are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, and a wide range of structural variants of silylboranes have already been synthesized. However, the stability of silylboranes varies significantly, and their decomposition mechanism remains to be fully understood. Moreover, some silylborane motifs have not yet been applied as synthetic reagents due to their instability. To address this issue, we first investigated the decomposition mechanism of silylboranes in air and moisture using experimental and theoretical methods. We discovered that oxygenation by atmospheric oxygen is the major decomposition pathway, resulting in the formation of a borylsilylether, and that the introduction of a bulky silyl group suppresses this decomposition. Based on these results, we synthesized triisopropylsilyldimesitylborane (i&#8208;Pr3Si&#8211;BMes2), which exhibits high bench stability. Moreover, i&#8208;Pr3Si&#8211;BMes2 reacts with carbon monoxide (CO), which is the first example of a reaction between a silylborane and CO. Further computational studies revealed that electronic effects, including hyperconjugation between the Si&#9472;B &#963;&#8208;bond and C&#9472;O &#960;*&#8208;bond, are crucial for CO activation. Furthermore, we prepared a bench&#8208;stable bissilylaminoborane by introducing triisopropylsilyl groups, providing a bissilylchloroborane upon hydrogen chloride treatment. These findings provide valuable insights into how steric and electronic effects can be used to optimize the balance between stability and reactivity in silylboranes.

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;Octasulfur Crystals as Light&#8208;Controlled Molecular Muscles</title>

Bending and stretching effect provoked by the repeated application of 385&#8208;nm radiation (purple) and 475&#8208;nm radiation (blue) on sulfur microcrystals.








Abstract
Here, we describe the synthesis and photo&#8208;responsive properties of 2D cyclo&#8208;octasulfur microcrystals (&#945;&#8208;S8 MCs), produced using a quick, simple, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly hydrothermal method. Controlled 385&#8208;nm irradiation of these crystals induces an immediate, reversible, and sustained bending effect. The time required for the crystals to return to their initial shape is significantly reduced when exposed to 475&#8208;nm light, completing the entire excitation&#8208;relaxation cycle in less than 2 s. Moreover, this process can be repeated up to 50 times as long as the crystals remain in water. The dependence of recovery time on light wavelength is rationalized qualitatively via highly correlated quantum&#8208;chemical calculations of the absorption spectra of S8 chains. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of ring&#8208;to&#8208;chain and chain&#8208;to&#8208;ring transformations: the breaking of &#945;&#8208;S8 rings by 385&#8208;nm radiation induces bending in the &#945;&#8208;S8 MCs, while the excitation of the chains with 475&#8208;nm light facilitates an accelerated recovery process, allowing the S8 molecules to swiftly regain their ring shape. Thus, our study demonstrates that &#945;&#8208;S8 MCs represent intelligent actuators as light&#8208;controlled molecular muscles with the simplest inorganic composition reported to date.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C Addition of Glycinate to Nitroalkenes by Pyridoxal/Nd Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridoxal/Nd dual catalytic system enables asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C Michael addition of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to nitroalkenes, providing a highly efficient approach to make biologically significant &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Direct enantioselective &#945;&#8208;C Michael addition of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to nitroalkenes is a significant organic transformation, which may provide a highly efficient strategy to make bioactive chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. However, it is extremely challenging to achieve this reaction due to the interference of the reactive NH2 group, potential [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition side reaction and complicated stereoselective control. Carbonyl catalysis is an effective strategy to activate glycinate by forming an imine to facilitate the conjugate addition. With a pyridoxal/Nd dual catalytic system, direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C conjugate addition of glycinate to nitroalkenes has been successfully developed for the first time, producing a broad range of chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 98% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, 98% ee). The products can be easily converted into various biologically significant chiral molecules maintaining the same enantiopurity.

         <title>Decoy DNA Protects Molecular Tension Probes from DNase Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based probes are rapidly degraded by DNases in live&#8208;cell environments, limiting their use. We introduce a decoy DNA strategy, where an excess of unmodified double&#8208;stranded DNA acts as a competitive substrate for DNases, protecting functional DNA probes and significantly extending their stability for long&#8208;term live&#8208;cell studies.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular probes are essential tools for visualizing and quantifying mechanotransduction at the single&#8208;molecule level. However, their application in live&#8208;cell environments is severely limited by DNase&#8208;mediated degradation, which shortens probe lifespan and introduces false&#8208;positive signals. Here, we present a decoy DNA strategy where an excess of unmodified double&#8208;stranded DNA competitively binds DNases, effectively preserving functional DNA probes. This approach extends probe stability from 1&#8211;2 h to beyond 24 h, substantially improving signal integrity in live&#8208;cell tension imaging. In contrast to structurally modified nucleic acids, decoy DNA can be readily applied to existing DNA probe systems, enabling seamless integration without the need for additional validation or calibration. This cost&#8208;effective and scalable strategy provides a generalizable framework for stabilizing DNA&#8208;based molecular tools in DNase&#8208;rich environments, enabling high&#8208;precision mechanobiology studies across diverse cell types and extended experiment durations.

In contrast to structurally modified nucleic acids, decoy DNA can be readily applied to existing DNA probe systems, enabling seamless integration without the need for additional validation or calibration. This cost-effective and scalable strategy provides a generalizable framework for stabilizing DNA-based molecular tools in DNase-rich environments, enabling high-precision mechanobiology studies across diverse cell types and extended experiment durations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Counterintuitive Photochemistry of an Isolated Acridinyl Radical: ConPET via Preassembly, Solvated Electrons or a Long&#8208;Lived Excited State?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we isolate the reduced form of a commonly used acridinium photocatalyst (acridinyl, Acr&#8226;) and investigate its photochemistry using transient absorption, analysed alongside TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We show that despite the apparent long lifetime of the fluorescent state of Acr&#8226;, it is not relevant to reactivity. Instead, reactivity occurs through counterintuitive preassembly and solvated electron&#8208;based mechanisms.








Abstract
Photoredox chemistry has seen a dramatic rise in popularity in recent years, but mechanistic understanding has persistently lagged behind reaction development itself. This is particularly true for the emerging area of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (conPET), which has attracted both great interest due to its ability to activate inert substrates selectively and under mild conditions and continuing controversy over its mechanistic feasibility. We describe herein the isolation of the key radical intermediate state of an acridinium&#8208;based conPET catalyst and detailed investigations of its photochemistry by a suite of (photo)reactivity, photoluminescence and transient absorption techniques, supported by computational studies. We observe strong wavelength and solvent dependencies in the reactivity profile, which correlate well with observations of a long&#8208;lived, fluorescent excited state that would be compatible with diffusion&#8208;limited reactivity. However, photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopies suggest that, counter&#8208;intuitively, this state does not actually participate in reactivity. Instead, changes occur far faster than the diffusion limit, which provides strong, direct evidence for preassembly of the photocatalyst and substrate prior to photoexcitation. Further inspection also indicates parallel formation of solvated electrons, likely providing the major pathway under previously reported synthetic conditions, suggesting that otherwise competing rationales for conPET can in fact operate simultaneously.

         <title>Highly Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant and Self&#8208;Adaptive Surface&#8208;Initiated Bimetal&#8208;Mediated Controlled Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel and versatile self&#8208;adaptive surface&#8208;initiated bimetal&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional polymer brushes under ambient conditions with exceptional oxygen tolerance. By introducing a bimetal CuZn alloy, the system self&#8208;adaptively regulates the dissociation of copper species, ensuring robust and controllable polymer brush growth across a wide range of distances between the bimetallic alloy and the initiator&#8208;modified substrate.








Abstract
We report herein a self&#8208;adaptive surface&#8208;initiated bimetal&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (SI&#8208;BMCRP) for fabricating various polymer brushes using microliter volumes under ambient conditions. The introduction of bimetal CuZn alloy can self&#8208;adaptively control the dissociation of copper species while still realizing the controllability of polymer brush growth with high oxygen tolerance at a wide range of distances between the bimetal alloy and the initiator&#8208;modified substrate. The successful fabrication of multiscale and multifunctional polymer brushes with high&#8208;end group fidelity and patterned architectures further demonstrates the robust nature of SI&#8208;BMCRP. The resultant polymer brushes show great potential for new applications in moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generation, breath monitoring, and speech recognition.

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of Native Proteins by BioReversible Arginine Modification (BioRAM) on Amino Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioreversible Arginine Modification of amine&#8208;containing protein residues (termed BioRAM) allows the serum&#8208;compatible, readily accessible, and efficient delivery of native proteins into live cells. Combined with cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP) additives, BioRAM results in intracellular RNase A activity at nanomolar concentrations, thus enabling the cellular delivery of native protein cargoes without additional genetic engineering. 








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based tools are emerging as innovative solutions to interfere with biological pathways in molecular biology and medicine. They offer advantages over traditional small molecules due to their adaptable structural diversity and their ability to engage previously inaccessible cellular targets. However, most proteins do not penetrate the lipid bilayer of mammalian cells and are therefore restricted to extracellular targets. Despite recent advances, a general method for the delivery of functional proteins into human cells remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a bioreversible protein modification strategy of amines using short arginine&#8208;containing peptides (termed BioRAM) that enables cytosolic delivery starting from genetically non&#8208;engineered proteins. We optimized the bioconjugation strategy to achieve fast intracellular cleavage and complete recovery of the native protein. In combination with our previously established cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;additive protocol, we show superior delivery of fluorescent protein and functional RNase A into the cytosol, achieving physiological response. Moreover, we are able to demonstrate the excellent performance of BioRAM in the presence of serum, thereby broadening the scope for intracellular applications of functional proteins.

         <title>Sequential Reconstruction of Calicheamicin &#947;1I Iodo&#8208;Thiobenzoate by Selective Carrier Protein Trapping Reveals a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Iodinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic synthesis of the iodo&#8208;thiobenzoate of calicheamicin &#947;1I was reconstituted in vitro from malonyl&#8208;CoA, involving the orsellinate biosynthesis by CalO5 and subsequent modifications by CalO6, CalO3, CalO2, and CalO1. A TEV site was introduced into CalO5, enabling the successful detection of the intermediate or product attached to the ACP domain through intact&#8208;protein mass spectrometric analysis.








Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) play important roles in natural product biosynthesis, particularly chlorinases and brominases. Apart from ubiquitous mammalian iodination in thyroxine biosynthesis, iodinated natural products are extremely rare, and enzymes responsible for iodination are even less well described. A notable exception is calicheamicin &#947;1I, a potent antitumor compound containing an aromatic iodide, for which a halogenase has been proposed to mediate iodine incorporation. Despite predictions regarding the enzymes involved in iodinated aryl ring biosynthesis, experimental evidence remains limited due to challenges in substrate identification and reaction monitoring. In this study, we successfully reconstituted the enzymatic activities required for iodination and all embellishments of the highly substituted benzene ring in calicheamicin &#947;1I. Using intact&#8208;protein mass spectrometry combined with protease cleavage, we demonstrated formation of the orsellinate thioester followed by sequential C&#8208;2 O&#8208;methylation, C&#8208;5 iodination, C&#8208;3 oxidation, and C&#8208;3 O&#8208;methylation. This research characterizes the first flavin&#8208;dependent iodinase that acts on a carrier protein&#8208;dependent substrate, identifies the natural substrates of a cytochrome P450 oxygenase and two O&#8208;methyltransferases, and provides valuable insights for biocatalysis. Additionally, these findings could facilitate the engineering of other polyketide biosynthetic pathways and contribute to optimizing fermentation conditions to generate new calicheamicin derivatives.

         <dc:description>
The RuNi&#8208;Ti3C2 catalyst was utilized to investigate the activation and conversion of hydrogen. RuNi&#8208;Ti3C2 exhibits outstanding activity in AB hydrolysis, HOR, and phenylethylene tandem reaction, especially TOF of AB hydrolysis up to 1833 min&#8722;1.








Abstract
Insights into the activation and conversion of hydrogen using a single&#8208;mode catalyst are crucial for advancing fuels and fine chemical production. In this paper, the activation and conversion of H2 molecules in hydrogen production and application were investigated on RuM (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Co, Cu, Fe)&#8208;MXene catalysts. RuM (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Co, Cu, Fe) bimetallic nanoclusters were uniformly distributed on Ti3C2 MXene. The optimal Ru2.5Ni2.5&#8208;Ti3C2 exhibits the highest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1833 min&#8722;1 toward ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis. Meanwhile, the catalysts also showed good catalytic activity in hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and phenylacetylene hydrogenation. The high activity originates from the acceleration of the catalytic process by RuNi clusters&#8208;Ti3C2 and the promotion of H2 molecular transport by the special interface of RuNi cluster&#8208;MXene. The RuNi clusters&#8212;Ti3C2 with multisites provide a dependable platform for the regulated activation and conversion of H2 molecules and various reaction intermediates. The competitiveness of nanocluster&#8208;MXene catalytic material is showcased for activation and conversion of hydrogen. This research of reaction&#8208;inducing adaptation uncovered the pathway to explore multifunctional catalysts in energy, chemistry, and materials applications.

         <title>Redox&#8208; and NIR&#8208;Active Iron(III) Triradicals as Catalysts for Radical Polymerization of Acrylamides and Methacrylates</title>

A redox&#8208;active low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;triradical complex was isolated in good yield and utilized as a catalyst for radical polymerization of acrylamides and methacrylates at ambient conditions.








Abstract
Two unprecedented redox&#8208;active, low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;triradical complexes, [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;S&#8226;&#8722;)3]&#183;NHC&#9552;S (1&#183;NHC&#9552;S; E&#9552;S) and [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;Se&#8226;&#8722;)3] (2; E&#9552;Se) have been synthesized and structurally characterized by SCXRD. They were further characterized spectroscopically using IR, Raman, EPR, and UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. The low&#8208;spin electronic configuration of the central Fe(III) ion (1) and the nature of the magnetic interaction between the Fe(III) center and the three unpaired electrons in 1 have been investigated by magnetic measurements. In addition, the bonding stability and electron density distribution in 1 were studied by quantum chemical calculations and correlated with experimental results. Finally, a series of well&#8208;defined functional homopolymers were synthesized via catalytic polymerization reactions using [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;S&#8226;&#8722;)3] (1) as a catalyst at ambient temperature. These reactions yielded poly(N, N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA), poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM), poly(dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), and poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) with low dispersities ranging from 1.2 to 1.22. The successful synthesis of various diblock copolymers confirmed excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity of the synthesized homopolymers. These homopolymers and diblock copolymers highlight the versatile catalytic polymerization reactions of these Fe&#8208;radical complexes. Herein, we present a report on the polymerization of various acrylamides and methacrylates using a redox&#8208;active Fe&#8208;dithiolene complex for the first time.

         <title>Hybrid Cathode Interlayer Engineering Enables Over 20% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy is developed by using polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine as a guest material to improve the photovoltaic performance of the perylene&#8208;diimide cathode interlayer. Benefitted from the improved ohmic contact, interfacial compatibility, and carrier dynamics of PDINN:F16CuPc, a remarkable efficiency of 20.17% is achieved in the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device, which is higher than that of the control PDINN&#8208;based device with an efficiency of 19.29%.








Abstract
The capability of cathode interlayer (CIL) in regulating the conductivity, interfacial dipole, and work function of the electrode plays a critical role in determining the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). The widely used perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs suffered from the inbuilt limitation of finite conductivity and poor thickness tolerance. To address this issue, we develop a universal strategy to finely optimize the functionality of perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;type CIL (PDINN) by incorporating polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) derivative to form a hybrid CIL. It is found that the hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between PDINN and CuPc can address the solvent processability issue of CuPc used as CIL. The incorporation of CuPc in the PDINN layer leads to better film morphology, increased conductivity, and reduced cathode work function, enabling greater CIL thickness tolerance and significantly improved photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Notably, the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device using PDINN:F16CuPc as hybrid CIL yields a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.17%, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 19.29% for the control device based on PDINN CIL. Particularly, this strategy demonstrates a universality in multiple photoactive layers and various perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs, offering an effective approach to developing highly efficient OSCs.

         <title>Engineered C&#8211;N Lyases for Stereoselective Synthesis of Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
EDDS lyase was subjected to iterative cycles of site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screened for increased activity for the addition of 2&#8208;((methylamino)methyl)aniline to fumarate. The final mutant, EDDS lyase CEA, accepts various N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylmethanamines derivatives, yielding N,N&#8208;disubstituted L&#8208;aspartic acids, as well as several ortho&#8208;substituted anilines, producing N&#8208;arylated L&#8208;aspartic acids.








Abstract
Optically pure N&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acids are valuable chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and agrochemicals. Ethylenediamine&#8208;N,N&#8208;disuccinic acid lyase from Chelativorans sp. BNC1 catalyzes the addition of a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic primary amines to fumarate, producing the corresponding enantioenriched N&#8208;substituted L&#8208;aspartic acids. In this work, the enzyme was subjected to iterative cycles of site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screened for increased activity for the addition of 2&#8208;((methylamino)methyl)aniline to fumarate. The final variant displayed an activity of three orders of magnitude higher compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme. Unexpectedly, the enzyme catalyzed the hydroamination of fumarate with the aliphatic secondary amine of the starting substrate, rather than with the aromatic primary amine, leading to the formation of a tertiary amine. Exploring the substrate scope showed that the enzyme accepts various substituted N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylmethanamines for the hydroamination of fumarate, yielding N,N&#8208;disubstituted L&#8208;aspartic acids in high optical purity (up to &gt;99% ee). Furthermore, we showed that the enzyme accepts several ortho&#8208;substituted anilines that were previously not accepted by the wild&#8208;type enzyme, yielding the corresponding N&#8208;arylated L&#8208;aspartic acids in high enantiomeric excess (&gt;99% ee). This serendipitous finding enables a new strategy for the biocatalytic synthesis of tertiary amines, unlocked within the C&#8208;N lyase toolbox.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Porous Aromatic Framework Cathode with Fast Redox Kinetics for Ultralow&#8208;Temperature (&#8722;70&#160;&#176;C) Potassium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We propose the novel concept of the application of donor&#8211;acceptor porous aromatic framework (named as PAF&#8208;310) constructed from two types (n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type) storage blocks to accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics in potassium ion batteries, which shows the impressively electrochemical properties at room and low&#8208;temperature (even &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C) with the anions and cations co&#8208;storage mechanism.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries are essential for cryogenic energy storage. However, lowering the working temperature will exacerbate the disadvantages of slowed reaction kinetics and mechanical instability of inorganic electrode materials, thus causing severe capacity degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated that constructing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;310) using p&#8208;type phenazine (PZ) and n&#8208;type hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) as storage blocks can accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics even at low&#8208;temperature conditions. When employed as the cathode of potassium ion batteries (PIBs), PAF&#8208;310 possesses higher electrochemical performance than its counterparts, including impressive discharge specific capacity (215.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1) and outstanding rate performance (77.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1) at 25&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, PAF&#8208;310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low&#8208;temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and 130.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C at 0.2 A g&#8722;1). Even at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, PAF&#8208;310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1). Moreover, various in/ex&#8208;situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the continuous co&#8208;storage mechanism of K+ and PF6&#8722; in PAF&#8208;310. This contribution sheds a feasible molecular design strategy towards low&#8208;temperature stabilized PIBs.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Red Algal Diterpene Peyssonnosol in Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two terpene synthases derived from Anaerolineae bacteria catalyse the biosynthesis of peyssonnosene&#8208;type diterpenes from red algae. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis enabled a partial functional switch, resulting in the formation of additional byproducts. The intricate cyclisation mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments and density functional theory calculations.








Abstract
Two diterpene synthases (DTSs) for peyssonnosol and peyssonnosol B were discovered in bacteria. Their enzyme mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, yielding biosynthetically related molecules that gave important insights into the terpene cyclisation cascade. In the present case, several mechanisms in line with the isotopic labelling experiments could be formulated. Only an extended experimental approach in combination with computational chemistry ultimately resulted in a refined mechanistic model.

         <title>Controlling Assembly of Hybrid DNA Nanostructures into Higher&#8208;Order Structures via Hydrophobicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We harness hydrophobic interactions, fundamental in biology yet underutilized in DNA nanotechnology, to build a design framework for hierarchical DNA assemblies. By conjugating small hydrophobic molecules to DNA motifs, we controlled the formation of higher&#8208;order structures, moving beyond traditional Watson&#8211;Crick pairing.








Abstract
Hydrophobic interactions are one of the fundamental driving forces of self&#8208;assembly in living systems. It remains challenging to harness hydrophobicity to have a controllable and programmable assembly of DNA nanostructures. On the other hand, there is also a need to explore orthogonal hierarchical assembly strategies to be used as an additional toolset along with the traditional Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing to achieve complex superstructures. In this work, we rationally design and synthesize a series of low molecular weight hydrophobic molecules that are conjugated to single&#8208;stranded DNA strands. By incorporating these modified DNA strands into the precisely defined locations of DNA tiles and origami nanostructures, we achieve controlled hierarchical assembly driven by hydrophobic interaction. We demonstrate a versatile hydrophobicity&#8208;guided higher&#8208;order assembly strategy by employing strategically engineered DNA nanostructures of increasing complexity, ranging from simple DNA tiles to complex origami structures, functionalized with these small hydrophobic molecules as programmable building blocks.

         <title>Resiquimod&#8208;Induced Nanovaccine (RINV) for Personalized Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the dual roles of resiquimod (R848) as both an immune stimulant and a structural unit, this study conjugates R848 onto fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer to develop an antigen carrier G5&#8208;R848. G5&#8208;R848 forms stable nanovaccines with OVA model antigen or tumor lysates and facilitates cytosolic antigen delivery. The nanovaccines demonstrate potent DCs maturation and cross&#8208;presentation and elicit significantly increased tumor antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell responses.








Abstract
Cancer nanovaccines have emerged as a promising modality for cancer immunotherapy due to their capability of eliciting robust tumor&#8208;specific immune responses. However, structural complexity and insufficient spatiotemporal coordination of immune activation pose substantial challenges for optimizing the therapeutic potential of nanovaccines. Herein, a resiquimod&#8208;induced nanovaccine (RINV) is devised for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) was covalently conjugated to fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer through a disulfide linker to obtain the vaccine carrier G5&#8208;R848. In this design, R848 not only fulfills its biological role as a vaccine adjuvant but facilitates uniform nanovaccine formation with the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) due to its distinctive chemical structure. Redox&#8208;triggered intracellular R848 release further promotes cytosolic delivery of antigen and subsequent antigen cross&#8208;presentation. In vivo studies demonstrated that the nanovaccine induces remarkable prophylactic and therapeutic effects in the B16F10&#8208;OVA melanoma model. Moreover, G5&#8208;R848 forms personalized nanovaccines by complexing with cell lysates from resected B16F10 and 4T1 tumor tissues, effectively inhibiting postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Synthesis of Bonnadiene and ent&#8208;Polytrichastrene B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric total synthesis of bonnadiene and ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B has been accomplished. An enantioselective redox&#8208;relay Heck alkenylation was used to form the stereocenter at C7. The unique [6,7,5] spirotricyclic structure was constructed via [5+2] cycloaddition. The functionalities in the spirotricycle have been strategically utilized to append the remaining moieties present in the natural product in a sequential manner. Moreover, two Fe&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes were employed to reduce the unactivated tetrasubstituted olefin and to construct the tetrasubstituted cyclopropane ring.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The first asymmetric total synthesis of bonnadiene and &lt;i&gt;ent&lt;/i&gt;-polytrichastrene B has been accomplished. An enantioselective redox-relay Heck alkenylation was used to form the stereocenter at C7. The unique [6,7,5] spirotricyclic structure was constructed via [5+2] cycloaddition. The functionalities in the spirotricycle have been strategically utilized to append the remaining moieties present in the natural product in a sequential manner. Moreover, two Fe-catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes were employed to reduce the unactivated tetrasubstituted olefin and to construct the tetrasubstituted cyclopropane ring.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tunable Endo/Exo Selectivity in Direct Catalytic Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions with Polyfunctional Lewis Acid / Azolium&#8211;Aryloxide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept for catalytic asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with iminoesters employs modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium&#8208;aryloxide betaine catalysts, controlling endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;selectivity through adjustments of metal center, azolium, and sterics. DFT studies reveal an almost perfect spatial fit of functional sites, enabling precise orchestration of the catalytically relevant moieties involved&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic catalysis.








Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions (1,3&#8208;DCA) using iminoesters as ylide precursors offer a powerful approach to accessing stereochemically complex, biologically relevant pyrrolidines. Although previous studies have already achieved impressive stereoselectivities, catalytic productivity remains a challenge, with turnover numbers (TON) typically below 20. In this article, we introduce a novel concept for catalytic 1,3&#8208;DCA that enables remarkable productivity for both endo (TON up to 4000) and the more challenging exo products (TON up to 1500). This approach, making use of modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium&#8208;aryloxide catalysts, allows for precise control over endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity. The switch from endo&#8208; to exo&#8208;selectivity is accomplished by modifying the metal center, the azolium moiety, and steric factors. As detailed DFT studies reveal, both the endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;selective catalyst systems exhibit an almost perfect spatial alignment of their key functional sites, allowing for a unique interplay of Br&#248;nsted acids and bases, Lewis acids, and hydrogen bonding. The computational studies further demonstrate that these polyfunctional catalysts dramatically lower the energetic barriers of the concerted or stepwise cycloaddition key steps. However, they also precisely orchestrate and accelerate all accompanying transformations&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic machineries.

         <title>Origin of Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structures in Siloxane Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxane electrolytes exhibit anion&#8208;rich solvation structures due to their large steric hindrance. The lower Pauli repulsion of Si&#9472;O bond compared to C&#9472;O bond leads to higher intrinsic stability than corresponding ethers.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. Siloxane electrolytes exhibit excellent performance in high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Herein, the mechanisms responsible for the Li metal compatibility and high&#8208;voltage resistance of siloxane electrolytes were probed by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, first&#8208;principles calculations, and experimental characterizations. Siloxane electrolytes have been demonstrated to deliver anion&#8208;rich solvation structures, which are induced by weak Li ion (Li+)&#8211;solvent interactions and strong Li+&#8211;anion interactions. The silicon (Si)&#9472;oxygen (O) bond energy of siloxane is larger than that of carbon (C)&#9472;O of C&#8208;siloxane (replacing Si atoms in siloxane with C atoms) because the atomic radius of Si is larger than that of C, and the Pauli exclusion of Si is smaller than that of C. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that the decomposition of siloxane produces substances containing Si&#9472;O fragments on Li metal surfaces, which is beneficial for interfacial stability. This work reveals the mechanism of interfacial stability and intrinsic stability of siloxane electrolytes, providing a theoretical basis for the practical application of siloxane electrolytes in high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Divergent Upcycling of Polystyrene into Phenol and Hydroquinone Derivatives by Photocatalysis and Electrocatalysis</title>

A novel divergent upcycling of PS to high value&#8208;added phenol and hydroquinone derivatives by photocatalysis and electrocatalysis with high chemical selectivity. This method operates under 1 atm air and room temperature with an inexpensive organic photocatalyst via photooxidation&#8208;induced Hock rearrangement in a single step. The practicality of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful depolymerization of real&#8208;life polystyrene (PS) using a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation platform, highlighting its promising potential for the chemical recycling of PS waste.








Abstract
The selective upcycling of polystyrene (PS) waste into value&#8208;added aromatics has emerged as a compelling strategy toward sustainable plastic valorization, drawing significant scientific and industrial interest. While most existing methods involved oxidative C&#9472;C bond cleavage predominantly yield benzoic acid, the direct conversion of waste PS into phenolic compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first example of photocatalytic upcycling of PS into phenol derivatives with high chemoselectivity. This economical method proceeds under ambient conditions (1 atm air and room temperature) using an inexpensive organic photocatalyst via photooxidation&#8208;induced Hock rearrangement in a single step. The use of strong acid effectively suppresses the formation of benzoic acid, playing a critical role in high selectivity. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the cis configuration of neighboring phenyl rings in PS raises the barrier for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from the benzylic C&#9472;H bond, thereby contributing to the low polymer conversion. Furthermore, the novel divergent upcycling of PS to hydroquinone derivatives was achieved by a photo&#8208;electro tandem strategy. The practicality of this strategy is demonstrated by depolymerization of real&#8208;life PS using a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation platform, underscoring its promising potential for sustainable and scalable upcycling of PS waste.

         <title>Tunable Oxygen Vacancy Clusters Enhanced Catalytic Activity of CeO2 Nanorods on CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and halogen&#8208;free strategy for CO2 cycloaddition is achieved using CeO2 nanorods enriched with oxygen vacancy clusters. The Ce3+ ions and lattice oxygens in the vicinity of the vacancy clusters construct abundant frustrated Lewis pair sites, which boost substrate adsorption and activation, reduce reaction energy barriers, stabilize intermediates, and accelerate product desorption.








Abstract
Constructing heterogeneous halogen&#8208;free catalysts featuring efficiently activated CO2 and epoxides for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via an atom&#8208;economical route is significant but remains a big challenge. In this work, we develop an atmosphere&#8208;assisted strategy for preparing mesoporous CeO2 nanorods with tunable oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations, which boosts the performance of CO2 cycloaddition. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis elucidates that oxygen vacancy clusters regulate the dynamic equilibrium of the multiscale structure of CeO2 via a synergistic &#8220;compression&#8208;expansion&#8221; mechanism. Furthermore, the high concentrations of oxygen vacancy clusters form abundant frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) sites, which remarkably promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 with epoxides. Thus, the performance of CO2 cycloaddition was substantially intensified. A 95% yield of cyclic carbonate was obtained when the reaction was conducted with RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 at 110&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the kinetic properties and the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition on FLP sites in RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 were investigated based on the in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations. Thus, this work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts with tunable FLP sites for the efficient activation and conversion of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals by modulating oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient and halogen-free strategy for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycloaddition is achieved using CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanorods enriched with oxygen vacancy clusters. The Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and lattice oxygens in the vicinity of the vacancy clusters construct abundant frustrated Lewis pair sites, which boost substrate adsorption and activation, reduce reaction energy barriers, stabilize intermediates, and accelerate product desorption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing heterogeneous halogen-free catalysts featuring efficiently activated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and epoxides for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via an atom-economical route is significant but remains a big challenge. In this work, we develop an atmosphere-assisted strategy for preparing mesoporous CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanorods with tunable oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations, which boosts the performance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycloaddition. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis elucidates that oxygen vacancy clusters regulate the dynamic equilibrium of the multiscale structure of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via a synergistic &#8220;compression-expansion&#8221; mechanism. Furthermore, the high concentrations of oxygen vacancy clusters form abundant frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) sites, which remarkably promote the adsorption and activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with epoxides. Thus, the performance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycloaddition was substantially intensified. A 95% yield of cyclic carbonate was obtained when the reaction was conducted with RNR-CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 110&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the kinetic properties and the catalytic mechanism of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycloaddition on FLP sites in RNR-CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were investigated based on the in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations. Thus, this work provides new insights into the design of high-performance catalysts with tunable FLP sites for the efficient activation and conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into value-added chemicals by modulating oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Engineering of Hollow Microreactors with Catalytic Nanobrushes for Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated living CDSA endows the engineering of the surface of hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures and enables specific inner&#8208;outer spatial isolation of various catalytic species on tailored microreactor. Notably, the microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes and internal Pt&#8208;Ni alloys revealed prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine (95.4% sel.).








Abstract
Micro/nanoreactors with hollow structures have traditionally focused on the design of the internal catalytic microenvironment, while precise engineering of their external surfaces at a nanoscale level is particularly rare. Here, we develop a unique approach to elaborately engineer the surface of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;8)&#8208;based hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures that serve as an external catalytic platform. This involves the anchoring of high&#8208;density micellar brushes onto the epidermis of ZIF&#8208;8 via surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, followed by the rapid capture of multiple species to fabricate the catalytic nanobrushes. Such a nanoscale fluff&#8208;like surface in combination with an internal cavity that encapsulates other functional components enables specific spatial isolation of various catalysts. The resultant microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes for esterification and internal Pt&#9472;Ni alloys for hydrogenation reveals prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine with a high selectivity of 95.4%. Remarkably, the microreactor decorated with PW12 nanobrushes can greatly prompt the catalytic efficiency of esterification with the inhibited competition from the hydrogenation reaction. Overall, this work provides an innovative guidance for the rational creation of multifunctional microreactors with fine surface nanostructures.

         <title>Length Ratio&#8208;Driven Configurational Modulation of Heteroleptic Pd6L6L&#8217;6 Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By systematically modulating the ligand length ratio (r) between the two types of ligands in the octahedral heteroleptic Pd6L6L'6 cages, the local steric hindrance of each triangular face was altered. This subsequently adjusted the energy difference between the Type&#8208;A and Type&#8208;B isomers, ultimately driving a directional transformation of the cage configuration.








Abstract
Biomolecular configurational modulation is essential for maintaining the stability and functionality of biological systems. Drawing inspiration from this natural phenomenon, we present a strategy to modulate the configurations of heteroleptic Pd6L6L'6 cages by systematically varying the ligand length ratio (r). Although theoretical analysis suggests that these Pd6L6L'6 assemblies could adopt up to 48 possible configurational isomers, we successfully modulated the thermodynamic preference between two dominant configurations (Type&#8208;A and Type&#8208;B) by implementing energetic differentiation through careful optimization of r. Specifically, the system exclusively forms Type&#8208;A cages at r&#160;=&#160;1.0, whereas Type&#8208;B becomes the predominant configuration when r&#160;&#8805;&#160;1.4. Control experiments demonstrate that the introduction of bulky steric groups does not induce configuration changes. This research offers valuable insights and serves as a useful reference for the design and configurational modulation of heteroleptic cages.

         <title>Overcoming Challenges in Small&#8208;Ring Transfer: Direct Decarboxylative Hydroalkylation of Alkenes via Iron&#8208;Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a catalytic approach for the direct decarboxylation of challenging CF3&#8208;cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl carboxylic acids using cooperative iron&#8208;thiol catalysis. This strategy enables the efficient generation of valuable radicals that can be incorporated into activated and unactivated alkenes, offering access to elusive chemical space. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive mechanistic studies, supported by experimental, spectroscopic, and DFT data, which offer insights into radical stability in small&#8208;ring systems.








Abstract
Cyclopropanes, especially those substituted with trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups, are valuable scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Their enhanced bioavailability contributes to the widespread presence of this motif in a variety of bioactive compounds. Despite the development of multiple synthetic strategies, a direct method for transferring CF3&#8208;containing small rings from their most abundant carboxylic acid surrogates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we overcome the challenging decarboxylation of CF3&#8208;cyclopropyl and CF3&#8208;cyclobutyl carboxylic acids while leveraging the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited state of photochemically activated iron complexes. The resulting radicals were then engaged in radical addition to alkenes, followed by a timely hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process mediated by a thiol donor. This efficient iron&#8208;thiol cooperative catalysis enables, for the first time, facile hydroalkylation of alkenes with highly reactive CF3&#8208;containing cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl radicals. Synergistic experimental, spectroscopic, and density functional theory (DFT) studies support the proposed reaction mechanism. Additionally, we employed the radical stabilization energy (RSE) scale, developed using isodesmic equations computed at the DFT level, aiming to provide a better understanding of the reluctant radical decarboxylation of small&#8208;strained cycloalkanes.

         <title>Chirality Unbound in Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a method to wind chiral graphene nanoribbons into either right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices, depending on the functional groups that adorn their edges. These helically wound graphene nanoribbons act as room&#8208;temperature spin filters in thin films due to their chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.








Abstract
In this manuscript, we report the first demonstration of controlled helicity in extended graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We present a wealth of new graphene nanoribbons that are a direct consequence of the high&#8208;yielding and robust synthetic method revealed in this study. We created a series of defect&#8208;free, ultralong, chiral cove&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons where helical twisting of the graphene nanoribbon backbone is tuned through functionalization with chiral side chains. S&#8208;configured point chiral centers in the side chains transfer their chiral information to induce a helically chiral, right&#8208;handed twist in the graphene nanoribbon. As the backbone is extended, these helically twisted graphene nanoribbons exhibit a substantial increase in their circular dichroic response. The longest variant synthesized consists of an average of 268 linearly fused rings, reaching 65&#160;nm in average length with nearly 10 full end&#8208;to&#8208;end helical rotations. The structure exhibits an extraordinary |&#916;&#949;| value of 6780 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 550&#160;nm&#8212;the highest recorded for an organic molecule in the visible wavelength range. This new chiroptic material acts as room&#8208;temperature spin filters in thin films due to its chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.

The structure exhibits an extraordinary |&#916;&lt;i&gt;&#949;&lt;/i&gt;| value of 6780 M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 550&#160;nm&#8212;the highest recorded for an organic molecule in the visible wavelength range. This new chiroptic material acts as room-temperature spin filters in thin films due to its chirality-induced spin selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Tailored Molybdenum&#8211;Nickel Catalyst Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation and Suppresses Parasitic Oxygen Reduction for Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;tailored MoNi4 alloyed catalyst (MoNi3.6Cu0.4) showing high hydrogen oxidation activity but low oxygen reduction activity in alkali has been developed. Such dual functionality tackles the issue of reverse&#8208;current decay&#8212;the harmful potential jump from parasitic anodic oxygen reduction during startup/shutdown events. When integrating into an anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell, this catalyst demonstrates superior corrosion resistance and durability compared with the Pt/C counterpart over repeated startup/shutdown cycles.








Abstract
Numerous existing strategies struggle to mitigate reverse&#8208;current decay (RCD) during startup and shutdown in polymer electrolyte fuel cells to avoid cathode corrosion, but the added system complexity and cost are drawbacks. Here, we report that modification of a molybdenum&#8211;nickel alloy through the doping of copper enables a non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst (MoNi3.6Cu0.4) that efficiently catalyzes hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) while catalytically inactive toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, making it ideal for fuel&#8208;cell anode because the instantaneous interfacial potential jump originated from the parasitic ORR during device startup/shutdown can be surmounted. The catalyst, when assembled in the anode of an anion exchange membrane fuel cell, manifests substantially improved corrosion&#8208;resistant ability compared with that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon&#8208;supported platinum (Pt/C) catalyst. The basis for the achieved performances reveals to be the copper dopants that increase the hydrogen bonding of interfacial water for enhanced HOR, yet weaken molecular oxygen adsorption while stabilizing hydroxyl adsorption for ORR suppression.

         <title>Photoelectric/Photothermal Synergy Activation in Floating Aerogel Cathode Breaks Neutral Triphase Reaction Barriers for High&#8208;Efficiency Full&#8208;Spectrum&#8208;Responsive Seawater Batteries</title>

A unique photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activated floating catalytic platform based on the rationally designed Janus aerogel has been explored to maximize sunlight utilization and overcome inherent kinetics/mass transport limitations of bifunctional oxygen reactions in neutral triphase systems, enabling a new class of full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive seawater battery to achieve ultrahigh energy efficiency. It is unveiled that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically improve oxygen reaction kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates the adsorption energetics optimization of reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Harnessing natural resources (solar, seawater) to explore next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage is an intriguing yet challenging task. Here, we establish a unique floating photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activated catalytic platform based on engineered Janus aerogel that overcomes inherent mass transport/kinetics constraints in neutral triphase oxygen reaction systems to enable a full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive seawater battery with ultrahigh energy efficiency. Our approach employs in situ region&#8208;selective assembly of the rationally designed fluorinated donor&#8211;acceptor polymers on carbon&#8208;nanotube aerogel (FMTAPPC), creating a new floatable FMTAPPC photoelectrode with asymmetric wettability, superior photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;response, and bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction (OER/ORR) catalysis. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration enables floating FMTAPPC to maximize sunlight utilization for interface micro&#8208;environment regulation and adsorbate binding optimization via photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activation while satisfying paradoxical wetting requirements of OER/ORR, which tunes reaction kinetics and intermediate energetics to remarkably promote both OER/ORR in neutral media. Under sunlight, floating FMTAPPC delivers large current densities for both OER/ORR&#8211;3&#8211;4 fold&#8208;enhancement over dark conditions. This enables the seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8211;air battery to simultaneously improve charge/discharge performance at high rates and deliver ultrahigh round&#8208;trip efficiency of 128.2%&#8212;surpassing most photo&#8208;assisted batteries. Mechanistic studies unveil that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically boost OER/ORR kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates intermediate energetics optimization, substantially lowering reaction energy barriers.

         <title>Spring&#8208;Like Behavior in [8]Helicene Diimides: How Helical Pitch Governs Optical Anisotropy and Electronic Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging the imide nitrogen atoms of [8]helicene diimides with different alkyl chains allows for precise control over the helical pitch of their backbones. This has a profound impact on the molecular packing, chiroptical properties, and through&#8208;space electronic conjugation of the molecules. As a result, this approach enables fine&#8208;tuning of the properties of this new class of materials with enhanced optical anisotropy and electronic communication.








Abstract
Helicenes, with their corkscrew&#8208;shaped geometry, have emerged as prototypical molecular springs for engineering chiral functional materials through precise structural modulation. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of [8]helicene diimides ([8]HDIs) and demonstrate that the helical pitch of their backbone can be precisely tuned by bridging the imide nitrogen atoms with alkyl chains of varying lengths (C3&#8211;C6). This approach constrains the molecular geometry to systematically control optical anisotropy, chiroptical response, and electronic communication. Remarkably, modulation of the helical pitch leads to high optical dissymmetry factors (up to 6.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) and enhanced through&#8208;space conjugation. Furthermore, we investigate how variations in the helical pitch affect crystal packing in both enantiopure and racemic samples. Complementary quantum chemical calculations provide insights into the origins of these properties, highlighting the potential of this strategy for designing advanced chiral materials.

We develop a thiophene&#8208;modified &#960;&#8208;conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayer, referred to as Me&#8208;TPCP, which serves as the hole&#8208;selective layer for inverted perovskite solar cells. Me&#8208;TPCP demonstrates exceptional ultraviolet stability, superior hole extraction, and effective defect passivation capabilities. Consequently, we achieve a remarkable efficiency of 25.62% with excellent ultraviolet, operational, and thermal stability.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced degradation, particularly occurring at the buried interface, has emerged as a significant stability challenge, severely limiting the widespread applications of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we rationally design and synthesize novel thiophene&#8208;modified self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;conjugated hole&#8208;selective molecules, namely (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;TPCP), affording UV&#8208;stable high&#8208;efficiency PSCs. Simultaneously incorporating phenyl and thiophene groups enhances molecular conjugation, effectively protecting the fragile bonds between the carbazole core and the phosphonic acid group. This modification results in enhanced intrinsic UV stability and improved hole transport ability of the molecule. Furthermore, thiophene grafted on the carbazole coordinates with the Pb2+ ions in perovskite, enhancing the binding of perovskite to hole&#8208;selective molecules. Consequently, the crystallinity of the perovskite film is significantly improved, along with decreased defect density, thereby inhibiting its degradation under UV light illumination. By introducing methyl groups, the molecular stability is further enhanced, and the energy level of Me&#8208;TPCP is finely tuned, resulting in a lower interfacial energy barrier that facilitates more efficient hole extraction. With these advantages, inverted PSC devices based on Me&#8208;TPCP achieve a significantly higher efficiency of 25.62% than the control devices (23.85%). Meanwhile, these devices demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in UV stability, as well as improved operational and thermal stability.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of three&#8208;dimensional (3D COFs)&#160;was developed with a cyt topology, facilitating the uniform dispersion and full exposure of distinct metal sites. The resulting TAPP&#8208;OFPc&#8208;COFs demonstrate exceptional electrocatalytic performance in urea oxidation. The Fe&#8211;Ni bimetallic sites synergistically ensure high efficiency and cycle stability.








Abstract
Porphyrin and phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile scaffolds for developing high&#8208;performance photo&#8208; and electrocatalysts. By enabling precise anchoring of metal species onto their cores, these COFs allow for meticulous tuning of chemical and electronic properties, facilitating single&#8208;atom distribution and achieving outstanding catalytic performance. However, the majority of these COFs are restricted to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) architectures, where the catalytic activity of the metal centers is often compromised due to eclipsed stacking layers, limiting their optimization potential. To address this challenge, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porphyrin and phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs with a cyt topology. This innovative structural arrangement facilitates the atomic&#8208;level distribution of distinct metal species across steric exposed networks, and the synergistic effect of bimetallic sites leads to exceptional electrocatalytic activity in urea oxidation reactions with a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at just 1.37&#160;VRHE. This study not only broadens the topological diversity of 3D COFs but also establishes a platform for achieving uniform and accessible multimetal distributions, paving the way for synergistic electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Reactivity of a Methylene&#8208;Bridged 1,3&#8208;Bis(germylene) in Dynamic Equilibrium with Its Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the properties and reactivity of an unprecedented methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. In the solid state, the 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative undergoes dimerization to afford a 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetragermacyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene (Ge4CHD) derivative. Moreover, the reactivity revealed that the Ge4CHD derivative dissociated into the methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative in solution.








Abstract
We report the properties and reactivity of an unprecedented methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. In the solid state, it undergoes dimerization to afford a 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetragermacyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene derivative (Ge4CHD). Moreover, theoretical calculations on Ge4CHD reveal &#963;*&#8211;&#960; interactions between the two &#960; orbitals (Ge&#9552;Ge) and the CH &#963;* orbital. This interaction is confirmed by a significant red shift in the solid&#8208;state UV&#8211;vis spectrum. In contrast to the behavior in the solid state, the Ge4CHD derivative dissociates in solution into a methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. The resultant 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative reacted with S8 to form a novel cage compound containing three S and two Ge atoms. On the other hand, in the reaction with triphenylphosphine sulfide, the in situ generated 2&#8208;thia&#8208;1,3&#8208;digermabicyclo[1.1.0]butane derivative activated the benzene solvent, leading to the formation of a [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition product. Additionally, the 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative reacted with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to form a three&#8208;membered ring. Its structural parameters and the results of theoretical calculations indicated the zwitterionic character.

         <title>Operando XAFS Deciphering Dynamic Evolution of Heteronuclear Cu&#8211;Ni From Atomic Sites to Atomic Clusters for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the intrinsic potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction of Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear sites during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Through operando XAFS and microscopy, we reveal the potential&#8208;driven transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8211;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8211;Ni ACs, x&#160;=&#160;3&#8211;7). The tailored Cu5&#8211;Ni ACs effectively reduce the occupancy of Cu 3d&#8211;C 2p antibonding orbitals, thereby promoting CO2 protonation and significantly accelerating eCO2RR kinetics.








Abstract
Revealing the dynamic evolution of atomic&#8208;level active sites during catalytic reactions is critical for identifying true catalytic centers and optimizing the adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, elucidating the dynamic atomic/electronic transformation mechanisms of metal sites in multimetallic systems and achieving atomic&#8208;level control remains challenging. Here, we report a potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction intrinsic to Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear atomic sites during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and microscopy unveil the transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8211;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8211;Ni ACs, x&#160;=&#160;3&#8211;7) at potentials from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.2&#160;V versus RHE, anchored on porous carbon through N/S coordination. The Cu&#8208;rich evolution reshapes geometric structures of active sites, inducing gradual electron localization, thereby optimizing the adsorption energy of CO2 intermediates as evidenced by operando measurements and theoretical analysis. Specifically, the tailored Cu5&#8211;Ni ACs formed at &#8722;0.9&#160;V reduce the antibonding orbital occupancy between Cu 3d and C 2p states, facilitating CO2 protonation and enhancing eCO2RR kinetics. These findings demonstrate high CO selectivity and catalytic stability, providing fundamental insights into the dynamic reconstruction and catalytic mechanism of atomic&#8208;scale active sites.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Atom La2 Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an ultra&#8208;fast printing technology, we have successfully embedded diatomic lanthanum sites onto a graphene framework, which shows excellent ORR performance. The La2&#8208;N6 configuration structure can effectively reduce the reaction barrier of RDS and promote effective charge transfer, thus enhancing the catalytic process, on which the intermediates and structural evolution were well uncovered by combining advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations.








Abstract
Rare earth lanthanum element has a large atomic radius, multi&#8208;shell orbital electrons, and Fenton&#8208;like reaction inertia, on which a localized high&#8208;coordination structure can be easily formed for the favorable adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, for single&#8208;atom lanthanum sites, due to the loss of all the outmost s and d electrons, the practically vacuous outmost orbitals are stable but sleepy for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we synthesize a novel dual&#8208;atom La catalyst onto N&#8208;doped graphene (La2&#8208;NG) by a Joule ultrafast heating method, which shows a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.893&#160;V for the ORR. The La2&#8208;NG&#8208;assembled zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrates a great open circuit voltage of 1.52&#160;V and a maximal power density of 192&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal the change of valence states of La and the dynamic structural evolution of the La2&#8208;N6 moiety embedded onto the graphene during the ORR, through which the adsorption/desorption of oxygen reduction intermediates can be reasonably regulated. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the La2&#8208;N6 structure can decrease the reaction energy barrier and promote charge transfer.

Operando X-ray absorption spectra reveal the change of valence states of La and the dynamic structural evolution of the La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; moiety embedded onto the graphene during the ORR, through which the adsorption/desorption of oxygen reduction intermediates can be reasonably regulated. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; structure can decrease the reaction energy barrier and promote charge transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upconversion Lanthanide&#8208;Based 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Multimode Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D Yb&#8208;PMA MOFs were synthesized, and upconversion luminescence under 980&#160;nm excitation was successfully achieved by introducing Ho3+, Tb3+, or Eu3+ as the luminescence center and using Yb3+ as the sensitizer. The upconversion/down&#8208;shifting luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based 2D MOFs designed in this work show good potential for application in the field of information encryption.








Abstract
Luminescent 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of metal&#8208;organic framework materials expanded in a 2D plane, which have a wide range of applications in fields of optoelectronic devices, sensors, and information storage due to their unique layered structure and excellent optical properties. Currently, research on luminescent 2D MOFs mainly focuses on down&#8208;shifting luminescence, while the exploration of upconversion luminescence remains in its early stages. Herein, a novel 2D Yb&#8208;PMA MOFs were synthesized, and red upconversion luminescence at 660 nm under 980&#160;nm excitation was successfully achieved by introducing Ho3+ as the luminescence center and using Yb3+ as the sensitizer. In addition, multimode emitting MOFs with both upconversion and down&#8208;shifting luminescence were further constructed by codoping Tb3+ or Eu3+. Inspired by the layered structure of 2D materials, multilayer stacked 2D MOFs composites were prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation method and upconversion luminescence was realized for the first time by interfacial energy transfer between different components. This strategy not only expands the optical modulation of luminescent 2D MOFs, but also provides new ideas for the construction of multifunctional luminescent materials. The upconversion/down&#8208;shifting luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based 2D MOFs designed in this work show good potential for application in the field of information encryption.

         <title>N&#9472;B&#9472;N Isomer Induced Room Temperature Phosphorescence: Expression, Mechanistic Insights, and Multi&#8208;Level Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>

This study introduces an N&#9472;B&#9472;N unit&#8208;based strategy to enhance room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), highlighting that 1,1&#8208;DB shows strong RTP property, unlike its isomer 1,2&#8208;DB. The contrast in their performance aids in understanding the relationship between molecular structure and phosphorescence, offering insights for designing and optimizing RTP materials.








Abstract
Achieving pure organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials is of great interest due to their applications in optoelectronics. However, improving RTP in pure organic materials by controlling triplet excitons is challenging due to their complex relaxation processes. Therefore, exploring effective strategies to modulate triplet excitons is crucial. Herein, we propose a N&#9472;B&#9472;N isomerization strategy to enhance RTP performance. Two isomers containing HN&#9472;B&#9472;NH units (B2{1,2&#8208;(NH)2C6H4}2), namely 1,1&#8208;DB and 1,2&#8208;DB, were synthesized to explore their RTP properties. Intriguingly, 1,1&#8208;DB exhibited excellent RTP, whereas 1,2&#8208;DB displayed negligible phosphorescence. The N&#9472;B&#9472;N unit in 1,1&#8208;DB optimizes molecular configuration and interactions, enhancing electron delocalization and stabilizing triplet excitons, which improves intersystem crossing (ISC) and spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) while reducing nonradiative decay, thus enabling RTP. Additionally, based on phosphorescence resonance energy transfer, multicolor afterglows were achieved by doping fluorescein into 1,1&#8208;DB. This work not only provides a new class of RTP materials but also offers valuable insights for the discovery and optimization of rational designs in RTP materials, potentially triggering the exploration of new functions and properties within boron&#8208;nitrogen molecular systems.

         <title>Azine&#8208;Pyridine Frame Generated Covalent Organic Frameworks and Self&#8208;Polymerized Films</title>

We report a family of azine&#8208;pyridine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that promote proton and electron transport through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. These COFs exhibit thermochromism, self&#8208;assemble into meter&#8208;scale films, and show enhanced heavy metal ion reduction, UV shielding, and battery performance, offering new opportunities in reticular chemistry, environmental science, and energy storage.








Abstract
Engineering covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into industrializable films with inherent functionalities has remained a major challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, through developing skeletal azine&#8208;pyridine conformation, we present an effectual synthetic frame to convert a family of powdery COFs into self&#8208;polymerized COFs films under green and ambient conditions. The active proton tautomerism in our azine&#8208;pyridine frame offers a thermochromism, facilitating self&#8208;polymerization of large&#8208;area COFs films from ca. 10&#160;nm to &gt;30&#160;&#181;m thickness with outstanding chemical stability, industrializable processability, and mechanical strength. More remarkably, our azine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based COFs first display various fresh properties, i.e., up to 1913 and 624&#160;mg g&#8722;1 reducing capacities on ions of Au3+&#160;&#8594;&#160;Au0 and Cr6+&#160;&#8594;&#160;Cr3+, 99.9% UV&#8208;blue light shielding and 97.2% transmissivity of visible lights and 10&#8208;fold increase in Zn battery lifetime. We expect that the azine&#8208;pyridine synthetic frame will serve as a generalizable route to boost the development of reticular chemistry, environmental science, and nano&#8208;electronics.

         <title>Tunable Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Supramolecular Polymers Toward Application in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitherto thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and supramolecular polymerization have been seemingly incompatible phenomena. Herein, we demonstrate multiple resonance (MR) TADF from supramolecular polymers, which can be tuned, by using a supramolecular modulator approach. Further, a supramolecular solubilization strategy allows for the transfer of these properties to aqueous media, highlighting the potential for future application.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) offers great potential for application in light emitting devices and bioimaging. Supramolecular polymers can offer intriguing properties for the same applications, such as stimuli responsiveness and self&#8208;healing owing to their dynamic intermolecular interactions. However, merging the two has remained a formidable challenge, due to the nonplanar geometry of common TADF chromophores. Herein, we overcome this challenge by utilizing a less distorted multiple resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) chromophore connected to a polymerization inducing building block. The obtained supramolecular synthon is capable of assembling in aliphatic solvents due to combined interchromophore interactions and hydrogen bonding. Within the supramolecular ensemble the long&#8208;lived photoluminescence properties of the chromophore are maintained. Further modification of the photoluminescence properties could be achieved by using different supramolecular modulators in a social self&#8208;sorting approach, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of the photoluminescence lifetime and bandwidth. Notably, the extent of intermolecular interactions can switch these assemblies from kinetically to thermodynamically controlled regimes. Finally, we employ this co&#8208;assembly strategy to move from organic to aqueous media highlighting the potential toward biological applications.

         <title>Engineering Unspecific Peroxygenases for Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unspecific peroxygenase from Aspergillus niger (AniUPO) has been successfully engineered to catalyze the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. This biocatalytic process demonstrates high efficiency and selectivity with scalability to preparative levels, expanding the catalytic repertoire and synthetic applicability of UPOs in selective oxyfunctionalization.








Abstract
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) are promising biocatalysts for selective oxyfunctionalization. Compared to cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s), the catalytic potential of UPOs has been less investigated, largely due to their limited natural diversity and the challenges associated with their optimization through enzyme engineering. In this study, we engineered an UPO from Aspergillus niger (AniUPO) to catalyze the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, a valuable transformation yet to be realized in biocatalysis. Through enzyme engineering, two AniUPO variants, AniUPO&#8208;M3 and AniUPO&#8208;M6, were developed to produce a wide range of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters, achieving up to 97% yield, 4140 total turnover number (TTN), and &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio (er). The biocatalytic process operates under mild conditions and is scalable for preparative applications. This study broadens the catalytic repertoire of UPOs and enhances their potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Chirally Chimeric Protein Nanoparticle Vaccines via Mirror&#8208;Image Spy Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study illustrates a versatile strategy for creating chirally chimeric protein constructs by merging natural&#8208;chirality (L&#8208;) and mirror&#8208;image (D&#8208;) protein motifs through a combination of L&#8208;sortase&#8208;mediated transpeptidation and D&#8208;SpyStapler&#8208;mediated ligation. This approach has enabled the development of protein nanoparticle vaccines with improved stability and the ability to elicit potent antibody responses.








Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image proteins and nucleic acids exhibit remarkable biostability and bioorthogonality, offering a promising strategy to enhance the longevity of biological therapeutics. Here, we present a modular approach for constructing complex protein architectures that integrate both natural&#8208;chirality (L&#8208;) and mirror&#8208;image (D&#8208;) motifs. Key to this strategy is the development of D&#8208;SpyStapler&#8212;a chemically synthesized, chirally inverted ligase that enables the efficient conjugation of D&#8208;SpyTag and D&#8208;BDTag. By exploiting the achirality of glycine (Gly), we used L&#8208;sortase to covalently link D&#8208;peptides (e.g., SpyTag or BDTag, bearing an N&#8208;terminal poly&#8208;Gly motif) to L&#8208;proteins (e.g., GFP, VLP&#8208;forming Mi3, or antigens) containing a C&#8208;terminal LPXTG sorting signal. The resulting D&#8208;SpyTagged and D&#8208;BDTagged proteins were further assembled via D&#8208;SpyStapler. This method enabled the construction of chirally chimeric VLP vaccines displaying antigens derived from malaria parasites and coronaviruses in various forms&#8212;recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides&#8212;providing significant flexibility and modularity for vaccine design. The resulting chirally hybrid vaccines exhibited enhanced proteolytic resistance in vitro and elicited potent immune responses in vivo. This study provides a versatile platform for developing long&#8208;acting therapeutics and vaccines.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Alternating Poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with Tunable Properties Enabled by Substitution Effects and Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structurally diversity were synthesized by a &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8208;repolymerization&#8221; strategy. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. 








Abstract
The development of innovative poly(ether&#8208;ester)s with perfectly alternating ether and ester functionalities to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer's depolymerizability and performance properties is in high demand for advanced material applications and sustainable development. Herein, we prepared a series of enantiopure cyclic thioether&#8208;ester monomers bearing various pendant substituents by a facile &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8221; strategy. The controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of these enantiopure monomers will afford stereoregular poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structural diversity. The varieties of substituent size, position and stereo&#8208;configuration provide the opportunity to systematically investigate polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics as well as structure&#8208;properties relationship for the resulting poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. A(hard)&#8208;B(soft)&#8208;A(hard) triblock thermoplastic elastomers with good mechanical performance and elastic recovery were also created by sequential polymerization. Of note, these polymers can be chemically recycled by either ring&#8208;closing depolymerization or alcoholysis, with high monomer regeneration efficiency. The systematic investigation of substitution effects and structure&#8208;property relationships in this work provides a molecular blueprint for designing novel chemically recyclable polymers with high performance.

         <title>Engineering Crystalline/Amorphous Interfaces for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an amorphous indium&#8208;based catalyst, which could reconstruct into crystalline/amorphous In/In&#9472;OH interfaces instead of metallic indium under working conditions. Therefore, it can exhibit excellent performance in CO2 electroreduction to formic acid at high current densities. The Faradaic efficiency of CO2 electroreduction to formic acid over the In/In&#9472;OH interfaces reaches 98%, which is a 66.1% increase compared to traditional In2O3. 








Abstract
In the request for carbon neutrality, CO2 electroreduction to high&#8208;value fuels and chemicals, particularly formic acid, has become as a promising approach. However, implementing it on an industrial scale is hindered by the catalyst instability under high current densities and the excessive energy consumption of conventional electrolysis systems. To tackle these challenges, we propose an amorphization strategy to regulate catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions. In particular, an amorphous In&#8208;based catalyst, InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x, was designed and achieved high Faradaic efficiencies of 98% at &#8722;800 to &#8722;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for CO2 electroreduction to formate, while maintaining stability for 100&#160;h. Mechanistic studies show that InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x undergoes partial reduction to stable crystalline/amorphous In/In&#9472;OH interfaces instead of fully reducing to metallic In, enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and *OCHO intermediate. To improve the economic viability of electrolysis system, a CO2 electroreduction coupled with waste plastics electrooxidation system for formate production was constructed. Compared to conventional electrolysis system, the coupled system reduced energy consumption by 34.7% and increased formate production by 49.7%, offering a more energy&#8208;efficient and cost&#8208;effective approach to CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Dynamic Regulation of Radical Photochromism and Photoluminescence via Polymer Polarity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarity of polymer matrices not only plays a crucial role in inducing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence by protecting the naphthalene diimide core structure from quenching by oxygen and moisture, but also facilitates the generation of stable anion radicals through photoinduced electron transfer, even in the absence of UV irradiation.








Abstract
While polymer matrices are widely used to protect excited&#8208;state phosphors from oxygen and moisture quenching by providing a network that enables long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the influence of polymer polarity on phosphors for stable free radicals with radical luminescence (RL) has not been well studied. In this work, naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives, denoted as NDI&#8208;XC&#8208;OH (X&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;6), featuring different alkyl alcohol chains, exhibit multi&#8208;responsive and tunable RTP and RL properties through polymer matrix polarity regulation. Experimental results reveal that NDI&#8208;XC&#8208;OH&#8226;&#8722; anion radicals are generated via not only photoinduction in the excited state but also intermolecular interactions of polar matrix in the ground state. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that polar polymers rich in hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors (e.g., &#9472;NH2, &#9472;NH&#9472;, and &#9472;OH), where electrostatic interactions dominate over dispersion (E/D&#160;&gt;&#160;1), more readily induce anion radicals compared to polar polymers rich in acceptors (e.g., &#9472;CN and &#9472;CO&#9472;), where dispersion interactions outweigh electrostatic effects (E/D&#160;&lt;&#160;1). These derivatives exhibit potential applications in information encryption and volatile amine detection due to their chromic and luminescent properties. These findings offer perspectives on the role of polymer matrix polarity in modulating anion radical behavior, and mechanistic insights into the balance between RTP and RL properties.

         <title>Efficient Electro&#8208;Oxidation of Ethylene to 2&#8208;Chloroethanol on SnO2 Through Dual&#8208;Adsorbate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of chlorine&#8208;participated ethylene oxidation on a tin dioxide (SnO2) anode is elucidated. In this process, 92% of 2&#8208;chloroethanol is produced through the dual&#8208;adsorbate pathway, where ethylene directly couples with chloride (*Cl) and hydroxide (*OH). 








Abstract
Electrified 2&#8208;chloroethanol synthesis serves as a promising alternative to conventional ethylene oxidation with corrosive hypochlorous acid (HClO) and offers the opportunity for sustainable pharmaceutical production. However, the instability of locally generated HClO and the competing water oxidation largely limit the efficiency of this electrochemical process. Here we report a new reaction pathway involved in the ethylene oxidation toward 2&#8208;chloroethanol, featuring co&#8208;adsorbed chloride (*Cl) and hydroxide (*OH) species on a tin dioxide (SnO2) anode. This dual&#8208;adsorbate pathway favors the efficient ethylene oxidation, giving rise to a large current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for at least 50 h and a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 82% for the 2&#8208;chloroethanol product. This work opens an avenue for electrifying the synthesis of important organic molecules via simultaneously modulating the adsorption of multiple active intermediates.

         <title>A Recyclable Cooperative Approach for Selective Lithium Recovery from Industrial&#8208;Grade Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Black Mass via Oxidative Delithiation and Complexation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel method to extract lithium selectively from spent LIBs under mild conditions. The cooperative actions of anthraquinone ligand with H2O2 generate reactive oxygen species that drive oxidative delithiation with concurrent lithium abstraction and coordination by the ligand, enabling efficient and rapid lithium extraction.








Abstract
Extracting lithium selectively from an industrial&#8208;grade lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) black mass having multiple metal ions is challenging but crucial from an industrial standpoint. However, most of the methods involve harsh conditions and sacrificial reagents, are energy&#8208;intensive and time&#8208;consuming, and generate secondary pollution. This study presents a lithium selective, ligand&#8208;assisted cooperative approach for the selective leaching of lithium under mild conditions. It is revealed that the synergistic actions of anthraquinone salt (Na2AQAc) and H2O2 generate highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as &#8226;OH, &#8226;O2&#8722;, and 1O2 that facilitate oxidative delithiation supported by spin trapping EPR and quenching experiments. As a result, a phase transition of cathode material and concurrent lithium abstraction by the ligand, forming an octanuclear lithium complex ([Li8(AQAc2&#8722;)2(&#956;&#8208;OH2)2(H2O)12]4+) in the leachate was observed. Consequently, a leaching efficiency of 97% with over 99% selectivity was achieved under the optimized conditions of 3.5% H2O2 (v/v), 30&#160;&#176;C, 72&#160;mM Na2AQAc, 40&#160;g L&#8722;1 pulp density, and a reaction time of 1&#160;h. A recycling strategy was demonstrated to recover anthraquinone acid, and lithium was separated as high&#8208;purity Li&#8322;CO&#8323;. This method offers the advantages of room&#8208;temperature operation, neutral pH conditions, shorter time duration, minimal reagent usage, and the ability to recycle the reagents.

         <title>Stepwise Acetylene Insertion and Ammonia Activation at a Digallene and Diindene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise insertion of acetylene into the E&#9552;E bonds of digallenes and diindenes is reported. This leads to the selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores. The six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues are Lewis&#8208;acidic and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia, which&#8212;upon heating&#8212;undergo ammonolysis releasing ethylene.








Abstract
Sequential [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions between acetylene and the digallene and diindene compounds (ETer)2 (E&#160;=&#160;Ga, In; Ter&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Dipp2&#8208;C6H3; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) are described. Careful control of the reaction conditions leads to selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores, respectively. A structural analysis of the heterocycles by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests limited electronic delocalization within the rings, which is borne out in their reactivity. For example, the six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues exhibit Lewis&#8208;acidic behavior and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia. Upon heating, these adducts transform into the corresponding bimetallic triel amides with concomitant generation of ethene.

         <title>Regioreversed Carbosulfenylation of Fluoroalkenes via Nickel&#8208;Mediated Radical Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed unconventional 2,1&#8208;carbosulfenylation of fluoroalkenes provides efficient access to sulfide and fluoroalkyl&#8208;containing products. Preliminary mechanistic studies support a pathway involving thiyl radical generation via HAT, addition to the alkene, and subsequent nickel&#8208;mediated benzylation.








Abstract
Carbosulfenylation of olefins represents an important class of reactions for the synthesis of structurally diverse organosulfur compounds. Previous studies typically yield 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity. In the context of diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis, accessing the regioreversed products is desirable, significantly broadening the scope of these reactions. In this study, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed 2,1&#8208;carbosulfenylation of trifluoromethyl&#8208; and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, using free thiols and benzyl bromides as sulfur and carbon sources, respectively. The unusual regioselectivity observed is enabled by a &#8220;radical sorting&#8221; mechanism. The Ni catalyst activates benzyl bromide to generate a benzylic radical that undergoes hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with the thiol to form a sulfur&#8208;centered radical. The sulfur radical subsequently adds to the fluoroalkenes, resulting in an &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl C&#8208;radical. This radical undergoes SH2 with a Ni&#8211;CH2Ar to form a C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond and quaternary center, ultimately producing valuable fluoroalkyl thioethers. Isotopic labeling experiments corroborate a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) event within the working mechanism.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature, High&#8208;Voltage, Flame&#8208;Retardant Electrolyte for 4.8&#160;V Li||NCM94 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we construct a highly Li+&#8208;conductive, lithophilic gradient CEI based on a high&#8208;voltage, wide&#8208;temperature and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte for stabilizing Li||NCM94 battery at high voltage (4.8&#160;V) and extreme temperatures (&#8722;40&#8764;60&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
All&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries attract great interest, but their poor safety and cycling performance hinder their applications, especially with high cut&#8208;off voltage nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode. Herein, we develop a high&#8208;voltage, wide&#8208;temperature, and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte for Li|| LiNi0.94Co0.05Mn0.01O2 (NCM94) batteries with excellent cycling performance through constructing highly Li+&#8208;conductive, lithophilic gradient cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). Such CEI exhibits a gradual decrease in C&#9472;F and a gradient increase in LiF and LiBxOy from the outside to the inside, which effectively inhibits structural degradation of the NCM94 cathode. With an excellent CEI, Li|| NCM94 batteries show outstanding cycling stability and wide temperature applicability (&#8722;40&#8764;60&#160;&#176;C). The battery could exhibit a capacity retention of 87% after 200 cycles at 4.8&#160;V, and deliver 112% (or 56%) of their room&#8208;temperature capacity at 60 &#176;C and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, as&#8208;constructed 7.6&#160;Ah pouch cell could run 145 cycles with an energy density of 541&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work provides the guidance on designing electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces for wide&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Modular Access to P(V)&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds via Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of (Thio)Phosphonic Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy using newly modified chiral PIM ligands enables modular access to diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds with high stereocontrol. This approach tolerates broad functionality, constructs challenging P&#9552;S motifs, and enables late&#8208;stage nucleoside derivatization, providing a versatile platform for drug and nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutic development.








Abstract
Chiral phosphorus(V) centers&#8212;particularly those bearing fully heteroatom&#8208;substituted frameworks&#8212;are key stereochemical motifs in pharmaceuticals, nucleic acid therapeutics, and functional materials. However, their stereoselective construction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy enabled by rationally engineered PIM ligands that affords broad and modular access to structurally diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds. By harnessing the tunable Lewis acidity and well&#8208;defined chiral environment of the catalyst&#8212;together with the distinct mechanistic features of chiral Lewis acid catalysis&#8212;this strategy overcomes the substrate scope limitations that have constrained traditional approaches. The method demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and delivers high levels of stereocontrol across seven distinct substitution patterns, including the efficient construction of chiral P&#9552;S motifs previously considered synthetically challenging. Importantly, the approach enables efficient late&#8208;stage derivatization of nucleosides and their analogs, thereby providing a general entry point to stereodefined P(V)&#8208;containing bioactive molecules. This work not only expands the utility of transition&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis in phosphorus chemistry, but also establishes a versatile framework for applications in drug discovery and nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutics where precise stereochemical control is essential.

         <title>Electrocatalytic C&#9472;S Cross&#8208;Coupling via Engineered Frustrated Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Pairs for High&#8208;Efficiency Methanesulfonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that MOFs catalysts with Lewis acid&#8208;base sites generated by introducing specific ligand groups can produce methanesulfonate through nucleophilic attack, and performance is superior to previously reported copper&#8208;based catalysts. This work highlights the importance of the Lewis acid and base sites for electrocatalytic C&#9472;S coupling reaction and provides an avenue to produce by abundant resources and renewable electricity.








Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of sulfonyl compounds under mild conditions remains a significant challenge due to the reliance on harsh reagents, high energy consumption, and low selectivity in conventional methods. Herein, we report a novel strategy for efficient C&#9472;S bond formation through in situ modulation of frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs within a copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CuBDC&#8208;XN). By precisely engineering electron&#8208;deficient Cu Lewis acid sites and electron&#8208;rich XN&#8208;functionalized Lewis base sites, this bifunctional catalyst enables the synergistic co&#8208;reduction of SO32&#8722; and CO2 into methanesulfonate (MS) at ambient conditions with a Faradaic efficiency of 13.77% (&#8722;0.78&#160;V versus RHE). Mechanistic studies reveal that the frustrated Lewis pairs selectively stabilize key intermediates (*CHO and SO32&#8722;) via electrostatic interactions, facilitating nucleophilic attack and C&#9472;S coupling with a reduced energy barrier (0.48&#160;eV). In situ spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations further elucidate the dynamic adsorption&#8208;configuration regulation and intermediate evolution pathway. This work not only establishes a molecular&#8208;level understanding of cooperative Lewis acid&#8208;base catalysis but also provides a universal design principle for the sustainable electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added organosulfur compounds.

         <title>Dual Chemical Scissors Strategy Enables 1D Antimony Selenates with Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric 1D antimony selenates&#8212;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III)&#8212;were successfully designed and synthesized via dual chemical scissors strategy. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8211;10&#160;&#181;m), a strong SHG response (5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546&#160;nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for UV NLO applications.








Abstract
The rational, function&#8208;driven design of advanced inorganic functional materials remains a significant challenge, primarily attributed to their inherently complex and highly connected 3D frameworks of most oxide&#8208;based systems. Herein, we report a &#8220;dual chemical scissors&#8221; strategy that synergistically combines the effects of fluoride ions and stereochemically active lone pairs to precisely modulate local coordination environments and enable controlled dimensional reduction. Using this approach, we successfully synthesized the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric 1D antimony selenates&#8212;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III). These compounds feature well&#8208;defined helical chain structures constructed from SbOxFy polyhedra and SeO4 tetrahedra, resulting in pronounced optical anisotropy and robust nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8211;10&#160;&#181;m), a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546&#160;nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for ultraviolet NLO applications. This work establishes a powerful and generalizable structural design paradigm for constructing polar low&#8208;dimensional architectures and underscores the effectiveness of targeted coordination modulation in advancing high&#8208;performance optical materials.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation in Porous Organic Cage Salt&#8211;Metal Cluster Hybrids for Efficient Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated catalytic system based on a pH&#8208;responsive porous organic cage salt hybrid has been engineered, where Pd clusters are confined within the cage cavities and radical sites are located on the cage skeletons. Spatiotemporal regulation, combining pH&#8208;stimuli with spatially isolated active sites in proximity, maximizes cooperative performance and enables efficient orthogonal tandem catalysis of oxidation and reduction reactions in one pot.








Abstract
Developing artificial biomimetic catalysts with precise spatiotemporal control remains challenging. Here, we present a pH&#8208;responsive organic cage salt containing quaternary ammonium moieties ([QA&#8208;Cage]&#8208;12X, X&#9552;Cl or Br counteranions) as a platform for constructing such catalysts. Thermally induced electron transfer from counteranions to ammonium moieties generates radicals throughout cage skeletons ([QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X), which, combined with nanocavity confinement, facilitates metal precursor reduction and Pd cluster encapsulation, yielding the hybrid catalyst, Pd@[QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X. The pH&#8208;responsive cages enable switching between two catalytic states: Pd@[QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X, where radicals serve as active sites while Pd accessibility is hindered by numerous counteranions, and Pd@A&#8208;Cage, where neutralization of ammonium cages to non&#8208;radical amine cages (A&#8208;Cage) restores Pd accessibility by removing counteranions and modulating Pd surface charge. This dynamic switching allows real&#8208;time modulation of site&#8208;specific activity in single&#8208;step reactions. Sequential activation of dual active sites by acid&#8208;base stimuli enables tandem catalysis. Moreover, fine&#8208;tuning the protonation degrees of quaternary ammonium groups with base stimuli unveils an optimized catalyst, Pd@[PQA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;6X (where PQA&#8208;Cage refers to partially quaternized ammonium cages). Such a spatiotemporal control maximizes cooperative performance by balancing spatially isolated radicals and Pd sites for efficient orthogonal tandem catalysis of incompatible oxidation and reduction reactions in one pot.

         <title>Blood Retention and Kidney Clearance of Renal&#8208;Clearable Gold Nanoparticles Strongly Correlate with Renal Injury Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a doxorubicin&#8208;induced acute kidney injury model, proximal tubular injury&#8212;rather than glomerular leakage&#8212;predominantly determines the renal clearance of gold nanoclusters. The blood retention of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; strongly correlates with proximal tubular injury biomarker KIM&#8208;1, highlighting its potential as a sensitive exogenous blood marker for proximal tubular injury.








Abstract
Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are typically filtered through the glomeruli and transported along the renal tubules before entering the bladder. However, the effects of glomerular leakage and tubular injury, two common features of kidney diseases, on nanoparticle transport remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the blood retention, kidney accumulation, and renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; in a doxorubicin&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model. By correlating its transport with proteinuria and urinary kidney injury molecule&#8208;1 (KIM&#8208;1), endogenous biomarkers of glomerular leakage and proximal tubular injury, respectively, we found that glomerular leakage, as indicated by a &gt;50&#8208;fold increase in proteinuria, did not enhance its blood clearance. Instead, tubular injury significantly reduced glomerular filtration, resulting in elevated blood retention, increased kidney accumulation, and reduced renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328;. Moreover, Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; blood retention exhibited a very strong positive correlation with urinary KIM&#8208;1 (Pearson's coefficient r&#160;=&#160;0.90), much stronger than KIM&#8208;1 correlations with conventional glomerular filtration blood markers such as serum creatinine. This suggests that Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; could serve as a sensitive exogenous blood marker of tubular injury, expanding the diagnostic potential of renal&#8208;clearable nanoparticles in kidney diseases.

         <title>Communicative Nanomotors Reprogram Cancer Cell Death via Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Communicative nanomotors respond to elevated ROS in the tumor microenvironment, enabling active communication and selective mitochondrial targeting through non&#8208;covalent surface engineering. Their precise interaction with cells induces mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and pyroptotic cell death, while chemotactic motility ensures deeper tumor penetration, advancing intelligent cancer therapeutics.








Abstract
Nanomotors offer significant advantages over passive nanoparticles in biomedical applications. However, their potential has been largely restricted to cargo transport, with limited capacity for interaction with biological systems. Here, we present next&#8208;generation self&#8208;assembled nanomotors that not only exhibit chemotactic motility but also actively communicate with cells, reprogramming cell fate by inducing pyroptosis. These nanomotors are designed to respond to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment, triggering nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;driven propulsion and selective mitochondria targeting via triphenylphosphine (TPP) surface engineering. This interaction induces mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and activation of gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Furthermore, their chemotactic motility facilitates deeper tumor tissue penetration in 3D spheroids, demonstrating their ability to navigate physiological barriers. By shifting the paradigm from motility&#8208;driven to interactive nanomedicine, this study establishes a transformative platform for targeted cancer therapy.

Cation&#8211;anion moieties in poly(ionic liquid) copolymers can modify the fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock interactions. Precise control over dipolar and ionic interactions through copolymer composition enables self&#8208;healing, thus opening pathways for designing sustainable, mechanically resilient materials for applications in energy harvesting and storage, sensing, actuators, and others. 








Abstract
Commodity aliphatic and aromatic acrylic&#8208;based copolymers self&#8208;heal due to ubiquitous key&#8208;and&#8208;lock, ring&#8208;and&#8208;lock, and fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock van der Waals (vdW) interactions. However, the role of these interactions in the presence of covalently copolymerized ionic liquid (IL) is not known. This study is driven by the hypothesis that covalently incorporated cation&#8211;anion pairs to form poly(ionic liquid) copolymers (PILCs) can perturb inter&#8208; or intra&#8208;chain vdW interactions reflected in mechanical and electrical responses. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a series of PILCs comprising of pentafluorostyrene (PFS) and imidazolium&#8208;based IL monomers with variable&#8208;length aliphatic tails (methyl and butyl). Using a combination of 2D 1H&#8208;1H and 19F &#8208;19F NOESY NMR and FTIR measurements supplemented by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, these studies demonstrate that preferentially alternating/random PILCs topologies facilitate self&#8208;healing. The introduction of cation&#8211;anion moieties modifies the fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock interactions and, along with longer aliphatic tails &#9472;(CH2)3CH3 covalently attached to the imidazolium cation, enhances cation&#8208;anion mobility, thus faster recovery from mechanical damage occurs. These findings underline how precise control over dipolar and ionic interactions through copolymer composition enables self&#8208;healing in PILCs. These insights may open pathways for designing sustainable, mechanically resilient materials for applications in energy storage and energy harvesting.

         <title>Photoswitchable Catalytic Divergent Synthesis by a Viologen&#8208;Functionalized Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Tetrahedral Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here a viologen&#8208;functionalized lanthanide&#8208;organic coordination cage with photo&#8208;redox activities, representing the first example of photoswitchable divergent synthesis by a single self&#8208;assembled coordination cage.








Abstract
Photoswitchable catalysis presents a significant challenge, particularly in the modulation of reaction pathways. In this study, we describe a redox&#8208;active lanthanide&#8208;organic tetrahedral cage 1, self&#8208;assembled from a viologen&#8208;functionalised ditopic tridentate ligand and Eu(III) ions. Complexation&#8208;induced charge redistribution and spatial rearrangement of ligands in the assembly endow 1 with distinct photochromic properties and redox activities compared to free ligand L. 1 can serve as a photoswitchable catalyst for divergent chemical transformations of various tetraarylborates, giving biaryls and phenols via photo&#8208;oxidative coupling reaction under 365&#160;nm light irradiation, or producing mono&#8208;arene products through catalytic de&#8208;composition process in the absence of light. This work represents the first example of photoswitchable divergent synthesis by a single self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, paving the way for the design and construction of novel supramolecular edifices with switchable functions.

         <title>Switching Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation Toward Ethanol by Tuning Spin States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) photocatalyst with medium&#8208;spin active sites, in which both the unpaired electrons and eg orbital occupancy allow to selectively generate &#8226;CH2OH intermediates at moderate *OH coverage and promote the C&#9472;C coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH, leading to efficient photocatalytic conversion of CH4 to ethanol without the addition of strong oxidizing reagents. 








Abstract
The selective oxidation of methane (CH4) has attractive potentials for mitigating global warming and producing value&#8208;added chemicals, whereas the efficient generation of multicarbon products such as ethanol remains challenging, due to the short lifetimes and high unpaired concentrations of reactive intermediates (like &#8226;OH, &#8226;CH3, &#8226;OCH3, and &#8226;CH2OH). Herein, we developed a medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst with tunable Fe(III) spin states, which can efficiently photo&#8208;oxidize CH4 to ethanol at ambient conditions. The unpaired electrons in d orbitals of Fe sites allow for efficient adsorption of &#8226;OH, and the eg orbital occupancy enables stabilizing different key carbon&#8208;containing intermediates (&#8226;OCH3 versus &#8226;CH2OH). By balancing those two descriptors, the medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst allows to achieve selective generation of &#8226;CH2OH intermediates with a moderate *OH coverage and subsequent coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH to ethanol. With a light intensity of 100 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2 and water as a weak oxidant, the Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst exhibited a peak photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol yield of 372 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 without the use of photosensitizers or sacrificial reagents, which is &#8764;3 times higher than the previously best reported photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol under similar conditions. Our study suggests an attractive potential of converting CH4 to multicarbon products by modulating spin states of the catalytic sites.

         <title>Gold and Bismuth Trimetallic Synergistic Redox Catalysis for Non&#8208;Directed C&#9472;H Arylation with Aryl Bismuth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear gold catalyzed selective C&#9472;H arylation by using aryl bismuth reagents as the arylation reagents has been developed. The Bi(V) generated in&#8208;situ can oxidize gold(I) to form Au&#9472;Au&#9472;Bi intermediate, where Bi's Z&#8208;type coordination mitigates steric/electronic constraints. This trimetallic strategy outperforms classical C&#9472;C couplings, tolerating silanes, boronate esters, and germanes, thus providing new insights for multimetallic cooperative catalysis.








Abstract
The influence of substituent effects plays an important role on the efficiency and regioselectivity toward C&#9472;H activation of non&#8208;directed arenes. Here, an unprecedented trimetallic synergistic redox catalysis system has been developed to achieve a highly efficient and orthogonal C&#9472;H arylation of non&#8208;directed arenes with aryl bismuth. Both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;deficient aryl bismuth can proceed C&#9472;H arylation readily, thus affording an elegant strategy for the synthesis of challenging electron&#8208;rich and sterically hindered biaryls by means of gold catalysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Bi(V) species generated in&#8208;situ from Ar&#9472;Bi(III) and NFSI is not only an arylation reagent but also an oxidant to form a critical Au(II)&#9472;Au(II)&#9472;Bi intermediate (detected by HRMS). Interestingly, the binding Bi&#8208;moiety can modulate the electronic and steric environment of gold center through cooperative interactions, thus promoting the intramolecular transmetallation and reductive elimination. In addition, the synthetic robustness of this protocol has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale experiments and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Alkylidene Succinimides Enabled by Weak Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positive correlation between weak noncovalent interactions and the activity of asymmetric hydrogenation was explored through both DFT calculations and experimental studies by modifying the protecting group of the substrate. Based on these findings, an Earth&#8208;abundant nickel catalytic system was developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;alkylene succinimide, demonstrating superior efficiency (4000&#160;S/C, substrate/catalyst) compared to rare metal catalysts (2000&#160;S/C). This system delivered excellent results, achieving up to 99% enantiomeric excess (ee) and 99% yield.








Abstract
The development of asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts based on Earth&#8208;abundant metals presents a sustainable alternative to efficient but resource&#8208;limited rare&#8208;metal systems. However, these catalysts often suffer from low catalytic activity. In this study, through a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and kinetic experiments, we uncovered a positive correlation between catalyst&#8208;substrate weak noncovalent interactions and catalytic efficiency in the enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides with different N&#8208;protecting groups. The tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) substituent emerged as the optimal choice, significantly enhancing reactivity. This approach enabled the hydrogenation of a wide range of substrates with excellent yields (up to 99%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99%&#160;ee), achieving a substrate/catalyst (S/C) ratio of 4000&#8212;twice the efficiency of rare&#8208;metal catalysts (S/C&#160;&#8804;&#160;2000) for similar transformations. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) of the enantiomers revealed that the high stereoselectivity is promoted by stabilizing weak noncovalent interactions in the R&#8208;configured transition state.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioconvergent C&#9472;O Bond Formation for Asymmetric Cross&#8208;Coupling of Allylamines and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of the C1&#8208;symmetric oxazoline ligand with copper induced an additional C&#9472;N axial chirality, thereby enhancing stereochemical control in the challenging asymmetric CO2 fixation. This result may establish a new paradigm for developing metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations. 








Abstract
Upgrading abundant carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value organic molecules has garnered broad research interest for decades. Within this domain, catalytic asymmetric synthesis employing CO2 holds great synthetic importance. Although remarkable advances have been made in asymmetric C&#9472;C bond formation using CO2 as a C1 synthon in recent years, the development of incorporation of CO2 as an oxygen source for asymmetric C&#9472;O bond construction remains elusive, presumably due to the formidable challenge of simultaneously addressing enantioselectivity control and reaction efficiency. Here, we demonstrate the first copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#9472;O bond cross&#8208;coupling of allylamines and CO2 in a radical strategy. The key innovation resides in the rational and strategic conversion of C2&#8208;symmetric oxazoline ligands to their C1&#8208;symmetric counterparts, which induces additional C&#9472;N axial chirality after coordination with copper. The resultant enantioenriched fluoroalkylated 2&#8208;oxazolidones can be further transformed into diverse functional compounds, including novel chiral amino alcohols for oxazoline ligand design and a potent bioactive insecticide analogue. Detailed mechanistic investigations elucidate a radical&#8208;mediated pathway and establish the critical role of C1&#8208;symmetric ligands in achieving efficient stereochemical control.

         <title>A Polyaromatic Metallotube With a Dual Multi&#8208;Functionalization Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyaromatic metallotube, formed from PtCl2 and bispyridine ligands, undergoes dual multi&#8208;functionalization via substitution on the metal hinges. The first multi&#8208;functionalized Pt(II)&#8208;tube exhibits high water solubility as well as binds one molecule of fullerene C60, which is subsequently released through the second multi&#8208;functionalization, in a quantitative fashion. 








Abstract
Post&#8208;functionalization is an advanced, key synthetic method in supramolecular systems, whereas the previous method relies heavily on the substitution on the organic frameworks. Here we report a polyaromatic metallotube capable of dually multi&#8208;functionalizing the metal sites in an efficient post&#8208;assembly fashion. The Pt(II)&#8208;linked tube with tetrachloro groups is prepared from two PtCl2 hinges and two bent bispyridine ligands in high yield. The new metallotube efficiently converts to tetra&#8208;substituted tubes by the first multiple functionalization, through the replacement of the chloro groups with various alkynyl groups. The tubular structures before/after the functionalization are unequivocally confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. A resultant tetraammonium&#8208;attached Pt(II)&#8208;tube exhibits high water solubility and uptake abilities toward spherical and rod&#8208;like compounds. The metallotube strongly binds one molecule of fullerene C60 in the polyaromatic cavity yet releases it through the second multi&#8208;functionalization by tetrabromination of the metal hinges in a quantitative and reversible manner. Even after Bingel reaction within the tube, sterically demanding bis&#8208;substituted fullerenes (&gt;&#8764;80% selectivity) are readily released by the second functionalization. The present method, i.e., the use of simple PtCl2 hinges, will be applicable to wide&#8208;ranging metallo&#8208;supramolecules to enhance their structural and functional versatilities via post&#8208;multi&#8208;functionalizations.

         <title>&#8220;Outside&#8208;in&#8221; Design of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Linking Specific Peripheral Geometry to Defined CO2 Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an &#8220;outside&#8208;in&#8221; strategy for the design of NC&#8208;supported Fe and Ni SACs for CO2RR. Combined DFT calculations and experimental studies show that incorporating specific six&#8208; or five&#8208;membered rings into the outer shell retrofit the electronic property of coordination N atoms in the inner shell, thereby precisely controlling the catalytic performance of the metal center.








Abstract
The regulation of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) through microenvironment engineering, particularly via peripheral species, has recently garnered significant attention in the fields of materials science and heterogeneous catalysis. Nevertheless, establishing unambiguous structure&#8208;property relationships for SAC, especially concerning peripheral effects, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy for the design of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Fe SACs for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory(DFT) calculations reveal that installing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring in the outer shell modulates the electronic properties of the inner&#8208;shell coordination N species, altering their electron transfer capabilities while fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;p coupling between the Fe center and adjacent N atoms. Notably, five&#8208;membered rings induce stronger d&#8208;p coupling compared to their six&#8208;membered counterparts, leading to a higher Fe valence state. This electronic modulation optimizes the adsorption strength of key CO2RR intermediates (COOH* and CO*), enhancing catalytic performance for CO production.&#160;Extensive experimental studies corroborate these theoretical findings. The proposed &#8220;outside&#8208;in&#8221; design strategy can be extended to Ni SACs, offering new insights into the exploration of highly efficient single&#8208;atom centers through peripheral geometric effects.

         <title>The Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster of Bacterioferritin&#8208;Associated Ferredoxin (Bfd): a &#8220;Biological Fuse&#8221; that Prevents Oxidative Damage to Cells?</title>

         <dc:description>
When cellular iron is low, bacterioferritin (Bfr) releases its stored iron through a reductive process dependent on the [2Fe&#8211;2S] ferredoxin Bfd. Why accessing stored iron should depend on an iron&#8208;requiring protein when iron is scarce is unclear. Here, we show that the Bfd [2Fe&#8211;2S] cluster is sensitive to oxidative stress, suggesting that it may act as a &#8220;biological fuse&#8221;, shutting down iron release under conditions where free iron is toxic.








Abstract
Iron is in an essential micronutrient in living systems. However, it is also potentially toxic and so the concentration of chelatable iron within cells is tightly regulated to prevent catalytic formation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferritins play a key role in iron homeostasis by storing excess iron as an insoluble ferric mineral within the protein. When bacterial cells become iron deficient, this store may be accessed by reduction/solubilisation of the iron. Bacterioferritins utilise heme, bound at an inter&#8208;subunit site, to support electron transfer to the stored mineral. Electrons for heme reduction are shuttled from NADPH via Bfd, a [2Fe&#8211;2S] cluster&#8208;containing ferredoxin. This raises the paradox that the synthesis of an iron&#8208;dependent protein co&#8208;factor is required under conditions of iron&#8208;deficiency so that stored iron can be utilised. Here, we show that exposure of Bfd to ROS suppresses the capacity of the protein to stimulate iron release from bacterioferritin. We propose that reliance of iron release on Bfd evolved to ensure that chelatable iron levels do not increase under oxidative stress conditions. Thus, the Bfd iron&#8211;sulfur cluster functions as a &#8220;biological fuse&#8221; in providing a fail&#8208;safe that immediately halts iron release once ROS accumulate to damaging concentrations.

         <title>Efficient Separation of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Products Using a Robust Polycatenated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed using an expanded aromatic tricarboxylate ligand, featuring the highest degree of catenation among known HOF analogues and enabling efficient C3H6/C2H4 separation with record productivity for this class of materials. 








Abstract
The methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins process produces mixtures of ethylene and propylene, driving demand for high&#8208;performance separation materials. We present HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework built from an expanded BTB (4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl&#8208;tribenzoate) linker, featuring the highest catenation degree observed in BTB&#8208;based HOFs. This unique architecture confers good stability under solvent, pH, and thermal conditions. With optimally sized pores and aromatic&#8208;rich surfaces, HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3 demonstrates excellent propylene/ethylene separation potential, outperforming its parent frameworks (HOF&#8208;BTB and HOF&#8208;BTB&#8208;NH2) under ambient conditions. Notably, the material accomplishes single&#8208;cycle purification of high&#8208;purity ethylene (99.95%) and propylene (99.5%) from equimolar binary mixtures, achieving a record ethylene productivity of 3.22&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 among HOF adsorbents. This study not only establishes HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3 as a benchmark HOF material for MTO product separation but also advances the structural design of HOFs for industrial olefin purification.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Boosts the Uptake of Small Molecules in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the importance of chalcogen bonding in improving the uptake of small molecules in mammalian cells. The uptake strongly depends on the nature of chalcogen atom and the compounds with heavier chalcogen atoms (Se and Te), which can form stronger chalcogen bonds, are preferentially taken up by the cells through macropinocytosis pathway.








Abstract
Chalcogen bonding, a noncovalent interaction between the chalcogen atom (S, Se, and Te) and Lewis base, plays crucial roles in catalysis, anion recognition, protein confirmation, enzyme activity, and drug design. Herein, we show that chalcogen bonding can be used as a driving force to enhance the uptake of small molecules in mammalian cells. A systematic investigation using several chalcogen&#8208;containing fluorescent molecules reveal that the cellular uptake strongly depends on the nature of chalcogen atom and the compounds with heavier chalcogen atoms (Se and Te), which can form stronger chalcogen bonds, are preferentially taken up by the cells. This study suggests that the biological activities of chalcogen&#8208;based compounds may depend not only on their chemical reactivity but also on their chalcogen bond forming ability with the cell membrane.

         <title>Synthesis of a Linear Tetraboron Cation via Deprotonation of a Nonsupported Dimeric Hydroborylborenium Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deprotonation of a dimeric hydroborylborenium ion results in formation of a linear tetraboron cation. This homocatenated boron species can activate H2, leading to the first example of complete hydrogenolysis of main&#8208;group homocatenated chains. On the other hand, in the presence of tBuNC, only the internal B&#8211;B bond of the tetraboron cation is cleaved, resulting in the formation of an azadiborabutadiene cation. 








Abstract
The nonsupported B&#8211;H&#8211;B moiety of a dimeric hydroborylborenium ion can be readily deprotonated by 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine, affording a H&#8208;bridged linear tetraboron cation. The resulting tetraboron cation shows diverse reactivity with small molecules. Treatment of this tetraboron cation with H2 leads to the first example of complete hydrogenolysis of main&#8208;group homocatenated chains. On the other hand, in the presence of tBuNC, only the internal B&#8211;B bond of the tetraboron cation is cleaved, resulting in the formation of an azadiborabutadiene cation. Additionally, during the preparation of the hydroborylborenium, an unprecedented formal boryl cage&#8208;walking was observed. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest this process involves consecutive activation of carboranyl B(9)&#8211;H bonds.

         <title>Decoupling Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation: A Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Assisted Dual&#8208;Site Synergy Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy mechanism is demonstrated to overcome the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Ru single sites drive selective CO&#8322;&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, while Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply H species to Ru single sites via spillover over N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages, achieving 98.0% CO selectivity with ultrahigh activity (3.1&#160;mol&#183;gRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The persistent trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and selectivity remains a critical barrier to efficient CO2 valorization. Herein, we propose a concept of decoupling the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in the photothermal catalytic reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy. This concept is demonstrated through a hybrid catalyst constructed by immobilizing abundant Ru single sites and trace Ru clusters onto high&#8208;efficiency photothermal support of N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages (hNCNC). Theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru&#9472;N4 sites are highly active and selective for the RWGS reaction, contingent on the efficient migration of dissociated *H species to adjacent C atoms of Ru. Importantly, we experimentally confirm that Ru single sites dominate CO2 hydrogenation to CO, whereas Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply hydrogen species to adjacent single sites via spillover over hNCNC. Leveraging this synergistic interaction, the hybrid catalyst achieves an exceptional CO production rate of 3.1&#160;mol&#183;gRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and selectivity over 98%. This mechanism shows universal applicability as demonstrated by the effective promotion of CO2 hydrogenation of Ru single sites by other typical hydrogen&#8208;spillover&#8208;active metal clusters, e.g., Pt and Pd clusters. This design concept liberates the potential to overcome the longstanding activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in hydrogenation reactions.

Importantly, we experimentally confirm that Ru single sites dominate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to CO, whereas Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply hydrogen species to adjacent single sites via spillover over hNCNC. Leveraging this synergistic interaction, the hybrid catalyst achieves an exceptional CO production rate of 3.1&#160;mol&#183;g&lt;sub&gt;Ru&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and selectivity over 98%. This mechanism shows universal applicability as demonstrated by the effective promotion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation of Ru single sites by other typical hydrogen-spillover-active metal clusters, e.g., Pt and Pd clusters. This design concept liberates the potential to overcome the longstanding activity-selectivity trade-off in hydrogenation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Active Edge Sites Engineering on Amorphous Co&#8211;Mn Spinel&#8208;Based Oxides for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general synthesis approach is presented to prepare Turing&#8208;type porous CoMn2O4 nanoreactors, facilitating the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies, thereby promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn2O4/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant nonradical (1O2) pathways.








Abstract
Rational modulation of edge active sites in the Fenton&#8208;like reaction, utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers, is a hot topic in the heterogeneous catalysis field, yet the applicability of large&#8208;scale manufacturing remains a severe challenge. Herein, a general wet&#8208;chemical approach is reported to large&#8208;scale prepare porous CoMn2O4 with abundant active edge sites for enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like activation without using a template or heat treatment. The obtained Turing&#8208;type structure not only can be assembled into spatially restricted domain CoMn2O4 nanoreactors but also greatly facilitates the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies in promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn2O4/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant nonradical (1O2) pathways and maintained a degradation rate of 99.8% within 5 min after seven&#8208;cycle runs. Moreover, the application prospect of the PMS&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like process for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment, including sulfadiazine (SD) antibiotics in real river water and real pharmaceutical wastewater, was demonstrated by the fixed&#8208;bed tower reactor and the in&#8208;situ floating water treatment device. This work will provide guidance for the development of low&#8208;cost and efficient heterogeneous PMS&#8208;activation catalysts through rational defect engineering.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dominated Calendar Aging in Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;dominated plating morphology governs the calendar aging of aqueous zinc metal batteries. Notably, corrosion severity does not directly correlate with aging&#8208;induced degradation. Electrolytes that promote smoother zinc deposition, quantified by a lower plating roughness factor (Prf), exhibit enhanced resistance to calendar aging. Leveraging this insight, an acetatization strategy achieves up to a 49&#8208;fold reduction in calendar aging&#8211;induced degradation.








Abstract
Zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage. While the majority of current research focuses on cyclic aging, the impact of calendar aging on zinc anodes has received far less attention. Here, we reveal that zinc deposition morphology, governed by anion chemistry, plays a decisive role in calendar degradation by amplifying interfacial corrosion and accelerating &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc accumulation. Notably, intrinsic corrosion rates alone do not predict degradation severity; for instance, triflate anion shows low corrosion but induces highly porous deposits and rapid aging. To address this, we propose a comprehensive electrochemical descriptor to quantify deposition morphology beyond traditional morphological characterization. Moreover, we introduce an acetatization strategy that tailors Zn2+ solvation and promotes dense plating, effectively suppressing side reactions and &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc formation. This approach effectively curbs calendar degradation, yielding nearly a 49&#8208;fold improvement in capacity retention. Under demanding conditions (6&#160;h aging intervals per cycle), practical anode&#8208;free Cu||ZnI2 cells (ca. 3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) exhibit high cycling stability, maintaining 96.2% of their initial capacity over 1000&#160;h. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of zinc anode degradation and offer a viable route to address calendar aging in ZMBs.

         <title>Accessing Metal&#8208;Containing Species in Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Precursor Solutions via Molecular Strategies Guided by the Hard&#8211;Soft Acid&#8211;Base Principle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strategies guided by the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base (HSAB) principle enable precise control over metal&#8208;based species in perovskite precursor solutions. This approach enhances the quality of narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.26&#160;eV) mixed tin&#8211;lead perovskite films and improves the performance of the resulting solar cell devices.








Abstract
The properties of metal&#8208;centred species in metal halide perovskite precursor solutions substantially influence the formation and evolution of colloidal particles, which in turn dictate the crystallisation process and the film quality. In this work, we assess the &#8220;hard&#8221; and &#8220;soft&#8221; Lewis acid characteristics of Sn2+ and Pb2+ cations as a strategy to modulate the chemical environment of these metal&#8208;containing species in mixed&#8208;metal tin&#8211;lead perovskite precursor solutions. We observe enhanced simultaneous access to both metal centres upon adding compounds with functional groups suggested by the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principle. Theoretical calculations suggest that the hard base carboxyl group preferentially interacts with Sn2+&#8208;based species, while the softer base thiol group also targets Pb2+&#8208;based species. By effectively accessing and manipulating possible classes of inorganic species and their colloidal particle properties in the precursor solutions, we achieve 1.26 eV perovskite polycrystalline films exhibiting enhanced structural and optoelectronic quality, giving the best quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting values of up to 0.95&#160;eV. As a result, the solar cell devices demonstrate efficiency values of up to 23.3% with an extended operational lifetime, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after over 280 and 180&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 25 and 65 &#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Emission of Congruently Melting Iodocuprate Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids based on a 2D or 1D CuI2&#8722; iodocuprate network, which have low congruent melting temperatures allowing the solvent&#8208;free preparation of thin films, exhibit excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent emission: upon excitation at high energy (inorganic network) a strong yellow emission of STE type occurs, whereas upon excitation at low energy (organic component), a red emission originating from iodide vacancies (&#9633;(I&#8722;)) is observed.








Abstract
In the context of the emergence of metal halide perovskites for optoelectronic materials, the lead&#8208;free and earth&#8208;abundant copper(I)&#8208;based halide hybrids are of high interest. Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO2C(CH2)n&#8208;1NH3)CuI2 (n&#160;=&#160;3, 4) exhibiting excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable n&#160;=&#160;4 compound (2D&#8208;C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge&#8208;sharing tetrahedra is found both in the n&#160;=&#160;3 compound (1D&#8208;C3) and in the metastable n&#160;=&#160;4 (1D&#8208;C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D&#8208;C4 and 1D&#8208;C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission&#8212;resulting from the emission of both components,&#8212;while 1D&#8208;C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D&#8208;C4 and 1D&#8208;C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid&#8208;gap states. The emission of 2D&#8208;C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D&#8208;C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 &#176;C, allowing the solvent&#8208;free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor&#8208;converted&#8208;LED based on 2D&#8208;C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.

&lt;p&gt;In the context of the emergence of metal halide perovskites for optoelectronic materials, the lead-free and earth-abundant copper(I)-based halide hybrids are of high interest. Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;3, 4) exhibiting excitation-wavelength-dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;4 compound (2D-C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge-sharing tetrahedra is found both in the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;3 compound (1D-C3) and in the metastable &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;4 (1D-C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D-C4 and 1D-C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission&#8212;resulting from the emission of both components,&#8212;while 1D-C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D-C4 and 1D-C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid-gap states. The emission of 2D-C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D-C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 &#176;C, allowing the solvent-free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor-converted-LED based on 2D-C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hooked for Decay with Hydrophobic&#8208;Coated Magnetic Beads to Grapple and Disintegrate Nanoplastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biohybrid catalysts based on the material&#8208;binding peptide LCI_F16C, which is conjugated with a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda cofactor, were immobilized on the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The immobilized biohybrid catalysts catalyzed a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles to form a hydrophobic polynorbornene film. These film&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibited bifunctional activity toward both capturing of nanoplastics and degrading of styrene&#8208;butadiene rubber nanoparticles.








Abstract
Degradation of synthetic polymers inevitably leads to the formation of nanoplastics (NPs), and recent studies associate health risks with NPs. Therefore, catching and degrading NPs are important to manage environmental and human health risks. In this study, we developed a biohybrid catalyst system with two functionalities to capture (Hook) and degrade (Decay) NPs. The biohybrid catalyst is composed of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda (GH) type cofactor conjugated to the material&#8208;binding peptide LCI_F16C, which immobilizes the GH&#8208;cofactor onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The anchored biohybrid catalyst initiates a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization to generate a hydrophobic polynorbornene film around iron oxide core, which enables to efficiently capture and remove a broad spectrum of hydrophobic NPs, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and styrene&#8208;butadiene rubber (SBR), with hydrophobic interaction as the main driving force. This hydrophobic coating facilitated rapid adsorption of PS&#8208;COOH500 nm NPs within 10 min, reaching an impressive adsorption capacity of 5.53 &#177; 0.29&#160;g/g on PS NPs, and demonstrated a high recovery efficiency of 99% for SBR NPs. Notably, the embedded GH&#8208;cofactor preserved its ethenolysis activity, cleaving internal C&#9552;C bonds of SBR and resulting in 6.5% degradation, thereby validating the concept of simultaneous nanoplastic capture and catalytic breakdown.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Quantum Dots for Near&#8208;Frictionless Ion Transport Battery Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of covalent organic framework quantum dots has been developed to optimize the electrolyte to achieve near&#8208;frictionless ion transport and high electrochemical performance in Li&#8211;S battery.








Abstract
Optimization of electrolyte with enhanced energy density and durability in battery system is highly demanded yet challenging owing to the high ion transport resistance and complex by&#8208;reactions in electrolyte. In this work, we tailored the solid&#8211;liquid phase transport interface by adding covalent organic frameworks quantum dots (COFs QDs) into electrolyte. COFs QDs with abundant lipophilic ether&#8208;oxygen groups and &#8764;12&#160;nm nano&#8208;size can serve as myriad ion&#8208;transport nano&#8208;engines for constantly replenishing the interface with Li+ to achieve near&#8208;frictionless ion transport (tLi+&#160;=&#160;0.98) and exceptional stability (&gt;400 days). Lithium&#8211;sulfur battery based on COFs QDs shows high discharge specific capacity of 1063.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#160;C and maintains a low overpotential (&#8764;16&#160;mV) over 4000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 in Li//Li symmetric battery. A Li&#8211;S pouch battery has also been successfully assembled to validate the practicality. Our results may promote the development of COFs QDs in energy storage field.

         <title>Photocatalytic Co&#8208;Reduction of CO2 and Nitrate over Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Dual Atomic Active Site and Nanostructure Synergy Enhances C&#8211;N Coupling for Urea Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimetallic porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework with nanoflower&#8208;like architecture is synthesized as a high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for urea synthesis. The synergy between dual atomic active sites and nanostructure engineering enables an excellent performance with a urea yield of 2459.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 via photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and nitrate.








Abstract
The photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 (NitRR&amp;CRR) offers a sustainable approach for urea synthesis and environment remediation. However, there is a lack of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Herein, we report a nanoflower&#8208;like bimetallic porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework superstructure (Cu&#8208;TCPP(Co)&#8208;NF, TCPP&#160;=&#160;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) as an efficient NitRR&amp;CRR photocatalyst for urea production. Systematical investigations have revealed that the Cu and Co centers serve as the active sites for driving NitRR and CRR, respectively. The high pore volumes of nanoflower architecture can improve the light adsorption, promote the reactant enrichment, and intermediate generation. Consequently, the C&#8211;N coupling process over Cu&#8208;TCPP(Co)&#8208;NF is facilitated with reduced energy barriers and inhibited side reactions, resulting in an unprecedent urea yield of 2459.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 in the absence of sacrificial agents. This study provides new insights into the design of advanced photocatalysts for urea synthesis.

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Fe Atom to Boost Surface Reaction Kinetics Toward Robust Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomineralization strategy was developed to regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low&#8208;spin configuration to a medium&#8208;spin state, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe&#8208;N4 to Fe&#8208;N3S. This spin state transition of Fe SAs influences its orbital orientation and modulates electronic coupling with adsorbates, directly contributing to the superior activity of Fer&#8208;N&#8208;C@ZIS in PHE.








Abstract
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance over transition metal catalysts is limited by the unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics, which involves the transformation of electronic spin states. In this work, we successfully regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low&#8208;spin configuration (LS) to a medium&#8208;spin state (MS) via a biomineralization strategy, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe&#8208;N4 to Fe&#8208;N3S. This spin state transition of Fe center is able to not only influence the orbital orientation but also modulate the electronic coupling between active sites and the adsorbates, thereby enhancing the kinetic process of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, the spin polarization induced by this unique structure could also improve the utilization efficiency of the carriers by facilitating the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and prolonging their lifetime. All these factors directly contribute to the superior activity of Fer&#8208;N&#8208;C@ZIS (Fer, ferritin; ZIS, ZnIn2S4), which delivers an impressive H2 evolution rate of approximately 31&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a high stability over 25 h of continuous operation.

&lt;p&gt;A biomineralization strategy was developed to regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low-spin configuration to a medium-spin state, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S. This spin state transition of Fe SAs influences its orbital orientation and modulates electronic coupling with adsorbates, directly contributing to the superior activity of Fer-N-C@ZIS in PHE.

         <title>Solvent Polarity Triggered Rapidly Reversible Quadruple&#8208;Mode Luminescence Adjustment in 0D Hybrid Antimony Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zero&#8208;dimensional metal halide demonstrates quadruple/triple&#8208;mode luminescence switching with a rapid response (&lt;1s) and excellent recyclability (&#8805;100 cycles) triggered with moderately&#8208;polar and strongly&#8208;polar solvents. The solvochromism mechanism links luminescence tuning to solvent polarity, with dipole moment changed from moderately&#8208;polar solvents, and phase transformation induced by strongly&#8208;polar solvents. This crystal shows potential for solvent detection, safety monitoring, and information encryption.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimension (0D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides are highly attractive as smart responsive luminescent materials, but the multiple&#8208;mode luminescence switch is rarely achieved and intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is unclear. Herein, we report a yellowish&#8208;green&#8208;emitting (Me3BzN)3Sb2Cl9 (Me3BzN: trimethylbenzyl ammonium) single crystal, revealing quadruple/triple&#8208;mode luminescence switch with rapid response time (&lt;1&#160;s) and excellent recyclability (&#8805; 100 cycles) when triggered by moderately&#8208;polar and strongly&#8208;polar solvents. Significantly, the intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is systematically proposed, of which the reversibly multiple&#8208;mode luminescence tuning is closely related to solvent polarity, the moderate polarity can lead to luminescence redshift from 560 to 670&#160;nm due to the increase of dipole moment for inorganic polyhedron. Besides, the small molecular solvent with strong polarity can insert into crystal and form &#8220;host&#8208;guest&#8221; system, inducing single crystal&#8208;single crystal phase transformation with structural disorder and Sb&#8208;Sb distance variation. Owing to the unique multiple&#8208;mode luminescence adjustment performance, (Me3BzN)3Sb2Cl9 displays potential candidate in solvent detection, safety monitoring and information encryption scenarios. These findings highlight the significance of solvent polarity and molecule volume on the dynamic luminescence adjustment and offer guidance for the development of new smart responsive 0D hybrid antimony halides in advanced optical switchable fields.

         <title>A Facile and Scalable &#945;&#8208;Diimine Platform for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is employed in the facile, rapid, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of benchmark &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts (20 catalysts). These catalysts show boosted activity (4.4&#160;&#215;&#160;108&#160;g mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), enhanced thermostability (up to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weight, enabling scalable polyethylene production from plastic to elastomer and wax and oil.








Abstract
The structural design and facile synthesis of ligands are crucial for the development of innovative catalysts. Advances have enabled the iterative design of benchmark &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts for the synthesis of polyolefins, which represent the largest class of polymers. In this work, a versatile post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is introduced for the synthesis of a new family of &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts, deviating from the conventional methods. Based on the commercial butanedione ligand backbone that is found in &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts, target groups were introduced into the backbone via a one&#8208;pot substitution reaction. This simple and efficient approach enabled the large&#8208;scale production of the target systems without purification. Using this protocol, 20 new ligands (50&#160;g&#8208;level) and 20 new nickel catalysts were easily and rapidly synthesized. The catalysts demonstrated significant enhancements in their catalytic activities (4.4 &#215; 108&#160;g mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), thermostabilities (from 90 to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weights (8.3&#8208;fold those of polyethylenes produced by the unmodified catalyst) during ethylene polymerization. These improvements are comparable to those achieved through complicated and tedious aniline modifications in pioneering reports, thereby facilitating the kg&#8208;scale synthesis of polyethylenes, varying from semi&#8208;crystalline plastics to thermoplastic elastomers and ultimately to wax&#8208;like and oil&#8208;like products.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroelectrochemical Observation of Overlayer&#8208;Induced Charge Carrier Dynamics in Water Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 overlayers on WO3 photoanode enhance photoelectrochemical water oxidation by surface and interfacial engineering. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy reveals photogenerated electron trapping pathway in ionized states driven by band bending. These findings demonstrate how surface properties, PEC performance, and charge carrier kinetics interrelate, highlighting the significance of band bending modifications.








Abstract
Surface and interface engineering is essential for constructing efficient and stable photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar fuel production. Despite the recent advances in photoelectrode optimization for the practical application, the corresponding interfacial reaction mechanism has not been elucidated owing to a lack of suitable measurements at the semiconductor&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the key factor for an interfacial reaction in a model system (WO3 photoanode coated with amorphous TiO2 overlayers) is elucidated using operando spectroelectrochemistry. The thin TiO2 overlayers are shown to enhance n&#8208;type semiconductor characteristics and heal the excessive oxygen vacancies on the WO3 photoanode surface, which suggests reduced bulk and surface charge carrier recombination and 1.5&#8208;fold increase in Faradaic efficiency. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the overlayers accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the electrode to the external circuit and increase the population of trapped holes by promoting band bending, which reveals that the kinetic connection between ultrafast phenomena and real water oxidation reaction. Thus, our work elucidates band bending in the space&#8208;charge region as a key factor and provides a major strategy for designing surface&#8208;modified PEC devices.

         <title>Balancing Solvation Ability of Polymer and Solvent in Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Efficient Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tailing the solvation ability of both polymer and solvent, this work establishes a correlation between Li+ coordination, ion transport, and interphase formation in gel electrolytes. A combination of weakly coordinated polymer and lower donor number (DN) solvent enables the gel electrolyte to achieve fast ion hopping and form a robust interphase for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) show practical potential in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but their development is hindered by insufficient understanding of Li+ solvation chemistry and its impact on ion transport and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. By regulating the solvation abilities of polymer and solvent, this work explores the relationships between GPE composition, Li+ coordination structures, Li+ transference number, and interphase chemistry. The GPE combining weakly coordinated solvents with strongly coordinating polymer results in strong Li+&#8208;polymer attachment, leading to sluggish ion transport. Employing strongly chelating solvents causes complete Li+&#8208;polymer detachment, forming micelle structures that obstruct ion transport. The GPE with both weakly coordinated solvent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)&#160;and polymer 1H,1H,2H,2H&#8208;tridecafluoro&#8208;n&#8208;octyl acrylate (TFOA) enables optimal interactions between Li+ and polymer/solvent, facilitating partial Li+&#8208;polymer detachment and aggregates (AGGs) generation, avoiding micelle formation. This promotes efficient Li+ transport and anion&#8208;derived SEI generation. The resulting GPE achieves 99.2% Coulombic efficiency (CE) in Cu||Li cells and enables 4.5&#160;V LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||Li to demonstrate 81% capacity retention after 140 cycles. These findings provide valuable insights for further advanced GPE design.

Employing strongly chelating solvents causes complete Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-polymer detachment, forming micelle structures that obstruct ion transport. The GPE with both weakly coordinated solvent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)&#160;and polymer 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-tridecafluoro-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-octyl acrylate (TFOA) enables optimal interactions between Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and polymer/solvent, facilitating partial Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-polymer detachment and aggregates (AGGs) generation, avoiding micelle formation. This promotes efficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and anion-derived SEI generation. The resulting GPE achieves 99.2% Coulombic efficiency (CE) in Cu||Li cells and enables 4.5&#160;V LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Li to demonstrate 81% capacity retention after 140 cycles. These findings provide valuable insights for further advanced GPE design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ambient Processing of High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Modules Enabled by Radical Scavengers</title>

The antioxidant strategy is employed to achieve the all&#8208;air preparation of organic solar cells (OSCs) by doping the antioxidant C60&#8208;OH into PDINN. C60&#8208;OH significantly affects the film&#8208;forming process of PDINN and the resulting morphological characteristics. Due to the stability of PDINN:C60&#8208;OH, an impressive efficiency of 20.22% is attained, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in air&#8208;processed (o&#8208;xylene) OSCs.








Abstract
The pronounced efficiency disparity between ambient&#8208;air&#8208;fabricated organic solar cells (OSCs) and nitrogen&#8208;glovebox&#8208;processed devices poses a major obstacle to industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. The instability of the organic electron transport layer (ETL) materials in air undoubtedly affects the carrier transport properties, which significantly reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. Here, based on the antioxidant strategy, the stability of PDINN in air is enhanced by doping PDINN with the antioxidant C60&#8208;OH, thereby successfully achieving the all&#8208;air preparation of OSCs. Eventually, the PCE of the air&#8208;prepared green OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and PM6:PTQ10:BTP&#8208;eC9 (o&#8208;xylene) achieves 19.35% and 20.22%, respectively, after being optimized by the antioxidant strategy. Moreover, C60&#8208;OH remarkably improves the operational stability of the device in air with a T80 lifetime of over 1060&#160;h, which is higher than that of undoped device (416&#160;h). Furthermore, the PCE of large&#8208;area (25&#160;cm2) modules based on PDINN:C60&#8208;OH attains 16.47%. This study highlights the potential of the antioxidant strategy to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency and stable organic photovoltaics in air, significantly promoting the development of OSCs.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Insensitive Solvation Chemistry Stabilizes High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a solvophilic diluent&#8208;modulated electrolyte model for electric field&#8208;insensitive electrolyte chemistry. The electrolyte decouples solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields and maintains Li+&#8208;solvent coordination integrity via mutual hydrogen bonding, enabling remarkable success in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Ether based electrolytes are promising for the realization of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs). However, the oxidation chemistry of these electrolytes stemming from the disruption to solvent coordination by interfacial electric&#8208;field remains unresolved and challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that reinforcing the interactions between solvent and diluent to decouple solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields could maintain Li&#8314;&#8208;solvent coordination integrity and drastically diminish uncoordinated solvents, thereby increasing electrolyte anodic stability. To realize this concept, we identify a class of solvophilic diluents (SPDs, whose interaction energies with solvent&gt;3.3&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) to strongly anchor diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) solvent at electrified interfaces via mutually reinforcing H(DEGDME)&#183;&#183;&#183;F/O(SPD) and H(SPD)&#183;&#183;&#183;O(DEGDME) interactions and effectively decrease dipole moment of DEGDME (&lt;&#160;2.47&#160;D), creating an electric field&#8208;insensitive solvation environment wherein the O&#9472;H/C&#9472;H bond polarization of DEGDME is dramatically impeded. Remarkably, our designed SPD&#8208;assisted electrolyte mediated by electric field&#8208;insensitive methyl nonafluorobutyl ether exhibits outstanding anodic stability, endowing 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 30&#160;&#181;m Li||2.1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell with 80% capacity retention after 168 cycles&#8208;an improvement over the 90 cycles achieved with a Li friendly electrolyte. This work establishes a mechanistic framework for manipulating interfacial solvation dynamics to unlock high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

[3&#8208;IPy]3[MnBr3][MnBr4] exhibits quasi&#8208;1D chain structure with antiparallel electric dipole alignment, and the corresponding X&#8208;ray&#8208;irradiated polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Mn(II) halide hybrid crystals possess exceptional emission properties and pronounced anisotropic optoelectronic characteristics, making them highly promising for diverse applications. In this study, we present five structurally distinct Mn(II) hybrids, which either form the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains or a hybrid structure combining both 1D [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains and a quasi&#8208;1D chains. These quasi&#8208;1D chains are composed of polar MnBr42&#8722; tetrahedra and halogen&#8208;substituted pyridine ligands. Of particular interest is the mixed&#8208;polyhedral compound [3&#8208;IPy]3[MnBr3][MnBr4]. It exhibits dominant antiparallel alignment of dipole moment between quasi&#8208;1D chains, while 1D [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains display zero dipole moment. The highly&#8208;distorted MnBr42&#8722; tetrahedra owing to strong hydrogen bonding with halopyridine introduces large inherent structural anisotropy. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, it gives rise to a pronounced and fascinating polarization&#8208;sensitive emission. These findings underscore the promising potential of mixed&#8208;polyhedral Mn(II) halide hybrids in polarized photonic applications and provide valuable insights for the rational design of polarization&#8208;sensitive functional materials.

         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron catalytic system for efficient atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of CH2Br2 to alkenes has been developed. This photochemical approach enables facile synthesis of valuable 1,3&#8208;dibromo compounds that serve as versatile intermediates for streamlined preparation of oxetanes, allyl bromides, and cyclopropane derivatives through one&#8208;pot or sequential transformations. This breakthrough in CH2Br2 activation under mild conditions advances sustainable halogenation methodologies.








Abstract
An efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated iron&#8208;catalyzed atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction between CH2Br2 and various alkenes has been developed. This transformation provides direct access to synthetically valuable 1,3&#8208;dibromo compounds with excellent atom economy under mild reaction conditions. The protocol demonstrates remarkable versatility, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility. Notably, the obtained 1,3&#8208;dibromo products function as highly versatile synthetic building blocks. Through rationally designed one&#8208;pot multistep transformations, these intermediates can be conveniently converted into structurally diverse derivatives, including oxetanes and allyl bromides, directly from terminal alkenes.

         <title>Freely&#8208;Rotatable Multidentate Molecular Anchor Enables Self&#8208;Adaptive Aqueous Binders for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidentate molecular anchoring strategy was proposed to optimize the binders performance for lithium ion batteries. The BHB possesses a very special molecular rotation properties that can facilitate a multidentate anchoring effect to efficiently withstand the volume change of Si&#8208;based anodes after cross&#8208;linking with the traditional binders.








Abstract
The rational design and synthesis of reliable binders is a big challenge to efficiently mitigate the severe volume change of silicon&#8208;based anodes for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we report a multidentate molecular anchoring strategy to construct a novel self&#8208;adaptive aqueous binder. This binder composes of robust 3D dynamic networks derived from the crosslinking of the freely&#8208;rotatable multidentate molecular anchor (2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)butyric acid, BHB) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) via dynamic hydrogen&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly, which effectively imparts the fabrication of high&#8208;strength Si/C anodes and achieves high areal capacities (6.13&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2) under a high mass loading of 13&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the dynamic and reversible adhesion and the efficient &#8220;net&#8208;to&#8208;point&#8221; bonding characteristic contribute to enhance structural and interfacial stability in the NCM811/Si/C full cells. Consequently, the cells demonstrate superior cyclability and electrochemical performance. Notably, this multidentate molecular anchoring strategy can be further extended to develop other BHB&#8208;derived self&#8208;adaptive binders (i.e., BHB/PVA and BHB/CMC) for the purpose of dynamic structure regulation. This work provides valuable insights into the judicious modulation of aqueous binders from the perspective of molecular chemistry and product engineering, paving the pathway for the design of auqeous binders for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;energy Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Homogeneous Heterobimetallic&#8208;Oxide Interfaces Enable Synergistic Hydrogen Evolution Passivation for Durable Acidic Zn&#8211;Mn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative multi&#8208;cation synergistic modulation strategy enables self&#8208;assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces on Zn anodes. The design ingeniously blends the hydrolysis of SnCl4 and the replacement reaction of In3+ and Cu2+ ions with Zn metal to spontaneously generate the heterobimetallic In&#8211;CuZn5 and the oxide SnO2. Heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn&#8208;ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance and the abundant nucleation sites in acidic media. 








Abstract
Acidic Zn&#8211;Mn batteries hold promising prospects in large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their higher discharge voltage and capacity. However, the challenge of developing long&#8208;term acidic Zn&#8211;Mn batteries still remains due to Zn anode instability in acidic media arising from the inevitable proton corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report self&#8208;assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces on the Zn anode surface via a multi&#8208;cation (Cu2+, In3+, and Sn4+) synergistic regulation strategy to achieve &gt;85.5% depth of discharge with over 1000&#160;h of cycling in strongly acidic medium (pH&#160;=&#160;0.9). The design ingeniously blends the SnCl4 hydrolysis and In3+ and Cu2+ ions replacement with Zn metal to spontaneously generate heterobimetallic In&#8211;CuZn5 and SnO2 oxide. Heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn&#8208;ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance of SnO2 and the abundant nucleation sites of heterobimetallic. Crucially, the in situ hydrolysis of SnCl4 establishes a self&#8208;regulated acidic environment without additional acidic medium. Consequently, Zn&#8211;Mn pouch battery within this acidic environment delivers a high capacity of 1.39 mAh cm&#8722;2 and retains 84.9% of initial capacity after 200 cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This direct multi&#8208;cation synergistic modulated self&#8208;assembly interface strategy holds significant potential for expediting the advancement of high&#8208;safety, large&#8208;scale energy storage technology.

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Adaptive Transformations of Flexible Frameworks: From Controlled Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness to Regulated Responsive Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two flexible framework conformers (FJI&#8208;H29 and FJI&#8208;H41) were prepared. They not only exhibit different responses to the same stimuli, but their responsive behaviors can also be regulated precisely. FJI&#8208;H29 is thermosensitive, it can undergo thermal&#8208;driven deformations and reconstructions. While FJI&#8208;H41 is sensitive to the kinetic energy, it can undergo desolvent&#8208;driven controllable deformations, from in situ shrinkage to stepwise shrinkage.








Abstract
Synthesizing enzyme&#8208;like porous materials that can regulate responsiveness through conformations remains a challenge. Here, two flexible framework conformers (FJI&#8208;H29 and FJI&#8208;H41) were prepared from a semirigid ligand. They not only exhibit different responses to the same stimuli, but their responsive behaviors can also be regulated precisely. FJI&#8208;H29 is thermosensitive, it can undergo continuous thermal&#8208;driven transformations, from reversible deformations to irreversible reconstruction, and the reconstruction barrier can be further tuned. While FJI&#8208;H41 is sensitive to the kinetic energy generated by solvent removal; when the solvents escape vigorously, it in situ shrinks to a more stable conformer (FJI&#8208;H43); when the solvents escape slowly, it first forms a shape maintaining metastable state (FJI&#8208;H41'), then spontaneously transforms into FJI&#8208;H43. Structural analysis shows the FJI&#8208;H29 is mechanically stable, while its ligands undergo more severe distortion with increasing temperature, enabling it to undergo thermal&#8208;driven reconstruction. Whereas FJI&#8208;H41 is mechanically unstable, so it is prone to undergo desolvent&#8208;driven deformations. FJI&#8208;H43 not only exhibits a temperature&#8208;dependent gate&#8208;open effect for the adsorption of C2H2 and CO2 but can also be used for one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H2/C2H4/CO2 mixture; but FJI&#8208;H29 does not work. This provides a new strategy for preparing enzyme&#8208;like porous materials.

         <title>Confining the Node Accessibility of Zr&#8208;MOFs Along One&#8208;Dimensional Channels Toward High Water&#8208;Vapor Cycle&#8208;Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A principle for building Zr&#8208;MOFs with high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability by deliberately constructing one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels with limited accessibility of Zr6 nodes to water along channel direction was illustrated. Through either shortening or elongating the core of organic linker horizontally, MOFs with high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability were synthesized. The new resultant Zr&#8208;MOF NJTech&#8208;5 shows one of the highest water uptake amount and working capacity.








Abstract
Zirconium&#8208;based MOFs (Zr&#8208;MOFs) with high hydrolytic stability are promising materials for water&#8208;adsorption&#8208;related applications. However, besides hydrolytic stability, cycling stability is also a crucial feature that renders a MOF a good candidate for water adsorption. Through a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels showing high water cycling stability, a principle of confining the accessibility of Zr6 nodes aligning along channel direction in Zr&#8208;MOFs was unveiled. According to this principle, several topologies that regulates Zr6 nodes with chelating formate aligning in a same plane with a distance less than 5.4&#160;&#197; can successfully hinder the introduction of in&#8208;plane water molecules, thus significantly improve the cycling stability of Zr&#8208;MOFs for water adsorption. Along with this principle, we illustrated a linker designing strategy by horizontal extending the core of organic linkers toward the synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs with similar node alignment. By either intentionally shortening or elongating the core horizontally, both MOFs shows high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability. Among them, NJTech&#8208;5 (NJTech for Nanjing Tech University) with scu&#8208;topology, presents a water uptake capacity of 0.93&#160;g g&#8722;1 and working capacity of 0.82&#160;g g&#8722;1, making it among the top stable MOFs with high water uptake capacity and a promising candidate for indoor humidity control.

Among them, &lt;b&gt;NJTech-5&lt;/b&gt; (NJTech for Nanjing Tech University) with &lt;i&gt;scu&lt;/i&gt;-topology, presents a water uptake capacity of 0.93&#160;g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and working capacity of 0.82&#160;g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, making it among the top stable MOFs with high water uptake capacity and a promising candidate for indoor humidity control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Co sites in n&#8208;n type heterojunction enable selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C n&#8208;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12 V (vs. RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#8208;hour continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#8208;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#8208;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst, containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities, to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Indolocarbazole&#8208;Bridged Multiple Resonance Emitter through Steric Pre&#8208;Substitution for Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE over 40%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric pre&#8208;substitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W&#8208;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2 and 5,000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively. This work establishes a pre&#8208;substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.</dc:description>

Here, a steric pre-substitution strategy is devised using tert-butylphenyl-functionalized indolo[3,2-b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora-Friedel-Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W-1. The efficiency roll-off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m-2 and 5,000 cd m-2, respectively. This work establishes a pre-substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid-state emission for high-performance MR emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Strategies Applied to the Late&#8208;Stage Modifications of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review explores the potential of mechanochemistry in the late&#8208;stage modification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), offering a comprehensive analysis of methods designed to transform structurally complex molecular scaffolds. By examining the scope, efficiency, and mechanistic aspects of these approaches, the review highlights protocols capable of effectively modifying structurally complex molecular scaffolds. To further assist researchers, we provide a detailed table summarizing the discussed APIs, their respective modifications, and any necessary pre&#8208;functionalizations. This resource should provide a practical guide for selecting suitable substrates to evaluate the pharmaceutical relevance of existing and novel (mechano)chemical methods.</dc:description>
