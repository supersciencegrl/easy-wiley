      <title>Direct Imaging of Atomic Permeation Through a Vacancy Defect in the Carbon Lattice</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomic vacancies in graphenic lattice can be applied as sieve pores for sieving atoms, ions and molecules. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010630), A. Khlobystov, U. Kaiser and co&#8208;workers report the direct observation of the permeation of single palladium atoms passing one&#8208;by&#8208;one through a vacancy defect in a single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube by transmission electron microscopy. The curvature of the carbon lattice drives the permeation in the direction from the concave to the convex side of the membrane due to the difference between metal&#8211;carbon bonding with opposite sides.

      <title>Codoping of Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskites Promotes Near&#8208;Infrared Photoluminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Efficient near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence in lead&#8208;free double perovskite bulk materials has been achieved by Nag and co&#8208;workers through a codoping strategy. The introduction of Bi3+ ions leads to the formation of a new energy state that absorb lower&#8208;energy light. The excited state thus formed, excites f&#8208;electrons of Er3+ or Yb3+ ions, and the subsequent relaxation of the f&#8208;electrons results in near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence.







Abstract
In the rapidly developing smart era, near&#8208;infrared luminescent materials have important applications in various fields that are closely related to people. Nag and co&#8208;workers provided a first codoping strategy to achieve efficient near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence in lead&#8208;free double perovskite materials. Through the introduction of Bi3+ ions, a new energy state is formed that leads to the absorption of lower&#8208;energy light. The excited state formed by this light absorption subsequently excites f&#8208;electrons of Er3+ or Yb3+ ions, and the relaxation of these f&#8208;electrons results in near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence. This may open a new chapter in the application of perovskites for infrared detection and human sensing.

      <title>High Ammonia Uptake of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Adsorbent in a Wide Pressure Range</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous NH3 adsorbents are characterized by insufficient NH3 uptake, low NH3 affinity at low pressure, and poor chemical stability under wet conditions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202012552), C.&#8197;S. Hong and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a Mg&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework material with high&#8208;density open Lewis metal sites along one&#8208;dimensional hexagonal channels shows record&#8208;high NH3 capacities at both very low and high pressures, and remarkable structural stability even under wet NH3 conditions.

      <title>Chemical Tagging of Protein Lipoylation</title>
      <dc:description>Protein lipoylation is a post&#8208;translational modification of emerging importance in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, labeling and large&#8208;scale profiling of protein lipoylation remain challenging. Here, we report the development of iLCL (iodoacetamide&#8208;assisted lipoate&#8208;cyclooctyne ligation), a chemoselective reaction that enables chemical tagging of protein lipoylation. We demonstrate that the cyclic disulfide of lipoamide but not linear disulfides can selectively react with iodoacetamide to produce sulfenic acid, which can be conjugated with cyclooctyne probes. iLCL enables tagging of lipoylated proteins for gel&#8208;based detection and cellular imaging. Furthermore, we apply iLCL for proteomic profiling of lipoylated proteins in both bacteria and mammalian cells. In addition to all of the eight known lipoylated proteins, we identified seven candidates for novel lipoylated proteins. The iLCL strategy should facilitate uncovering the biological function of protein lipoylation.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Assembly of An Organoplatinum(II) Complex with Ratiometric Dual Emission for Two&#8208;Photon Bioimaging</title>

Pt1  displays blue emission in cells with an intact membrane due to its low cellular uptake. In cells where the membrane is disrupted, uptake of the complex is increased and at higher concentrations yellow emission is observed. The ratio of yellow to blue emission shows a linear relationship to the loss of cell membrane integrity.  Pt1  is, to our knowledge, the first example of an assembly&#8208;induced two&#8208;photon ratiometric dual emission organoplatinum complex. The excellent and unique characteristics of the complex enabled its use for the tracking of cell apoptosis, necrosis and the inflammation process in zebrafish.</dc:description>

      <title>Role of pyridinic nitrogen in the mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction on carbon electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The introduction of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N) into carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction is considered to create new active sites. Herein, the role of pyri&#8208;N in such catalysts was investigated from a mechanistic viewpoint using carbon black (CB)&#8208;supported pyri&#8208;N&#8208;containing molecules as model catalysts, and the highest activity was observed for 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline/CB. X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy showed that in acidic electrolytes, both pyri&#8208;N atoms of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline could be protonated to form pyridinium ions (pyri&#8208;NH  +  ). In O  2  &#8208;saturated electrolytes, one of the pyri&#8208;NH  +  species was reduced to pyri&#8208;NH upon the application of a potential, whereas no such reduction was observed in N  2  &#8208;saturated electrolytes. This behavior was ascribed to the electrochemical reduction of pyri&#8208;NH  +  occurring simultaneously with the thermal adsorption of O  2  , as supported by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, according to these calculations, the coupled reduction was promoted by hydrophobic environments.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of FASnI3 Films with Pre&#8208;nucleation Clusters for Efficient Lead&#8208;free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Tin halide perovskites are rising as promising materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the crystallization rate of tin halide perovskites is much faster than the lead&#8208;based analogs, leading to more rampant trap states and much lower power conversion efficiencies. Here, we disclose a key finding to modulate the crystallization kinetics of FASnI  3  (FA: formamidinium) through a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism based on pre&#8208;nucleation clusters (PNCs). By introducing piperazine dihydriodide to tune the colloidal chemistry of the FASnI  3  perovskite precursor solution, stable clusters could be readily formed in the solution before nucleation. These pre&#8208;nucleation clusters act as intermediate phase and thus can reduce the energy barrier for the perovskite nucleation. The precursor solution enriched with such intermediate PNCs could be readily converted to a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with a much lower defect density. This PNCs&#8208;based method has led to a conspicuous photovoltaic performance improvement for FASnI  3  &#8208;based PSCs, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.39% plus improved stability.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational Modulation of Iduronic Acid&#8208;Containing Sulfated Glycosaminoglycans by a Polynuclear Platinum Compound. Implications for Development of Antimetastatic Platinum Drugs.</title>
      <dc:description>1  H NMR spectroscopic studies on the 1:1 adduct of the pentasaccharide Fondaparinux (FPX) and the substitution&#8208;inert polynuclear platinum complex TriplatinNC show significant modulation of geometry around the glycosidic linkages of the FPX constituent monosaccharides. FPX is a valid model for the highly sulfated cell signalling molecule heparan sulfate (HS). The conformational ratio of the  1  C  4  :  2  S  0  forms of the FPX residue IdoA(2S) is altered from &#8776; 35:65 (free FPX) to &#8776; 75:25 in the adduct; the first demonstration of a small molecule affecting conformational changes on a HS oligosaccharide. Functional consequences of such binding are suggested to be inhibition of HS cleavage in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We further describe inhibition of metastasis by TriplatinNC in the TNBC 4T1 syngeneic tumour model. Our work provides insight into a novel approach for design of platinum drugs (and coordination compounds in general) with intrinsic anti&#8208;metastatic potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterostructure of Ru2P/WO3/NPC Synergistically Promotes H2O Dissociation for Improved Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Facilitating the dissociation of water and desorption of hydrogen are both crucial challenges for improving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Herein, we report the synthesis of heterostructure of Ru2P/WO3@NPC (N, P co&#8208;doped carbon) by a simple hydrothermal reaction using ruthenium and tungsten salts as precursors, followed by pyrolyzing under an Ar atmosphere. The Ru2P/WO3@NPC electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding HER activity with an overpotential of 15 mV at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 and excellent durability in a 1.0 M KOH solution, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and most reported electrocatalysts. Experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the electron density redistribution in Ru2P/WO3@NPC is achieved by electron transfer from NPC to Ru2P/WO3 and from Ru2P to WO3, which directly promotes the dissociation of water on W sites in WO3 and desorption of hydrogen on Ru sites in Ru2P.</dc:description>

      <title>A glass&#8208;ceramic with accelerated surface reconstruction toward the efficient oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The effective non&#8208;precious metal catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desirable for electrochemical water splitting. The amorphous electrocatalysts are highly potential due to the increased exposure of active sites, while the crystalline counterparts exhibit the superiority of electron transport to active sites. To organically integrate these two components, here we prepare a novel glass&#8208;ceramic (Ni  1.5  Sn@triMPO  4  ) by embedding crystalline Ni  1.5  Sn nanoparticles into amorphous trimetallic phosphate (triMPO  4  ) matrix. This unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous nanostructure synergistically accelerates the surface reconstruction to active Ni(Fe)OOH, due to the low vacancy formation energy of Sn in glass&#8208;ceramic and high adsorption energy of PO  4  3&#8208;  at the V  O  sites. Compared to control samples, this dual&#8208;phase glass&#8208;ceramic after surface reconstruction exhibits a remarkably lowered overpotential and boosted OER kinetics, rivaling most of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the residual PO  4  3&#8208;  and the V  O  sites induce electron depletion of adjacent Ni atoms and shift the d band center much closer to the Fermi level. Such redistribution of electron states optimizes the adsorption of OH* and OOH* intermediates on metal oxyhydroxides and promotes the OER activity. This study proves the structural superiority of glass&#8208;ceramics in boosting surface reconstruction and provides new insights into design of advanced electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Insights into Redox Chemistry of Organosulfides Towards Stable Molecule Design in Nonaqueous Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) have great potential to achieve high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, their advancement has long been limited by low solubility and poor stability of active materials. Here we demonstrate organosulfides as a new&#8208;type model material system to explore the rational design of redox&#8208;active molecules in nonaqueous systems. The designed tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TETD) molecule shows high solubility in various common organic solvents and achieves a high reversible capacity of ~50 Ah L  &#8208;1  at a high concentration of 1 M. More importantly, the resonance structures in the reduced product endow the molecule with high electrochemical stability in different organic electrolytes.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) have great potential to achieve high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, their advancement has long been limited by low solubility and poor stability of active materials. Here we demonstrate organosulfides as a new&#8208;type model material system to explore the rational design of redox&#8208;active molecules in nonaqueous systems. The designed tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TETD) molecule shows high solubility in various common organic solvents and achieves a high reversible capacity of ~50 Ah L  &#8208;1  at a high concentration of 1 M. More importantly, the resonance structures in the reduced product endow the molecule with high electrochemical stability in different organic electrolytes. The underlying mechanism in redox chemistry of organodisulfides involving the cleavage and reformation of disulfide bonds is revealed by systematic material/structural characterizations. This study provides a new perspective of promising molecule designs to tackle the fundamental challenges in the development of redox&#8208;active materials for high&#8208;performance nonaqueous RFBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Analogous mixed matrix membranes with self&#8208;assembled interface pathways</title>
      <dc:description>The implementation of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for sub&#8208;angstrom scale gas separations remains a grand challenge. Meanwhile, the elucidation of structure and formation mechanism of elusive interface pathways is urgently needed yet largely unmet. Herein, a series of analogous mixed matrix membrane (AMMMs) were constructed via molecular&#8208;level hybridization by utilizing reactive ionic liquid (RIL) as continuous phase and graphene quantum dot (GQD) as nanofiller for sub&#8208;angstrom scale ethylene/ethane (0.416 nm / 0.443 nm) separation. With a small number of GQDs (3.5 wt.%) embedded in GQD/RIL AMMMs, ethylene permeability soared by 3.1 times, and ethylene/ethane selectivity simultaneously boosted by nearly 60% and reached up to 99.5, which outperformed most previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and their self&#8208;assembly mechanism was revealed, where the non&#8208;covalent interactions between RIL and GQDs induced the local arrangement of IL chains to self&#8208;assemble into plenty of compact and superfast interfacial pathways, contributing to the combination of superhigh permeability and selectivity. This study shed light on the rational design of interface pathways and sustainable prosperity of MMMs for energy&#8208;intensive gas molecule separations.</dc:description>

      <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Solvent&#8208;Free Chiral Organic &#960;&#8208;liquids</title>
      <dc:description>The solvent&#8208;free organic &#960;&#8208;liquids have been attracting increasing attentions due to the inherent optoelectronic properties accompanied by the advantages of non&#8208;volatility and high processability. Here we reported a series of naphthalene derivatives substituted with chiral branched alkyl chains, which present as liquids ( Nap1&#8208;3 ) or solid ( Nap4 ) at room temperature depending on the substitution positions. Circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were only observed for enantiomeric Nap2 (2,3&#8208;substituted) liquid. It is suggested that the chiral aggregation in the &#960;&#8208;liquid leads to the CD signal and the chiral excimer resulting in the CPL performance. When achiral anthracene or pyrene was dissolved in Nap2, the &#960;&#8208;liquid could serve as chirality and energy transfer media that both CD and CPL emerged from the achiral anthracene. A CPL dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of anthracene reached to 5.2&#215;10&#8208;2 when dissolved in chiral Nap2 liquid, which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the pure Nap2 &#960;&#8208;liquid. Combined the experimental and theoretical studies, a fundamental understanding of the origin of the chiroptical properties in organic &#960;&#8208;liquid was provided and an efficient media for developing soft chiral materials was demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereoselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylcyclopropanation via Generation of a Sulfur&#8208;Substituted Vinyl Carbene Equivalent</title>
      <dc:description>A stereoselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed vinylcyclopropanation of alkenes has been developed. A gold&#8208;coordinated cationic vinyl carbene species, readily generated via a rearrangement of the ethylenedithioacetal of propargyl aldehyde, reacts with a wide range of alkenes to afford thio&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropanes. The gold&#8208;catalyzed vinyl cyclopropanation proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature and is generally selective for the formation of  cis  &#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. The reaction allows the formal introduction of a &#8216;naked&#8217; vinyl carbene, by subsequent chemoselective hydrodesulfurisation of the ethylenedithio&#8208;bridge.

      <title>Strategies of mitigating dissolution of solid electrolyte interphases in sodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>With emerging interest in sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) technology due to its cost effectiveness and high earth abundance of sodium, the search for an optimised SIB&#160;system becomes more and more crucial.&#160;It is well known that the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode in Na&#8208;based systems is a challenge due to the higher solubility of the SEI components compared to in the lithium&#8208;ion battery case. Our knowledge about the formation and dissolution of the SEI in SIBs is so far based on limited experimental data. The aim of the present research is therefore to enhance the understanding of the behaviour of the SEI in SIBs and shed more light on the influence of the electrolyte chemistry on the dissolution of the SEI. By conducting electrochemical tests including extended open circuit pauses, we study the SEI dissolution in different time domains. With this, it is possible to determine the extent of self&#8208;discharge due to SEI dissolution during a specific time. Instead of using a conventional separator, &#946;&#8208;alumina is employed as a Na&#8208;conductive membrane to avoid crosstalk between the working electrode and Na&#8208;metal counter electrode. The SEI composition is monitored using synchrotron&#8208;based soft X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SOXPES). The electrochemical and XPS results show that the SEIs formed in the studied electrolyte systems have different stabilities. The relative capacity loss after a 50&#8208;hour pause in the tested electrolyte systems can be up to 30%. Among three carbonate&#8208;based solvent systems, NaPF  6  in ethylene carbonate: diethyl carbonate&#160;exhibits the most stable SEI.&#160;The addition of electrolyte additives improves the SEI stability in PC. The electrolyte is saturated with typical SEI species, NaF and Na  2  CO  3  , in order to oppose the dissolution of the SEI. Furthermore, the solubilities of the latter additives in the different solvent systems are determined by inductively coupled plasma &#8211; optical emission spectrometry.</dc:description>

      <title>Fe&#8208;O Clusters Anchored on Nodes of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Direct Methane Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Direct methane oxidation into value&#8208;added organic oxygenates with high productivity under mild condition remains a great challenge. In this work, we show Fe&#8208;O clusters on nodes of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable electronic state for direct methane oxidation into C1 organic oxygenates at 50&#176;C. The Fe&#8208;O clusters are grafted onto inorganic Zr6  nodes of UiO&#8208;66 (UiO stands for University of Oslo), while the organic terephthalic acid (H2BDC) ligands of UiO&#8208;66 are partially substituted with monocarboxylic modulators of acetic acid (AA) or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Experiments and theoretical calculation disclose that the TFA group coordinated with Zr6  node of UiO&#8208;66 enhances the oxidation state of adjacent Fe&#8208;O cluster due to its electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, promotes the activation of C&#8208;H bond of methane and increases its selective conversion, thus leading to the extraordinarily high C1 oxygenate yield of 4799 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with 97.9% selectivity, ~8 times higher than those modulated with AA.</dc:description>

      <title>Inorganic&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Advanced Lithium Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>In carbonate electrolytes, the organic&#8208;inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the lithium (Li) metal anode surface is strongly bonded to Li and experiences the same volume change as Li, thus it undergoes continuous cracking/reformation during plating/stripping cycles. Here, an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI is designed on a Li metal surface to reduce its bonding energy with Li metal by dissolving 4 M concentrated LiNO  3  in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive for a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) based electrolyte. Due to the aggregate structure of NO  3  &#8208;  ions and its participation in the primary Li  +  solvation sheath, abundant Li  2  O, Li  3  N, and LiN  x  O  y  grains are formed in the resulting SEI, in addition to the uniform LiF distribution from the reduction of PF  6  &#8208;  ions. The inorganic&#8208;rich SEI&#8217;s weak bonding (high interface energy) to Li can effectively promote Li diffusion along the SEI/Li interface and prevent Li dendrite penetration into the SEI. As a result, our designed carbonate electrolyte enables a Li anode to achieve a high Li plating/stripping CE of 99.55% (1 mA cm  &#8208;2  , 1.0 mAh cm  &#8208;2  ) and the electrolyte also enables a Li||LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  (NMC811) full cell (2.5 mAh cm&#8208;2) to retain 75% of its initial capacity after 200 cycles with an outstanding CE of 99.83%. The concentrated additive strategy presented here provides a drop&#8208;in practical solution to further optimize carbonate electrolytes for beyond Li&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosted Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics over Particulate Lanthanum and Rhodium&#8208;Doped Strontium Titanate Photocatalysts Modified with Phosphonate Groups</title>
      <dc:description>Phosphonate groups loaded on the surface of the visible light responsive photocatalyst Ru&#8208;loaded La,Rh&#8208;doped SrTiO  3  (Ru/La,Rh:STO)  via  a silane coupling treatment enhance the photocatalytic activity of this material during the hydrogen evolution reaction. Surface modification with an alkylsilane phosphonate accelerates the supply of reactants to active sites and is much more effective at improving photocatalytic activity than the utilization of phosphate buffered electrolyte as a reaction solution. In contrast, the incorporation of amine, sulfonate, and propyl groups does not improve the activity of Ru/La,Rh:STO. The effects of these functional groups introduced  via  the silane coupling on the reaction kinetics of hydrogen evolution are evaluated separately from the oxidative reaction using electrochemical methods. It was also demonstrated that the present alkylsilane phosphonate modification increases photocatalytic activity even under a low photon flux. This study introduces a new approach to improving the reaction kinetics of particulate photocatalysts by actively accelerating the reactant mass transfer through the pre&#8208;anchored phosphonate groups as an alternative to the development of the photocatalyst material itself.</dc:description>

      <title>A Stable [4,3]Peri&#8208;acene Diradicaloid: Synthesis, Structure and Electronic Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis of peri&#8208;fused two or more rows of acenes (peri&#8208;acenes) is challenging due to their intrinsic open&#8208;shell diradical character. Herein, we report the isolation of a derivative (  4  ) of hitherto the largest peri&#8208;acene molecule, namely [4,3]peri&#8208;acene, in a crystal form. The parent [4,3]peri&#8208;acene containing three rows of tetracene has a large diradical character (y  0  = 94.8%) originated from aromatic stabilization. Due to kinetic blocking,  4  showed reasonable stability with a half&#8208;life time of ~157 hours under ambient conditions. Its structure was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and bond length analysis revealed eight localized Clar&#8217;s sextets.  4  exhibited open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a narrow electrochemical energy gap (1.13 eV) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8208;0.57 kcal/mol from SQUID measurement).

      <title>Reaction Acceleration at Solid/Solution Interfaces: Katritzky Reaction Catalyzed by Glass Particles</title>
      <dc:description>The Katritzky reaction in bulk solution at room temperature is accelerated significantly by the surface of a glass container compared to a plastic container. Remarkably, the reaction rate is increased by more than two orders of magnitude upon the addition of glass particles with the rate increasing linearly with increasing amounts of glass. A similar phenomenon is observed when glass particles are added to levitated droplets, where large acceleration factors are seen. Evidence shows that glass acts as a catalyst: it participates as a base in the deprotonation step and is recovered unchanged from the reaction mixture. Reaction acceleration at two separate interfaces is recognized in this study: (i) air/solution phase acceleration, as is well known in microdroplets; (ii) solid/solution phase, where such acceleration appears to be a new phenomenon.</dc:description>

      <title>Formic Acid Electro&#8208;synthesis by Concurrent Cathodic CO2 Reduction and Anodic CH3OH Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into energy carrying compounds or value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for diminishing the greenhouse effect and the efficient utilization of carbon dioxide emissions, which, however, suffers from the kinetic&#8208;sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its less value&#8208;added production of O  2  . Herein, we report a general strategy for efficient formic acid synthesis by concurrent cathodic    CO  2  reduction and anodic partial methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), using mesoporous SnO  2  grown on carbon cloth (mSnO  2  /CC) and CuO nanosheets grown on copper foam (CuONS/CF) as cathodic and anodic catalysts, respectively. Anodic CuONS/CF enables an extremely lowered potential of 1.47 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to obtain 100 mA cm  &#8208;2  , featuring a significantly enhanced electro&#8208;activity in comparison to OER. Meanwhile, the cathodic mSnO  2  /CC shows a rather high Faraday efficiency of 81% at 0.7 V vs RHE for formic acid production from CO  2  . Moreover, the established electrolyzer equipped with CuONS/CF at the anode and mSnO  2  /CC at the cathode requires a considerably low cell voltage of 0.93 V at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  for formic acid production at both sides.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells with imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for surface passivation and charge transport</title>
      <dc:description>Surface defects have been a key constraint for perovskite photovoltaics. Herein, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMIMPF  6  ) ionic liquid (IL) is adopted to passivate the perovskite surface and also reduce the energy barrier between the perovskite and hole transport layer. Theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that Pb&#8208;cluster and Pb&#8208;I antisite defects can be effectively passivated by [DMIM]  +  bonding with the Pb  2+  on the perovskite surface, leading to significantly suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. As a result, the solar cell efficiency is increased to 23.25% from 21.09% for the control device, mostly due to improvement of open&#8208;circuit voltage. Furthermore, the DMIMPF  6  &#8208;treated perovskite device shows better long term environmental stability because the DMIMPF  6  layer can efficiently block moisture permeation due to its hydrophobic nature. This work provides firm support to the understanding of the passivation effect and further promotes the development of surface engineering for enhancing the performance of perovskite photovoltaics.</dc:description>

      <title>An enantioselective e&#8208;nose: An array of nanoporous homochiral MOF films for stereospecific sensing of chiral odors</title>
      <dc:description>Chirality is essential in nature and often pivotal for biological information transfer, e.g. via odor messenger molecules. While the human nose can distinguish the enantiomers of many chiral odors, the technical realization by an artificial sensor or an electronic nose, e&#8208;nose, remains a challenge. Here, we present an array of six sensors coated with nanoporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films of different homochiral and achiral structures, working as an enantioselective e&#8208;nose. While the achiral&#8208;MOF&#8208;film sensors show identical responses for both isomers of one chiral odor molecule, the responses of the homochiral MOF films differ for different enantiomers. By machine learning algorithms, the combined array data allow the stereoselective identification of all compounds, here tested for 5 pairs of chiral odor molecules. We foresee the chiral&#8208;MOF&#8208;e&#8208;nose, able to enantioselectively detect and discriminated chiral odors, to be a powerful approach towards advanced odor sensing.</dc:description>

      <title>An Ethacrynic Acid&#8208;Brominated BODIPY Photosensitizer
(EA&#8208;BPS) Construct Enhances the Lethality of Reactive Oxygen Species in Hypoxic Tumor&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Despite being a clinically approved intervention for cancer, photodynamic therapy (PDT) still suffers from limitations. Prime among these is a therapeutic response that is mostly oxygen dependent. This limits the utility of PDT in treating hypoxic tumors since lower levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in regions of low oxygen tension. Glutathione&#8208;pi (GST&#8208;pi) is a key enzyme that militates against ROS&#8208;mediated apoptosis. We report here a new construct, EA&#8208;BPS, that contains both a brominated BODIPY photosensitizer (BPS) and an ethacrynic acid (EA) GST&#8208;pi inhibitor. Photoirradiation of EA&#8208;BPS induces a synergistic antitumor effect that results from the combination of ROS production and GST&#8208;pi inhibition. Relative to BPS alone, an enhanced cell&#8208;killing effect is seen under hypoxic conditions both&#160;in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo. We conclude that by making better use of the available oxygen in tumor environments, improved therapeutic PDT outcomes should be achievable even under hypoxic conditions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) sensors offer a powerful and general means for analyte detection in complex samples for various applications. Paper&#8208;based E&#8208;AB sensors could enable portable, low&#8208;cost, and rapid detection of a broad range of targets, but it has proven challenging to fabricate suitable three&#8208;electrode systems on paper. Here, we demonstrate a simple, economic, and environmentally&#8208;friendly strategy for fabricating aptamer&#8208;modified paper electrochemical devices (PEDs) via ambient vacuum filtration. The electrode material, shape, size, and thickness of the three&#8208;electrode PED system can be fully customized. We developed aptamer&#8208;modified PEDs that enable sensitive and specific detection of small molecules in minimally processed biosamples. The sensitivity and stability of the PEDs is comparable to E&#8208;AB sensors based on commercial gold electrodes. We believe our fabrication strategy can lead to the development of high performance PEDs that enable on&#8208;site detection of a variety of analytes, simplifying the development of portable sensors for real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrazine (N2H4) Formation via Coupling of a NiIII&#8208;NH2 Radical</title>
      <dc:description>M(NH  x  ) intermediates involved in N&#8211;N bond formation are central to ammonia oxidation (AO) catalysis, an enabling technology to ultimately exploit ammonia (NH  3  ) as an alternative fuel source. While homocoupling of a terminal amide species (M&#8211;NH  2  ) to form hydrazine (N  2  H  4  ) has been proposed, well&#8208;defined examples are without precedent. Herein, we discuss the generation and electronic structure of a Ni  III  &#8211;NH  2  species that undergoes bimolecular coupling to generate a Ni  II  2  (N  2  H  4  ) complex. This hydrazine adduct can be further oxidized to a structurally unusual Ni  2  (N  2  H  2  ) species; the latter releases N  2  in the presence of NH  3  , thus establishing a synthetic cycle for Ni&#8208;mediated AO. Distribution of the redox load for H  2  N&#8211;NH  2  formation via NH  2  coupling between two metal centers presents an attractive strategy for AO catalysis using Earth&#8208;abundant, late first&#8208;row metals.</dc:description>

      <title>Bioorthogonal Activation of Dual Catalytic and Anti&#8208;Cancer Activities of Organogold(I) Complexes in Living Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Controllably activating the bio&#8208;reactivity of metal complexes in living systems is challenging but highly desirable because it can minimize off&#8208;target bindings and improve spatiotemporal specificity. Herein we report a new bioorthogonal activation approach by employing Pd(II)&#8208;triggered transmetallation reactions to conditionally activate the bio&#8208;reactivity of NHC&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;phenylacetylide complexes (e.g.,  1a  ) in vitro and in vivo. A combination of  1  H NMR, LC&#8208;MS, DFT calculation and fluorescence screening assays reveals that  1a  displays a reasonable stability against biological thiols, but its phenylacetylide ligand can be efficiently transferred to Pd(II), leading to in situ formation of labile NHC&#8208;Au(I) species that is catalytically active inside living cells and zebrafish, and can meanwhile effectively suppress the activity of thioredoxin reductase, potently inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and efficiently suppress angiogenesis in zebrafish models. Of note, by introducing RGD&#8208;functionalized Pd(II) inducers,  1a  is endowed with highly selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells with minimal influence on the normal counterparts.</dc:description>

A series of coded amino acid methyl esters were conjugated to anthracene segments at N&#8208;terminus, which afforded 2  1  and 3  1  symmetry supramolecular tilt chirality in solid&#8208;states induced by H&#8208;bonds and aromatic interactions. Helical assemblies enabled diversified Cotton effects and CPL performances, which were in accordance with the tilted chirality between anthracene segments. Such correlation shows fine universality to all the eight applied building units that beyond exciton&#8208;chirality rule, whereby the chiroptical prediction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chrial luminophors could be realized based on solid&#8208;state structures or computational dynamic simulation. This work shall greatly facilitate the rational design and prediction for the on&#8208;demand chiroptical self&#8208;assembled materials. Furthermore, electron&#8208;deficient molecules were accommodated into charge&#8208;transfer coassemblies, which enabled wide luminescent color transition as well as pure white&#8208;light emission.

In particular, the trichlorine monoanion is of great interest because its structure should be symmetrical and show two equidistant Cl&#8722;Cl bonds. However, apart from matrix&#8208;isolation studies, only asymmetric trichlorine anions have been reported so far. Herein, the trichlorine monoanions in 2&#8208;chloroethyltrimethylammonium trichloride [NMe  3  EtCl][Cl  3  ],  1  , tetra&#173;methylammonium trichloride [NMe  4  ][Cl  3  ],  2  , and tetrapropylammo&#173;nium trichloride [N  n  Pr  4  ][Cl  3  ],  3  , are analysed. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures and experimental charge density analyses supported by periodic quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide insight into the influence of the crystalline environment on the structure of these [Cl  3  ]  &#8722;  anions as well as in the progress of the bond formation between a dichlorine molecule and a Cl  &#8722;  anion.</dc:description>

The versatile proteasome inhibitor MG132 is inactivated with a photolabile protection group at its reactive aldehyde function, as described by Esther Zanin et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202008267). Upon blue light irradiation MG132 activity is restored and cancer cells arrest either during metaphase of the cell cycle or die by apoptosis.

      <title>Rational Synthesis of 1D Hyperbranched Heterostructures with Enhanced Optoelectronic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) hyperbranched heterostructures (HBHSs) with abundant interfaces are rendered with various interfacial phenomena and functionalities. However, the rational synthesis of 1D HBHSs with desired spatial architecture and specific interface remains a great challenge. Here, we report a seeded growth method for controlled synthesis of two extraordinary types of HBHSs, in which high&#8208;intensity of CdS branches selectively grow on 1D nanowire (NW) trunks with different growth behaviors. The composition of the HBHSs can be further tuned by combining with cation exchange method, which enriches the variety of the HBHSs. The optoelectronic devices based on a single HBHS were fabricated and exhibit a better photoresponse performance compared with that of a single NW trunk. This advance provides a strategy for the controlled synthesis HBHSs with complex morphology and offers a platform for exploring their applications for photo harvesting and conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Theoretical, Solid&#8208;State and Solution Quantification of the Hydrogen Bond Enhanced Halogen Bond</title>
      <dc:description>Proximal noncovalent forces are commonplace in natural systems and understanding the consequences of their juxtaposition is critical. This paper experimentally quantifies for the first time a Hydrogen Bond enhanced Halogen Bond (HBeXB) without the complexities of protein structure or preorganization. An HBeXB is a halogen bond that has been strengthened when the halogen donor simultaneously accepts a hydrogen bond. Our theoretical studies suggest that electron&#8208;rich halogen bond donors are strengthened most by an adjacent hydrogen bond. Furthermore, stronger hydrogen bond donors enhance the halogen bond the most. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of halide complexes (X&#8212; = Br&#8212;, I&#8212;) reveal that HBeXBs produce shorter halogen bonds than non&#8208;hydrogen bond analogues. 19F NMR titrations with chloride highlight that the HBeXB analogue exhibits stronger binding. Together, these results form the foundation for future studies concerning hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds in close proximity.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and two&#8208;dimensional chiral surface self&#8208;assembly of a novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated system with three&#8208;fold symmetry: Benzotri(7&#8208;azaindole)</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of a novel expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely benzotri(7&#8208;azaindole), BTAI, is reported. Its C  3h  symmetry along with the integration of six complementary donor and acceptor N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonds in the conjugated structure promote the 2D self&#8208;assembly on Au(111) over extended areas.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a novel expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely benzotri(7&#8208;azaindole), BTAI, is reported. Its C  3h  symmetry along with the integration of six complementary donor and acceptor N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonds in the conjugated structure promote the 2D self&#8208;assembly on Au(111) over extended areas.

      <title>Giant Optical Anisotropy in the UV&#8208;Transparent 2D Nonlinear Optical Material Sc(IO3)2(NO3)</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringence is a fundamental optical property for linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Thus far, it has proved to be very difficult to engineer large birefringence in optical crystals functioning in the UV region. Herein, we report the first 2D rare&#8208;earth iodate&#8208;nitrate crystal Sc(IO3)2(NO3) (SINO), which is shown to exhibit giant optical anisotropy. Air&#8208;stable SINO possesses a short UV absorption edge (298 nm), a strong NLO response (4.0 times that of benchmark KH2PO4) for the nitrate family, and the largest birefringence (&#916;n&#160;= 0.348 at 546 nm) of inorganic oxide optical crystals. The unusually large birefringence and NLO response can be attributed to an optimized 2D layered structure, combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO3]&#8722;&#160;and [NO3]&#8722;. These findings will facilitate development of UV linear and NLO materials with giant optical anisotropy, and promote their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Reaction Mechanism of Pd&#8208;catalyzed "CO&#8208;free"&#160;Carbonylation Reaction Uncovered by In&#8209;situ Spectroscopy: The Formyl Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>&#8220;CO&#8208;free&#8221; carbonylation reactions, where synthesis gas (CO/H2) is substituted by C1 surrogate molecules like formaldehyde or formic acid, have received wide spread attention in homogeneous catalysis lately. Although a broad range of organics is available via this method, still relatively little is known about the precise reaction mechanism. In this work, we used in&#8208;situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to unravel the mechanism of the alkoxycarbonylation of alkenes using different surrogate molecules. In contrast to previous hypotheses no carbon monoxide could be found during the reaction. Instead the reaction proceeds via the C&#8209;H activation of in&#8209;situ generated methyl formate. On the basis of quantitative NMR experiments, a kinetic model involving all major intermediates is built which enables the knowledge&#8208;driven optimization of the reaction. Finally, a new reaction mechanism is proposed on the basis of in&#8208;situ observed Pd&#8208;hydride, Pd&#8208;formyl and Pd&#8208;acyl species.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The development of lead&#8208;free perovskite photoelectric materials has been extensively focused in recent years. Herein, a novel one&#8208;dimensional (1D) lead&#8208;free CsMnCl  3  (H  2  O)  2  single crystal is reported with solvatochromic photoluminescence properties. Interestingly, after contacting with the N, N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAC) or N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), the crystal structure can transform from 1D CsMnCl  3  (H  2  O)  2  to 0D Cs  3  MnCl  5  and finally transformed into 0D Cs  2  MnCl  4  (H  2  O)  2  . The solvent&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformations are accompanied by loss and regaining of water of crystallization, leading to the change of the coordination number of Mn  2+  . Correspondingly, the luminescence changes from red to bright green and finally back to red emission. By fabricating a test paper containing CsMnCl  3  (H  2  O)  2  , DMAC and DMF can be detected quickly with the response time less than one minute. These results can expand potential applications for low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free perovskites.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible Light Regulated Chloride Transport Channel Inspired by Rhodopsin</title>
      <dc:description>Inspired by the light&#8208;regulating capabilities of naturally occurring rhodopsin, we have constructed a visible light regulated Cl  &#8208;  &#160;transport membrane channel&#160;based on a supramolecular&#160;host&#8208;guest interaction. A natural retinal&#160;chromophore, capable of&#160;a visible light response, is used as the&#160;guest and grafted into the artificial channel. Upon introduction of an ethyl urea derived pillar[6]arene (Urea&#8208;P6)&#160;host, threading or de&#8208;threading of the retinal and selective bonding of&#160;Cl  &#8208;  &#160;can be utilized to regulate&#160;ion transport. Based on visible light&#8208;responsiveness&#160;of the host&#8208;guest interaction,&#160;Cl  &#8208;  &#160;transport can be regulated by&#160;visible light between ON and OFF states.&#160;Visible light regulated Cl  &#8208;  &#160;transport as a chemical&#160;model permits to&#160;understand the&#160;comparable biological&#160;ion selective transport&#160;behaviors.

Based on visible light&#8208;responsiveness&#160;of the host&#8208;guest interaction,&#160;Cl  &#8208;  &#160;transport can be regulated by&#160;visible light between ON and OFF states.&#160;Visible light regulated Cl  &#8208;  &#160;transport as a chemical&#160;model permits to&#160;understand the&#160;comparable biological&#160;ion selective transport&#160;behaviors. Furthermore, this result also supplies a smart visible light responsive&#160;Cl  &#8208;  &#160;transporter, which may have applications in&#160;natural photoelectric conversion and photo&#8208;controlled&#160;delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Novel High Yield Synthesis of an Octastannacubane and a Bis(silyl) Stannylene via Reductive Elimination of a Silane</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  Thermolysis of tris(silyl) tin hydride  2  at 70 &#176;C for 3 hours results in elimination of tBu  2  MeSiH and generation of bis(silyl) stannylene  3  which dimerizes instantaneously yielding distannene  4  .  3  can be trapped by NHC  Me  yielding stannylene&#8208;NHC  Me  complex  5  . Upon heating (70 &#176;C, 24 hours)  4  yields stannyl radical  8  along with pentastannatricyclo[2.1.0.0  2,5  ]pentane  10  (ca. 30%) and traces (ca. 5%) of the novel octastannacubane  9  . Remarkably, octastannacubane  9  is produced in 70% yield by mild heating (50 &#176;C) of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrasilyldistannane  11  , along with tBu  2  MeSiH.  9  was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. Based on DFT quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations the  11  &#224;  9  transformation occurs via reductive elimination of two tBu  2  MeSiH molecules from  11  yielding a distannyne, (or its distannylene isomer), followed by its tetramerization.</dc:description>

      <title>The Network of Replication, Transcription, and Reverse Transcription of a Synthetic Genetic Cassette</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic nucleic acids, with four non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, can function as genetic materials. A comprehensive analysis of PCR amplification, transcription, reverse transcription, and cloning was done to screen for alternative genetic monomers. A small library of six modified nucleobases was selected: the modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (dZTPs) and ribonucleoside (rZTPs) triphosphates of 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;adenine, 5&#8208;chlorouracil, 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;guanine or inosine together with 5&#8208;fluorocytosine or 5&#8208;bromocytosine. The fragments composed of one to four modified nucleotides (denoted as DZA) have been successfully recognised and transcribed to natural or modified RNA (denoted as RZA) by T7 RNA polymerase. The fully modified RZA fragment could be reverse transcribed and then amplified in the presence of various dZTPs. Noticeably, modified fragments could function as genetic templates  in vivo  by encoding the 678 base pair gene of a fluorescent protein in bacteria. These results demonstrate the existence of a fully simulated genetic circuit that uses synthetic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>A 34&#8208;Electron Superatom Ag78 Cluster with Regioselective Ternary Ligands Shells and Its 2D Rhombic Superlattice Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>The coverage of surface ligands has important influence on the formation, structure and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters.  Herein, we report a 78&#8208;nuclei silver nanocluster [Ag  78  (  i  PrPhS)  30  (dppm)  10  Cl  10  ]  4+  (  SD/Ag78a  ; dppm = bis&#8208;(diphenyphosphino)methane) that is synthesized by one&#8208;pot reaction using [Ag(pz)]  n  as precursor (Hpz = pyrazole) and further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.  SD/Ag78a  shows a core&#8208;shell structure comprised of an all&#8208;metallic Ag  53  kernel surrounded by an Ag  25  discontinuous metal&#8208;organic shell. The Ag  53  kernel is an Ag  13  Inodecahedron encaged by an Ag  40  drum&#8208;like shell, while the Ag  25  shell consists of two Ag  10  S  10  P  10  Cl  5  rings and five S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples. Three types of ligands regioselectively cap on the surface of the Ag  78  nanocluster, forming diverse metal&#8208;ligand interfacial structures such as  S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples, Cl&#8208;capped Ag  3  trigons and S&#8208;capped Ag  4  tetragons.  This nanocluster is a closed&#8208;shell 34&#8208;electron superatom with +4 charge state and shows highly featured molecule&#8208;like absorption spectra in the ultraviolet&#8208;visible region with a maximum around 493 nm. The rhombic superlattice assembled from  SD/Ag78a  through intercluster C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions can be formed by a simple drop&#8208;casting treatment. This work not only reveals the complicated surface chemistry of silver nanocluster but also provides a promising ternary ligand strategy for the syntheses of them.</dc:description>
