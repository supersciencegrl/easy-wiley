         <title>Efficient Gene Silencing in Intact Plant Cells Using siRNA Delivered By Functional Graphene Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to intact plants for gene silencing mainly relies on viral vectors and  Agrobacterium&#8208;  mediated transformation due to the barrier of intact plant cell wall. Here, we reported that polymer functionalized graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONs) enable siRNA transfer into intact plant cells and bring about efficient gene silencing. We found that sheeted GONs could efficiently load siRNA to form small sized, near&#8208;spheroidal GONs&#8208;siRNA complex, which could be across the cell wall and internalize in the plant cell. The GONs&#8208;siRNA exhibited transient and strong silencing (97.2% efficiency) in plant tissues at 24 h after treatment and returned to normal level at 5 days after treatment. This method has the obvious advantages of efficient, transient, simple, stability and well biocompatibility, which should greatly stimulate the application of nanomaterials as gene&#8208;engineering tools in plant research.</dc:description>

         <title>Transmembrane Shuttling of Photosynthetically Produced Electrons to Propel Extracellular Biocatalytic Redox Reactions in a Modular Fashion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many biocatalytic redox reactions depend on the cofactor NAD(P)H, which may be provided by dedicated recycling systems. Exploiting light and water for NADPH&#8208;regeneration as it is performed, e.g., by cyanobacteria, is conceptually very appealing due to its high atom economy. However, the current use of cyanobacteria is limited, e.g. by challenging and time&#8208;consuming heterologous enzyme expression in cyanobacteria as well as limitations of substrate or product transport through the cell wall. Here we establish a transmembrane electron shuttling system propelled by the cyanobacterial photosynthesis to drive extracellular NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent redox reactions. The modular photo&#8208;electron shuttling (MPS) overcomes the need for cloning and problems associated with enzyme&#8208; or substrate&#8208;toxicity and substrate uptake. The MPS was demonstrated on four classes of enzymes with 19 enzymes and various types of substrates, reaching conversions of up to 99% and giving products with &gt;99% optical purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Homogeneous Hydrogenation of CO2&#160;and CO to Methanol: The Renaissance of Low Temperature Catalysis in the Context of the Methanol Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The traditional economy based on carbon intensive fuels and materials has led to an exponential rise in anthropogenic CO2&#160;emissions. Outpacing the natural carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2&#160;levels increased by 50% since the pre&#8208;industrial age and can be directly linked to global warming. Being at the core of the proposed&#160;methanol economypioneered by the late George A. Olah, the chemical recycling of CO2&#160;to produce methanol, a green fuel and feedstock, is a prime channel to achieve carbon neutrality. In this direction,&#160;homogeneous catalytic systems have lately been a major focus for methanol synthesis from CO2, CO and their derivatives as potential low temperature alternatives to the commercial processes.&#160;This review provides an account of this rapidly growing field over the past decade, since its resurgence in 2011. Based on the critical assessment of the progress thus far, the present key challenges in this field have been highlighted and potential directions have been suggested for practically viable applications.</dc:description>

         <title>ppm Pd&#8208;Containing Nanoparticles as Catalysts for Negishi Couplings&#8230; in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New technology is reported that enables Negishi couplings to be run under sustainable, far greener conditions. Thus, ppm Pd&#8208;containing nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed that catalyze couplings in recyclable water under very mild conditions. These heterogeneous reactions involve loadings of Pd of typically only 2500 ppm (0.25 mol %). Highly functionalized aromatic and heteroaromatic bromides readily participate, including examples taken from the Merck Informer Library indicative of the functional group tolerance associated with these couplings. Direct comparisons with existing literature routes are made. Very low residual levels of Pd in newly formed products are to be expected, as determined by ICP&#8208;MS. The reagent involved has been extensively characterized via DLS, TEM, cryo&#8208;TEM, and EDX measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Arene Activation through Iminium Ions: Product Diversity from Intramolecular Photocycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While 2&#8208;alk&#8208;&#969;&#8208;enyloxy&#8208;sustituted benzaldehydes do not display any photochemical reactivity at the arene core, the respective iminium perchlorates were found to undergo efficient reactions either upon direct irradiation (&#955; = 366 nm) or under sensitizing conditions (&#955; = 420 nm, 2.5 mol% thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one). Three pathways were found: (a) Most commonly, the reaction led to benzoxacyclic products in which the olefin in the tether underwent a formal, yet unprecedented carboformylation (13 examples, 44&#8208;99% yield). The cascade process occurred with high diastereoselectivity and was found to be stereoconvergent. (b) If a substituent resides in the 3&#8208;position of the benzene ring, a  meta  photocycloaddition was observed which produced tetracyclic skeletons with five stereogenic centers in excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (2 examples, 58&#8208;79% yield). (c) If the tether was internally substituted at the alkene, an arene photocycloaddition was avoided and azetidines were formed in an aza Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction (2 examples, 95&#8208;98% yield).</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Nanoparticles on Lipophilic Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of graphitic domains on nanographenes (NGs) for anchoring metal nanoparticles (NPs) can open the door for their applications in catalysis. Reported examples employ hydrophilic graphene oxides as substrates, making it difficult to coexist with organic substrates in organic solvents. The title NGs are metal NP&#8208;doped&#160;lipophilic NGs&#160;(M&#8208;NG1). Various metal cations form NPs with a diameter of a few to tens of nanometers on the basal plane. Owing to the lipophilic nature of&#160;NG1,&#160;M&#8208;NG1&#160;is prepared by the reduction of the basal plane with sodium in THF followed by the addition of metal salts. Au&#8208;NPs on&#160;NG1&#160;allow anchoring an organic thiol carrying an anthracene fluorophore, which is a proof of concept of composite materials utilizing the surface of NGs. The assessment of the catalytic function of&#160;Pd&#8208;NG1&#160;reveals that chlorobenzene and bromobenzene yield a coupling product, and fluorobenzene also undergoes the reactions, demonstrating the catalytic function of&#160;Pd&#8208;NG1.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Aromaticity and Open&#8208;shell Diradical Character in The Dianions of 9&#8208;Fluorenylidene Substituted Expanded Radialenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radialenes and expanded radialenes are cross&#8208;conjugated macrocycles displaying poor aromatic character. In this work, three 9&#8208;fluorenylidene substituted expanded [n]radialenes (  ER&#8208;n  ,  n  =3&#8208;5) with diacetylene spacer were synthesized and their structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and NMR spectroscopy. They all can be easily reduced into relatively stable dianions. Detailed experimental measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that their dianions (  ER&#8208;n  2&#8208;  ,  n  =3&#8208;5) are stabilized by both the aromatic fluorenyl anion substituents and the central aromatic rings with formally [4  n  +2] delocalized &#960; electrons. In addition, the dianions of the extended radialenes (  ER&#8208;4  2&#8208;  and  ER&#8208;5  2&#8208;  ) show unique open&#8208;shell diradical character with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. For comparison, their linear counterparts (  L&#8208;3  and  L&#8208;4  ) were also synthesized and their dianions exhibit very different redox and optical properties from their respective macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Strained Bi&#8208;MOF on Bismuth Oxyhalide Support with Tailored Intermediate Adsorption/Desorption Capability for Robust CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, using as&#8208;designed surface&#8208;mounted Bismuth&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) on two&#8208;dimensional BiOBr support, as an operable platform for site&#8208;specific strain engineering to tailor the intermediate adsorption/desorption capability in CO  2  photocatalytic conversion is proposed. Giant compressive strain up to 7.85% is successfully induced on the surface&#8208;mounted Bi&#8208;MOF revealed by HRTEM images and geometric phase analysis as well as in situ Raman characterization, which largely downshifts the p band center of Bi nodes and intensifies their unsaturated state. In&#8208;depth explorations are put onto p&#8208;p (Bi 6p and CO  2  /CO 2p) orbital hybridization. Taking the adsorption process as an example, the 1&#960; and 7&#963; frontier molecule orbitals of CO  2  2p for both the strain&#8208;free and strained models shifts downwards the Fermi level, indicative of fast adsorption of CO  2  . Meanwhile, strain engineering further induces new non&#8208;degenerate orbital overlapping near 1&#960; and intensified overlapping of 7&#963; orbitals, stimulating the fast activation of absorbed CO  2  molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Nanozymes for Enantioselective Biological Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a neat combination of the characteristics of enzymatic activity and nanomaterials, nanonzymes have attracted much attention. Although tremendous effort has been devoted to developing nanozymes with high catalytic activity, substrate selectivity is often overlooked in the construction of nanozymes. With the subtly evolutional structures, natural enzymes generally possess high selectivity for chiral substrates, which play important roles in biosynthesis and biomedical applications. However, rational construction of nanozymes with high enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge. In this Minireview, we overview recent advances in synthesis strategies of chiral nanozymes and their enantioselective biological catalysis. We further focus on current challenges, potential solutions and future developing trends of chiral nanozyme&#8208;based enantioselective biological catalysis. There is plenty of room to explore. This review will provide new insights into the development of chiral nanozymes and their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters in Non&#8208;Doped Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing organic    near&#8208;infrared (NIR)  luminescent materials to confront the formidable barrier of "energy gap law" remains challenging. Herein, two NIR  thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)  molecules named T&#8208;&#946;&#8208;IQD and TIQD were developed by connecting  N,N  &#8208;diphenylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;amine and triphenylamine with a novel electron withdrawing unit 6&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6  H  &#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile. It is confirmed NIR&#8208;TADF emitters  concurrent with  aggregation&#8208;induced emission effect, J&#8208;aggregate with intra&#8208; and intermolecular  CN&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, and large center&#8208;to&#8208;center distance in solid states can  boost the emissive efficiencies both in thin films and non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).  Consequently, the T&#8208;&#946;&#8208;IQD&#8208;based non&#8208;doped NIR  &#8208;OLED  achieved the  maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE  max  )  of 9.44% with emission peak at 711 nm, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for non&#8208;doped NIR&#8208;OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Transfer Pathways in Nitrogenase with and without Dissociated S2B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenase is the only enzyme that can convert N  2  &#160;to NH  3  . Crystallographic structures have indicated that one of sulfide ligands of the active&#8208;site FeMo cluster, S2B, can be replaced by an inhibitor, like CO and OH  &#8211;  , and it has been suggested that it may be displaced also during the normal reaction. We have investigated possible proton transfer pathways within the FeMo cluster during the conversion of N  2  H  2  &#160;to two molecules of NH  3  , assuming that the protons enter the cluster at the S3B, S4B or S5A sulfide ions and are then transferred to the substrate. We use combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations with the TPSS and B3LYP functionals. The calculations indicate that the barriers for these reactions are reasonable if the S2B ligand remains bound to the cluster, but they become prohibitively high if S2B has dissociated. This suggests that it is unlikely that S2B reversibly dissociates during the normal reaction cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Hexagonal Planar Nickel: A Dispersion&#8208;Stabilised Tri&#8208;Lithium Nickelate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancing the understanding of lithum nickelate complexes, here we report a family of homoleptic organonickelate complexes obtained by reacting Ni(COD)2and lithium aryl&#8208;acetylides in the presence of the bidentate donor TMEDA. These compounds represent rare examples of low&#8208;valent transition&#8208;metals supported solely by organolithium ligands. Whilst the solid&#8208;state structures indicate a hexagonal planar geometry around Ni(0) with Ni&#8211;Li bonds, bonding analysis via QTAIM, NCI, NBO and ELI methods reveals that the Ni&#8211;Li interactions are repulsive in nature, characterising these complexes as tri&#8208;coordinated. London dispersion forces between TMEDA and the organic substituents on nickel are found to play a crucial role in the stabilisation and thus isolation of these complexes. Preliminary reactivity studies demonstrate that the homoleptic lithium nickelates undergo stoichiometric cross&#8208;coupling with PhI to give dinickel clusters containing both anionic acetylide and neutral alkyne ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Physical and Chemical Cues at Nano&#8208;bio Interface for Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunomodulation has made remarkable achievements in fighting against infectious disease and cancer. Conventionally, immunomodulation largely relied on chemical/biochemical agents which, unfortunately, suffer from sever off&#8208;target adverse effects. Recent understandings on nano&#8208;bio interactions suggest that nanomaterials per se can directly participate in immunomodulation. A range of physical and chemical cues at nano&#8208;bio interface have been harnessed to regulate diverse immuno&#8208;signaling for disease control and treatment. In this Minireview, we summarize recent studies of the physical and chemical cues enabled by intrinsic nanomaterials that trigger immunological signaling. Firstly, we discuss physical cues mediated by surface topography, hydrophobicity, charge and heat at nano&#8208;bio interface for immunomodulation. Secondly, various chemical cues, such as metal species and oxidative species are outlined. Finally, our perspectives on the challenge and possible future directions are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence Lifetime Imaging Based on Lanthanide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging has served as a primary method to collect information about complexed environments, providing detailed visualization of various entities with high clarity and differentiation. As an important branch of optical imaging, luminescence lifetime imaging exhibits significant advantages over traditional optical imaging in terms of precise quantification because of the intrinsic stability of luminescence lifetime. However, luminescence lifetime imaging based on traditional small molecular fluorophores with short lifetimes is not ideally suitable in some scenarios, such as  in vivo  imaging and multiplexed detection, where autofluorescence lifetimes in the same magnitude as molecular fluorophores would significantly interfere with the accurate detection of these probes. Thereby, great emphasis has been recently put into the exploration of lanthanide doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) with long&#8208;lived luminescence and easily tunable lifetimes. The long luminescence lifetime of LnNPs not only makes it easier to filter background signal during imaging, but also provides a wide lifetime tunable range while requiring less complexity in imaging system. In this review, we first introduced the luminescence mechanisms of LnNPs. Then the key technologies including luminescence lifetime modulation and data acquisition of LnNPs were discussed in&#8208;depth. Several cutting&#8208;edge applications in the luminescence lifetime imaging system were introduced as well. Last part covered our prospects to inspire elaborate efforts for improved technologies and extended applications of luminescence lifetime imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Barium Hydride Mediates Dinitrogen Fixation and Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated dinitrogen fixation has been intensively investigated. The employment of main group elements for this vital reaction recently aroused increasing interest because of new dinitrogen reaction chemistry. Herein, we report ammonia synthesis via a chemical looping process mediated by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free barium hydride (BaH  2  ). Experimental and computational studies reveal that the introduction of hydrogen vacancies is essential for creating coordinatively unsaturated multi&#8208;Ba sites for N  2  activation. The adjacent lattice hydridic hydrogen (H&#8254;) then undergoes both reductive elimination and reductive protonation to convert N  2  to NH  x  . The ammonia production rate supports this hydride&#8208;vacancy mechanism via a chemical looping route that is far exceeding that of a catalytic process. The BaH  2  &#8208;mediated chemical looping process has prospects for the future development toward ammonia synthesis using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atroposelective synthesis of atropisomers with vicinal diaxes remains rare and challenging, due to the steric influence between the two axes and their unique topology. Herein, we disclose a single&#8208;step construction of atropisomers with vicinal C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N chiral diaxes by cyclopentadiene (Cp)&#8208;free cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective C&#8208;H annulation, providing the desired diaxial atropisomers of unique structures with decent stereocontrols of both axes (up to &gt;99% ee and 70:1 dr). The optically pure products bearing fluorophores show circular polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, being candidate materials for potential CPL applications. Atropisomerization experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to study the rotational barriers and rotation pathways of the diaxes.</dc:description>

         <title>Green and Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performance Biocatalysts Using Covalent Organic Frameworks as Enzyme Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme immobilization is essential to the commercial viability of various critical large&#8208;scale biocatalytic processes. However, vast challenges remain for the immobilization systems, such as difficulties in loading large enzymes, enzyme leaching, and limitations for large&#8208;scale fabrication. Herein, we describe a green and scalable strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance biocatalysts through in situ assembly of enzymes with covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under ambient conditions (aqueous solution and room temperature). The obtained biocatalysts possess exceptional reusability and stability and serve as efficient biocatalysts for important industrial reactions that cannot be efficiently catalyzed by free enzymes or traditional enzyme immobilization systems. Notably, this versatile enzyme immobilization platform is applicable to various COFs and enzymes. The reactions in an aqueous solution occurred within a short timeframe (ca. 10&#8211;30 min) and could be scaled up readily (ca. 2.3 g per reaction).</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Theranostic Prodrug with Self&#8208;Sustainable Magnification Effect of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow theranostic prodrug that circumvents high background noise interference caused by external light excitation. The prodrug can release hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) in response to the high intratumoral peroxynitrite level associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD), and synchronously activate afterglow signal to monitor the drug release process and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor transformation. The prodrug itself is an ICD inducer achieved by photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT initiates ICD and recruits first&#8208;arrived neutrophils to secrete peroxynitrite to trigger HCPT release. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that HCPT can significantly amplify PDT&#8208;mediated ICD process. The prodrug thus shows a self&#8208;sustainable ICD magnification effect by establishing an &#8220;ICD&#8208;HCPT release&#8208;amplified ICD&#8221; cycling loop. In vivo studies demonstrate that prodrug can eradicate existing tumor and prevent further tumor recurrence through antitumor immune response.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxalate Oxidase for In Situ H2O2&#8208;generation in Unspecific Peroxygenase&#8208;Catalysed Drug Oxyfunctionalisations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H  2  O  2  &#8208;driven enzymes are of great interest for industrial biotransformations. Herein, we show for the first time that oxalate oxidase (OXO) is an efficient  in situ  source of H  2  O  2  for one of these biocatalysts, which is known as unspecific peroxygenase (UPO). OXO is reasonably robust, produces only CO  2  as a by&#8208;product and uses oxalate as a cheap sacrificial electron donor. UPO has significant potential as an industrial catalyst for selective C&#8208;H oxyfunctionalisations, as we confirm herein by testing a diverse drug panel using miniaturised high&#8208;throughput assays and mass spectrometry. 33 out of 64 drugs were converted in 5 &#181;L&#8208;scale reactions by the UPO with OXO (conversion &gt;70% for 11 drugs). Furthermore, oxidation of the drug tolmetin was achieved on a 50 mg scale (TON  UPO  25,664) with 84% yield, which was further improved via enzyme immobilization. This one&#8208;pot approach ensures adequate H  2  O  2  levels, enabling rapid access to industrially relevant molecules that are difficult to obtain by other routes.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic&#8208;Sieving of Carbon Dioxide from Acetylene through a Novel Sulfonic Ultramicroporous Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The engineering and tailoring of porous materials to realize the precise discrimination of CO2 and C2H2, with almost identical kinetic diameters, is a challenging task. We herein report the first example of the kinetic&#8208;sieving of relatively larger molecule of C2H2 from CO2 by a novel sulfonic anion&#8208;pillared hybrid ultramicroporous materials of ZU&#8208;610a. Specifically, ZU&#8208;610 constructed from copper(II), isonicotinic acid and 1,2&#8208;ethanedisulfonic acid is synthesized and shows the preferential affinity for C2H2 over CO2. After the post&#8208;synthetic heat treatment of ZU&#8208;610, ZU&#8208;610a with a contracted aperture is obtained. Interestingly, the C2H2&#8208;selctive ZU&#8208;610 was reversed to the CO2&#8208;selective ZU&#8208;610a. High purity C2H2 (&gt;99.5 %) could be directly obtained from the dynamic breakthrough experiments on an equimolar C2H2/ CO2 mixture at 298 K. This study provides guidance for the design of adsorbents aimed at separation systems with similar kinetic diameter.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt/Salox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dehydrogenative C&#8211;H Alkoxylation and Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The past decade has witnessed a rapid progress in asymmetric C&#8211;H activation. However, the enantioselective C&#8211;H alkoxylation and amination with alcohols and free amines remains elusive. Herein, we disclose the first enantioselective dehydrogenative C&#8211;H alkoxylation and amination enabled by a simple cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalysis. The use of cheap and readily available cobalt(II) salts as catalysts and Saloxs as chiral ligands provides an efficient method to access  P  &#8208;stereogenic compounds in excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee). The practicality of this protocol is demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale preparation and further derivatizations of the resulting  P  &#8208;stereogenic phosphinamides, which offering a flexible asymmetric alternative to access  P  &#8208;stereogenic mono&#8208; and diphosphine chiral ligands. Preliminary mechanistic studies on the enantioselective C&#8211;H alkoxylation reaction suggest that a cobalt(III/IV/II) catalytic cycle might be involved.</dc:description>

The practicality of this protocol is demonstrated by gram-scale preparation and further derivatizations of the resulting  P  -stereogenic phosphinamides, which offering a flexible asymmetric alternative to access  P  -stereogenic mono- and diphosphine chiral ligands. Preliminary mechanistic studies on the enantioselective C&#8211;H alkoxylation reaction suggest that a cobalt(III/IV/II) catalytic cycle might be involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimetallic Catalysis in Stereodivergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an efficient strategy for the development of new chemical reactions. Importantly, this strategy also provides a simple and powerful platform for stereodivergent synthesis in which all possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters could be easily prepared from the same set of starting materials. In this minireview, the development of stereodivergent allylic substitution, propargylic substitution, hydrofunctionalization, and annulation based on bimetallic catalysis has been summarized. It is expected that more novel bimetallic catalytic systems will be developed and applied for the stereodivergent synthesis of valuable molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In a series of n&#8208;type semiconducting naphthalene tetracarboxydiimide (NDI)&#8208;dithiophene (T2) copolymers, structural and electronic properties trends are systematically evaluated as the number of NDI carbonyl groups is reduced from 4 in NDI to 3 in NBL (1&#8208;amino&#8208;4,5&#8208;8&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;tricarboxylic acid&#8208;1,8&#8208;lactam&#8208;4,5&#8208;imide) to 2 in NBA (naphthalene&#8208;bis(4,8&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,5&#8208;dicarboxyl)&#8208;amide). As the NDI&#8208;T2 backbone torsional angle falls the LUMO energy rises. However, the thienyl attachment regiochemistry also plays an important role in less symmetric NBL and NBA. Electron mobility is greatest for N2200 (0.17 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1) followed by PNBL&#8208;3,8&#8208;T2 and PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 (0.11 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1), 0.02 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 in PNBL&#8208;4,8&#8208;T2, and negligible in PNBA&#8208;3,7&#8208;T2. Charge transport reflects a delicate balance between electronic backbone communication (optimum for N2200 and PNBL&#8208;4,8&#8208;T2), backbone planarity (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 and PNBL&#8208;3,8&#8208;T2), LUMO energy (optimum for N2200), &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2), and film crystallinity (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 and N2200).

         <title>Ring&#8208;to&#8208;Thread Chirality Transfer in [2]Rotaxanes for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of chiral mechanically interlocked molecules is attracting a lot of attention in the last years, with applications in different fields, such as asymmetric catalysis or sensing. Herein we describe the synthesis of orientational mechanostereoisomers, which include a benzylic amide macrocycle with a stereogenic center, and non&#8208;symmetric  N  &#8208;(arylmethyl)fumaramides as the axis. The base&#8208;promoted cyclization of the initial fumaramide thread allows the obtention of enantioenriched value&#8208;added compounds, like lactams of different ring sizes and aminoacids. The chiral information is effectively transmitted across the mechanical bond from the encircling ring to the interlocked lactam. High levels of enantioselectivity and full control of the regioselectivity of the final cyclic compounds are attained.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High oxidation&#8208;state carbonyl coupling partners including esters and lactones were reacted with enones to give aldol&#8208;type products directly using two&#8208;fold organoborane catalysis.

         <title>Framework Adaptability and Concerted Structural Response in a Bismuth Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalyst.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly robust bismuth MOF shows an unusual concerted structural response involving changes in inorganic building units upon binding of guest species at different sites. The MOF is an active catalyst for the Strecker reaction.







Abstract
Bismuth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as heterogeneous catalysts are scarce, and there is little knowledge on the influence of the MOF features on their resulting activity and behavior. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity in the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Strecker reaction with ketones of three new MOFs prepared with the combination of indium or bismuth and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;methanetetrayltetrabenzoic acid. One of them, denoted BiPF&#8208;7, is very robust and chemically stable, and demonstrates a high activity in the formation of the desired &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles. The interaction of the catalytic substrates with the metal centers in this MOF has been crystallographically characterized, showcasing a concerted framework adaptability process that involves structural changes in framework components that are not directly involved in the binding of the guests.

         <title>A Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide with Ultra&#8208;Microporosity for Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation at High Temperature and Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;microporous zeolitic octahedral metal oxide is used for CO2 capture over C2H2 to obtain highly pure C2H2 directly. The material not only shows high separation performance at low temperatures but also at high temperatures and humidities.







Abstract
Separation of CO2/C2H2 to obtain pure C2H2 presents a challenge for the chemical industry. CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents are favored because of the convenient separation process. However, there are only a few CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents that can effectively isolate CO2 from CO2/C2H2, and there is almost no research on CO2/C2H2 separation under harsh conditions, such as with high temperatures and humidities. Herein, a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalates is utilized for separations of CO2/C2H2 at high temperatures and humidities. Single gas adsorption measurements show that the material only adsorbs CO2 with almost no C2H2 taken up. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates CO2/C2H2, and highly pure C2H2 is obtained directly. The robust material maintains a high separation performance at 333&#8197;K with 18.12&#8201;% water. The high stability of the material enables reuse without loss of separation performance.

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-microporous zeolitic octahedral metal oxide is used for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture over C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain highly pure C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly. The material not only shows high separation performance at low temperatures but also at high temperatures and humidities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain pure C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; presents a challenge for the chemical industry. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-selective adsorbents are favored because of the convenient separation process. However, there are only a few CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-selective adsorbents that can effectively isolate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and there is almost no research on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation under harsh conditions, such as with high temperatures and humidities. Herein, a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on &#1013;-Keggin polyoxometalates is utilized for separations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at high temperatures and humidities. Single gas adsorption measurements show that the material only adsorbs CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with almost no C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; taken up. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and highly pure C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained directly. The robust material maintains a high separation performance at 333&#8197;K with 18.12&#8201;% water. The high stability of the material enables reuse without loss of separation performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cocrystallization Enabled Spatial Self&#8208;Confinement Approach to Synthesize Crystalline Porous Metal Oxide Nanosheets for Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general cocrystallization induced spatial self&#8208;confinement approach has been developed to synthesize crystalline porous two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanosheets. The mechanism is proposed and various crystalline porous metal oxides nanosheets can be obtained. The resulting crystalline porous CeO2/SnO2 nanosheets show exceptional sensing performance towards 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone.







Abstract
Crystalline metal oxide nanosheets show exceptional catalytic performance owing to the large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and quantum confinement effect. However, it is still a challenge to develop a facile and general method to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Herein, we report a cocrystallization induced spatial self&#8208;confinement approach to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Taking the synthesis of SnO2 as an example, the solvent evaporation from KCl and SnCl2 solution induces the cocrystallization of KCl and K2SnCl6, and the obtained composite with encapsulated K2SnCl6 can be in situ converted into SnO2 nanosheets confined in KCl matrix, after water washing to remove KCl, porous SnO2 nanosheets can be obtained. Notably, a series of metal oxide nanosheets can be obtained through this general and efficient green route. In particular, porous CeO2/SnO2 nanosheets with improved surface O&#8722; species and abundant oxygen vacancies exhibit superior gas sensing performance to 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone.

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Highly Efficient High Salinity Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polyzwitterionic hydrogel as highly efficient solar evaporator is developed for high&#8208;salinity solar desalination. The hydrogel evaporator could achieve a rapid solar evaporation rate of 4.14&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with high energy efficiency (&#8776;94&#8201;%) in 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% brine. This tactful designed polyzwitterionic hydrogel offers insight to design next&#8208;generation solar evaporators for high&#8208;salinity brine.







Abstract
Interfacial solar vapor generation (SVG) is regarded as a promising and sustainable strategy for clean water production. While many materials have demonstrated excellent evaporation rates under one sun, it remains challenging to design solar evaporators without compromising SVG performance in high&#8208;salinity brines (&#8805;10&#8197;wt&#8201;%). Herein, polyzwitterionic hydrogels (PZHs) are proposed as a novel platform for high&#8208;salinity solar desalination. Taking advantage of the unique anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, PZHs can trap salt ions from the brine water to form a more hydrated polymer network, leading to enhanced SVG performance. PZHs exhibit an exceptional solar evaporation rate of 4.14&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% brine, which is &#8776;20&#8201;% higher than that in pure water. It is anticipated that salt&#8208;responsive PZHs may provide insights for the design of next&#8208;generation solar desalination systems.

         <title>Diborylmethyl Group as a Transformable Building Block for the Diversification of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We established an efficient protocol for the preparation of halo&#8208;diborylmethanes and their use in homologative coupling with nitrogen nucleophiles to generate various nitrogen&#8208;substituted diborylmethanes. The diborylmethyl group installed onto the nitrogen atom served as a versatile synthetic handle, allowing for the programmed diversification of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
The development of new approaches to installing diverse carbon fragments to a nitrogen atom has attracted considerable attention in chemical science. While numerous strategies have been devised to forge C(sp3)&#8722;N bonds, one conceptually powerful and straightforward approach is to insert a transformable sp3&#8208;carbon unit onto a nitrogen atom for modular diversification. Here we describe the successful synthesis of halo&#8208;diborylmethanes and their applications to the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;substituted diborylmethanes through their homologative coupling with a variety of nitrogen nucleophiles including biologically relevant molecules. This process exhibits a remarkably broad substrate scope, and the usefulness of the obtained compounds is demonstrated by the modular diversification of the diborylmethyl group to access various nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Crystal Structure Based Mutagenesis of Cattleyene Synthase Leads to the Generation of Rearranged Polycyclic Diterpenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of the diterpene synthase CyS was solved, providing the structural basis for cattleyene biosynthesis. A CySC59A mutant generated diterpenes with novel carbon skeletons. The remarkable cyclization mechanism of one of these products was characterized by isotopic labeling experiments.







Abstract
The crystal structures of cattleyene synthase (apo&#8208;CyS), and CyS complexed with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) were solved. The CySC59A variant exhibited an increased production of cattleyene and other diterpenes with diverse skeletons. Its structure showed a widened active site cavity explaining the relaxed selectivity. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed a remarkable cyclization mechanism involving several skeletal rearrangements for one of the novel diterpenes.

         <title>One&#8208;For&#8208;All Polyolefin Functionalization: Active Ester as Gateway to Combine Insertion Polymerization with ROP, NMP, and RAFT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyolefin active ester exchange (PACE) process was developed for polyolefin&#8208;containing block copolymer synthesis and serves as a bridge connecting coordination&#8211;insertion polymerization to multiple controlled polymerization methods. As reported by Krzysztof Matyjaszewski, Eva Harth et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205931), PACE allows for the synthesis of hybrid materials which comprise olefins and ester, styrene, vinylic, acrylate, and acrylamide segments with a broad window for tunability. Nano&#8208;objects with higher&#8208;order morphologies can be obtained directly via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA.

Realizing efficient and ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence is highly desirable in chemistry and materials fields. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202208735), Yan et&#8197;al. report highly efficient and direct ultralong all&#8208; phosphorescence from transparent MOF glasses which are made by a bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly strategy. This work provides an alternative way to synthesize new MOF glasses with highly efficient utilization of triplet excitons and extends the function of color&#8208;tunable ultralong RTP into advanced photonic applications.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis between a Dipeptide Phosphonium Salt and a Metal&#8208;Based Lewis Acid for Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Bridged [3.2.1] Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic catalysis of a dipeptide phosphonium salt and a Lewis acid is reported by Zhishan Su, Tianli Wang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207334) for the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;bridged [3.2.1] ring systems. The picture shows the key transition state of the reaction, with the phosphonium salt placed on the left top, and the substrates of vinyl sulfone and cyclic imine on the left and right bottom, respectively. The silver nitrite in the center connects the catalyst and substrate with &#8220;lightnings&#8221; that symbolize hydrogen&#8208;bonding and coordination interactions. Via the transition state, the product &#8220;flies out&#8221; and appears on the right top.

         <title>Like Recycles Like: Selective Ring&#8208;Closing Depolymerization of Poly(L&#8211;Lactic Acid) to L&#8211;Lactide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Closed&#8208;loop recycling of poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) to L&#8208;lactide (LLA) was enabled owing to specific solvent interactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202204531), Karin Odelius and co&#8208;workers show how the ceiling temperature (Tc) depends on, not only concentration, but also on solvent properties. This was utilized to lower the recycling temperature of PLLA, resulting in direct ring&#8208;closing depolymerization of high molecular weight PLLA to the cyclic monomer LLA with high yield and high selectivity.

         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Aluminum Coordination Environments in Mordenite Zeolite and Their Role in the Dimethyl Ether (DME) Carbonylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Part of tetrahedral framework aluminum in a protonic mordenite (HMOR) will convert geometry to distorted tetrahedral and octahedral coordination. High&#8208;field 27Al NMR data show that more framework Al atoms at T3 and T4 sites change geometry to nonframework structures than others. These nonframework Al species preferentially reside in the side pockets, which will decrease the accessibility of acid sites in the 8&#8208;membered ring (MR) channel, impairing the dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation reaction. The arisen octahedrally coordinated Al species are framework&#8208;associated, which can be reverted into the zeolite framework. Herein, we find that a facile treatment with pyridine could force the octahedral coordination Al back into a tetrahedral environment, which could increase the number of available active sites and enhance the diffusion of DME, thus improving the reactivity (4 times) of the DME carbonylation reaction and prolonging the lifetime of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;in&#8208;One Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Long&#8208;Lived Luminescent Systems Based on Pyrene&#8208;Doped Amorphous Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived luminescent systems are developed based on pyrene&#8208;doped polymers, where the phosphorescence exhibits radiation&#8208;, concentration&#8208;, time&#8208;, and excitation&#8208;dependent characteristics at the same time.







Abstract
Materials exhibiting ultralong luminescent lifetime show promising applications in the fields of information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging. Herein, we present a low&#8208;cost and general strategy to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) based on pyrene chromophores doped into polymer matrices. The UOP of the resulted systems presents radiation&#8208;, concentration&#8208;, time&#8208;, and excitation&#8208;dependent characteristics. The UOP color can be turned from blue to red by changing the excitation wavelength or the concentration of chromophores. Experimental results prove that these characteristics are attributed to the consumption of triplet oxygen and the different aggregation states of chromophores in the polymer matrices. Finally, we demonstrate that these systems could be applied for multilevel information encryption. This work would promote further development of multi&#8208;responsive long&#8208;lived luminescent materials.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Shell Engineering of a Au28 Nanocluster Boosts Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboranethiolate&#8208;protected gold nanocluster Au28&#8208;S was fabricated by a facile self&#8208;reducing synthesis. Au28&#8208;S has an identical metal core to the reported Au28&#8208;C but different peripheral ligands. This ligand&#8208;shell tailoring led to obvious differences in their electronic structures and optical properties. Compared to Au28&#8208;C, Au28&#8208;S shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Subtle tailoring of gold nanoclusters (NCs) could significantly change their physicochemical properties. However, direct comparison of the catalytic performance of gold NCs with identical metal cores but distinct ligand shells is rarely elucidated. In this work, a novel gold NC, Au28(C2B10H11S)12(tht)4Cl4 (Au28&#8208;S), was isolated by a facile self&#8208;reducing synthesis. Au28&#8208;S adopts an identical Au28 metal framework to that of the reported alkynyl&#8208;protected Au28&#8208;C. The different protective layers lead to distinctions in their electronic structure and optical properties. Furthermore, Au28&#8208;S shows better catalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. Theoretical calculations identified the active sites and shed light on the catalytic mechanism to elucidate the different catalytic performances. This work provides an ideal platform to study the protective layer&#8208;activity relationship of gold NCs, and may also provide guidance in the design of metal NC&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Imide&#8208;Functionalized Fluorenone and Its Cyanated Derivative Based n&#8208;Type Polymers: Synthesis, Structure&#8211;Property Correlations, and Thin&#8208;Film Transistor Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imide&#8208;functionalization of fluorenone and its cyanated derivative afforded new acceptors FOI and FCNI, respectively, featuring excellent solubility, high planarity, and low&#8208;lying LUMO, which enabled the resulting polymers with unique n&#8208;type transport character in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. The design strategy and synthetic routes to FOI and FCNI are highly informative for the further development of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks for n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with optimized physicochemical properties. By meticulously installing an imide group onto fluorene and its cyanated derivative, we report here two very electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, imide&#8208;functionalized fluorenone (FOI) and its cyanated derivative (FCNI), both featuring a deep&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level down to &#8722;4.05&#8197;eV and highly coplanar framework, endowing them ideal units for constructing n&#8208;type polymers. Thus, a series of polymers are built from them, exhibiting unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with a highest electron mobility of 0.11&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Hence, FOI and FCNI offer a remarkable platform for accessing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers and the imide functionalization of appropriate (hetero)arenes is a powerful strategy for developing polymers with deep&#8208;lying LUMOs for n&#8208;type organic electronics.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Melanin&#8211;Protein&#8211;Fe/Cu Conjugates Derived from Norepinephrine as Reliable Models for Neuromelanin of Human Brain Locus Coeruleus</title>

         <dc:description>
Melanin&#8211;protein conjugates derived from norepinephrine fibrillar &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin were synthesized as soluble models of neuromelanin from human brain locus coeruleus. This pigment contains a significant amount of iron and copper. The synthetic models show that the two metals exhibit a strong tendency to remain coupled to each other in dinuclear or multinuclear aggregates.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble melanin&#8208;protein&#8208;Fe/Cu conjugates derived from norepinephrine and fibrillar &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin are reliable models for neuromelanin (NM) of human brain locus coeruleus. Both iron and copper promote catecholamine oxidation and exhibit strong tendency to remain coupled in oligonuclear aggregates. The Fe&#8208;Cu clusters are EPR silent and affect the 1H NMR spectra of the conjugates through a specific sequence of signals. Derivatives containing only Fe or Cu exhibit different NMR patterns. The EPR spectra show weak signals of paramagnetic FeIII in conjugates containing Fe or mixed Fe&#8208;Cu sites due to small amounts of mononuclear centers. The latter derivatives exhibit EPR signals for isolated CuII centers. These features parallel the EPR behavior of NM from locus coeruleus. The spectral data indicate that FeIII is bound to the melanic fraction, whereas CuII is bound on the protein fibrils, suggesting that the Fe&#8208;Cu clusters occur at the interface between the two components of the synthetic NMs.

         <title>Access to Unexplored 3D Chemical Space: cis&#8208;Selective Arene Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of Saturated Cyclic Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel and unexplored saturated cyclic boronic acids were synthesized using an arene hydrogenation methodology. Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cis&#8208;selective hydrogenation of biologically important molecules comprising benzoxaborole, benzoxaborinin, and benzoxaboripin&#8208;derivatives is reported. The utility of the synthesized molecules was shown by their high tendency to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding and molecular recognition under physiological conditions.







Abstract
A new class of saturated boron&#8208;incorporated cyclic molecules has been synthesized employing an arene&#8208;hydrogenation methodology. cis&#8208;Selective hydrogenation of easily accessible, and biologically important molecules comprising benzoxaborole, benzoxaborinin, and benzoxaboripin derivatives is reported. Among the various catalysts tested, rhodium cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene [Rh&#8208;CAAC] (1) pre&#8208;catalyst revealed the best hydrogenation activity confirming turnover number up to 1400 with good to high diastereoselectivity. A broad range of functional groups was tolerated including sensitive substituents such as &#8722;F, &#8722;CF3, and &#8722;silyl groups. The utility of the synthesized products was demonstrated by the recognition of diols and sugars under physiological conditions. These motifs can have a substantial importance in medicinal chemistry as they possess a three&#8208;dimensional structure, are highly stable, soluble in water, form hydrogen bonds, and interact with diols and sugars.

Among the various catalysts tested, rhodium cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene [Rh-CAAC] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) pre-catalyst revealed the best hydrogenation activity confirming turnover number up to 1400 with good to high diastereoselectivity. A broad range of functional groups was tolerated including sensitive substituents such as &#8722;F, &#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and &#8722;silyl groups. The utility of the synthesized products was demonstrated by the recognition of diols and sugars under physiological conditions. These motifs can have a substantial importance in medicinal chemistry as they possess a three-dimensional structure, are highly stable, soluble in water, form hydrogen bonds, and interact with diols and sugars.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethylene in a Solid Oxide Electrolyser Based on Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline CeO2 Monoliths</title>

The selective conversion of CH4 to C2H4 at the anode and the electrolysis of CO2 to CO at the cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser is presented. Well&#8208;defined interfaces were constructed that function as three&#8208;phase boundaries by exsolving single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths.







Abstract
Catalytic conversion of CH4 to C2H4 plays an important role in the light olefin industry. Here, we report the electrochemical conversion of CH4 to C2H4/C2H6 at the anode with the electrolysis of CO2 to CO at the cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser. We constructed well&#8208;defined interfaces that function as three&#8208;phase boundaries by exsolving single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths. We engineered the chemical states and flux of active oxygen species for the oxidation of CH4 at the anode by controlling voltage and temperature. We show the unprecedented C2 selectivity (C2H4 and C2H6) of &#8805;99.5&#8201;% at a CH4 conversion of &#8776;7&#8201;%. The electrolyser exhibits excellent durability without performance degradation being observed in a continuous operation of 100&#8197;hours. Our work enables a novel path for the selective conversion of CH4/CO2 into useful chemicals, and the technique of building well&#8208;defined interfaces may find potential applications in other fields.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Overproduction of Biofuels in Microorganisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photo&#8208;biosynthesis system was constructed for the overproduction of jet fuel farnesene by interfacing engineered E.&#8197;coli with persistent phosphor mesoporous Al2O3 (meso&#8208;Al2O3). meso&#8208;Al2O3 with rich defects prolonged the lifetime of photo&#8208;excited electrons that were passed to E.&#8197;coli and improved the farnesene production by a factor of over 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Microbial cell factories reinvigorate current industries by producing complex fine chemicals at low costs. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is the main reducing power to drive the biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms. However, insufficient intrinsic NADPH limits the productivity of microorganisms. Here, we report that supplying microorganisms with long&#8208;lived electrons from persistent phosphor mesoporous Al2O3 (meso&#8208;Al2O3) can elevate the NADPH level to facilitate efficient fine chemical production. The defects in meso&#8208;Al2O3 were demonstrated to be highly efficient in prolonging electrons&#8217; lifetime. The long&#8208;lived electrons in meso&#8208;Al2O3 can pass the material&#8211;microorganism interface and power the biosynthetic pathways of E.&#8197;coli to produce jet fuel farnesene. This work represents a reliable strategy to design photo&#8208;biosynthesis systems to improve the productivity of microorganisms with solar energy.

         <title>Aminal&#8208;Linked Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Framework for Rapid Photocatalytic Decontamination of Mustard&#8208;Gas Simulant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aminal&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF) was synthesized to detoxify the mustard&#8208;gas simulant 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES). Compared with imine&#8208;linked Por&#8208;COF, Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF demonstrates higher photooxidation of CEES into 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO). The COF linkages contribute to an intersystem crossing process and enhance the photochemical properties of the catalyst.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are appealing photocatalysts for toxic chemical degradation. Great efforts have been devoted to regulate the photocatalytic performance of COFs by tuning their organic building blocks, but the relationship between COF linkage and photochemical properties has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a novel aminal&#8208;linked porphyrinic COF, namely Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF. Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF (0.25&#8197;mol&#8201;%) showed excellent photocatalytic activity toward the detoxification of the sulfur mustard simulant with a half&#8208;life (t1/2) of 5&#8197;min, which is far lower than that of traditional imine&#8208;linked Por&#8208;COF (t1/2=16&#8197;min). Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the aminal linkages of Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF facilitated the intersystem crossing process. Thus, Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF showed higher triplet&#8208;state generation efficiency compared with Por&#8208;COF, consequently promoting the activation of oxygen molecular to singlet oxygen.

         <title>Electrostatic Secondary&#8208;Sphere Interactions That Facilitate Rapid and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic secondary&#8208;sphere interactions provide precise and systematic control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic CO2 reduction selectivity and activity in a Fe&#8208;porphyrin based MOF. Specifically, we show that MOFs allow the incorporation of molecular catalysts and positively&#8208;charged ligands one next to the other, in a manner which promotes catalysis by stabilization of reactive intermediates during electrochemical reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising platforms for heterogeneous tethering of molecular CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Yet, to further understand electrocatalytic MOF systems, one also needs to consider their capability to fine&#8208;tune the immediate chemical environment of the active site, and thus affect its overall catalytic operation. Here, we show that electrostatic secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities enable substantial improvement of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity and selectivity. In situ Raman analysis reveal that immobilization of pendent positively&#8208;charged groups adjacent to MOF&#8208;residing Fe&#8208;porphyrin catalysts, stabilize weakly&#8208;bound CO intermediates, allowing their rapid release as catalytic products. Also, by varying the electrolyte's ionic strength, systematic regulation of electrostatic field magnitude was achieved, resulting in essentially 100&#8201;% CO selectivity. Thus, this concept provides a sensitive molecular&#8208;handle that adjust heterogeneous electrocatalysis on demand.

         <title>Nitric&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Releasing aza&#8208;BODIPY: A New Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregate with Multiple Antibacterial Modalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent attachment of nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing N&#8208;nitrosamine moieties to aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives affords the first NO&#8208;releasing NIR J&#8208;aggregate of BDP&#8208;NO. The delicate modulation of the aggregation states of BDP&#8208;NO enables different antibacterial modalities, and the combination of NO release and photothermal therapy (PTT) can synergistically treat MRSA infections while attenuating PTT&#8208;associated inflammatory responses.







Abstract
The development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) J&#8208;aggregates has received increasing attention due to their broad applications. Here, we report the nitrosation of an amine&#8208;containing aza&#8208;BODIPY precursor (BDP&#8208;NH2), affording the first nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing NIR J&#8208;aggregate (BDP&#8208;NO). The introduction of N&#8208;nitrosamine moieties efficiently inhibits the aromatic interactions of BDP&#8208;NH2, which instead promotes the formation of J&#8208;aggregates within micellar nanoparticles with a remarkable bathochromic shift of &#8776;109&#8197;nm to the NIR window (820&#8197;nm). Interestingly, the NO release and photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) can be delicately tuned by the loading contents of BDP&#8208;NO within micellar nanoparticles, thereby enabling multiple antibacterial modalities by exploring either NO release, photothermal therapy (PTT), or both. We demonstrate the combination of NO and PTT can elevate antibacterial activity while attenuating PTT&#8208;associated inflammation for the in vivo treatment of MRSA infection.

         <title>Collective Total Syntheses of Five Lycopodium Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective total syntheses of five Lycopodium alkaloids were accomplished in an enantioselective and protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. The syntheses included a gold&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8211;alkyne cycloisomerization and the establishment of skeletal diversification approaches at different reactive sites of the tricyclic skeleton to achieve divergent total syntheses of Lycopodium alkaloids.







Abstract
It is reported herein that by exploiting the commonly shared bicyclic decahydroquinoline motif, a gold&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8211;alkyne cycloisomerization reaction is developed to access tricyclic cores in a simple way. These tricyclic cores further serve as an advanced platform for the divergent enantioselective collective total syntheses of five Lycopodium alkaloids, belonging to three different structural types, in a concise and protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free fashion. The key transformations in the second phase include: 1)&#8197;a transannular reductive Heck cyclization for installation of the azepane ring in fawcettidine, fawcettimine, and lycoposerramine&#8197;Q; 2)&#8197;a domino Mukaiyama hydration/Grob fragmentation process for construction of the ten&#8208;membered lactam system in phlegmariurine&#8197;B; 3)&#8197;a Fukuyama one&#8208;pot protocol for the construction of the 2&#8208;pyridone motif in lycoposerramine&#8197;R. The newly developed strategy is expected to pave the way for the synthesis of other structurally related Lycopodium alkaloids.

         <title>Back&#8208;Gated van der Waals Heterojunction Manipulates Local Charges toward Fine&#8208;Tuning Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microcell&#8208;based in&#8197;situ electronic/electrochemical system was designed to unlock the fixed charge transfer of a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS2 heterojunction under an electric field. The charges across the van der Waals (vdW) channel distribute to three Mo atoms adjacent to S vacancies and strengthen Mo&#8722;H bonding. The catalyst design enables precise regulation of the electronic configuration.







Abstract
Charge redistribution plays a prominent role in interpreting the intrinsic electrocatalytic mechanism. Establishing a quantitative relationship between the local charges and electrochemical performance can fundamentally update the design philosophies beyond conventional methods. We describe exertion of an external electric field in the cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS2 heterojunction to finely manipulate intermolecular charge transfer. The injected charges (e&#8722;) from CoPc to MoS2 migrate to natural S vacancies and enhance Mo&#8722;H bonding. Moreover, the band gap of MoS2 and CoPc can be readily tuned by the electric field, verifying band engineering at the heterointerface. In&#8197;situ photoluminescence spectra and gate&#8208;dependent electrochemical measurement reveal a linear correlation between the charge accumulation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. This approach provides a new strategy for the design of catalysts, enabling precise regulation of the electronic configuration to improve catalytic activity.

         <title>VPO4F Fluorophosphates Polyanion Cathodes for High&#8208;Voltage Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal criterion for proton cathodes was put forward combining experimental results and theoretical simulations, which might pave a new way for exploiting electrode materials for proton batteries. As a result, vanadium fluorophosphate (VPO4F) was demonstrated as a promising high&#8208;voltage proton cathode material with high capacity.







Abstract
Proton batteries are emerging in electrochemical energy storage because of the associated fast kinetics, low cost and high safety. However, their development is hindered by the relatively low energy density due to the limited choice of cathode materials. Herein, metal phosphate polyanion cathodes are proposed as the proton cathode for the first time. Combining experimental results and theoretical simulations, a universal criterion for the proton cathode was put forward. Vanadium fluorophosphate (VPO4F) was demonstrated as a promising high&#8208;voltage proton cathode material with a specific capacity of 116&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high potential of 1.0&#8197;V (vs. SHE). The proton insertion/extraction mechanism in the VPO4F electrode was also verified through X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the stability of VPO4F was investigated in various electrolytes and the optimized electrolyte enabled the stable operation of VPO4F for 300&#8197;cycles. This work provides new inspiration in the exploitation of new electrode materials for electrochemical proton storage devices.

         <dc:description>
A pyridine&#8208;enabled transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective aromatic nucleophilic cage B(4)&#8208;H amination of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes with magnesium bisamides, giving a class of B(4)&#8208;aminated o&#8208;carboranes is reported. In the presence of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbpy) and magnesium complex, B(4)&#8208;aminated o&#8208;carboranes can undergo cage isomerization to afford B(2)&#8208;aminated m&#8208;carboranes at as low as 100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The nucleophilic aromatic BH substitution reaction of carboranes is uncommon, compared to the electrophilic one. This work reported a pyridine&#8208;enabled transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective nucleophilic aromatic cage B(4)&#8208;H amination of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes with magnesium bisamides, giving a series of B(4)&#8208;aminated o&#8208;carboranes. DFT calculations showcased a stepwise B&#8722;N formation/B&#8722;H cleavage process, in which Mg&#8722;H formation/cage closure is the rate&#8208;determining step. Unprecedentedly, in the presence of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbpy), a tandem B(4)&#8208;amination/cage isomerization reaction of o&#8208;carboranes was discovered for the facile preparation of B(2)&#8208;aminated m&#8208;carboranes. Control experiments indicated that magnesium complex, bidentate ligand (dtbpy) and reaction temperature were crucial in the cage isomerization process. This direct nucleophilic aromatic cage B&#8722;H amination reaction offers an alternative strategy for selective amination of o&#8208; and m&#8208;carboranes.

&lt;p&gt;A pyridine-enabled transition-metal-free regioselective aromatic nucleophilic cage B(4)-H amination of 1,2-diaryl-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carboranes with magnesium bisamides, giving a class of B(4)-aminated &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carboranes is reported.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis and Anti&#8208;Pancreatic Cancer Cell Growth Activity of a Highly Branched Heptadecasaccharide from Carthamus tinctorius</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of a highly branched heptadecasaccharide moiety of the native bioactive galectin&#8208;3&#8208;targeting polysaccharide from Carthamus tinctorius has been accomplished via a photo&#8208;assisted convergent [6+4+7] one&#8208;pot coupling strategy. This work demonstrates a representative example to explore potential active domains of the polysaccharide for structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, thereby facilitating pharmaceutical development.







Abstract
Bioactive polysaccharides from natural resources target various biological processes and are increasingly used as potential target molecules for drug development. However, the accessibility of branched and long complex polysaccharide active domains with well&#8208;defined structures remains a major challenge. Herein we describe an efficient first total synthesis of a highly branched heptadecasaccharide moiety of the native bioactive galectin&#8208;3&#8208;targeting polysaccharide from Carthamus tinctorius L. as well as shorter fragments of the heptadecasaccharide. The key feature of the approach is that a photo&#8208;assisted convergent [6+4+7] one&#8208;pot coupling strategy enables rapid assembly of the heptadecasaccharide, whereby a photoremovable o&#8208;nitrobenzyl protecting group is used to generate the corresponding acceptor for glycosylation in situ upon ultraviolet radiation. Biological activity tests suggest that the heptadecasaccharide can target galectin&#8208;3 and inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth.

         <title>Molecular Inhibition for Selective CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular modifiers can be used to alter the product selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. In this study, immobilisation of a well&#8208;defined pyridine species on a copper catalyst inhibits CO and C2+ product formation, enabling the selective generation of formate at high reaction rates.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction presents a sustainable route to the production of chemicals and fuels. Achieving a narrow product distribution with heterogeneous Cu catalysts is challenging and conventional material modifications offer limited control over selectivity. Here, we show that surface&#8208;immobilised molecular species can act as inhibitors for specific carbon products to provide rational control over product distributions. Combined experimental and computational results showed that anchoring of a thiol&#8208;functionalised pyridine on Cu destabilises a surface&#8208;bound reaction intermediate to energetically block a CO&#8208;producing pathway, thereby favouring formate production. The nitrogen atom was shown to be essential to the inhibition mechanism. The ability of molecules to control selectivity through inhibition of specific reaction pathways offers a unique approach to rationally modify heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Homochiral Multiferroic Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Dimetallic Complexes Assembled by C&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;K Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first homochiral multiferroic dimetallic cyanides were constructed by the introduction of rarely seen C&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;K interactions, which show a saturated polarization of 9.4&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, larger than those of other ferroelectric dimetallic cyanides.







Abstract
Cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic complexes are attracting attention due to their varied structures and properties. However, homochiral cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic complexes are rare, and making them ferroelectric is a great challenge. Introducing C&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;K interactions between the guest chiral cations and the host [KFe(CN)6]2&#8722; framework, gives three&#8208;dimensional cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic multiferroics, [R&#8208; and S&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium]2[KFe(CN)6] (R&#8208; and S&#8208;3&#8208;FPC). The mirror&#8208;symmetric vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) signal shows their enantiomeric nature. R&#8208; and S&#8208;3&#8208;FPC crystallize in the same chiral&#8208;polar space group P21 at 298&#8197;K. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), polarizing optical microscopy, and temperature&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) measurements show their multiferroic properties (the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity), in line with the Aizu notation of 222F2. R&#8208;3&#8208;FPC shows excellent ferroelectricity with saturated polarization up to 9.4&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

A biomimetic synthetic strategy has resulted in a two&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;ulodione&#8197;A and the prediction of two potential natural products, (&#177;)&#8208;ulodiones&#8197;C and D. This work was guided by computational investigations into the selectivity of a proposed biosynthetic Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization, which was then utilized in the chemical synthesis.

         <title>Unveiling the Proton&#8208;Feeding Effect in Sulfur&#8208;Doped Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>

         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;doping in the second coordination shell of FeN4 induces the increased CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance relative to pristine FeN4. The proton&#8208;feeding effect after sulfur doping is demonstrated to promote protonation of *CO2 to *COOH, and thus CO2RR performances, through kinetic analysis, in situ characterization and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doping in metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is considered a powerful strategy to promote the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but the origin of enhanced catalytic activity is still elusive. Here, we disclose that sulfur doping induces an obvious proton&#8208;feeding effect for CO2RR. The model SAC catalyst with sulfur doping in the second&#8208;shell of FeN4 (Fe1&#8722;NSC) was verified by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Fe1&#8722;NSC exhibits superior CO2RR performance compared to sulfur&#8208;free FeN4 and most reported Fe&#8208;based SACs, with a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 98.6&#8201;% and turnover frequency of 1197&#8197;h&#8722;1. Kinetic analysis and in situ characterizations confirm that sulfur doping accelerates H2O activation and feeds sufficient protons for promoting CO2 conversion to *COOH, which is also corroborated by the theoretical results. This work deepens the understanding of the CO2RR mechanism based on SAC catalysts.

         <title>Methylamine Lithium Borohydride as Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion conductor based on methylamine lithium borohydride is reported. The new compound crystallizes in a layered two&#8208;dimensional structure with fast Li&#8208;ion migration in the interlayers. The first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery using a lithium borohydride with a neutral ligand as electrolyte is demonstrated with Li&#8208;metal as the anode and TiS2 as the cathode material.







Abstract
Fast Li&#8208;ion conductivity at room temperature is a major challenge for utilization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries. Metal borohydrides with neutral ligands are a new emerging class of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors, and here we report the discovery of a new mono&#8208;methylamine lithium borohydride with very fast Li+ conductivity at room temperature. LiBH4&#8901;CH3NH2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, forming a two&#8208;dimensional unique layered structure. The layers are separated by hydrophobic &#8722;CH3 moieties, and contain large voids, allowing for fast Li&#8208;ionic conduction in the interlayers, &#963;(Li+)=1.24&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The electronic conductivity is negligible, and the electrochemical stability is &#8776;2.1&#8197;V vs Li. The first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery using a lithium borohydride with a neutral ligand as the electrolyte, Li&#8208;metal as the anode and TiS2 as the cathode is demonstrated.

         <title>Enzymatic Enantioselective anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydration of Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene monooxygenase catalyzed enantioselective anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydration of aryl alkenes, rather than epoxidation, was made possible by simply removing oxygen from the reaction mixture. An acid&#8211;base mechanism with a carbanion&#8208;like intermediate enabled the reaction with excellent anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity.







Abstract
The addition of water to alkenes is an important method for the synthesis of alcohols, but the regioselectivity of acid&#8208;catalyzed hydration of terminal alkenes yields secondary alcohols according to Markovnikov's rule, making it difficult to obtain primary alcohols. Here we report a styrene monooxygenase that catalyzes the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydration of the terminal aryl alkenes under anaerobic conditions. This hydration provides primary alcohols in good yields (up to 100&#8201;%), excellent anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1), and good enantiomeric purity (60&#8211;83&#8201;% ee). Residues Asn46, Asp100, and Asn309 are essential for catalysis suggesting an acid&#8211;base mechanism with a carbanion&#8208;like intermediate that could account for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity. Our work reveals a new enzymatic tool with unusual regioselectivity based on the promiscuous catalytic activity of a monooxygenase.

Abstract
The regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective, intermolecular vicinal fluoroamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes has been achieved by enantioselective II/IIII catalysis. Leveraging C2&#8208;symmetric resorcinol&#8208;based aryl iodide catalysts, it has been possible to intercept the transient iodonium intermediate using simple nitriles, which function as both the solvent and nucleophile. In situ Ritter reaction provides direct access to the corresponding amides (up to 89&#8201;% yield, e.r. 93&#8201;:&#8201;7). This main group catalysis paradigm inverts the intrinsic regioselectivity of the uncatalyzed process, thereby providing facile access to tertiary, benzylic stereocenters bearing both CF3 and F groups. Privileged phenethylamine pharmacophores can be generated in which there is complete local partial charge inversion (CF3&#948;&#8722;/F&#948;&#8722; versus CH3&#948;+/H&#948;+). Crystallographic analyses of representative &#946;&#8208;fluoroamide products reveal highly pre&#8208;organized conformations that manifest the stereoelectronic gauche effect.

         <title>Ru&#8211;Co Pair Sites Catalyst Boosts the Energetics for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site Ru cation coordination manipulation strategy is proposed to achieve near&#8208;optimal adsorption energies for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates by constructing an atomically dispersed Ru&#8722;Co paired site on LiCoO2. Benefitting from the strong electronic interaction between Ru and Co, the Ru&#8722;Co/LiCoO2 nanosheets exhibit accelerated charge transfer capability, strengthened Co&#8722;O covalency, optimized eg filling, and then the resulting superior OER activity.







Abstract
Manipulating the coordination environment of the active center via anion modulation to reveal tailored activity and selectivity has been widely achieved, especially for carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom site catalysts (SACs). However, tuning ligand fields of the active center by single&#8208;site metal cation regulation and identifying the effects on the resulting electronic configuration is seldom explored. Herein, we propose a single&#8208;site Ru cation coordination strategy to engineer the electronic properties by constructing a Ru/LiCoO2 SAC with atomically dispersed Ru&#8722;Co pair sites. Benefitting from the strong electronic coupling between Ru and Co sites, the catalyst possesses an enhanced electrical conductivity and achieves near&#8208;optimal oxygen adsorption energies. Therefore, the optimized catalyst delivers superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotential, the high mass activity of 1000&#8197;A&#8201;goxide&#8722;1 at a small overpotential of 335&#8197;mV, and excellent long&#8208;term stability. It also exhibits rapid kinetics with superior rate capability and outstanding durability in a zinc&#8211;air battery.

         <title>Ball Milling Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Prussian Blue Analogue Na2&#8722;xMnFe(CN)6 Cathodes for All&#8208;Climate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, cost&#8208;efficient, and general programmable ball&#8208;milling synthesis process without any additives was designed to prepare highly crystalline MnHCF&#8208;S&#8208;170. The constructed sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) based on the above MnHCF&#8208;S&#8208;170 can adapt to the complex and fickle working environment, and demonstrate possible practical applications in large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems.







Abstract
With a series of merits, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been considered as superior cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Their commercialization, however, still suffers from inferior stability, considerable [Fe(CN)6] defects and interstitial water in the framework, which are related to the rapid crystal growth. Herein, a &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; nanoreactor is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs with decreased defects and water, which show both superior specific capacity and rate capability in SIBs. The air&#8208;stability, all&#8208;climate, and full&#8208;cell properties of our PBA have also been evaluated, and it exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and higher volume yield than its counterpart synthesized via the water&#8208;based co&#8208;precipitation method. Furthermore, their highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage behavior has been measured and identified via multiple in situ techniques. This work could pave the way for the PBA&#8208;based SIBs in grid&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Optimizing Pt Electronic States through Formation of a Schottky Junction on Non&#8208;reducible Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum nanoparticles are supported on different MOFs, including non&#8208;reducible ZIF&#8208;8 and reducible UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;125. Unexpectedly, the Pt/ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits higher activity than Pt/UiO&#8208;66 and Pt/MIL&#8208;125 in the photocatalytic benzylamine oxidative coupling reaction. The different electron transfer behaviors among these photocatalysts lead to the highest Pt electron density on ZIF&#8208;8 toward O2 activation, accounting for its superior activity.







Abstract
Charge transfer between metal sites and supports is crucial for catalysis. Redox&#8208;inert supports are usually unfavorable due to their less electronic interaction with metal sites, which, we demonstrate, is not always correct. Herein, three metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are chosen to mimic inert or active supports for Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and the photocatalysis is studied. Results demonstrate the formation of a Schottky junction between Pt and the MOFs, leading to the electron&#8208;donation effect of the MOFs. Under light irradiation, both the MOF electron&#8208;donation effect and Pt interband excitation dominate the Pt electron density. Compared with the &#8220;active&#8221; UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;125 supports, Pt NPs on the &#8220;inert&#8221; ZIF&#8208;8 exhibit higher electron density due to the higher Schottky barrier, resulting in superior photocatalytic activity. This work optimizes metal catalysts with non&#8208;reducible supports, and promotes the understanding of the relationship between the metal&#8211;support interaction and photocatalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of 2D Hybrid Double Perovskites on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 Crystals towards Ultrasensitive Detection of Weak Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of 2D/3D lead&#8208;free double perovskite heterocrystals (HCs) is shown here to give the first demonstration of high&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection with a large anisotropy ratio (&#8776;9) and weak light resolution.







Abstract
We report the self&#8208;assembly of 2D double perovskite (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7 (BLA=benzylammonium) on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 crystals, providing the first demonstration of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection using lead&#8208;free double perovskite heterocrystals (HCs). The (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7/Cs2AgBiBr6 HC successfully combines the anisotropy of 2D double perovskites with the well&#8208;defined interface provided by heterogeneous integration. Driven by the built&#8208;in electric field in junction, photodetectors of HCs exhibit unique polarization dependence of zero&#8208;bias photocurrent with a large anisotropy ratio up to 9, which is 6&#8197;times amplified as compared to the pristine 2D (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7. More importantly, the present devices can remain polarization&#8208;sensitive with incident light intensity down to the nW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 level. Our study on lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskite HCs marks a step toward establishing robust material foundations for fundamental scientific investigations and the development of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>The Synthetic Potential of Thiophenium Ylide Cycloadducts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl sulfides were shown to participate in thermal (3+2) cycloadditions with tethered alkynes. The resulting thiophenium ylide cycloadducts led to a variety of polysubstituted thiophenes by trapping with diverse electrophiles.







Abstract
(3+2) cycloaddition reactions are undeniably one of the most robust and versatile synthetic tools in heterocyclic chemistry. The classically required 1,3&#8208;dipoles are however limited to three&#8208;atom sequences bearing stabilized formal charges in their Lewis structure. The scope of three&#8208;atom groupings possible in (3+2) cycloadditions can be greatly expanded by taking of advantage neutral three&#8208;atom components (TACs). These groupings result in zwitterionic (3+2) cycloadducts adaptable to multiple outcomes depending on structure and conditions. Herein, the intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between alkynyl sulfides (neutral TAC) and alkynes to provide key thiophenium ylide intermediates is first reported. These reactive species provide access to highly substituted fused thiophenes following predictable chemical sequences.

     alt="The Synthetic Potential of Thiophenium Ylide Cycloadducts**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkynyl sulfides were shown to participate in thermal (3+2) cycloadditions with tethered alkynes. The resulting thiophenium ylide cycloadducts led to a variety of polysubstituted thiophenes by trapping with diverse electrophiles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3+2) cycloaddition reactions are undeniably one of the most robust and versatile synthetic tools in heterocyclic chemistry. The classically required 1,3-dipoles are however limited to three-atom sequences bearing stabilized formal charges in their Lewis structure. The scope of three-atom groupings possible in (3+2) cycloadditions can be greatly expanded by taking of advantage neutral three-atom components (TACs). These groupings result in zwitterionic (3+2) cycloadducts adaptable to multiple outcomes depending on structure and conditions. Herein, the intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between alkynyl sulfides (neutral TAC) and alkynes to provide key thiophenium ylide intermediates is first reported. These reactive species provide access to highly substituted fused thiophenes following predictable chemical sequences. Structural features on the obtained thiophenes were highly configurable by judicious choice of both alkynyl sulfide substitution and reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically Tuning Attractive and Repulsive Interactions between Solubilizing Oil Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of oil chemical structure, nonionic surfactant structure, and surfactant concentration on the interfacial tensions and Marangoni flows of solubilizing oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops is characterized systematically. Three regimes corresponding to droplet &#8220;attraction&#8221;, &#8220;repulsion&#8221;, or &#8220;inactivity&#8221; are identified and the chemical trends leading to these behaviors are discussed.







Abstract
Micellar solubilization is a transport process occurring in surfactant&#8208;stabilized emulsions that can lead to Marangoni flow and droplet motility. Active droplets exhibit self&#8208;propulsion and pairwise repulsion due to solubilization processes and/or solubilization products raising the droplet's interfacial tension. Here, we report emulsions with the opposite behavior, wherein solubilization decreases the interfacial tension and causes droplets to attract. We characterize the influence of oil chemical structure, nonionic surfactant structure, and surfactant concentration on the interfacial tensions and Marangoni flows of solubilizing oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops. Three regimes corresponding to droplet &#8220;attraction&#8221;, &#8220;repulsion&#8221; or &#8220;inactivity&#8221; are identified. We believe these studies contribute to a fundamental understanding of solubilization processes in emulsions and provide guidance as to how chemical parameters can influence the dynamics and chemotactic interactions between active droplets.

         <title>Functionalizable and Chemically Recyclable Thermoplastics from Chemoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Bio&#8208;renewable Bifunctional &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone</title>

         <dc:description>
The controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) to produce functionalizable P(MVL)ROP is presented. It can recycle back to pristine monomer with an almost quantitative yield (ca. 96&#8201;%). P(MVL)ROP with high molar mass behaves as a tough thermoplastic with good mechanical properties, which is comparable to isotactic polypropylene (PP) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE).







Abstract
It is a highly attractive strategy to develop chemically recyclable polymers to establish a circular plastic economy. Despite the recent advancements, chemically recyclable polymers still face challenges including high energy cost for polymer preparation or recycling, poor monomer recovery selectivity and efficiency as well as undesired material performance. In this contribution, we present the chemoselective controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization of bio&#8208;renewable bifunctional &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) to produce exclusive functionalizable polyester using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained polyester with high molar mass exhibits good tensile strength comparable to that of some commodity plastics. Remarkably, the obtained polyester can be depolymerized to recover pristine monomer with a 96&#8201;% yield by thermolysis, thus successfully establishing a closed&#8208;loop life cycle.

         <title>Fe2+/Fe3+ Cycling for Coupling Self&#8208;Powered Hydrogen Evolution and Preparation of Electrode Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling system has been established for efficient self&#8208;powered hydrogen evolution, in which a Zn&#8722;Fe battery with Fe3+ reduction reaction coupled Zn oxidation powers the electrolyzers of Fe2+ oxidation reaction (Fe2+OR) coupled hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, this Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling is used to prepare a multifunctional catalyst by the Fe2+OR&#8208;promoted dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on siloxene nanosheets.







Abstract
A novel Zn&#8722;Fe flow battery featuring an Fe3+ reduction reaction (Fe3+RR)&#8208;coupled zinc oxidation, and an Fe2+ oxidation reaction (Fe2+OR)&#8208;coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) system as well, was established. This battery is capable of driving two Fe2+OR&#8208;coupled HER systems in series based on the above Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling, for efficient self&#8208;powered hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, this Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling enables the preparation of a multifunctional catalyst, Pt&#8208;3@SXNS (siloxene nanosheet), by the Fe2+OR&#8208;promoted dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on SXNS; alternatively, this support could be obtained by Fe3+RR&#8208;assisted exfoliation using Fe3+ from the anolyte of Fe2+OR&#8208;coupled HER. The Pt&#8208;3@SXNS catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities toward Fe3+RR in the Zn&#8722;Fe flow battery, HER, and Fe2+OR in the electrolyzer, which is attributed to the strong electronic interaction between Pt and Si. This work offers a new strategy for energy storage and low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from acidic wastewater.

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Separation Using a Metal&#8211;Organic Cage Built from Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs), built from macrocycles, were investigated for the first time for the separation of hydrogen isotopes. The MOC crystal has flexible narrow pores, which leads to a separation temperature of over 100&#8197;K even without existing strong adsorption sites.







Abstract
Porous materials that contain ultrafine pore apertures can separate hydrogen isotopes via kinetic quantum sieving (KQS). However, it is challenging to design materials with suitably narrow pores for KQS that also show good adsorption capacities and operate at practical temperatures. Here, we investigate a metal&#8211;organic cage (MOC) assembled from organic macrocycles and ZnII ions that exhibits narrow windows (&lt;3.0&#8197;&#197;). Two polymorphs, referred to as 2&#945; and 2&#946;, were observed. Both polymorphs exhibit D2/H2 selectivity in the temperature range 30&#8211;100&#8197;K. At higher temperature (77&#8197;K), the D2 adsorption capacity of 2&#946; increases to about 2.7&#8197;times that of 2&#945;, along with a reasonable D2/H2 selectivity. Gas sorption analysis and thermal desorption spectroscopy suggest a gate&#8208;opening effect of the MOCs pore aperture. This promotes KQS at temperatures above liquid nitrogen temperature, indicating that MOCs hold promise for hydrogen isotope separation in real industrial environments.

         <title>Relaxation of the Plant Cell Wall Barrier via Zwitterionic Liquid Pretreatment for Micelle&#8208;Complex&#8208;Mediated DNA Delivery to Specific Plant Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique strategy to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for organelle&#8208;specific DNA delivery is presented. This strategy leverages the synergistic effects of a cell wall&#8208;loosening zwitterionic liquid and an organelle&#8208;targeting micelle complex, allowing greatly augmented DNA delivery to target organelles, such as chloroplasts, in living plants.







Abstract
Targeted delivery of genes to specific plant organelles is a key challenge for fundamental plant science, plant bioengineering, and agronomic applications. Nanoscale carriers have attracted interest as a promising tool for organelle&#8208;targeted DNA delivery in plants. However, nanocarrier&#8208;mediated DNA delivery in plants is severely hampered by the barrier of the plant cell wall, resulting in insufficient delivery efficiency. Herein, we propose a unique strategy that synergistically combines a cell wall&#8208;loosening zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) with a peptide&#8208;displaying micelle complex for organelle&#8208;specific DNA delivery in plants. We demonstrated that ZIL pretreatment can enhance cell wall permeability without cytotoxicity, allowing micelle complexes to translocate across the cell wall and carry DNA cargo into specific plant organelles, such as nuclei and chloroplasts, with significantly augmented efficiency. Our work offers a novel concept to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for nanocarrier&#8208;mediated cargo delivery to specific organelles in living plants.

         <title>A Cobalamin&#8208;Dependent Radical SAM Enzyme Catalyzes the Unique C&#945;&#8208;Methylation of Glutamine in Methyl&#8208;Coenzyme&#8197;M Reductase</title>

         <dc:description>
The enzyme responsible for the unique C&#945;&#8208;methylation of a glutamine residue within methyl&#8208;coenzyme M reductase was identified. Biochemical, spectroscopic and mass spectrometric characterization clearly classify the newly identified glutamine C&#8208;methyltransferase as a cobalamin&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme and, thus, as a new member of the class B radical SAM methyltransferase family.







Abstract
Methyl&#8208;coenzyme M reductase, which is responsible for the production of the greenhouse gas methane during biological methane formation, carries several unique posttranslational amino acid modifications, including a 2&#8208;(S)&#8208;methylglutamine. The enzyme responsible for the C&#945;&#8208;methylation of this glutamine is not known. Herein, we identify and characterize a cobalamin&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme as the glutamine C&#8208;methyltransferase. The recombinant protein from Methanoculleus thermophilus binds cobalamin in a base&#8208;off, His&#8208;off conformation and contains a single [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster. The cobalamin cofactor cycles between the methyl&#8208;cob(III)alamin, cob(II)alamin and cob(I)alamin states during catalysis and produces methylated substrate, 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio. The newly identified glutamine C&#8208;methyltransferase belongs to the class B radical SAM methyltransferases known to catalyze challenging methylation reactions of sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Double Remote C(sp2)&#8722;H / C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalizations by Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed double remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations via radical relay have been accomplished by mild visible&#8208;light photocatalysis without an exogenous photocatalyst, featuring meta&#8208;arene and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) functionalizations with a single catalyst.







Abstract
Distal C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations have recently emerged as step&#8208;economical tools for molecular synthesis. However, while the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) construction is of fundamental importance, its formation through double remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation has proven elusive. By merging the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization with an aliphatic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process, we, herein, describe the catalyzed twofold remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations via photo&#8208;induced ruthenium&#8208;mediated radical relay. Thus, meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H arene bonds and remote C(sp3)&#8722;H alkane bonds were activated by a single catalyst in a single operation. This process was accomplished at room temperature by visible light&#8212;notably without exogenous photocatalysts. Experimental and computational theory studies uncovered a manifold comprising ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H activation, single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET), 1,n&#8208;HAT (n=5&#8211;7) and &#963;&#8208;activation by means of a single ruthenium(II) catalyst.

         <title>Sodium Borates: Expanding the Electrolyte Selection for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising technology for grid&#8208;level storage, but require electrolytes specifically optimized for them. This work showcases the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts that can act as electrolytes for SIBs. Electrochemical studies reveal Na[B(hfip)4]&#8901;DME (hfip=hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp=perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) are excellent alternatives to conventionally used NaPF6.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising grid&#8208;level storage technology due to the abundance and low cost of sodium. The development of new electrolytes for SIBs is imperative since it impacts battery life and capacity. Currently, sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) is used as the benchmark salt, but is highly hygroscopic and generates toxic HF. This work describes the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts, with electrochemical studies revealing that Na[B(hfip)4]&#8901;DME (hfip=hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp=perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) have excellent electrochemical performance. The [B(pp)2]&#8722; anion also exhibits a high tolerance to air and water. Both electrolytes give more stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces than conventionally used NaPF6, as demonstrated by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, they give greater cycling stability and comparable capacity to NaPF6 for SIBs, as shown in commercial pouch cells.

         <title>Trap Inlaid Cationic Hybrid Composite Material for Efficient Segregation of Toxic Chemicals from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid composite aerogel material has been systematically fabricated by encapsulating an active nanosized cationic metal&#8211;organic polyhedron in a stable hierarchical porous metal&#8211;organic gel matrix. The hybrid aerogel demonstrated efficient and highly selective extraction of metal&#8208;based toxic oxoanions in both batch and dynamic column exchange experiments from simulated industrial wastewater and natural ground water systems.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based oxoanions are potentially toxic pollutants that can cause serious water pollution. Therefore, the segregation of such species has recently received significant research attention. Even though several adsorbents have been employed for effective management of chemicals, their limited microporous nature along with non&#8208;monolithic applicability has thwarted their large&#8208;scale real&#8208;time application. Herein, we developed a unique anion exchangeable hybrid composite aerogel material (IPcomp&#8208;6), integrating a stable cationic metal&#8211;organic polyhedron with a hierarchically porous metal&#8211;organic gel. The composite scavenger demonstrated a highly selective and very fast segregation efficiency for various hazardous oxoanions such as, HAsO42&#8722;, SeO42&#8722;, ReO4&#8722;, CrO42&#8722;, MnO4&#8722;, in water, in the presence of 100&#8208;fold excess of other coexisting anions. The material was able to selectively eliminate trace HAsO42&#8722; even at low concentration to well below the AsV limit in drinking water defined by WHO.

         <title>Fast Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Reveals the Evasive Hepatitis&#8197;B Virus Capsid C&#8208;Terminal Domain
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of proton&#8208;detected fast MAS NMR &gt;100&#8197;kHz and specific labelling schemes reveals the formerly invisible domain of the Hepatitis&#8197;B virus capsid. Since the evasiveness of this domain lies in its dynamic behavior, it is expected that this methodology will be of use to characterize flexible domains in a wider range of proteins.







Abstract
Experimentally determined protein structures often feature missing domains. One example is the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of the hepatitis&#8197;B virus capsid protein, a functionally central part of this assembly, crucial in regulating nucleic&#8208;acid interactions, cellular trafficking, nuclear import, particle assembly and maturation. However, its structure remained elusive to all current techniques, including NMR. Here we show that the recently developed proton&#8208;detected fast magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning solid&#8208;state NMR at &gt;100&#8197;kHz MAS allows one to detect this domain and unveil its structural and dynamic behavior. We describe the experimental framework used and compare the domain's behavior in different capsid states. The developed approaches extend solid&#8208;state NMR observations to residues characterized by large&#8208;amplitude motion on the microsecond timescale, and shall allow one to shed light on other flexible protein domains still lacking their structural and dynamic characterization.

         <title>Alternative Benzoxazole Assembly Discovered in Anaerobic Bacteria Provides Access to Privileged Heterocyclic Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biosynthetic route to a medically relevant benzoxazole scaffold was discovered in anaerobic bacteria. Genome editing, heterologous expression, and biotransformation studies show that the pathway invokes specialized precursors, backbone assembly, and heterocyclization to form closoxazoles. The biocatalysts involved display synthetic utility, and prompted the genomics&#8208;driven identification of cryptic gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.







Abstract
Benzoxazole scaffolds feature prominently in diverse synthetic and natural product&#8208;derived pharmaceuticals. Our understanding of their bacterial biosynthesis is, however, limited to ortho&#8208;substituted heterocycles from actinomycetes. We report an overlooked biosynthetic pathway in anaerobic bacteria (typified in Clostridium cavendishii) that expands the benzoxazole chemical space to meta&#8208;substituted heterocycles and heralds a distribution beyond Actinobacteria. The first benzoxazoles from the anaerobic realm (closoxazole A and B) were elucidated by NMR and chemical synthesis. By genome editing in the native producer, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, and systematic pathway dissection we show that closoxazole biosynthesis invokes an unprecedented precursor usage (3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoate) and manner of assembly. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by the precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis of a tafamidis analogue. A bioinformatic survey reveals the pervasiveness of related gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.

         <title>Amplification&#8208;Free Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Using CRISPR Cas13a and Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CRISPR Cas13a&#8208;gFET biosensors are reported for target amplification&#8208;free and ultrasensitive detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and respiratory syncytial virus. The sensor harnesses the trans&#8208;cleavage mechanism of Cas13a and the high sensitivity of graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (gFETs). The sensor performance was validated using synthetic targets, heat&#8208;inactivated virus samples, and clinical samples, showing a sensitivity comparable to that of RT&#8208;qPCR.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) systems have recently received notable attention for their applications in nucleic acid detection. Despite many attempts, the majority of current CRISPR&#8208;based biosensors in infectious respiratory disease diagnostic applications still require target preamplifications. This study reports a new biosensor for amplification&#8208;free nucleic acid detection via harnessing the trans&#8208;cleavage mechanism of Cas13a and ultrasensitive graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (gFETs). CRISPR Cas13a&#8208;gFET achieves the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genome down to 1 attomolar without target preamplifications. Additionally, we validate the detection performance using clinical SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 samples, including those with low viral loads (Ct value &gt;30). Overall, these findings establish our CRISPR Cas13a&#8208;gFET among the most sensitive amplification&#8208;free nucleic acid diagnostic platforms to date.

         <title>Intrinsic Nonflammable Ether Electrolytes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Chlorine Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte of LiFSI/1.6Cl&#8208;DEE/3TTE with chlorinated&#8208;DEE as the base solvent has excellent flame&#8208;retarding properties, intrinsic anti&#8208;oxidation capabilities and forms interphases rich in LiF and LiCl, which improves electrochemical stabilities of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under ultrahigh voltages.







Abstract
The issues of inherent low anodic stability and high flammability hinder the deployment of the ether&#8208;based electrolytes in practical high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries. Here, we report a rationally designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte with chlorine functionality on ether molecular structure to address these critical challenges. The chloroether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates a high Li Coulombic efficiency of 99.2&#8201;% and a high capacity retention &gt;88&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes at an ultrahigh cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V (stable even up to 4.7&#8197;V). The chloroether&#8208;based electrolyte not only greatly improves electrochemical stabilities of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under ultrahigh voltages with interphases riched in LiF and LiCl, but possesses the intrinsic nonflammable safety feature owing to the flame&#8208;retarding ability of chlorine functional groups. This study offers a new approach to enable ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high energy density, long&#8208;life and safe Li metal batteries.

The chloroether-based electrolyte demonstrates a high Li Coulombic efficiency of 99.2&#8201;% and a high capacity retention &amp;gt;88&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles for Ni-rich cathodes at an ultrahigh cut-off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V (stable even up to 4.7&#8197;V). The chloroether-based electrolyte not only greatly improves electrochemical stabilities of Ni-rich cathodes under ultrahigh voltages with interphases riched in LiF and LiCl, but possesses the intrinsic nonflammable safety feature owing to the flame-retarding ability of chlorine functional groups. This study offers a new approach to enable ether-based electrolytes for high energy density, long-life and safe Li metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sb3+&#8211;Er3+&#8208;Codoped Cs2NaInCl6 for Emitting Blue and Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs2NaInCl6 double perovskite was codoped with Sb3+ (s&#8208;electron) and Er3+ (f&#8208;electrons). Sb3+ provides sub&#8208;band gap (s to p) optical excitation, which de&#8208;excites via both emitting intense blue light and non&#8208;radiatively exciting f&#8208;electrons of Er3+. Then Er3+ emits 1540&#8197;nm short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) radiation. Phosphor converted light emitting diode (pc&#8208;LED) show stable performance under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Cs2NaInCl6 double perovskite is stable, environmentally benign and easy to prepare. But it has a wide band gap (5.1&#8197;eV), and therefore, does not show optical and optoelectronic properties in the visible and short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region. Here we introduce such functionalities in Cs2NaInCl6 by codoping Sb3+ (s&#8208;electron doping) and Er3+ (f&#8208;electron doping) ions. Sb3+ doping introduces optically allowed 5s2
5s15p1 electronic absorption at the sub&#8208;band gap level, which then emits blue photoluminescence with &#8776;93&#8201;% quantum yield. But f&#8208;f electronic absorption of Er3+ is parity forbidden. Codoping Sb3+&#8211;Er3+, leads to transfer of excitation energy from Sb3+ to Er3+, yielding SWIR emission at 1540&#8197;nm. Temperature (6 to 300&#8197;K) dependent photoluminescence measurements elucidate the excitation and emission mechanism. A phosphor converted light emitting diode (pc&#8208;LED) fabricated by using the codoped sample emits stable blue and SWIR radiation over prolonged (84&#8197;hours) operation at 5.1&#8197;V.

Nucleic acid detection plays a critical role in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety. In their Research Article (e202203826), Xue Gao, Yi Zhang and co&#8208;workers developed a new biosensor for amplification&#8208;free nucleic acid detection via harnessing the trans&#8208;cleavage mechanism of Cas13a and ultrasensitive graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (gFETs). The illustration shows the Cas13a&#8208;mediated RNA trans&#8208;cleavage on a gFET surface for sensor signal transduction.

A unique anion exchangeable hybrid composite aerogel material was fabricated by Sujit&#8197;K. Ghosh and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202203385) by strategically implanting a stable cationic metal&#8211;organic polyhedron in a hierarchically porous metal&#8211;organic gel material. The composite scavenger efficiently and selectively sequestrates various metal&#8208;based toxic oxoanions from natural and simulated industrial wastewater samples in both batch and dynamic column exchange sorption experiments.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Temperature Molten Oxide Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high temperature electrochemistry (UTE) is a promising and revolutionary technology for the low&#8208;carbon extraction of metals and in situ production of oxygen on the Moon. The progress of UTE, starting from the physicochemical properties of molten oxides and the development of inert anodes for oxygen evolution reaction and liquid metal cathodes for clean metal extraction, is reviewed. Further challenges and perspectives are highlighted to promote the advancement of UTE.







Abstract
Recently, the ultra&#8208;high temperature electrochemistry (UTE, about &gt;1000&#8201;&#176;C) has emerged, which represents an exploration to extend the temperature limit of human technology in electrochemical engineering. UTE has far&#8208;reaching impact on revolutionary low&#8208;carbon metal extraction and the in situ production of oxygen for deep&#8208;space exploration. It is hence of urgency to systematically summarize the development of UTE. In this Review, the basic concepts of UTE and the physicochemical properties of molten oxides are analyzed. The principles in the design of inert anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction in molten oxides are discussed, which forms a solid basis for the in situ production of oxygen from simulated lunar regolith by UTE. Furthermore, liquid metal cathodes for revolutionary titanium extraction and ironmaking/steelmaking are highlighted. With emphasis on the key challenges and perspectives, the Review can provide valuable inspiration for the rapid advancement of UTE.

         <title>Microplastics and their Additives in the Indoor Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of synthetic polymers are usually present in domestic and public indoor environments. These represent potential sources of microplastics, their monomers, and additives. Depending on the physical properties, fibers, fragments, and organic compounds originating from plastics are found in the air or accumulate in house dust. The question therefore arises as to how humans are exposed to microplastics and their components in indoor spaces.







Abstract
Analyses of air and house dust have shown that pollution of the indoor environment with microplastics could pose a fundamental hygienic problem. Indoor microplastics can result from abrasion, microplastic beads are frequently added to household products and microplastic granules can be found in artificial turf for sports activities and in synthetic admixtures in equestrian hall litter. In this context, the question arose as to what extent particulate emissions of thermoplastic materials from 3D printing should be at least partially classified as microplastics or nanoplastics. The discussion about textiles as a possible source of indoor microplastics has also been intensified. This Minireview gives an overview of the current exposure of residents to microplastics. Trends can be identified from the results and preventive measures can be derived if necessary. It is recommended that microplastics and their additives be given greater consideration in indoor environmental surveys in the future.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Selective Molecular Imaging via Upconversion Luminescence&#8208;Controlled, DNA&#8208;Based Biosensor Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses spatiotemporally selective molecular imaging based on engineered light&#8208;activatable DNA biosensors and its further combination with upconversion nanotechnology. Particular attention is paid to the application of this strategy for spatiotemporally controlled subcellular imaging, signal amplification, and regulation of the targeting activity of functional DNA.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based biosensor technologies have shown great potential in chemical and biological detection. These biosensors have been actively developed as probes for molecular imaging in live cells and in animals, allowing in situ detection of analytes in complex biological systems, elucidation of the roles of key molecules in biological processes, and the development of non&#8208;invasive diagnosis and image&#8208;guided surgery. Despite the progress made, improving the spatial&#8208;temporal precision remains a challenge in this field. In this Minireview, we describe the concepts behind spatiotemporally selective molecular imaging via the combination of engineered, light&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based biosensors and upconversion nanotechnology. We then highlight the application of the approach for the spatiotemporally controlled imaging of various targets in specific intracellular organelles, signal amplification, as well as the regulation of targeting activity to receptor proteins. We finally discuss the challenges and perspectives for possible future developments in this emerging field.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Dynamic RGB (Red&#8208;Green&#8208;Blue) Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence in an Anti&#8208;Kasha Organic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic ultra&#8208;long persistence luminescent material with dynamic RGB&#8208;tunable and high&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) based on a triamino&#8208;s&#8208;triazine derivative was designed and prepared for information encryption and decryption.







Abstract
Organic LPL (long&#8208;persistent luminescence) materials have sparked extensive research interest due to the ultralong&#8208;lived triplet states. Although numerous organic LPL materials have been reported, most of the triplet emission was static and monotonous. Therefore, LPL materials with dynamic triplet emission are urgently required. A triamino&#8208;s&#8208;triazine derivative 1 with dynamic LPL was fabricated. The single&#8208;crystal structure shows that the abundant intermolecular interactions and small free volume restrict the molecular motion and avoid the quenchers. Spectral and theoretical calculations upheld the existence of multiple excited states in 1, and the migration of electrons between multiple excited states is very sensitive to external stimuli. By modulating the stimulus, the residence of electrons in different triplet states can be manipulated to achieve RGB LPL. Importantly, blue LPL was achieved by manipulating the anti&#8208;Kasha emission. And the red LPL can still be observed at high temperature.

         <title>Spontaneous Ammonia Activation Through Coordination&#8208;Induced Bond Weakening in Molybdenum Complexes of a Dianionic Pentadentate Ligand Platform
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum complexes of the dianionic pentadentate ligand B2Pz4Py enable spontaneous activation of coordinated ammonia to release dihydrogen and form a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;nitrido Mo complex. DFT calculations and experimental investigations show that this ligand is highly effective at inducing N&#8722;H bond weakening and the ensuing chemistry brings to light potential side reactions in catalytic ammonia oxidation.







Abstract
Ammonia oxidation catalyzed by molecular compounds is of current interest as a carbon&#8208;free source of dihydrogen. Activation of N&#8722;H bonds through coordination to transition metal centers is a key reaction in this process. We report the substantial activation of ammonia via reaction with low&#8208;valent molybdenum complexes of a diborate pentadentate ligand system. Spontaneous loss of dihydrogen from (B2Pz4Py)MoII&#8722;NH3 at room temperature to produce the dinuclear &#956;&#8208;nitrido compound (B2Pz4Py)Mo&#8208;N&#8208;Mo(B2Pz4Py) is observed due to substantial N&#8722;H bond weakening upon coordination to Mo. Mechanistic details are supported through the experimental observation/characterization of terminal amido, imido and nitrido complexes and density functional theory computations. The generally under&#8208;appreciated role of bridging nitrido intermediates is revealed and discussed, providing guidance for further catalyst development for this process.

         <title>Photoredox Generation of Isothiouronyl Radical Cations: A New Platform in Covalent Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothiouronyl radical cations have been identified as a new class of radical catalysts for the covalent activation of vinylcyclopropanes. Their generation by photoredox catalysis from N,N,N,N&#8208;tetrasubstituted thioureas provides a modular, versatile and practical platform to achieve covalent radical catalysis.







Abstract
Thiyl radicals offer unique catalytic patterns for the direct covalent activation of alkenes. However, important limitations in terms of structural diversity and handling have hampered the routine use of thiyl radicals in covalent radical catalysis. Herein, we report a new class of cationic sulfur&#8208;centered radicals to achieve covalent radical catalysis. Their generation from highly modular thioureas by photoredox catalysis make their utilization very simple and reliable. The synthetic potential and the versatility of the catalytic system were finally evaluated in a (3+2)&#8208;radical cascade between vinylcyclopropanes and olefins.

         <title>A Lattice&#8208;Matching Strategy for Highly Reversible Copper&#8208;Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matching strategy was developed to design high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;metal anodes. Benefiting from the high lattice matching between Cu anodes and Ni substrates, Ni substrate&#8208;supported Cu anodes exhibit superior deposition/striping reversibility, lower nucleation overpotential and uniform deposition on the Ni substrates in comparison with other typical substrates.







Abstract
Copper metal is an attractive anode material for aqueous rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity (844&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), good environmental compatibility and high earth abundance. However, the Cu anodes often suffer from poor deposition/stripping reversibility and nonuniform deposition during the charge/discharge process, degrading the lifetime of aqueous Cu&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a lattice&#8208;matching strategy was developed to design high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;metal anodes. In such a strategy, Ni substrates that exhibit high lattice matching with Cu were selected to support the Cu anodes. The high lattice matching endows Cu anodes with high deposition/stripping reversibility, low nucleation overpotential as well as a uniform and dense electrodeposition on Ni substrates. Based on the Ni substrate&#8208;supported Cu anodes, the full cells paired with lead dioxide cathodes show a stable cycling behavior. This work provides a route for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu electrodes in aqueous rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Small Molecule Inhibitors of Interferon&#8208;Induced JAK&#8208;STAT Signalling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule that inhibits IFN&#8208;induced JAK&#8208;STAT signalling is reported. Chemical synthesis led to a series of more effective analogues that can selectively inhibit either IFN&#8208;signalling or formin&#8208;mediated actin assembly.







Abstract
Interferons (IFN) are cytokines which, upon binding to cell surface receptors, trigger a series of downstream biochemical events including Janus Kinase (JAK) activation, phosphorylation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription protein (STAT), translocation of pSTAT to the nucleus and transcriptional activation. Dysregulated IFN signalling has been linked to cancer progression and auto&#8208;immune diseases. Here, we report the serendipitous discovery of a small molecule that blocks IFN&#947; activation of JAK&#8208;STAT signalling. Further lead optimisation gave rise to a potent and more selective analogue that exerts its activity by a mechanism consistent with direct IFN&#947; targeting in vitro, which reduces bleeding in model of haemorrhagic colitis in vivo. This first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule also inhibits type I and III IFN&#8208;induced STAT phosphorylation in vitro. Our work provides the basis for the development of pan&#8208;IFN inhibitory drugs.

         <title>1,5&#8208;Allyl Shift by a Sequential Achmatowicz/Oxonia&#8208;Cope/Retro&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected 1,5&#8208;allyl shift is discovered for allyl furfuryl alcohol through two&#8208;step sequential ring expansion/contraction rearrangement at room temperature, which could be considered as a Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann&#8208;forbidden formal [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. Mechanistically, it involves Achmatowicz rearrangement, oxonia&#8208;Cope rearrangement, and an unprecedented &#8220;retro&#8208;Achmatowicz&#8221; rearrangement.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Allyl and 1,2&#8208;allyl shifts through [3,3]&#8208; and [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements are well&#8208;established and widely used in organic synthesis. In contrast, 1,5&#8208;allyl shift through related [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is unknown because [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is thermally Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann forbidden. Herein, we report an unexpected discovery of a formal 1,5&#8208;allyl shift of allyl furfuryl alcohol through a 2&#8208;step sequential rearrangement. Mechanistically, this formal 1,5&#8208;allyl shift is achieved through a sequential ring expansion/contraction rearrangement: 1) Achmatowicz rearrangement (ring expansion), and 2) cascade oxonia&#8208;Cope rearrangement/retro&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement (ring contraction). This new 1,5&#8208;allyl shift method is demonstrated with &gt;20 examples and expected to find applications in organic synthesis and materials chemistry.

         <title>Mapping Active Site Geometry to Activity in Immobilized Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A many&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic performance of frustrated Lewis pairs is attainable through judicious control of the spatial arrangement of the acid and base components. This is demonstrated for CO2 hydrogenation by mapping the active site geometry to catalyst activity and identifying the optimal distance and orientation of the donor&#8211;acceptor centers using nonlinear scaling relationships.







Abstract
The immobilization of molecular catalysts imposes spatial constraints on their active site. We reveal that in bifunctional catalysis such constraints can also be utilized as an appealing handle to boost intrinsic activity through judicious control of the active site geometry. To demonstrate this, we develop a pragmatic approach, based on nonlinear scaling relationships, to map the spatial arrangements of the acid&#8211;base components of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to their performance in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. The resulting activity map shows that fixing the donor&#8211;acceptor centers at specific distances and locking them into appropriate orientations leads to an unforeseen many&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic activity of FLPs compared to their unconstrained counterparts.

         <title>Bioinspired Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Emeriones&#8197;A&#8211;C
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emeriones, three highly oxidized and densely functionalized polyketides, were synthesized from two enantioenriched fragments in a Stille&#8208;8&#960;/6&#960; sequence, followed by late&#8208;stage stereo&#8208; and chemoselective oxidations. This work enabled the structural revision of emerione&#8197;C.







Abstract
We report asymmetric bioinspired total syntheses of the fungal metabolites emeriones&#8197;A&#8211;C via stereoselective oxidations of two bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene diastereomers. The central bicyclic scaffolds are prepared in an 8&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization cascade of a stereodefined pentaene, which contains the fully assembled side chains of the emeriones. The anti&#8208;aldol side chain is made using a Paterson&#8208;aldol addition, and the epoxide of the dioxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane side chain via ring&#8208;closure onto an oxidized acetal. Our work has enabled the structural revision of emerione&#8197;C, and resulted in the synthesis of a &#8220;missing&#8221; family member, which we call emerione&#8197;D. DFT calculations identified two methyl groups that govern torquoselectivity in the 8&#960;/6&#960; cascade.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroxylation of Dihydrosilanes to Si&#8208;Chiral Silanols Catalyzed by In Situ Generated Copper(II) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)&#8208;mediated &#963;&#8208;metathesis with prochiral dihydrosilanes has been successfully leveraged to efficiently synthesize Si&#8208;chiral silanols as well as many other related Si&#8208;chiral skeletons. The reaction hinges on the continuous generation of catalytically active copper(II) species via single&#8208;electron transfer oxidation of copper(I) by alkyl halides and the efficient stereocontrol with multidentate anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective hydroxylation of prochiral dihydrosilanes with water is expected to be a highly efficient way to access Si&#8208;chiral silanols, yet has remained unknown up to date. Herein, we describe a strategy for realizing this reaction: using an alkyl bromide as a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidant for invoking CuII species and chiral multidentate anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands for effective enantiocontrol. The reaction readily provides a broad range of Si&#8208;chiral silanols with high enantioselectivity and excellent functional group compatibility. In addition, we manifest the synthetic potential by establishing two synthetic schemes for transforming the obtained products into Si&#8208;chiral compounds with high structural diversity. Our preliminary mechanistic studies support a mechanism involving SET for recruiting chiral CuII species as the active catalyst and its subsequent &#963;&#8208;metathesis with dihydrosilanes.

         <title>Bioinspired and Ligand&#8208;Regulated Unnatural Prenylation and Geranylation of Oxindoles with Isoprene under Pd Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy has been developed for the bioinspired and ligand&#8208;regulated chemoselective unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles with isoprene under Pd catalysis. The selectivity was governed by modulating the coordination geometry of the Pd catalyst.







Abstract
In nature, prenylation and geranylation are two important metabolic processes for the creation of hemiterpenoids and monoterpenoids under enzyme catalysis. Herein, we have demonstrated bioinspired unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles using the basic industrial feedstock isoprene through ligand regulation under Pd catalysis. Pentenylated oxindoles (with C5 added) were attained with high selectivity when using a bisphosphine ligand, whereas upon switching to a monophosphine ligand, selectivity toward geranylated oxindoles (with C10 added) was achieved. Moreover, the head&#8208;to&#8208;head product could be further isomerized to an internal skipped diene under Pd&#8722;H catalysis. No stoichiometric by&#8208;product was formed in the process.

         <title>Eu2P2S6: The First Rare&#8208;Earth Chalcogenophosphate Exhibiting Large Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response and High Laser&#8208;Induced Damage Threshold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu2P2S6 exhibits excellent NLO properties, including a phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response &#8776;0.9&#215;AgGaS2@2.1&#8197;&#956;m, and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 3.4&#215;AgGaS2. Eu2P2S6 is the first NLO&#8208;active rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based chalcogenophosphate.







Abstract
Metal chalcogenophosphates are receiving increasing interest, specifically as promising infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) candidates. Here, a rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphate Eu2P2S6 crystallizing in the monoclinic noncentrosymmetric space group Pn was synthesized using a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Its structure features isolated [P2S6]4&#8722; dimer, and two types of EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. Eu2P2S6 exhibits a phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response &#8776;0.9&#215;AgGaS2@2.1&#8197;&#956;m, and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 3.4&#215;AgGaS2, representing the first rare&#8208;earth NLO chalcogenophosphate. The theoretical calculation result suggests that the SHG response is ascribed to the synergetic contribution of [P2S6]4&#8722; dimers and EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. This work provides not only a promising high&#8208;performance infrared NLO material, but also opens the avenue for exploring rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphates as potential IR NLO materials.

         <title>Borylation Directed Borylation of Indoles Using Pyrazabole Electrophiles: A One&#8208;Pot Route to C7&#8208;Borylated&#8208;Indolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophiles based on pyrazabole are simple to access reagents for the double E&#8722;H (E=N/C) borylation of N&#8722;H&#8208;indoles/indolines. Due to the robust B2N4 core of pyrazaboles and a B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation of ca. 3&#8197;&#197;, the first borylation directs the second to a proximal C&#8722;H. For N&#8722;H&#8208;indoles, C7&#8208;borylation occurs alongside reduction resulting, post work&#8208;up, in the one&#8208;pot formation of C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;indolines without requiring installation of a directing group.







Abstract
Pyrazabole (1) is a readily accessible diboron compound that can be transformed into ditopic electrophiles. In 1 (and derivatives), the B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation is ca. 3&#8197;&#197;, appropriate for one boron centre bonding to N and one to the C7 of indoles and indolines. This suitable B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation enables double E&#8722;H (E=N/C) functionalisation of indoles and indolines. Specifically, the activation of 1 with HNTf2 generates an electrophile that transforms N&#8722;H indoles and indolines into N/C7&#8208;diborylated indolines, with N&#8722;H borylation directing subsequent C7&#8722;H borylation. Indole reduction to indoline occurs before C&#8722;H borylation and our studies indicate this proceeds via hydroboration&#8212;C3&#8208;protodeboronation to produce an intermediate that then undergoes C7 borylation. The borylated products can be converted in situ into C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;N&#8208;H&#8208;indolines. Overall, this represents a transient directed C&#8722;H borylation to form useful C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;indolines.

         <title>Intramolecular C&#8722;H Activation as an Easy Toolbox to Synthesize Pyridine&#8208;Fused Bipolar Hosts for Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling reactions have been developed to rapidly build a library of structurally and functionally diverse benzoheteroaromatic&#8208;fused pyridine skeletons. This new synthetic strategy allowed to explore and highlight the high performance of bipolar host materials for blue OLEDs.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenging task. While exploiting new blue emitters has attracted great interest, developing host materials that considerably determine device performance obviously lags behind. Herein, we present an ease of access to the structurally diverse benzoheteroaromatic&#8208;fused pyridine skeletons by the iridium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling reaction, which unlocks an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly assemble a library of pyridine&#8208;fused bipolar host materials. As an illustrated example, the benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine skeleton (BTP) has been made to a pseudo&#8208;symmetric host (DCz&#8208;BTP). The merging of a pyridine fragment enables strong intermolecular interactions, leading to satisfactory bipolar transporting properties. Utilizing DCz&#8208;BTP as the host, blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLEDs (TADF&#8208;OLEDs) exhibit a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.8&#8197;V and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 29.0&#8201;% and blue TADF&#8208;sensitized florescent OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) give an EQEmax as high as 20.5&#8201;%, revealing the potential of the BTP skeleton for the construction of high&#8208;performance host materials.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol at Close to Theoretical Potential via Engineering Abundant Electron&#8208;Donating Cu&#948;+ Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2S1&#8722;x hollow nanocubes with abundant and stable Cu&#948;+ species are synthesized and achieve ethanol&#8208;selective electrosynthesis. The abundant Cu&#948;+ sites have electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to liquid multi&#8208;carbon alcohols provides a promising way for intermittent renewable energy reservation and greenhouse effect mitigation. Cu&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts can produce ethanol, but the in situ formed Cu&#948;+ is insufficient and easily reduced to Cu0. Here a Cu2S1&#8722;x catalyst with abundant Cu&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species is designedly synthesized and exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V for ethanol production. The catalyst not only delivers an outstanding ethanol selectivity of 86.9&#8201;% and a Faradaic efficiency of 73.3&#8201;% but also provides a long&#8208;term stability of Cu&#948;+, gaining an economic profit based on techno&#8208;economic analysis. The calculation and in situ spectroscopic results reveal that the abundant Cu&#948;+ sites display electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.

   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (0&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;1) species on Cu-based electrocatalysts can produce ethanol, but the in situ formed Cu&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is insufficient and easily reduced to Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. Here a Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with abundant Cu&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (0&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;1) species is designedly synthesized and exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V for ethanol production. The catalyst not only delivers an outstanding ethanol selectivity of 86.9&#8201;% and a Faradaic efficiency of 73.3&#8201;% but also provides a long-term stability of Cu&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, gaining an economic profit based on techno-economic analysis. The calculation and in situ spectroscopic results reveal that the abundant Cu&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites display electron-donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential-determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolution and Single&#8208;Droplet Analysis of Fuel&#8208;Driven Compartments by Droplet&#8208;Based Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet&#8208;based microfluidics were used to encapsulate a fuel&#8208;driven cycle that drives phase separation into coacervate&#8208;based droplets. This approach enables the analysis of every coacervate&#8208;based droplet in the reaction container throughout its lifetime. The nucleation, growth, and dissolution of active coacervate&#8208;based droplets were investigated with this setup.







Abstract
Active droplets are a great model for membraneless organelles. However, the analysis of these systems remains challenging and is often limited due to the short timescales of their kinetics. We used droplet&#8208;based microfluidics to encapsulate a fuel&#8208;driven cycle that drives phase separation into coacervate&#8208;based droplets to overcome this challenge. This approach enables the analysis of every coacervate&#8208;based droplet in the reaction container throughout its lifetime. We discovered that the fuel concentration dictates the formation of the coacervate&#8208;based droplets and their properties. We observed that coacervate&#8208;based droplets grow through fusion, decay simultaneously independent of their volume, and shrinkage rate scales with their initial volume. This method helps to further understand the regulation of membraneless organelles, and we believe the analysis of individual coacervate&#8208;based droplets enables future selection&#8208; or evolution&#8208;based studies.

         <title>Synthesis and Visualization of Entangled 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with High&#8208;Valency Stereoscopic Molecular Nodes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;valency quadrangular prism (D4h) stereoscopic molecular node is used to synthesize two isoreticular 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Low&#8208;dose electron microscopy unravels their 2&#8208;fold interpenetrating networks with a bcu topology. The unique pore architectures and strong binding sites enable excellent performance in separating C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 gas pairs. The high&#8208;valency molecular node may lead to new 3D COF topologies.







Abstract
The structural diversity of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are limited as there are only a few choices of building units with multiple symmetrically distributed connection sites. To date, 4 and 6&#8208;connected stereoscopic nodes with Td, D3h, D3d and C3 symmetries have been mostly reported, delivering limited 3D topologies. We propose an efficient approach to expand the 3D COF repertoire by introducing a high&#8208;valency quadrangular prism (D4h) stereoscopic node with a connectivity of eight, based on which two isoreticular 3D imine&#8208;linked COFs can be created. Low&#8208;dose electron microscopy allows the direct visualization of their 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated bcu networks. These 3D COFs are endowed with unique pore architectures and strong molecular binding sites, and exhibit excellent performance in separating C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 gas pairs. The introduction of high&#8208;valency stereoscopic nodes would lead to an outburst of new topologies for 3D COFs.

A series of C&#8208;aryl pyranosides and furanosides were synthesized by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the key pathway of ortho&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation involves an oxidative addition/reductive elimination process, while aryl meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation is mediated by &#963;&#8208;activation. DFT calculations showed that steric hindrance is responsible for the high stereoselectivity of meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation.







Abstract
C&#8208;aryl glycosides are popular basic skeletons in biochemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein, ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed highly stereo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation is described. A series of C&#8208;aryl pyranosides and furanosides were synthesized by this method. The strategy showed good substrate scope, and various N&#8208;heterocyclic directing groups were compatible with the reaction system. A mechanistic study suggested that the key pathway of ortho&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation might involve oxidative addition/reduction elimination, whereas aryl meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation was mediated by &#963;&#8208;activation. Density functional theory calculations also showed that the high stereoselectivity of meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation was due to steric hindrance.

         <title>Controlling the Valence&#8208;Electron Arrangement of Nickel Active Centers for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The valence&#8208;electron arrangement of Ni active centers can be controlled precisely by introducing Ni vacancies into electrocatalysts for facilitated hydrogen oxidation. Benefiting from the optimized valence&#8208;electron&#8208;orbital interactions with key intermediates, the Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N exhibited a 15&#8208;fold enhanced mass activity in comparison with Ni3N which has far fewer Ni vacancies.







Abstract
The valence&#8208;electron arrangement of heterogeneous catalysts can significantly affect the binding behavior of absorbates. However, it remains a challenge to understand the role of the valence&#8208;electron arrangement in electrocatalysis, which limits its utilization as a tool to design efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we describe experiments in which the valence&#8208;electron arrangement of Ni active centers for hydrogen oxidation is controlled precisely by using Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N as a platform. These Ni vacancies can promote the valence&#8208;electron delocalization of OH&#8208;adsorption centers to enhance the Ni&#8201;ds&#8211;O&#8201;2p valence&#8208;electron&#8208;orbital interaction with elevated OH adsorption. Meanwhile, the deficit of valence&#8208;electrons of H&#8208;adsorption centers at Ni vacancies can lower Ni&#8201;ds&#8211;H&#8201;1s interaction with weakened H binding. Relative to Ni3N poor in vacancies, the Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N showed a mass activity enhanced by 15&#8208;fold. This strategy paves a rational way to design efficient catalysts by finely tuning the valence&#8208;electron arrangement.

These Ni vacancies can promote the valence-electron delocalization of OH-adsorption centers to enhance the Ni&#8201;&lt;i&gt;ds&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;O&#8201;2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; valence-electron-orbital interaction with elevated OH adsorption. Meanwhile, the deficit of valence-electrons of H-adsorption centers at Ni vacancies can lower Ni&#8201;&lt;i&gt;ds&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;H&#8201;1&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; interaction with weakened H binding. Relative to Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N poor in vacancies, the Ni-vacancy-enriched Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N showed a mass activity enhanced by 15-fold. This strategy paves a rational way to design efficient catalysts by finely tuning the valence-electron arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Active Si Sites Enabled by Negative Valent Ru for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in LaRuSi</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike other Ru&#8208;containing compounds whose active sites are Ru sites, the Si sites in LaRuSi function as real active sites. The unusual negative valence Ru in this compound has excessively tight adsorption for hydrogen, according to both theoretical calculations and in situ Raman observations, but the Si sites have excellent hydrogen adsorption properties.







Abstract
The discovery and identification of novel active sites are paramount for deepening the understanding of the catalytic mechanism and driving the development of remarkable electrocatalysts. Here, we reveal that the genuine active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in LaRuSi are Si sites, not the usually assumed Ru sites. Ru in LaRuSi has a peculiar negative valence state, which leads to strong hydrogen binding to Ru sites. Surprisingly, the Si sites have a Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption that is near zero (0.063&#8197;eV). The moderate adsorption of hydrogen on Si sites during the HER process is also validated by in situ Raman analysis. Based on it, LaRuSi exhibits an overpotential of 72&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, which is close to the benchmark of Pt/C. This work sheds light on the recognition of real active sites and the exploration of innovative silicide HER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Kibdelomycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent synthesis of kibdelomycin, which leveraged readily available starting materials, enabled the efficient preparation of the potent antimicrobial and its C&#8208;22 epimer in 16 steps (LLS). The modularity of the strategy provided rapid access to 8 analogs, allowing investigation of structural activity relation.







Abstract
A modular total synthesis of kibdelomycin is disclosed that should enable structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies of this interesting class of antibiotics. The route uses simple building blocks and addresses lingering questions about its structural assignment and relationship to amycolamicin, a recently described natural product reported to have a similar structure. Initial antibacterial assays reveal that both C&#8208;22 epimers (the N&#8208;glycosidic linkage) of the natural product have similar activity while structurally truncated analogs lose activity.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Stable Iron Pentacarbonyl Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The open&#8208;shell iron pentacarbonyl cation [Fe(CO)5].+ was synthesized and isolated as a stable salt for the first time. The strategy involved the use of a strong deelectronator, i.e., single&#8208;electron oxidant, in combination with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs). The iron carbonyl complex is a novel example of low&#8208;valent iron and has thus been fully characterized. Isolation was achieved using standard laboratory conditions in combination with fluorinated benzenes as solvents.







Abstract
The open&#8208;shell iron pentacarbonyl cation [Fe(CO)5].+ was isolated by deelectronation, i.e., the single&#8208;electron oxidation of the parent neutral Fe(CO)5 using [phenazineF].+ as the [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; salt (RF=C(CF3)3; phenazineF=perfluoro&#8208;5,10&#8208;bis(perfluorophenyl)&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine). [Fe(CO)5].+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; was fully characterized (scXRD analysis, IR, NMR, EPR, 57Fe spectroscopy, CV and SQUID magnetization study) and, apart from being a compound of fundamental interest, may serve as a precursor for low&#8208;valent iron coordination chemistry.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry Engineered Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photoanode with Ultralow Onset Potential for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the film/substrate interface via coordination chemistry, a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) photoanode featuring intimate contact between the PCN film and the titanium&#8208;coated fluorine&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate was derived. Benefitting from the substantially reduced interfacial resistance credited by the strong coordination interaction, a record ultralow onset potential which enables unbiased water splitting is achieved.







Abstract
Construction of an intimate film/substrate interface is of great importance for a photoelectrode to achieve efficient photoelectrochemical performance. Inspired by coordination chemistry, a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) film is intimately grown on a Ti&#8208;coated substrate by an in situ thermal condensation process. The as&#8208;prepared PCN photoanode exhibits a record low onset potential (Eonset) of &#8722;0.38&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a decent photocurrent density of 242&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE for water splitting. Detailed characterization confirms that the origin of the ultralow onset potential is mainly attributed to the substantially reduced interfacial resistance between the Ti&#8208;coated substrate and the PCN film benefitting from the constructed interfacial sp2 N&#8594;Ti coordination bonds. For the first time, the ultralow onset potential enables the PCN photoanode to drive water splitting without external bias with a stable photocurrent density of &#8776;9&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 up to 1&#8197;hour.

An endo&#8208;directing group strategy enables enantioselective (3+1+2) cycloadditions that are triggered by carbonylative C&#8722;C bond activation of cyclopropanes. These processes are rare examples of cycloadditions where C&#8722;C bond oxidative addition is enantiodetermining.

         <title>The Microscopic Diamond Anvil Cell: Stabilization of Superhard, Superconducting Carbon Allotropes at Ambient Pressure</title>

DAC&#8208;carbon: A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. The superhard sp3 carbon framework serves as a microscopic diamond anvil cell, in which the sp2 chains are compressed to establish metallicity and superconductivity.







Abstract
A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. It is composed of an sp3 carbon framework that acts as a diamond anvil cell by constraining the distance between parallel cis&#8208;polyacetylene chains. The distance between these sp2 carbon atoms renders the phase metallic, and yields two well&#8208;nested nearly parallel bands that cross the Fermi level. Calculations show this phase is a conventional superconductor, with the motions of the sp2 carbons being key contributors to the electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The sp3 carbon atoms impart superior mechanical properties, with a predicted Vickers hardness of 48&#8197;GPa. This phase, metastable at ambient conditions, could be made by on&#8208;surface polymerization of graphene nanoribbons, followed by pressurization of the resulting 2D sheets. A family of multifunctional materials with tunable superconducting and mechanical properties could be derived from this phase by varying the sp2 versus sp3 carbon content, and by doping.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free N&#8722;H Bond Activation by Phospha&#8208;Wittig Reagents
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile activation of NH3 with the aid of phospha&#8208;Wittig reagents has been demonstrated to give for the first time secondary aminophoshines of the type ArP(H)NH2. Evident from DFT calculations two molecules of NH3 act in concert to facilitate an NH3 for PMe3 exchange and subsequent proton shift. The activation of primary and secondary amines is likewise achieved.







Abstract
N&#8208;containing molecules are mostly derived from ammonia (NH3). Ammonia activation has been demonstrated for single transition metal centers as well as for low&#8208;valent main group species. Phosphinidenes, mono&#8208;valent phosphorus species, can be stabilized by phosphines, giving so&#8208;called phosphanylidenephosphoranes of the type RP(PR&#8242;3). We demonstrate the facile, metal&#8208;free NH3 activation using ArP(PMe3), affording for the first time isolable secondary aminophosphines ArP(H)NH2. DFT studies reveal that two molecules of NH3 act in concert to facilitate an NH3 for PMe3 exchange. Furthermore, H2NR and HNR2 activation is demonstrated.

         <title>An Intelligent Nanomachine Guided by DNAzyme Logic System for Precise Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intelligent nanomachine usually has a control center to carry out self&#8208;regulation. Unfortunately, most of the nanomaterials for chemodynamic therapy (CDT) do not have such a control center to sense and process the chemical or biological signals, which greatly weakens the selectivity and efficiency of CDT. To address this problem, here an intelligent nanomachine was constructed with a DNAzyme logic gate as the control center, and metal organic framework as the actuator. The well&#8208;designed nanomachine showed an enhanced killing effect on cancer cells but posed no harm to normal cells, acquiring better selectivity than clinical chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin and cisplatin). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported cell&#8208;specific CDT by the guidance of DNAzyme logic gate. Our work highlights the great potential of DNAzymes in intelligent response networks, and extends the implementation of nanomachines in precision medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobaloxime Photocatalysis for Phosphorylated Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, cobaloxime is disclosed for the first time to achieve phosphorylated heteroaromatics, which is an intriguing and versatile functional motif. With visible&#8208;light irradiation, cobaloxime not only oxidizes phosphine oxide to form phosphorus radical (P&#8208;radical) for subsequent reaction with radical acceptor isocyanides or heteroaromatics, but also combines the radical intermediate with &#946;&#8208;H elimination, thereby producing phosphorylated heteroaromatics with only H2 or CH4 as byproduct. Phosphine oxides with dialkyl, alkylaryl, and diaryl could be directly transformed into phosphorylated phenanthridines, benzothiazoles, isoquinolines and common heteroaromatics. This catalytic system features extremely mild conditions, broad substrate scope and good to excellent yields, in which scale&#8208;up reaction and sunlight reaction have shown great application potential in green synthesis of important organophosphorus chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Radical Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simplified and appealing strategy via a chiral catalyst to facilitate the electrochemical process and provide asymmetric induction of radical reactions is particularly desirable and would have potential applications in electrosynthesis, organic chemistry, and drug discovery. Here, we introduced a novel electrolytic system that diverts the standard ionic reactivity to new catalytic functions, enabling mechanistically distinct single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;based enantioselective routes to exhibit a brand&#8208;new pattern of reactivity&#8212;electricity&#8208;driven asymmetric catalysis as a privileged chiral platform for enantioselective radical allylation. The nickel&#8208;catalyzed activation of nucleophiles triggered a single&#8208;electron transfer process to provide a chiral catalyst&#8208;bound radical cation intermediate, which could be applied as an alternative strategy for the development of stereocontrolled radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Strain Relaxation on 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual strain in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite films is investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. Strain relaxation facilitated by the organic spacer cations leads to improved film quality, suppressed recombination, and enhanced device performance under external stress.







Abstract
Although the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached the commercial standards, the unsatisfactory stability limits their further application. Hydrophobic interface and encapsulation can block the damage of water and oxygen, while the instability induced by intrinsic residual strain remains inevitable. Here, the residual strain in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite film is investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. It's found that the spacer cations contribute to the residual strain even though they are not in the inorganic cages. Benefited from strain relaxation, the film quality is improved, leading to suppressed recombination, promoted charge transport and enhanced efficiency. More significantly, the strain&#8208;released devices maintain 86&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after being kept in air with 85&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) for 1080&#8197;h, 82&#8201;% under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 804&#8197;h and 86&#8201;% after continuous heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1080&#8197;h.

         <title>Methyl Substitution Destabilizes Alkyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Question everything: Radical stability decreases, and not increases, from methyl to primary to secondary to tertiary. This is not conflicting with the fact that the C&#8722;H bond becomes weaker along the corresponding series H3C&#8722;H, MeH2C&#8722;H, Me2HC&#8722;H, and Me3C&#8722;H. The resolution to this seeming contradiction is that the parent MemH3&#8722;mC&#8722;H is destabilized even more upon methyl substitution than the radical MemH3&#8722;mC&#8901;.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically investigated how methyl substituents affect the stability of alkyl radicals MemH3&#8722;mC&#8901; and the corresponding MemH3&#8722;mC&#8722;X bonds (X&#8201;=&#8201;H, CH3, OH; m&#8201;=&#8201;0&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;3) using density functional theory at M06&#8208;2X/TZ2P. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in physical organic chemistry is that alkyl radicals are stabilized upon an increase in their degree of substitution from methyl&lt;primary&lt;secondary&lt;tertiary, and that this is the underlying cause for the decrease in C&#8722;H bond strength along this series. Here, we provide evidence that falsifies this model and show that, on the contrary, the MemH3&#8722;mC&#8901; radical is destabilized with increasing substitution. The reason that the corresponding C&#8722;H bond nevertheless becomes weaker is that substitution destabilizes the sterically more congested MemH3&#8722;mC&#8722;H molecule even more.

The state-of-the-art in physical organic chemistry is that alkyl radicals are stabilized upon an increase in their degree of substitution from methyl&amp;lt;primary&amp;lt;secondary&amp;lt;tertiary, and that this is the underlying cause for the decrease in C&#8722;H bond strength along this series. Here, we provide evidence that falsifies this model and show that, on the contrary, the Me&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;m&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8901; radical is &lt;i&gt;destabilized&lt;/i&gt; with increasing substitution. The reason that the corresponding C&#8722;H bond nevertheless becomes weaker is that substitution destabilizes the sterically more congested Me&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;m&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8722;H molecule even more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Adaptive Rhodium Catalyst to Control the Hydrogenation Network of Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive rhodium&#8208;based catalyst for controlled hydrogenation of nitroarenes to hydroxylamines and anilines is presented. Both product platforms could be accessed under mild conditions and excellent yields using molecular hydrogen as the reducing agent. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to shed light on the mode of functioning of the catalyst and elucidate the origin of adaptivity.







Abstract
An adaptive catalytic system that provides control over the nitroarene hydrogenation network to prepare a wide range of aniline and hydroxylamine derivatives is presented. This system takes advantage of a delicate interplay between a rhodium(III) center and a Lewis acidic borane introduced in the secondary coordination sphere of the metal. The high chemoselectivity of the catalyst in the presence of various potentially vulnerable functional groups and its readiness to be deployed at a preparative scale illustrate its practicality. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to shed light on the mode of functioning of the catalyst and elucidate the origin of adaptivity. The competition for interaction with boron between a solvent molecule and a substrate was found crucial for adaptivity. When operating in THF, the reduction network stops at the hydroxylamine platform, whereas the reaction can be directed to the aniline platform in toluene.

         <title>Synergy of Weakly&#8208;Solvated Electrolyte and Optimized Interphase Enables Graphite Anode Charge at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte and a high&#8208;quality SEI by room&#8208;temperature formation process, which enables graphite electrode with a fast&#8208;charging 6C&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature operation. Moreover, the Gr||LiFePO4 full cell exhibits a capacity retention of 78&#8201;% at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and a high discharge capacity of 37&#8201;% even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively.







Abstract
Graphite anode suffers from great capacity loss and even fails to charge (i.e. Li+&#8208;intercalation) under low temperature, mainly arising from the large overpotential including sluggish de&#8208;solvation process and insufficient ions movement in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, an electrolyte is developed by utilizing weakly solvated molecule ethyl trifluoroacetate and film&#8208;forming fluoroethylene carbonate to achieve smooth de&#8208;solvation and high ionic conductivity at low temperature. Evolution of SEI formed at different temperatures is further investigated to propose an effective room&#8208;temperature SEI formation strategy for low&#8208;temperature operations. The synergetic effect of tamed electrolyte and optimized SEI enables graphite with a reversible charge/discharge capacity of 183&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and fast&#8208;charging up to 6C&#8208;rate at room temperature. Moreover, graphite||LiFePO4 full cell maintains a capacity retention of 78&#8201;% at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, and 37&#8201;% even at a super&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. This work offers a progressive insight towards fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective de novo Construction of Chiral Arenes through Desymmetrizing Oxidative [4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization approach to centrally chiral unfunctionalized arenes is developed through the enantioselective de novo construction of the arene ring by oxidative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of polycyclic meso&#8208;cyclohexenediones. Catalyzed by a diphenylprolinol silyl ether, this external oxidant&#8208;free protocol gives rise to diversely substituted chiral arenes with outstanding enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.0&#8201;:&#8201;0.1 e.r.).







Abstract
Central chirality in arene derivatives arising out of unsymmetrically substituted arene ring is a fascinating yet rarely explored research topic. Here, we report a desymmetrization approach to centrally chiral unfunctionalized arenes, which is enabled by the enantioselective de novo construction of the arene ring. This operationally simple protocol is based on a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between polycyclic meso&#8208;cyclohexenediones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, and doesn't usually require any external oxidant. Catalyzed by a diphenylprolinol silyl ether, this reaction proceeds via dienamine intermediate and greatly simplifies the access to diversely substituted chiral arenes with outstanding enantioselectivities.

         <title>Manipulating Reaction Intermediates to Aqueous&#8208;Phase&#160; ZnSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters and Quantum Dots at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is not resolved which model describes better the aqueous&#8208;phase nucleation and growth of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), the classical one&#8208;step one or the nonclassical multi&#8208;step one. Here, we design a room&#8208;temperature reaction to trap reaction intermediates in the prenucleation stage of ZnSe QDs (as a model system). We show that the trapped intermediate can transform to magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) via intra&#8208;molecular reorganization and can fragment to enable the growth of QDs. The MSCs exhibit a sharp optical absorption peaking at 299 nm, labelled MSC&#8208;299. The intermediate, the precursor compound (PC&#8208;299) of MSC&#8208;299, is optically transparent at 299 nm and to longer wavelengths. This intermediate forms in various Zn and Se reaction systems. The present study provides unambiguous evidence that the nonclassical and classical pathways are both necessary to explain the nucleation and growth of aqueous&#8208;phase QDs, with the former pathway favored more by high reaction concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Quinone&#8208;Based Anodes with Rapid Kinetics for Rechargeable Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinone compounds, which are capable of accommodating proton (H  +  ), are emerging electrodes in aqueous batteries. However, the storage mechanism of proton in quinone compounds is less known and the energy/power density of quinone&#8208;based proton battery is still limited. Here we design a series of quinone anodes and study their electrochemical properties in acidic electrolyte, in which tetramethylquinone (TMBQ) delivers a high capacity of 300 mAh g  &#8211;1  with an extremely low polarization of 20 mV at 1 C, and maintains over 50% theoretical capacity in less than 16 seconds. The fast kinetics of TMBQ is attributed to the continuous H  +  migration channel, high H  +  diffusion coefficient (10  &#8211;6  cm  2  s  &#8211;1  ), and low H  +  migration energy barrier (0.26 eV). When coupling with MnO  2  cathode, the battery shows a long lifespan of 4000 cycles with a capacity retention of 77% at 5 C. This study reveals the proton transport in quinone&#8208;electrodes and offers new insights to design advanced aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol over Carbon&#8208;Coated CuOx Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient Cu&#8208;based catalysts is critical for CO2 electroreduction to multiple carbon products. However, most Cu&#8208;based catalysts are favorable for ethylene production while selective production of ethanol with high Faradaic efficiency and current density still remains great challenges. Herein, we design a carbon&#8208;coated CuOx (CuOx@C) catalyst through one&#8208;pot pyrolysis of Cu&#8208;based metal organic framework, which exhibits high selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with Faradaic efficiency of 46%. Impressively, the partial current density of ethanol reaches 166 mA cm&#8208;2, which is higher than that of most catalysts in the literatures. Operando Raman spectra indicate that the carbon skin can efficiently stabilize Cu+ species under CO2 electroreduction conditions, which promotes C&#8208;C coupling step. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the carbon layer can tune the key intermediate *HOCHCH goes the hydrogenation pathway toward ethanol production.</dc:description>

         <title>Generating High&#8208;valent Iron&#8208;oxo &#8801;FeIV=O Complexes in Neutral Microenvironments through Peroxymonosulfate Activation by Zn&#8722;Fe Layered Double Hydroxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The universal limit on the pH conditions is disturbing peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;triggered high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo systems in environmental applications. Here, we propose for the first time the construction of a neutral microenvironment on the surface of Zn&#8208;Fe layered double hydroxide (ZnFe&#8208;LDH) by using the amphoteric properties of zinc hydroxide, which continuously generates &#8801;FeIV=O over a wide pH range of 3.0~11.0 in activating PMS. The &#8801;Zn(OH)2 moiety offers a neutral microenvironment at the phase interface, which mitigates the self&#8208;decomposition of &#8801;FeIV=O by protons and the hydrolysis reaction of iron by hydroxyl groups, which is supported by the Mossbauer spectra, density functional theory calculations and designed experiments. Consequently, ZnFe&#8208;LDH/PMS can satisfy the stability in long&#8208;term experiments, selectivity under conditions with high salinity or natural organic matter and efficient treatment of actual wastewater.</dc:description>

Herein, a &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent template strategy based on azo group has been developed, which features dual intramolecular macrocyclizations directed by a tetra&#8208;substituted azobenzene core, followed by traceless removal of the azo linker. Employing this strategy, the efficient synthesis of a novel all&#8208;benzene [2]catenane consisting of meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes has been accomplished.</dc:description>

         <title>In vivo Realization of Combined Photodynamic and Photothermal Therapy for Melanoma by Mitochondria Targeting Dinuclear Ruthenium Complexes under Civil Infrared Low&#8208;power Laser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes with extremely high TPA cross sections in the range of 800&#8722;900 nm have been designed. The amphiphilic complex  Ru3  containing tert&#8208;butyl groups has balanced performance in singlet oxygen generation and photothermal conversion and becomes the ideal drug candidate of the series.  Ru3  targets mitochondria without penetrating the nucleus, which substantially increases its photodynamic therapy activity and reduces its dark cytotoxicity.  Ru3  successfully suppresses melanoma tumor growth in vitro and in vivo with combined photodynamic and photothermal therapy under low light dose irradiation of an 808 nm low&#8208;power laser, avoiding the known PDT resistance in melanoma. The excellent therapeutic effect of  Ru3  facilitates its applications in further human trials for larger or deeper buried tumors, thereby becoming a prospective candidate for a new generation of low&#8208;power IR&#8208;driven dual PDT/PTT drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Persistent Polarization Change in a Spin Transition Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using light as a local heat source to induce a temporary pyroelectric current is widely recognized as an effective way to control the polarization of crystalline materials. In contrast, harnessing light directly to modulate the polarization of a crystal via excitation of the electronic bands remains less explored. In this study, we report an Fe(II) spin crossover crystal that exhibits photoinduced macroscopic polarization change upon excitation by green light. When the excited crystal relaxes to the ground state, the corresponding pyroelectric current can be detected. An analysis of the structures, magnetic properties and the M&#246;ssbauer and infrared spectra of the complex, supported by calculations, revealed that the polarization change is dictated by the directional relative movement of ions during the spin transition process. The spin transition and polarization change occur simultaneously in response to light stimulus, which demonstrates the enormous potential of polar spin crossover systems in the field of optoelectronic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unblocking Ion&#8208;occluded Pore Channels in Poly(triazine imide) Framework for Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride hosting &#197;&#8208;scale pores attractive for selective molecular transport. AA&#8217;&#8208;stacked PTI layers are synthesized by ionothermal route during which ions occupy the framework and occlude the pores. Synthesis of ion&#8208;free PTI hosting AB&#8208;stacked layers has been reported, however, pores in this configuration are blocked by the neighboring layer. The unavailability of open pore limits application of PTI in molecular transport. Herein, we demonstrate acid treatment for ion depletion which maintains AA&#8217; stacking and results in open pore structure. We provide first direct evidence of ion&#8208;depleted open pores by imaging with the atomic resolution using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. Depending on the extent of ion&#8208;exchange, AA&#8217; stacking with open channels and AB stacking with closed channels are obtained and imaged for the first time. The accessibility of open channels is demonstrated by enhanced proton transport through ion depleted PTI.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride hosting &#197;-scale pores attractive for selective molecular transport. AA&#8217;-stacked PTI layers are synthesized by ionothermal route during which ions occupy the framework and occlude the pores. Synthesis of ion-free PTI hosting AB-stacked layers has been reported, however, pores in this configuration are blocked by the neighboring layer. The unavailability of open pore limits application of PTI in molecular transport.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of alkylthio electrophiles in synthesis remains elusive by the lack of access to a suitable reagent that is practical and of excellent enantioselectivity and appropriate reactivity. In this work we introduce a novel alkylthio reagent based on the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (MMTD) fragment for direct alkylsulfenylation of ketones and aldehydes. It can be readily prepared from oxidative coupling between thiadiazole and other alkylthiols and merge with chiral primary aminocatalysis successfully. This protocol provides facile access for the construction of diverse &#945;&#8208;alkylthio quaternary carbon with good stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Carbamoyloximes for the Activation of Secondary Amines in Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanophores are molecular moieties that are incorporated into polymers and respond to force with constitutional, configurational, or conformational bond rearrangements to enable functionality. Up to today, several chemically latent motifs have been activated by polymer mechanochemical methods, but the generation of secondary amines remains elusive. Here we report carbamoyloximes as mechanochemical protecting groups for secondary amines. We show that carbamoyloximes undergo force&#8208;induced homolytic bond scission at the N&#8208;O oxime bond in polymers thus producing the free amine, as the reaction proceeds via the carbamoyloxyl and aminyl radicals, analogously to its photochemical counterpart. Eventually, we apply the carbamoyloxime motif in a force&#8208;activated organocatalytic Knoevenagel reaction. We believe that this protecting strategy can be universally applied for many other secondary and primary amines in polymer materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An Optically Anisotropic Crystal with Large Birefringence Arising from Cooperative &#960; Orbitals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent materials are highly demanded for high&#8208;performance polarized optics. As compared with artificial anisotropic metamaterials, anisotropic crystals have advantages of low optical losses and easy processing, but their birefringence is still limited. Herein, based on first&#8208;principles studies, we identified a new type of functional anion units, (HxC6N9)(3&#8208;x)&#8208; (x = 0, 1, 2), and then successfully synthesized a new anisotropic crystal, namely, CsH2C6N9&#183;H2O (I), whose crystal structure consists of (H2C6N9)&#8208; anions. Remarkably, I is ultraviolet&#160;transparent and exhibits very large birefringence of about 0.55@550 nm, which is much larger than those of commercial birefringent crystals. These results make I a candidate for highly efficient manipulation of optics and light in optical modulation devices. Theoretical calculations reveal that large birefringence mainly arises from the cooperative &#960; orbitals in (H2C6N9)&#8208; anions. This work provides a new insight on the underlying structure&#8208;property relationships of anisotropic crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>H2O2&#8208;Responsive NIR&#8208;II AIE Nanobomb for Carbon Monoxide Boosting Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The upregulated expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) impairs the therapeutic efficacy of photothermal therapy (PTT). Inhibition of HSPs repair is crucial for improving the efficiency of low&#8208;temperature PTT. The AIE nanobomb PBPTV@mPEG(CO) could be triggered by the over&#8208;expressed hydrogen peroxide in the tumor microenvironment and release CO to inhibit the upregulated expression of HSPs during low&#8208;temperature PTT to enhance the antitumor efficiency.







Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT), which circumvents the limitations of conventional PTT (e.g., thermotolerance and adverse effects), is an emerging therapeutic strategy which shows great potential for future clinical applications. The expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) can dramatically impair the therapeutic efficacy of PTT. Thus, inhibition of HSPs repair and reducing the damage of nearby normal cells is crucial for improving the efficiency of low&#8208;temperature PTT. Herein, we developed a nanobomb based on the self&#8208;assembly of NIRII AIE polymer PBPTV and carbon monoxide (CO) carrier polymer mPEG(CO). This smart nanobomb can be exploded in a tumor microenvironment in which hydrogen peroxide is overexpressed and release CO into cancer cells to significantly inhibit the expression of HSPs and hence improve the antitumor efficiency of the low&#8208;temperature PTT.

         <title>Sulfur&#8211;Phenolate Exchange: SuFEx&#8208;Derived Dynamic Covalent Reactions and Degradation of SuFEx Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur(VI)&#8211;phenolate exchange (SuPhenEx) reaction between sulfonimidates and phenols has been shown to generate new sulfonimidates that undergo dynamic covalent reactions with other phenols. The fast, high&#8208;yielding, and enantiospecific reactions are useful for both asymmetric synthesis and the degradation of SuFEx polymers. The wide scope of the reaction extends the usefulness of SuFEx and related click reactions.







Abstract
The products of the SuFEx reaction between sulfonimidoyl fluorides and phenols, sulfonimidates, are shown to display dynamic covalent chemistry with other phenols. This reaction was shown to be enantiospecific, finished in minutes at room temperature in high yields, and useful for both asymmetric synthesis and sustainable polymer production. Its wide scope further extends the usefulness of SuFEx and related click chemistries.

         <title>Third&#8208;Generation Covalent TMP&#8208;Tag for Fast Labeling and Multiplexed Imaging of Cellular Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The third&#8208;generation TMP&#8208;tag3 is developed. It features optimized synthesis, fluorogenic labeling, and fast cellular intake. It performs well in comparative studies with HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag. The 18&#8197;kD&#8208;protein tag is compatible with loop insertion. The TMP&#8208;tag3 supplements and supplants the existing self&#8208;labeling protein tags, adding an orthogonal channel for multiplexed labeling and nanoscopic imaging.







Abstract
Self&#8208;labeling protein tags can introduce advanced molecular motifs to specific cellular proteins. Here we introduce the third&#8208;generation covalent TMP&#8208;tag (TMP&#8208;tag3) and showcase its comparison with HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag. TMP&#8208;tag3 is based on a proximity&#8208;induced covalent Michael addition between an engineered Cys of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) and optimized trimethoprim (TMP)&#8211;acrylamide conjugates with minimal linkers. Compared to previous versions, the TMP&#8208;tag3 features an enhanced permeability when conjugated to fluorogenic spirocyclic rhodamines. As a small protein, the 18&#8208;kD eDHFR is advantageous in tagging selected mitochondrial proteins which are less compatible with bulkier HaloTag fusions. The proximal N&#8722;C termini of eDHFR also enable facile insertion into various protein loops. TMP&#8208;tag3, HaloTag, and SNAP&#8208;tag are orthogonal to each other, collectively forming a toolbox for multiplexed live&#8208;cell imaging of cellular proteins under fluorescence nanoscopy.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional Inorganic Analogue of 9,10&#8208;Diazido&#8208;9,10&#8208;Diboraanthracene: A Lewis Superacidic Azido Borane with Reactivity and Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
The 3D analogue of 9,10&#8208;diazido&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodiboraanthracene exists as a monomer in both the solid and solution state. It is thermally stable up to 230&#8201;&#176;C, representing a rare example of an azido borane with boosted Lewis acidity and stability in one. Apart from the classical acid&#8208;base and Staudinger reactions, it is capable of E&#8722;H bond activation (E=B, Si, Ge).







Abstract
Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) inorganic analogue of 9,10&#8208;diazido&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodiboraantracene, which turned out to be a monomer in both the solid and solution state, and thermally stable up to 230&#8201;&#176;C, representing a rare example of azido borane with boosted Lewis acidity and stability in one. Apart from the classical acid&#8208;base and Staudinger reactions, E&#8722;H bond activation (E=B, Si, Ge) was investigated. While the reaction with B&#8722;H (9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) led directly to the 1,1&#8208;addition on N&#945; upon N2 elimination, the Si&#8722;H (Et3SiH, PhMe2SiH) activation proceeded stepwise via 1,2&#8208;addition, with the key intermediates 5int and 6int being isolated and characterized. In contrast, the cooperative Ge&#8722;H was reversible and stayed at the 1,2&#8208;addition step.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Adaptive Chiral [1]Rotaxane for Thermo&#8208;Rulable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of covalently &#8220;potting&#8221; an emitter into a flexible chiral macrocycle was proposed to achieve steerable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities in solid state. The concept benefits from the adaptive confinement of the emitter in the nanocavity of the self&#8208;assembled nanoarchitectures.







Abstract
It remains a formidable challenge to realize thermo&#8208;rulable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we propose a new strategy by covalently &#8220;potting&#8221; the emitter into a flexible chiral macrocycle as an adaptive chiral [1]rotaxane to address this issue. Different from its included analogue, the potted emitter [DS] showed adaptive conformers with tunable CPL in varied solvents. Significantly, upon controlled self&#8208;assembly, [DS] formed a channel&#8208;type nanoarchitecture ([DS]A), which exhibited an extraordinary thermo&#8208;rulable CPL between 25&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, the glum was large as 0.024 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which was amplified to 0.040 at 90&#8201;&#176;C with a decrease of QY (from 92&#8201;% to 80&#8201;%). By comparison, the assemblies of cage&#8208;type [DS]B and the unpotted emitter showed irreversible or unanswered thermal behaviors. The work demonstrated the thermo&#8208;rulable and durable CPL for the first time and provided an insightful understanding of thermal effect on high&#8208;temperature and switchable CPL materials.

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling in Catalytic Hydrolysis and Alcoholysis of Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;giant&#8221; kinetic isotope effect (KIE=346) has been observed for the generation of hydrogen from the hydrolysis of silanes catalyzed by a silyl&#8208;iridium(III) complex. This and other experimental evidence together with theoretical calculations have been used to demonstrate the participation of hydrogen quantum tunneling in this catalytic process.







Abstract
An unprecedented quantum tunneling effect has been observed in catalytic Si&#8722;H bond activations at room temperature. The cationic hydrido&#8208;silyl&#8208;iridium(III) complex, {Ir[SiMe(o&#8208;C6H4SMe)2](H)(PPh3)(THF)}[BArF4], has proven to be a highly efficient catalyst for the hydrolysis and the alcoholysis of organosilanes. When triethylsilane was used as a substrate, the system revealed the largest kinetic isotopic effect (KIESi&#8722;H/Si&#8722;D=346&#177;4) ever reported for this type of reaction. This unexpectedly high KIE, measured at room temperature, together with the calculated Arrhenius preexponential factor ratio (AH/AD=0.0004) and difference in the observed activation energy [(E
&#8722;E
)=34.07&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1] are consistent with the participation of quantum tunneling in the catalytic process. DFT calculations have been used to unravel the reaction pathway and identify the rate&#8208;determining step. Aditionally, isotopic effects were considered by different methods, and tunneling effects have been calculated to be crucial in the process.

&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], has proven to be a highly efficient catalyst for the hydrolysis and the alcoholysis of organosilanes. When triethylsilane was used as a substrate, the system revealed the largest kinetic isotopic effect (KIE&lt;sub&gt;Si&#8722;H/Si&#8722;D&lt;/sub&gt;=346&#177;4) ever reported for this type of reaction. This unexpectedly high KIE, measured at room temperature, together with the calculated Arrhenius preexponential factor ratio (A&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;=0.0004) and difference in the observed activation energy [(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&#8722;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
)=34.07&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;] are consistent with the participation of quantum tunneling in the catalytic process. DFT calculations have been used to unravel the reaction pathway and identify the rate-determining step. Aditionally, isotopic effects were considered by different methods, and tunneling effects have been calculated to be crucial in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Regioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective hydroboration of unsymmetrical internal alkynes featuring with unique regioselecitivty, broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility was realized by using cobalt catalysts modified with newly developed cyclopropane&#8208;based diphosphine ligands. The current protocol enabled the synthesis of novel alkenyl borates and improved the synthetic efficiency of bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Herein, we report the development of new Co complexes that have cyclopropane&#8208;based diphosphine ligands and can catalyze highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective hydroboration reactions of unsymmetrical internal alkynes. These reactions exhibited unusual regioselectivity: specifically, reactions of aryl alkyl internal alkynes showed excellent cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;addition selectivity, and reactions of dialkyl internal alkynes gave excellent cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;addition selectivity. Highly regioselective hydroboration of unsymmetrical dialkyl internal alkynes cannot be achieved by other known methods. The reactions described herein are highly synthetically useful, particularly for the stereoselective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenylborates and alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a CoI&#8722;H species is a plausible active catalyst and the rigid structure of the cyclopropane skeleton of the ligands and the crowded reaction pocket were responsible for the unprecedented regioselectivity.

         <title>A Mechanochemical, Catalyst&#8208;Free Cascade Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diols and 1,4&#8208;Iodoalcohols Using Styrenes and Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient mechanochemical electrophilic functionalization reactions of unsaturated compounds with hypervalent iodine reagents have been developed. These green and sustainable mechanochemical protocols enable the synthesis of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized molecules that are otherwise difficult to achieve via standard solution&#8208;phase methods. Our mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds in an intermolecular fashion.







Abstract
A mechanochemical and solvent/catalyst&#8208;free functionalization of olefins with hypervalent iodine reagents has been developed, enabling the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dioxygenated compounds. Under similar reaction conditions with the addition of molecular iodine, 1,4&#8208;iodoalcohols can be synthesized. These valuable products are non&#8208;trivial to achieve via standard solution&#8208;phase methods. Mechanistic study reveals that the hypervalent iodine reagent might dimerize at solid state with the help of mechanical force. The active monomeric form of hypervalent iodine reagent might trigger the 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization reactions in an intermolecular cascade manner.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Pentacoordinated&#8208;Zirconium Catalyst with Axial Oxygen Ligand for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Zr&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst with a stable pentacoordinated structure and high single&#8208;atom Zr loading is discovered. With the high&#8208;loading catalyst, the assembled zinc&#8211;air battery delivers a record&#8208;high power density among those of single&#8208;atom catalyst&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), as promising alternatives to Pt&#8208;based catalysts, suffer from the limited choice of center metals and low single&#8208;atom loading. Here, we report a pentacoordinated Zr&#8208;based SAC with nontrivial axial O ligands (denoted O&#8722;Zr&#8722;N&#8722;C) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The O ligand downshifts the d&#8208;band center of Zr and confers Zr sites with stable local structure and proper adsorption capability for intermediates. Consequently, the ORR performance of O&#8722;Zr&#8722;N&#8722;C prominently surpasses that of commercial Pt/C, achieving a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and outstanding durability (92&#8201;% current retention after 130&#8208;hour operation). Moreover, the Zr site shows good resistance towards aggregation, enabling the synthesis of Zr&#8208;based SAC with high loading (9.1&#8197;wt%). With the high&#8208;loading catalyst, the zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) delivers a record&#8208;high power density of 324&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 among those of SAC&#8208;based ZABs.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Additives Modulate Calcification by Interacting with Prenucleation Clusters on the Molecular Level
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small but effective: only few small additives are potent antiscalants, extremely solubilizing CaCO3. These underlying molecular mechanisms act beyond standard concepts of nucleation inhibition: they trigger, stabilize, and feed PNCs, presetting key properties of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). This study reveals how small molecules may co&#8208;regulate biomineralization and breaks grounds for sustainable antiscalants.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW) additives can strongly impact amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), playing an elusive role in biogenic, geologic, and industrial calcification. Here, we present molecular mechanisms by which these additives regulate stability and composition of both CaCO3 solutions and solid ACC. Potent antiscalants inhibit ACC precipitation by interacting with prenucleation clusters (PNCs); they specifically trigger and integrate into PNCs or feed PNC growth actively. Only PNC&#8208;interacting additives are traceable in ACC, considerably stabilizing it against crystallization. The selective incorporation of potent additives in PNCs is a reliable chemical label that provides conclusive chemical evidence that ACC is a molecular PNC&#8208;derived precipitate. Our results reveal additive&#8208;cluster interactions beyond established mechanistic conceptions. They reassess the role of small&#8208;MW molecules in crystallization and biomineralization while breaking grounds for new sustainable antiscalants.

         <title>Chirality Induction on a Coordination Capsule for Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By utilizing a confined space inside a coordination capsule consisting of achiral components, we achieve trimeric structures composed of acetic acid and 2,3&#8208;disubstituted tartaric acid derivatives. Steric and electronic interactions between the substituents on the tartaric acid and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arms of the capsule permit the transfer of the chirality of the tartaric acid to the capsule, resulting in diastereoenrichment of the host&#8211;guest complexes of up to 92 de%. The chiral templates can be washed away with diethyl ether, leaving an enantiomerically enriched capsule. The resulting capsule biases the dynamic axial chirality of a 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl guest carrying benzothiadiazole units, demonstrating guest&#8208;to&#8208;capsule and capsule&#8208;to&#8208;guest chirality transfer. The induced chirality on the bound guest enables it to emit circularly polarized luminescence in the NIR region, demonstrating the application of induced chirality for confined spaces for the generation of chiroptical properties.</dc:description>

The induced chirality on the bound guest enables it to emit circularly polarized luminescence in the NIR region, demonstrating the application of induced chirality for confined spaces for the generation of chiroptical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure of a promiscuous thioesterase domain responsible for branching acylation in polyketide biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioesterases (TEs) are fundamentally important enzymes present in all bacteria and eukaryotes, where they have conserved functions in fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary metabolism. This work provides the first structural insights into a functionally distinct group of TEs that perform diverse acylations in polyketide and peptide biosynthesis (TE  B  s). Structural analysis of the oocydin (OocS) TE  B  domain facilitated identification and engineering of the active site to modulate acyl&#8208;group acceptance. In this way, we achieved higher reactivity using a structure&#8208;based approach, building a foundation for biocatalytic development of TE  B  &#8208;mediated  O  &#8208;acylation, a modification known to improve the bioactivity of oocydin&#8208;type polyketides. Lastly, the promiscuity of the OocS TE  B  motivated us to investigate, and ultimately provide evidence for, the production of longer chain branched oocydins in the native host  Serratia plymuthica  4Rx13. This work frames the OocS TE  B  and homologs as invaluable synthetic biology tools for polyketide drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of the First Selective Nanomolar Inhibitors of Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 2 by Kinetic Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2) is a key enzyme involved in the trimming of antigenic peptides presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex class I. It is a target of growing interest for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and in cancer immunotherapy. However, the discovery of potent and selective ERAP2 inhibitors is highly challenging. Herein, we have used kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) to identify such inhibitors. Co&#8208;crystallization experiments revealed the binding mode of three different inhibitors with increasing potency and selectivity over related enzymes. Selected analogues engage ERAP2 in cells and inhibit antigen presentation in a cellular context.  4d  (  BDM88951  ) displays favorable in vitro ADME properties and in vivo exposure. In summary, KTGS allowed the discovery of the first nanomolar and selective highly promising ERAP2 inhibitors that pave the way of the exploration of the biological roles of this enzyme and provide lead compounds for drug discovery efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>sp&#8208;Carbon Incorporated Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Photocathode for Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted increasing interest for broad applications in catalysis and gas separation due to their high porosity. However, the insulating feature and the limited active sites hindered MOFs as photocathode active materials for application in photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation. Herein, we develop a layered conductive two&#8208;dimensional conjugated MOF (2D c&#8208;MOF) comprising sp&#8208;carbon active sites based on arylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle ligand via CuO4 linking, named as Cu3HHAE2. This sp&#8208;carbon 2D c&#8208;MOF displays apparent semiconducting behavior and broad light absorption till the near&#8208;infrared band (1600 nm). Due to the abundant acetylene units, the Cu3HHAE2 could act as the first case of MOF photocathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation and presents a record hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocurrent density of ~260 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode among the structurally&#8208;defined cocatalyst&#8208;free organic photocathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Induced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence Duality in Tetracationic Binaphthyl&#8208;Based Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report an approach to the synthesis of highly charged enantiopure cyclophanes by the insertion of axially chiral enantiomeric binaphthyl fluorophores into the constitutions of pyridinium&#8208;based macrocycles. Remarkably, these fluorescent tetracationic cyclophanes exhibit a significant AIE compared to their neutral optically active binaphthyl precursors. A combination of theoretical calculations and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveal that the AIE originates from limited torsional vibrations associated with the axes of chirality present in the chiral enantiomeric binaphthyl units and the fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic landscape when incorporated within the cyclophane structure. Furthermore, these highly charged enantiopure cyclophanes display CPL responses both in solution and in the aggregated state. This unique duality of AIE and CPL in these tetracationic cyclophanes is destined to be of major importance in future development of photonic devices and bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Momomycin, an Antiproliferative Cryptic Metabolite from the Oxytetracycline Producer Streptomyces rimosus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products provide an important source of pharmaceuticals and chemical tools. Traditionally, assessment of unexplored microbial phyla has led to new natural products. However, with every new microbe, the number of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) grows. As such, the more difficult proposition is finding new molecules from well&#8208;studied strains. Herein, we targeted Streptomyces rimosus, the widely&#8208;used oxytetracycline producer, for the discovery of new natural products. Using MALDI&#8208;MS&#8208;guided high&#8208;throughput elicitor screening (HiTES), we mapped the global secondary metabolome of S. rimosus and structurally characterized products of three cryptic BGCs, including momomycin, an unusual cyclic peptide natural product with back&#8208;bone modifications and several non&#8208;canonical amino acids. We elucidated important aspects of its biosynthesis and evaluated its bioactivity. Our studies showcase HiTES as an effective approach for unearthing new chemical matter from &#8220;drained&#8221; strains</dc:description>

         <title>Work&#8208;function&#8208;induced Interfacial Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Os&#8208;OsSe2 Heterostructures for Active Acidic and Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional favorable charge balance effect is generated at the Os&#8208;OsSe2 interfaces via work function induced interfacial built&#8208;in electric field provides highly efficient HER active sites, accelerating the kinetics toward water electrolysis hydrogen production.







Abstract
Theoretical calculations unveil that the formation of Os&#8208;OsSe2 heterostructures with neutralized work function (WF) perfectly balances the electronic state between strong (Os) and weak (OsSe2) adsorbents and bidirectionally optimizes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Os sites, significantly reducing thermodynamic energy barrier and accelerating kinetics process. Then, heterostructural Os&#8208;OsSe2 is constructed for the first time by a molten salt method and confirmed by in&#8208;depth structural characterization. Impressively, due to highly active sites endowed by the charge balance effect, Os&#8208;OsSe2 exhibits ultra&#8208;low overpotentials for HER in both acidic (26&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and alkaline (23&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) media, surpassing commercial Pt catalysts. Moreover, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen device assembled with Os&#8208;OsSe2 further highlights its potential application prospects. Profoundly, this special heterostructure provides a new model for rational selection of heterocomponents.

         <title>Design of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Fast and Robust Organic Solvent Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) is prepared as a membrane for highly permselective and robust organic solvent nanofiltration. The membrane has an unprecedented methanol permeance. High&#8208;performance purification of active pharmaceutical ingredients is also realized by the 3D COF membrane.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) has become increasingly important in petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries, demanding superior and robust membranes. Herein, we report advanced OSN processes by designing three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) membranes through moderated interfacial crystallization. Nanoporous supports work as the moderator allowing the crystallization of 3D COF membranes. The 3D COF features sub&#8208;nanometer and anti&#8208;swelling channels, affording a sharp selectivity to fine targets with an exceptionally high and stable methanol permeance. Thus&#8208;synthesized membrane exhibits a record stability against high&#8208;concentration feeds and long&#8208;term operation for &#8776;1000&#8197;h. Moreover, we unambiguously demonstrate that our membrane holds excellent practicality in purifying active pharmaceutical ingredients from organic liquids. This work reveals the great potential of distinctive 3D COFs in producing prominent OSN membranes for industrial applications.

         <title>Tug&#8208;of&#8208;War between Two Distinct Catalytic Sites Enables Fast and Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of organocatalysts featuring two distinct catalytic sites in one molecule was illustrated in the ROCOP of epoxides with anhydride, giving excellent selectivity and activity. A chain tug&#8208;of&#8208;war mechanistic pathway is proposed to rationalize the simultaneous enhancement in monomer activation and nucleophilic attack, thus giving rise to outstanding catalytic performance.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations have emerged as a powerful approach towards the creation of sustainable polymers. Typical H&#8208;bonding catalysts for ring&#8208;opening are subject to a single catalytic site. Here we describe a H&#8208;bond&#8208;donor/Lewis&#8208;acidic&#8208;boron organocatalyst featuring two distinct catalytic sites in one molecule. The ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides with anhydride mediated by these modular, and tunable catalysts achieves high selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% polyester selectivity) and markedly higher activity compared to either of the di&#8208;thiourea analogues or any combinations of them. Calculations and experimental studies reveal that the superior catalytic performance arises from tug&#8208;of&#8208;war between two differentiated catalytic sites: thiourea pulls off the propagating chain&#8208;end from boron center, simultaneously enhancing the role of monomer activation and also nucleophilicity of the propagation intermediates.

         <title>Tuning Proapoptotic Activity of a Phosphoric&#8208;Acid&#8208;Tethered Tetraphenylethene by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Isomerization and Switchable Protein Interactions for Cancer Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered trans&#8208;cis isomerization of a phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene can be tuned by interaction with albumin. The trans and cis isomers show different interactions toward alkaline phosphatase and albumin, and have different cellular uptake efficiency and proapoptotic activity. Thus, on&#8208;demand activating and deactivating the proapoptotic effect has been achieved in vitro and in vivo by using visible light and proteins as switching elements.







Abstract
We herein report a phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene (T&#8208;P) capable of adapting its geometric configuration and biological activity to the microenvironment upon light irradiation for apoptosis modulation. Different from most ultraviolet&#8208;responsive isomerization, T&#8208;P undergoes cis&#8208;trans isomerization under visible light irradiation, which is biocompatible and thus photo&#8208;modulation is possible in living biosystems. By using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and albumin as dual targets, T&#8208;P isomers display different protein binding selectivity, cancer&#8208;cell internalization efficiency and apoptosis&#8208;inducing ability. The proapoptotic activity was found to be kinetically controlled by the enzymatic reaction with ALP and regulated by co&#8208;existing albumin. Motivated by these findings, two&#8208;way modulation of proapoptotic effect and on&#8208;demand boosting anticancer efficacy were realized in vitro and in vivo using light and endogenous proteins as multiple non&#8208;invasive switching stimuli.

         <title>Suppressing Electron Back&#8208;Donation for a Highly CO&#8208;tolerant Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst via Cobalt Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Co into MoNi4 nanocatalyst can suppress the d&#8594;CO 2&#960;* back donation, leading to excellent CO tolerance. When feeding with CO (250&#8197;ppm)/H2, the fuel cell assembled by this catalyst yields a peak power density of 394&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, exceeding that of 209&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the Pt/C catalyst.







Abstract
Platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst is commercially adopted in fuel cells but it undergoes formidable active&#8208;site poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO). In particular, given the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC), the issues of Pt poisoning and slow rate would combine mutually, notably worsening the device performances. Here we overcome these challenges through incorporating cobalt (Co) into molybdenum&#8208;nickel alloy (MoNi4), termed Co&#8208;MoNi4, which not only shows superior HOR activity over the Pt/C catalyst in alkali, but more intriguingly exhibits excellent CO tolerance with only small activity decay after 10&#8201;000 cycles in the presence of 500 parts per million (ppm) CO. When feeding with CO (250&#8197;ppm)/H2, the AEMFC assembled by this catalyst yields a peak power density of 394&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, far exceeding the Pt/C catalyst. Experimental and computational studies reveal that weakened CO chemisorption originates from the electron&#8208;deficient Ni sites after Co incorporation that suppresses d&#8594;CO 2&#960;* back&#8208;donation.

         <title>Over 70&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Enabled by Potassium Dopant&#8208;Tuned Interaction between Copper Sites and Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium doping of Cu2Se nanosheet arrays on copper foam serves as a versatile method for tuning the interaction between Cu sites and reaction intermediates. This approach enables CO2 electroreduction to ethanol as a single liquid product with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 70.3&#8201;% and an extraordinary stability for 130&#8197;h at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V.







Abstract
It is highly desired yet challenging to steer the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2ER) toward ethanol with high selectivity, for which the evolution of reaction intermediates on catalytically active sites holds the key. Herein, we report that K doping in Cu2Se nanosheets array on Cu foam serves as a versatile way to tune the interaction between Cu sites and reaction intermediates in CO2ER, enabling highly selective production of ethanol. As revealed by characterization and simulation, the electron transfer from K to Se can stabilize CuI species which facilitate the adsorption of linear *COL and bridge *COB intermediates to promote C&#8722;C coupling during CO2ER. As a result, the optimized K11.2%&#8208;Cu2Se nanosheets array can catalyze CO2ER to ethanol as a single liquid product with high selectivity in a potential area from &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.2&#8197;V. Notably, it offers a Faradaic efficiency of 70.3&#8201;% for ethanol production at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V with as is stable for 130&#8197;h.

         <title>Between Elemental Match and Mismatch: From K12Ge3.5Sb6 to Salts of (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722;, (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722;, and (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>
Extraction of the intermetallic phase &#8220;K2GeSb&#8221;, actually comprising the new single&#8208;crystalline compound K12Ge3.5Sb6, yields the long sought&#8208;for binary anion (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722; and larger ones, (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; and (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;, which place the Ge/Sb combination at the border of elemental match and mismatch. The yet unknown diversity of these binary species predicts a rich follow&#8208;up chemistry.







Abstract
The solid mixture &#8220;K2GeSb&#8221; was shown to comprise single&#8208;crystalline K12Ge3.5Sb6 (1), a double salt of K5[GeSb3] with carbonate&#8208;like [GeSb3]5&#8722; anions, and the metallic Zintl phase K2Ge1.5. Extraction of 1 with ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine in the presence of crypt&#8208;222 afforded [K(crypt&#8208;222)]+ salts of several novel binary Zintl anions: (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722; (in 2), (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; (in 3), and in the presence of [AuMePPh3] also (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722; (in 4). The anion in 2 represents a predicted, yet heretofore missing pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral anion. 4 comprises a cluster analogous to (Ge4Bi14)4&#8722; and (Ga2Bi16)4&#8722;, and thus one of the most Sb&#8208;rich binary p&#8208;block anions. The unprecedented cluster topology in 3 can be viewed as a defect&#8208;version of the one in 4 upon following a &#8220;dead end&#8221; of cluster growth. The findings indicate that Ge and Sb atoms are at the border of a well&#8208;matching and a mismatch elemental combination. We discuss the syntheses, the geometric structures, and the electronic structures of the new compounds.

         <title>(4+3) Annulation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and Azadienes: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Azepanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azepanones are important and widespread seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, but their synthesis is challenging. A convergent method to access these scaffolds was developed relying on a (4+3) annulation reaction of azadienes and donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Good to excellent yields and high diastereoselectivity were achieved using Yb(OTf)3 as the catalyst. Asymmetric induction was possible with Cu(OTf)2 in the presence of a trisoxazoline (Tox) ligand.







Abstract
Azepanes are important seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, which are present in numerous natural and synthetic compounds. However, the development of convergent synthetic methods to access them remains challenging. Herein, we report the Lewis acid catalyzed (4+3) annulative addition of aryl and amino donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes. Densely substituted azepane derivatives were obtained in good to excellent yields and with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction occurred under mild conditions with ytterbium triflate as the catalyst. The use of copper triflate with a trisoxazoline (Tox) ligand led to an enantioselective transformation. The obtained cycloadducts were convenient substrates for a series of further modifications, showing the synthetic utility of these compounds.

         <title>A SLC35C2 Transporter&#8208;Targeting Fluorescent Probe for the Selective Detection of B Lymphocytes Identified by SLC&#8208;CRISPRi and Unbiased Fluorescence Library Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a systematic SLC&#8208;CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of CDyB was identified as the SLC35C2 transporter based on a gating&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (GOLD) mechanism. Gene expression analysis and knock&#8208;out experiments confirmed that the SLC35C2 transporter acted as the target responsible for the selectivity of CDyB for B&#8208;cells over T&#8208;cells.







Abstract
T and B lymphocytes are two major adaptive immune cells in the human defense system. To real&#8208;time monitor their diverse functions, a live&#8208;cell&#8208;selective probe for only one cell type is need to investigate the complex interaction of the immune cells. Herein, a small&#8208;molecule probe CDyB for live B cells is developed by an unbiased fluorescence library screening. The cell selectivity was confirmed by multiparametric single&#8208;cell analysis using CyTOF. Through a systematic SLC&#8208;CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of CDyB was identified as SLC35C2 transporter based on a gating&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (GOLD) mechanism. The gene expression analysis and knock&#8208;out experiments validated that the SLC35C2 transporter was the target for CDyB distinction. Interestingly, when CDyB was applied to study B cell development, the CDyB fluorescence and SLC35C2 expression were positively correlated with the B cell maturation process, and not involved in the T cell development.

         <title>Au20(tBu3P)8: A Highly Symmetric Metalloid Gold Cluster in Oxidation State 0</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretically long&#8208;studied Au20 cluster was synthesized by a wet chemistry approach, solely stabilized by phosphine ligands. The presented superatom cluster possesses a high symmetrical structure and an oxidation state of the gold atoms of &#177;0.







Abstract
Metalloid gold clusters have unique properties with respect to size and structure and are key intermediates in studying transitions between molecular compounds and the bulk phase of the respective metal. In the following, the synthesis of the all&#8208;phosphine protected metalloid cluster Au20(tBu3P)8, solely built from gold atoms in the oxidation state of 0 is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a highly symmetric hollow cube&#8208;octahedral arrangement of the gold atoms, resembling gold bulk structure. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations illustrated the cluster can be described as a 20&#8208;electron superatom. Optical properties of the compound have shown molecular&#8208;like behavior.

         <title>Odorant Metabolism in Humans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete passage and turnover of odorants within the human organism, beginning with the various routes of odorant uptake, followed by biotransformation and excretion are delineated in this Review. Special emphasis is placed on a comparison of the involved enzymes concerning the nasal, oral, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal metabolism of odorants and the respective functions of odorant metabolism in these body sites.







Abstract
Odorants are relatively small molecules which are easily taken up and distributed in the human body. Despite their relevance in everyday life, however, only a limited amount of evidence about their metabolism, pathways, and bioactivities in the human body exists. With this Review, we aim to encourage future interdisciplinary research on the function and mechanisms of the biotransformation of odorants, involving different disciplines such as nutrition, medicine, biochemistry, chemistry, and sensory sciences. Starting with a general overview of the different ways of odorant uptake and enzymes involved in the metabolism of odorants, a more precise description of biotransformation processes and their function in the oral cavity, the nose, the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is given together with an overview of the different routes of odorant excretion. Finally, perspectives for future research are discussed.

         <title>Calcination&#8208;regulated Microstructures of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Polymers towards Enhanced and Stable Photocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating molecular structure of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymer is a promising strategy to improve photoactivity. Herein, a porous nanorod&#8208;like D&#8208;A polymer is synthesized via a strategy of supramolecular chemistry combined with subsequent calcination treatment. This polymer consists of benzene rings (D) and triazine (A) that are linked by amido bond (&#8722;CONH&#8722;). &#8722;CONH&#8722; further partially cracks into cyano groups (&#8722;C&#8801;N) (A) under calcination. The ratio of benzene to triazine could be tuned to adjust the &#8722;C&#8801;N content by varying the calcination atmosphere. Such regulation of molecular structure could modulate the band structure of D&#8208;A polymer and endow it with unique porous nanorod&#8208;like morphology, leading to the achievement of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction and two&#8208;electron water oxidation and the improvement of exciton splitting, O  2  adsorption and activation. These merits synergistically ensure a highly efficient and stable photocatalytic H  2  O  2  production in pure water.</dc:description>

         <title>Arene&#8722;Ruthenium(II)/Osmium(II) Complexes Potentiate the Anticancer Efficacy of Metformin via Glucose Metabolism Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting metabolic reprogramming to treat cancer could increase overall survival and reduce side effects. Here, we put forward a strategy using arene&#8722;ruthenium(II)/osmium(II) complexes to potentiate the anticancer effect of metformin (Met.) via glucose metabolism reprogramming. Complexes 1&#8208;6 with oxoglaucine derivatives as ligands were synthesized and their anti&#8208;tumor activities were tested under hypoglycemia. Results indicated that 2 and 5 potentiated the anticancer effects of Met. under hypoglycemia, exhibiting lower toxicity, slower blood glucose decline and inhibition of early tumor liver metastasis. Combination of 5 with Met. could be used as a new strategy to treat cancer under hypoglycemia through glucose metabolism reprogramming.</dc:description>

         <title>Encoding Morphogenesis of Quasi&#8208;Triangular Gold Nanoprisms with DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Properties of gold nanoparticles vary with their morphologies. Typically, the research on the properties and applications of the nonequilibrium intermediates generated by the morphological evolution of triangular gold nanoprisms is still incomplete. Herein, we employed thiol&#8208;DNA (HS&#8208;DNA) to protect the low&#8208;stability quasi&#8208;nanoprisms with different truncation degrees (  R  values). The presence of HS&#8208;DNA not only increases the stability of the quasi&#8208;nanoprisms in different microenvironment, but also facilitates us to investigate their intrinsic plasmonic properties related to morphology. Additionally, we served quasi&#8208;nanoprisms loaded with HS&#8208;DNA as assembly modules and nanoplatforms for programmable self&#8208;assembly higher&#8208;order hybrid structures, as well as carriers for encoding and decoding of orthogonal barcode&#8208;like information, which opens new opportunities for developing novel building blocks for light manipulation at nanoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Depolymerizable Polyether Electrolytes for Convenient and Low&#8208;cost Recycling of LiTFSI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes(SPEs) with LiTFSI(Lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide)) are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state batteries, owing to their good interfacial contact with solid electrodes. Here, three copolymerized polyethers were prepared as SPEs, using the catalysts of SnF2 or SnF2&#8208;LiPF6. The thermal depolymerization of these polyethers was observed at elevated temperatures, which limits their operating temperature ranges. Once the catalyst is removed, the thermal degradation temperatures of these SPEs are raised by 30&#8208;55oC, together with improved thermal performance in cells. For SPEs, the high price of LiTFSI is an obstacle for their large&#8208;scale application, and it&#8217;s recycling is hindered by the strong interaction with polymers. By the thermal depolymerization of polyethers, LiTFSI can be easier reclaimed from above mentioned SPEs and even the commercial PEO(poly(ethylene&#8208;oxide)) based SPE in rates of 70&#8208;80%, providing a low&#8208;cost strategy for the recycling of LiTFSI.</dc:description>

         <title>A Monocrystalline Coordination Polymer with Multiple Redox Centers as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers can take advantage of both transition metal redox and organic ligand redox, thus serving as promising cathodes with multiple redox centers toward higher&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we selected the high&#8208;capacity carbonyl compound of chloranilic acid (CA) as organic ligand to coordinate with the high&#8208;voltage Cu  2+  as transition metal node and successfully synthesized copper(II) chloranilate (CuCA) with &#960;&#8211;d conjugation, layered structure and monocrystalline nature. The resulting CuCA presents inorganic and organic redox centers, high electronic conductivity and fast Li  +  diffusion kinetics, leading to high discharge capacity (297.0 mAh g  &#8211;1  at 50 mA g  &#8211;1  ), excellent rate capability (160.6 mAh g  &#8211;1  at 1000 mA g  &#8211;1  ) and good cycling stability (165.5 mAh g  &#8211;1  at 500 mA g  &#8211;1  after 50 cycles) with quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte. This work will provide insightful understanding of the materials design strategies to develop more efficient coordination polymer cathodes for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Cage Binding Iodide Anion over Halide Ions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A triangular&#8208;prism shaped cage was self&#8208;assembled  via  the formation of a dynamic covalent bond, namely hydrazone, in acidic aqueous solution. The hexa&#8208;cationic host bears a number of relatively acidic protons pointing inward the cage cavity, which is able to accommodate an iodide anion selectively in water over other halide anions such as F  &#8722;  , Cl  &#8722;  and Br  &#8722;  , which are more hydrated. As a comparison, a macrocycle analogue bearing fewer positive charges and fewer hydrogen bond donors shows no anion binding ability. As inferred from the single crystal structure and theoretical calculations, the ability of the cage in selectively recognizing iodide anion results from the combination of electrostatic forces, C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I  &#8722;  hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanographene Metallaprisms: Structure, Stimulated Transformation, and Emission Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographenes are inclined to assemble into stacked columnar structures that are stabilized by p&#8208;p interactions, whereas other supramolecular structures of nanographenes, such as prisms and cages, are rarely investigated. Herein, a diazananographene was synthesized, and then assembled with coordination unit, producing a triangular metallaprism. After adding C  60  or C  70  , the triangular metallaprism was transformed into a square tetramer, which encapsulated a pair of C  60  or C  70  . The formed host&#8208;guest complex demonstrated the efficient energy transfer from diazananographene shell to C  60  cores. The emission intensity of capsulated C  60  was enhanced remarkably, compared with free C  60  , due to an increased quantum yield and optical absorption coefficient. This work demonstrates the versatility of nanographene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures beyond columnar stacking and their ability to enhance the emission of otherwise nonemissive fullerene.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Brook Rearrangements: Concept and Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical Brook rearrangement is a unique molecular arrangement, but it is not highly explored in synthetic chemistry. This Minireview summarizes the early developments and general concept of radical Brook rearrangements and highlights the recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving radical Brook rearrangements.







Abstract
The Brook rearrangement has already become established as one of the most important molecular rearrangements in synthetic chemistry and has been applied in the generation of complexes, drug discovery, material science, and natural products synthesis. Compared to the widely known ionic mechanism, the radical Brook rearrangement is less explored because of the difficulty in generating alkoxyl radical species. This Minireview summarizes the early developments and general concept of the radical Brook rearrangement and highlights recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving radical Brook rearrangements. We hope this survey will inspire further developments in this emerging area.

         <title>A Traceless Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation on Native Antibodies Enables Efficient One&#8208;Step Payload Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A traceless one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) has been established using a novel thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer design with an optimized Fc&#8208;binding ligand, which enables ligand self&#8208;release during payload assembly. This strategy exhibits excellent compatibility with various toxins, linkers, and IgG subclasses, implying the potential for broad applications in ligand&#8208;directed protein modifications.







Abstract
Direct chemical modification of native antibodies in a site&#8208;specific manner remains a great challenge. Ligand&#8208;directed conjugation can achieve the selective modification of antibodies, but usually requires multiple extra steps for ligand release and cargo assembly. Herein, we report a novel, traceless strategy to enable the facile and efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) by harnessing a thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer reagent. The designed reagent, consisting of an optimized Fc&#8208;targeting ligand, a thioester bridge and a toxin payload, directly assembles the toxin precisely onto the K251 position of native IgGs and simultaneously self&#8208;releases the affinity ligand in one step. With this method, we synthesized a series of K251&#8208;linked ADCs from native Trastuzumab. These ADCs demonstrated excellent homogeneity, thermal stability, and both in vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;tumor activity. This strategy is equally efficient for IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subtypes.

         <title>Lysosome Interference Enabled by Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Assembly of DNA Nanoframeworks inside Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;driven dynamic assembly of DNA nanoframeworks inside cells couples with the lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways/lysosomal maturation to give the rational modulation of lysosomal functions. These include lysosomal acidity reduction and hydrolase activity attenuation, thereby improving the delivery efficiency of nucleic acid drugs.







Abstract
Coupling materials chemistry systems to biological processes is a promising way to rationally modulate lysosomal functions. A proton&#8208;driven dynamic assembly of a DNA nanoframework inside cells coupled with the lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways/lysosomal maturation, gives the rational modulation of lysosomal functions, which we term &#8220;lysosome interference&#8221;. Through lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis, the DNA nanoframework with acid&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;i&#8208;motif enters the lysosome and assembles into an aggregate in a process triggered by lysosomal acidity. The aggregate is suitable for long&#8208;term retention. The consumption of protons resulted in lysosomal acidity reduction and hydrolase activity attenuation, thus hindering the degradation of nucleic acid drugs in the lysosome and improving gene silencing effects. This study shows a new way to achieve lysosome interference by coupling the subcellular microenvironment with a precisely programmable assembly system.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric &#945;&#8208;Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 Compounds with Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity Originating from Ag9Te2 Motifs</title>

         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;temperature crystal structure of &#945;&#8208;Ag9GaTe6 shows a hexagonal structure. Highly disordered Ag atoms vibrate in&#8208;harmonically leading to an intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, the deficiency of Ga in Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 compounds effectively optimizes the electronic transport properties. All these factors contribute to an improved thermoelectric Figure of Merit ZT value of 1.13 at 623&#8197;K for Ag9Ga0.95Te6.







Abstract
We have determined the complex atomic structure of high&#8208;temperature &#945;&#8208;Ag9GaTe6 phase with a hexagonal lattice (P63mc space group, a=b=8.2766&#8197;&#197;, c=13.4349&#8197;&#197;). The structure has outer [GaTe4]5&#8722; tetrahedrons and inner [Ag9Te2]5+ clusters. All of the Ag ions are disorderly distributed in the lattice. Seven types of the Ag atoms constitute the cage&#8208;like [Ag9Te2]5+ clusters. The highly disordered Ag ions vibrate in&#8208;harmonically, producing strong coupling between low frequency optical phonons and acoustic phonons. This in conjunction with a low sound velocity of 1354&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1 leads to an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.20&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 673&#8197;K. Meanwhile, the deficiency of Ga in Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 compounds effectively optimizes the electronic transport properties. Ag9Ga0.91Te6 attains a highest power factor of 0.40&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 673&#8197;K. All these contribute to a much&#8208;improved ZT value of 1.13 at 623&#8197;K for Ag9Ga0.95Te6, which is 41&#8201;% higher than that of the pristine Ag9GaTe6 sample.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Triggered Polar Polymorph Formation: &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3, a Promising Next&#8208;Generation Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material</title>

         <dc:description>
The key mechanism of additives in the formation of noncentrosymmetric solids has been clarified for the first time based on a new metastable &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3, which exhibits excellent mid&#8208;IR NLO properties including the strongest SHG responses and the largest band gap for a rare&#8208;earth iodate, a sufficient birefringence, and a wide optical transparency window.







Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) solids have attracted interest for their potential in ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical (NLO) devices, but their synthesis remains a major challenge. In this study, the additive Li2CO3 triggers formation of an NCS precursor at an early nucleation stage, and plays a crucial role in the successful polymorphism transformation. The resultant metastable &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3 is a promising mid&#8208;infrared NLO crystal, with the strongest second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (2.2&#215;KTiOPO4 @ 2100&#8197;nm, 16&#215;KH2PO4 @ 1064&#8197;nm) and the largest optical band gap (4.52&#8197;eV) for a rare&#8208;earth iodate, as well as sufficient birefringence (&#916;n=0.219 @ 546&#8197;nm) for type I phase&#8208;matching, and wide optical transparency, which are induced by optimal alignment of the iodate anions. This study reveals the key role of additives in the growth of polar NCS solids, a discovery with implications for the strategic design of new NCS polymorphism materials with exceptional NLO properties.

         <title>Dual Reactivity of a Geometrically Constrained Phosphenium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometrically constrained phosphenium cation 1+ was synthesized and its reactivity was studied. While 1+ reacts with MeOH and Et2NH via P&#8208;center/ligand assisted path, its reaction with Et3SiH proceeds via oxidative addition type reaction affording new PV intermediate. The ability of 1+ to activate Si&#8722;H bond was tested in catalytic hydrosilylation of benzaldehyde, where 1+ closely mimics transition metal behaviour.







Abstract
A geometrically constrained phosphenium cation in bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine based NNN pincer type ligand (1+) was synthesized, isolated and its preliminary reactivity was studied with small molecules. 1+ reacts with MeOH and Et2NH, activating the O&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds via a P&#8208;center/ligand assisted path. The reaction of 1+ with one equiv. of H3NBH3 leads to its dehydrogenation producing 5. Interestingly, reaction of 1+ with an excess H3NBH3 leads to phosphinidene (PI) species coordinating to two BH3 molecules (6). In contrast, [1+][OTf] reacts with Et3SiH by hydride abstraction yielding 1&#8208;H and Et3SiOTf, while [1+][B(C6F5)4] reacts with Et3SiH via an oxidative addition type reaction of Si&#8722;H bond to P&#8208;center, affording a new PV compound (8). However, 8 is not stable over time and degrades to a complex mixture of compounds in matter of minutes. Despite this, the ability of [1+][B(C6F5)4] to activate Si&#8722;H bond could still be tested in catalytic hydrosilylation of benzaldehyde, where 1+ closely mimics transition metal behaviour.

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;oxo Nodes of MOFs with Tunable Electronic Properties Provide Effective &#8901;OH Species for Enhanced Methane Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts modified with various ligands can directly convert CH4 into oxygenates with 100&#8201;% selectivity by using H2O2 as an oxidant under mild conditions. The Zr&#8208;oxo nodes have different electronic properties that affected the anchoring of &#8901;OH species to form effective Zroxo&#8722;&#8901;OH sites. These sites promote the activation of the C&#8722;H bond of CH4.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane to high value&#8208;added oxygenates under mild conditions has attracted extensive interest. However, the over&#8208;oxidation of target products is usually unavoidable due to the easily excessive activation of C&#8722;H bond on the sites of supported metal species. Here, we identified the most efficient Zr&#8208;oxo nodes of UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane with H2O2. These nodes were modified by three types of benzene 1, 4&#8208;dicarboxylates (NH2&#8208;BDC, H2BDC, and NO2&#8208;BDC). Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that these ligands can effectively tune the electronic properties of Zr&#8208;oxo nodes and the H2BDC ligand led to optimal electronic density of Zr&#8208;oxo nodes in UiO&#8208;66. Thus the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H catalyst promoted the formation of &#8901;OH species that adsorbed on Zr&#8208;oxo nodes, and facilitated the activation of methane with a lower energy barrier and subsequent conversion to hydroxylation oxygenates with 100&#8201;% selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;UiO-66 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts modified with various ligands can directly convert CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into oxygenates with 100&#8201;% selectivity by using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an oxidant under mild conditions. The Zr-oxo nodes have different electronic properties that affected the anchoring of &#8901;OH species to form effective Zr&lt;sub&gt;oxo&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;&#8901;OH sites. These sites promote the activation of the C&#8722;H bond of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct conversion of methane to high value-added oxygenates under mild conditions has attracted extensive interest. However, the over-oxidation of target products is usually unavoidable due to the easily excessive activation of C&#8722;H bond on the sites of supported metal species. Here, we identified the most efficient Zr-oxo nodes of UiO-66 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These nodes were modified by three types of benzene 1, 4-dicarboxylates (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-BDC, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC, and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-BDC). Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that these ligands can effectively tune the electronic properties of Zr-oxo nodes and the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC ligand led to optimal electronic density of Zr-oxo nodes in UiO-66. Thus the UiO-66-H catalyst promoted the formation of &#8901;OH species that adsorbed on Zr-oxo nodes, and facilitated the activation of methane with a lower energy barrier and subsequent conversion to hydroxylation oxygenates with 100&#8201;% selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PEG&#8208;Functionalized Hollow Multishelled Structures with On&#8208;Off Switch and Rate&#8208;Regulation for Controllable Antimicrobial Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel functionalized hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) has hierarchical shells as multilevel responsive bodies and uses polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a gated regulator. The interaction between PEG&#8208;functionalized shells endows them with a pH&#8208;responsive switch and rate&#8208;regulator capability. These features allow rapid release of molecules wrapped in the outer shell, and controlled diffusion of antimicrobials stored in the inner shell.







Abstract
The construction of responsive antimicrobial carriers with multifunctional and controllable release is an attractive but challenging proposition. Recently developed hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) offers structural advantages, such as easily modifiable surfaces and mutually influenced shells. Herein, we report a novel pH&#8208;responsive antimicrobial carrier having hierarchical shells as multilevel responsive bodies using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a gated regulator. The interaction between PEG&#8208;functionalized shells endows them with a pH&#8208;responsive switch and rate&#8208;regulator capability. These features are present in the form of rapid release of molecules wrapped in the outer shell, and controlled diffusion of antimicrobials stored in the inner shell by electrostatic interaction, resulting in a long&#8208;lasting mildew resistance for up to 71&#8197;days. The versatility of the hierarchical interactions of HoMSs will inspire the design of promising smart drug carriers.

Chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions are used for the first time to organize photoreactive systems, here (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpen) molecules, into rectangular motifs favoring cyclobutane formation through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photodimerizations, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of strong and directional ChB donors such as selenocyanate moieties toward topochemical reactions.







Abstract
The face&#8208;to&#8208;face association of (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpen) molecules into rectangular motifs stabilized for the first time by chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions is shown to provide photoreactive systems leading to cyclobutane formation through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photodimerizations. The chelating chalcogen bond donors are based on original aromatic, ortho&#8208;substituted bis(selenocyanato)benzene derivatives 1&#8211;3, prepared from ortho&#8208;diboronic acid bis(pinacol) ester precursors and SeO2 and malononitrile in 75&#8211;90&#8201;% yield. The very short intramolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se distance in 1&#8211;3 (3.22&#8211;3.24&#8197;&#197;), a consequence of a strong intramolecular ChB interaction, expands to 3.52&#8211;3.54&#8197;&#197; in the chalcogen&#8208;bonded adducts with bpen, a distance (&lt;4&#8197;&#197;) well adapted to the face&#8208;to&#8208;face association of the bpen molecules into the reactive position toward photochemical dimerization.

         <title>An Ultramicroporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Exhibiting High C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a suitable pore environment and complementary electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to acetylene (C2H2) molecule, the ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 exhibits extra strong affinity to C2H2 (46.73&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
The separation of C2H2/CO2 is not only industrially important for acetylene purification but also great scientific challenge due to their very similar molecular size and physical properties. To address this difficulty, herein, we present an ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) from tetracyano bicarbazole to separate C2H2 from CO2 by taking advantage of differences in their electrostatic potential distribution. This material possesses a suitable pore environment and electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to C2H2, thus showing extra strong affinity to C2H2 (46.73&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C2H2/CO2 separation among the adsorbents reported. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the suitable pore environment in HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 provides multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonded interactions N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C with C2H2 molecules. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate its outstanding separation performance to C2H2/CO2 mixtures.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Programmable AgAuS&#8208;Primed Conductive Nanowelding Wires&#8208;Up Wet Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;based, DNA&#8208;programmable, and highly efficient nanowelding process generates conductive threads in self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle &#8220;molecules&#8221; and &#8220;polymers&#8221;. The process starts with a gap&#8208;specific Ag2S deposition in pre&#8208;formed gold nanostructures. It ends with Ag2S&#8208;directed gold&#8208;atom diffusion and a reduction of the resulting AgAuS primer phase to give conductive Au/Ag alloyed junctions.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanomaterials, directed by molecular or supramolecular interactions, is a powerful strategy to build nanoscale devices. Despite many advantages of such solution&#8208;based processes, a big challenge is to realize interparticle ohmic contacts toward facilitated charge transport over a long distance. We report a new concept of primed nanowelding to thread solution&#8208;borne nanoparticles in prescribed assemblies. The process starts with a gap&#8208;specific deposition of Ag2E (E=S, Se) materials in pre&#8208;assembled gold structures, which spontaneously transform into AgAuE semiconductors via directional gold diffusion. Treatment with tributylphosphine generates alloyed Au/Ag welding spots that conductively wire&#8208;up nanoparticles into discrete &#8220;molecules&#8221; and micron&#8208;long &#8220;polymers&#8221;. This method is compatible with DNA programming and delivers a possible way to solve the problem of the carrier&#8208;transport dilemma in solution&#8208;processed nanostructures for better&#8208;functioning nanodevices.

Treatment with tributylphosphine generates alloyed Au/Ag welding spots that conductively wire-up nanoparticles into discrete &#8220;molecules&#8221; and micron-long &#8220;polymers&#8221;. This method is compatible with DNA programming and delivers a possible way to solve the problem of the carrier-transport dilemma in solution-processed nanostructures for better-functioning nanodevices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Supported&#160;gold nanoparticle catalysts have attracted growing interest in aerobic&#160;oxidation reactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205873), Kazuya Yamaguchi, Kosuke Suzuki et&#8197;al. describe&#160;a&#160;method for the design of supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts using negatively&#160;charged multivacant polyoxometalates. The electronic states of the&#160;catalysts&#160;can be sequentially modulated, and the catalyst prepared&#160;using [SiW9O34]10&#8722; acted as a reusable heterogeneous catalyst, showing&#160;superior&#160;catalytic activity and enhanced stability compared to conventional catalysts.

         <title>BTDAzo: A Photoswitchable TRPC5 Channel Activator
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TRPs (Transient Receptor Potentials) are important sensory ion channels with roles in perception including of heat, cold, and electrophiles, as well as in signaling and mineralostasis. Here the first photopharmaceutical TRPC5 ligand, BTDAzo, is developed, which achieves outstanding photoswitchability of TRPC5 currents in physiological models including brain slice, without crosstalk to the related TRPC4 channel.







Abstract
Photoswitchable reagents can be powerful tools for high&#8208;precision biological control. TRPC5 is a Ca2+&#8208;permeable cation channel with distinct tissue&#8208;specific roles, from synaptic function to hormone regulation. Reagents giving spatiotemporally&#8208;resolved control over TRPC5 activity may be key to understanding and harnessing its biology. Here we develop the first photoswitchable TRPC5&#8208;modulator, BTDAzo, to address this goal. BTDAzo can photocontrol TRPC5 currents in cell culture, as well as controlling endogenous TRPC5&#8208;based neuronal Ca2+ responses in mouse brain slices. BTDAzos are also the first reported azo&#8208;benzothiadiazines, an accessible and conveniently derivatised azoheteroarene with strong two&#8208;colour photoswitching. BTDAzo&#8242;s ability to control TRPC5 across relevant channel biology settings makes it suitable for a range of dynamically reversible photoswitching studies in TRP channel biology, with the aim to decipher the various biological roles of this centrally important ion channel.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe for Imaging Fluctuations of Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) in the Alzheimer's Disease Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining the ONOO&#8722;&#8208;initiated cascade reactions of a novel chemical trigger and a new NIR emissive Rhodol fluorophore, an activity&#8208;based NIR fluorescent probe for ONOO&#8722; in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains was constructed. Real&#8208;time imaging of ONOO&#8722; in AD mice and age&#8208;dependent accumulation of ONOO&#8722; in AD mouse brains have been demonstrated with the probe.







Abstract
Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To reveal the ONOO&#8722; influx in AD brains, an activatable activity&#8208;based fluorescence probe Rd&#8208;DPA3 was designed by a structure&#8208;modulated strategy. Taking advantage of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;initiated two&#8208;step cascade reactions of a novel chemical trigger, Rd&#8208;DPA3 specifically responds to ONOO&#8722; in 0.3&#8197;mM of other reactive oxygen species (ROS) and varied proteins, and gives an intensive fluorescence enhancement (F/F0=50). Moreover, with its mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, Rd&#8208;DPA3 can be used to efficiently monitor the alternations of intracellular ONOO&#8722; levels in cerebral cells during oxidative stress. Significantly, due to NIR emission and good blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) crossing ability, Rd&#8208;DPA3 is suitable for in vivo imaging of cerebral ONOO&#8722; influx and illustrating an age&#8208;dependent accumulation of ONOO&#8722; in AD mice brains.

         <dc:description>
A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized 1,4&#8208;diborabenzene ligand enables the isolation of thermally stable two&#8208;legged parent piano&#8208;stool Fe0 and Ru0 complexes.

         <title>Low&#8208;Pt NiNC&#8208;Supported PtNi Nanoalloy Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysts&#8212;In Situ Tracking of the Atomic Alloying Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During thermal annealing treatment, carbon&#8208;encapsulated Ni NPs, rather than NiNx single sites, serve exclusively as the Ni atom source for PtNi alloy formation. Despite this low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt&#8208;mass activities compared to conventional, carbon&#8208;supported 20&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%Pt Pt&#8208;loaded benchmark PtNi alloy catalysts.







Abstract
We report and analyze a synthetic strategy toward low&#8208;Pt platinum&#8208;nickel (Pt&#8208;Ni) alloy nanoparticle (NP) cathode catalysts for the catalytic electroreduction of molecular oxygen to water. The synthesis involves the pyrolysis and leaching of Ni&#8208;organic polymers, subsequent Pt NP deposition, followed by thermal alloying, resulting in single Ni atom site (NiNC)&#8208;supported PtNi alloy NPs at low Pt weight loadings of only 3&#8211;5&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Despite low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt&#8208;mass activities compared to conventional 20&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;% benchmark PtNi catalysts. Using in situ microscopic techniques, we track and unravel the key stages of the PtNi alloy formation process directly at the atomic scale. Surprisingly, we find that carbon&#8208;encapsulated metallic Ni@C structures, rather than NiNx sites, act as the Ni source during alloy formation. Our materials concepts offer a pathway to further decrease the overall Pt content in hydrogen fuel cell cathodes.

         <title>Molecularly Precise, Bright, Photostable, and Biocompatible Cyanine Nanodots as Alternatives to Quantum Dots for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine nanodots constructed by step&#8208;by&#8208;step divergent synthesis of cyanine dye&#8208;cored polylysine dendrimers possess many of the merits of quantum dots and organic fluorophores, including precise structure, well&#8208;defined size, strong and stable fluorescence, and a customizable fluorescence spectrum. A strategy is described for synthesis of various precise fluorescent nanoparticles with optical properties that are relevant to biomedical applications.







Abstract
Fluorescent imaging with fluorophores has become a powerful way to explore complex biological systems and visualize nanoparticles for drug delivery. However, it is challenging to develop fluorophores with ideal physical and optical properties. We report a method to synthesize cyanine nanodots with a single&#8208;molecule structure, well&#8208;defined particle size, customizable fluorescent spectrum, and bright and stable fluorescence. These cyanine nanodots are acquired by the divergent synthesis of cyanine&#8208;dye&#8208;cored polylysine (PLL) dendrimers. We demonstrated the feasibility of the method by synthesizing cyanine 3 (Cy3), cyanine 5 (Cy5), or cyanine 7 (Cy7) cored single&#8208;molecule nanodots up to eight generations with a size of around 11&#8197;nm. We show that these cyanine nanodots are capable of multiple biomedical applications, including multicolor cellular tracing and cancer imaging. These cyanine nanodots possess many merits of organic dots and quantum dots that are promising for future application.

         <title>Efficient Production of L&#8208;Homophenylalanine by Enzymatic&#8208;Chemical Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route involving both enzymatic and spontaneous chemical reactions was designed for the synthesis of L&#8208;homophenylalanine from inexpensive building blocks. One enzyme in the cascade, EcQOR, was identified as the first ene reductase to catalyze the reduction of an unsaturated aromatic keto acid. This study shows the potential of introducing spontaneous chemical reactions into enzymatic cascades for the synthesis of valuable chemicals.







Abstract
L&#8208;Homophenylalanine (L&#8208;HPA) is a vital building block for the synthesis of numerous chiral drugs. However, the high cost of starting materials limits the industrial production of L&#8208;HPA. In this study, an enzymatic&#8208;spontaneous chemical cascade route for L&#8208;HPA production was designed based on retrosynthetic analysis. This route, using simple benzaldehyde and pyruvate as starting materials, is extremely cost&#8208;effective. The enzymes were screened and further assembled in E.&#8197;coli, and TipheDH was identified as the rate&#8208;limiting enzyme. Therefore, TipheDH was engineered to improve its specific activity (by 82&#8201;%) and expression level (by 254&#8201;%), thus generating the best strain (W14). W14 exhibited the optimum enzyme activity ratio (1.7&#8201;:&#8201;1.1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1.8) and demonstrated production of 100.9&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 of L&#8208;HPA (with 94&#8201;% conversion, &gt;99&#8201;% ee) in a 5&#8208;L reactor. This route effectively exploits the power of cascades and offers insight into avenues for synthesizing other valuable chemicals from inexpensive building blocks.

         <title>Biodegradable Ca2+ Nanomodulators Activate Pyroptosis through Mitochondrial Ca2+ Overload for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable Ca2+ nanomodulators (CaNMs) that can activate pyroptosis for cancer immunotherapy are reported. The CaNMs decompose under low pH to release Ca2+ and curcumin (CUR), leading to a sudden surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ ions. This Ca2+ overload triggers an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the release of cytochrome&#8197;C, activation of caspase&#8208;3, and cleavage of GSDME, causing cell bubbling and pyrolysis.







Abstract
Pyroptosis provides a new direction and broad prospects for cancer immunotherapy. However, the development of a nanoplatform as a pyroptosis inducer is limited, and the discovery of a new type of nano&#8208;pyroptosis inducer for cancer immunotherapy is still imminent. Herein, biodegradable Ca2+ nanomodulators (CaNMs) are prepared as pyroptosis inducers for cancer immunotherapy via mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. The obtained CaNMs can decompose under low pH to release Ca2+ and curcumin, leading to a sudden surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ ions, eventually resulting in pyroptosis. We not only confirm the occurrence of mitochondrial Ca2+ overload&#8208;triggered pyroptosis for the first time but also reveal the robust immune responses via CaNMs, along with remarkably suppressing tumor proliferation and lung metastasis. This work will provide new strategies and inspiration for pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cancer treatments, greatly contributing to the further development of Ca2+ nanomodulators.
