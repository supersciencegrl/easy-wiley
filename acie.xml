         <title>Broad Dual Emission by Codoping Cr3+ (d&#8208;d) and Bi3+ (s&#8208;p) in Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4InCl6 Double Perovskite</title>

         <dc:description>A phosphor emitting both white light and broad near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation can simultaneously provide visual inspection and early signs of rotting of food products.&#160;The broad NIR emission is absorbed by the vibrational overtones of water molecules present in food items, providing the non&#8208;invasive image contrast to assess the food freshness.&#160;Here we design a phosphor, namely, Cr3+&#8208;Bi3+&#8208;codoped Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4InCl6, that simultaneously emit warm white light and broad NIR (1000 nm) radiation with quantum yield 27%.&#160;This dual emitter is designed by combining the features of s2&#8208;electron (Bi3+) and d3&#8208;electron (Cr3+) doping in a weak crystal field of the halide perovskite host. 6s2 to 6s16p1&#160;excitation of Bi3+, using a commercial 370 nm ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (UV&#8208;LED), yields both the emissions.&#160;A fraction of the excited Bi3+ dopants emit the warm white light, and the other fraction transfers its energy non&#8208;radiatively to Cr3+.&#160;Then the Cr3+ de&#8208;excites emitting broad NIR emission.&#160;Temperature dependent (6.4 &#8211; 300 K) photoluminescence in combination with Tanabe&#8208;Sugano diagram show that the Cr3+ experiences a weak crystal field (Dq/B = 2.2),&#160;yielding the&#160;4T2 to 4A2&#160;NIR emission.&#160;As a proof of concept, we fabricated a panel containing&#160;122 phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs, demonstrating its capability to inspect food products.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Linear and Cyclic Poly(diphenylacetylene)s by Molybdenum and Tungsten Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improved methods for the synthesis of linear and cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s by polymerization of the corresponding diphenylacetylenes using MoCl5&#8208; and WCl4&#8208;based catalytic systems have been developed. MoCl5 induces migratory insertion polymerization of diphenylacetylenes in the presence of arylation reagents such as Ph4Sn and ArSnnBu3 to produce cis&#8208;stereoregular linear poly(diphenylacetyelene)s with high molecular weights (Mn = 30,000&#8210;3,200,000) in good yields (up to 98%). On the other hand, WCl4 induces ring expansion polymerization of diphenylacetylenes in the presence of Ph4Sn or reducing reagents to produce cis&#8208;stereoregular cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s with high molecular weights (number&#8208;average molar mass (Mn) = 20,000&#8210;250,000) in moderate to good yields (up to 90%). Both catalytic systems are applicable to the polymerization of various diphenylacetylenes having polar functional groups such as esters that are not efficiently polymerized by conventional methods using WCl6&#8208;Ph4Sn and TaCl5&#8208;nBu4Sn systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing&#160;Oxygen Vacancies via&#160;Engineering Heterostructured Fe3C/Fe3O4&#160;Catalysts for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions provides an intriguing pathway to convert N2 into NH3. However, the NRR&#8217;s kinetic barriers at low temperatures in desirable aqueous electrolytes remains a grand challenge due to the inert N&#8801;N bond of the N2 molecule. Herein, we propose a unique strategy for in situ oxygen vacancy construction to address the significant trade&#8208;off between N2 adsorption and NH3 desorption by building a hollow shell structured Fe3C/Fe3O4 heterojunction coated with carbon frameworks (Fe3C/Fe3O4@C). In the heterostructure, the Fe3C serves as a trigger to induce oxygen vacancies of the Fe3O4 component, which are likely active sites for the NRR. The unique design could optimize the adsorption strength of the N2 and NxHy intermediates, thus boosting the catalytic activity for the NRR. This work highlights the significance of the interaction between defect&#8208;engineering and interface&#8208;engineering strategies for regulating the electrocatalytic properties for the challenging NRR. It could motivate an in&#8208;depth exploration to advance N2 reduction to ammonia.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Ion Full Cells Operating at &#8722;40 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are promising for cryogenic energy storage. However, current researches on low&#8208;temperature PIBs are limited to half cells utilizing potassium metal as an anode, and realizing rechargeable full cells is challenged by lacking viable anode materials and compatible electrolytes. Herein, a hard carbon (HC)&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature potassium&#8208;ion full cell is successfully fabricated for the first time. Experimental evidence and theoretical analysis revealed that potassium storage behaviors of HC anodes in the matched low&#8208;temperature electrolyte involve defect adsorption, interlayer co&#8208;intercalation, and micropore filling. Notably, these unique potassiation processes exhibited low interfacial resistances and small reaction activation energies, enabling an excellent cycling performance of HC with a capacity of 172 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8722;40 &#176;C (68% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity). Consequently, the HC&#8208;based full cells demonstrated impressive rechargeability and high energy density above 100 Wh kg&#8208;1cathode at &#8722;40 &#176;C, representing a significant advancement in the development of PIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fully Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework with Oxidative and Reductive Sites for Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing powerful photocatalytic system that can achieve the carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction half&#8208;reaction and the water (H2O) oxidation half&#8208;reaction simultaneously is a very challenging but meaningful task. Herein, a porous material with crystalline topological network, named viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re, was rationally synthesized by incorporating rhenium complexes as reductive sites and triazine ring structures as oxidative sites via robust &#8211;C=C&#8211; bond linkages. The charge separation ability is promoted by low polarized &#960;&#8211;bridges between rhenium complexes and triazine ring units, and the efficient charge separation enables the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs separated by intramolecular charge transfer process to form photogenerated electrons involved in CO2 reduction and photogenerated holes participated in H2O oxidation simultaneously. The powerful viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re shows the highest catalytic photocatalytic carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 190.6 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 with about 100% selectivity and oxygen (O2) evolution of 90.2 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 among all the porous materials in CO2 reduction with H2O as sacrificial agents. Therefore, a powerful photocatalytic system is successfully achieved, and this catalytic system exhibits excellent stability in the catalysis process for 50 hours. Meanwhile, the structure&#8211;function relationship was confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Colossal Anisotropic Thermal Expansion in a Diazo&#8208;Functionalized Compound with Switchable Solid&#8208;State Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving substantial anisotropic thermal expansion (TE) in solid&#8208;state materials is challenging as most materials undergo volumetric expansion upon heating. Here, we describe colossal, anisotropic TE in crystals of an organic compound functionalized with two azo groups. Interestingly, the material exhibits distinct and switchable TE behaviors within different temperature regions. At high temperature, two&#8208;dimensional, area zero TE and colossal, positive linear TE (&#945; = 211 MK&#8208;1) are attained due to dynamic motion, while at low temperature, moderate positive TE occurs in all directions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Achieving substantial anisotropic thermal expansion (TE) in solid-state materials is challenging as most materials undergo volumetric expansion upon heating. Here, we describe colossal, anisotropic TE in crystals of an organic compound functionalized with two azo groups. Interestingly, the material exhibits distinct and switchable TE behaviors within different temperature regions. At high temperature, two-dimensional, area zero TE and colossal, positive linear TE (&#945; = 211 MK-1) are attained due to dynamic motion, while at low temperature, moderate positive TE occurs in all directions. Investigation of the solid-state motion showed the change in enthalpy and entropy are quite different in the two temperature regions and solid-state NMR experiments support motion in the solid. Cycling experiments demonstrate that the solid-state motions and TE behaviors are completely reversible. These results reveal strategies for designing significant anisotropic and switchable behaviors in solid-state materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond Reduction Cocatalysts: Critical Role of Metal Cocatalysts in Photocatalytic Oxidation of Methane with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Environmentally sustainable and selective conversion of methane to valuable chemicals under ambient conditions is pivotal for the development of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic technology. However, due to the lack of microscopic knowledge about non&#8208;thermal methane conversion, controlling and modulating photocatalytic oxidation processes driven by photogenerated holes remain a challenge. Here, we report novel function of metal cocatalysts to accept photogenerated holes and dominate selectivity of methane oxidation, which is clearly beyond the conventional concept in photocatalysis that the metal cocatalysts loaded on the surfaces of semiconductor photocatalysts mostly capture photogenerated electrons and dominate reduction reactions exclusively. The novel photocatalytic role of metal cocatalysts was verified by operando molecular spectroscopy combined with real&#8208;time mass spectrometry for metal&#8208;loaded Ga2O3 model photocatalysts under methane and water vapor at ambient temperature and pressure.&#160;Our concept of metal cocatalysts that work as active sites for both photocatalytic oxidation and reduction provides a new understanding of photocatalysis and a solid basis for controlling non&#8208;thermal redox reactions by metal&#8208;cocatalyst engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Random Island Nucleation in the Electrochemical Roughening on Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical roughening of platinum upon oxidation&#8208;reduction cycles, leads to nano&#8208;island growth that surprisingly show an almost perfect hexagonal arrangement. The non&#8208;random nucleation of these islands is due to special, preferential nuclei sites that a priori do not exist. Precursors of the oxidation, given by the so&#8208;called place&#8208;exchange atoms, form a network of triangles or disordered spoke wheels, in which the nucleation takes place.







Abstract
Many chemical surface systems develop ordered nano&#8208;islands during repeated reaction and restoration. Platinum is used in electrochemical energy applications, like fuel cells and electrolysers, although it is scarce, expensive, and degrades. During oxidation&#8208;reduction cycles, simulating device operation, nucleation and growth of nano&#8208;islands occurs that eventually enhances the dissolution. Preventing nucleation would be the most effective solution. However, little is known about the atomic details of the nucleation; a process almost impossible to observe. Here, we analyze the nuclei&#8208;distance distribution mapping out the underlying atomic mechanism: a rarely observed, non&#8208;random nucleation takes place. Special, preferential nucleation sites that a priori do not exist, develop initially via a precursor and eventually form a semi&#8208;ordered Pt&#8208;oxide structure. This precursor mechanism seems to be general, possibly explaining also the nano&#8208;island formation on other surfaces/reactions.

         <title>Understanding Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on PdNiRuIrRh High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy by Machine Learning Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating machine learning&#8208;based Monte Carlo simulation with ab initio calculation, the complex atomic structure of a high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA&#8208;PdNiRuIrRh) was comprehensively uncovered. The origin of the superior electrocatalytic performance for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction was fundamentally understood.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts have been widely studied in electrocatalysis. However, identifying atomic structure of HEA with complex atomic arrangement is challenging, which seriously hinders the fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanism. Here, we report a HEA&#8208;PdNiRuIrRh catalyst with remarkable mass activity of 3.25&#8197;mA&#8201;&#956;g&#8722;1 for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which is 8&#8208;fold enhancement compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Through machine learning potential&#8208;based Monte Carlo simulation, we reveal that the dominant Pd&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ni/Pd&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pd bonding environments and Ni/Ru oxophilic sites on HEA surface are beneficial to the optimized adsorption/desorption of *H and enhanced *OH adsorption, contributing to the excellent HOR activity and stability. This work provides significant insights into atomic structure and catalytic mechanism for HEA and offers novel prospects for developing advanced HOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Aerobic&#8208;Hydrophobic Janus Interface on Partially Carbonized Iron Heterostructure Promotes Bifunctional Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerobic&#8208;hydrophobic Janus interface is constructed by introducing fluorinated modification on porous carbon nanofibers embedded with partially carbonized iron heterojunctions (Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F). The Janus structure can keep the internal Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F away from water infiltration and endows a N2 molecule&#8208;concentrating effect, resulting in the formation of a robust &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;gas&#8221; state micro&#8208;domain at the catalyst surface. Such microdomains can suppress competing water splitting reactions and enhance nitrogen fixation.







Abstract
Competition from hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions and low solubility of N2 in aqueous systems limited the selectivity and activity on nitrogen fixation reaction. Herein, we design an aerobic&#8208;hydrophobic Janus structure by introducing fluorinated modification on porous carbon nanofibers embedded with partially carbonized iron heterojunctions (Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F). The simulations prove that the Janus structure can keep the internal Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F away from water infiltration and endow a N2 molecular&#8208;concentrating effect, suppressing the competing reactions and overcoming the mass&#8208;transfer limitations to build a robust &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;gas&#8221; state micro&#8208;domain around the catalyst surface. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, the Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for nitrogen fixation (NH3 yield rate up to 29.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and Faraday efficiency (FE) up to 27.8&#8201;% in nitrogen reduction reaction; NO3&#8722; yield rate up to 15.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and FE up to 3.4&#8201;% in nitrogen oxidation reaction).

         <title>Enhanced Carrier Diffusion Enables Efficient Back&#8208;Contact Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced charge carrier diffusion in perovskite thin films is demonstrated to significantly improve the efficiency of back&#8208;contact perovskite photovoltaics. The addition of guanidine thiocyanate induces a preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation of the perovskite films which exhibit increased carrier diffusion lengths exceeding 7.5&#8197;&#956;m. Back&#8208;contact devices using such films display improved efficiencies reaching 11.2&#8201;%, a 3&#8208;fold increase in performance.







Abstract
Back&#8208;contact architectures offer a promising route to improve the record efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by eliminating parasitic light absorption. However, the performance of back&#8208;contact PSCs is limited by inadequate carrier diffusion in perovskite. Here, we report that perovskite films with a preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation show improved carrier dynamic properties.

     alt="Enhanced Carrier Diffusion Enables Efficient Back-Contact Perovskite Photovoltaics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhanced charge carrier diffusion in perovskite thin films is demonstrated to significantly improve the efficiency of back-contact perovskite photovoltaics. The addition of guanidine thiocyanate induces a preferred out-of-plane orientation of the perovskite films which exhibit increased carrier diffusion lengths exceeding 7.5&#8197;&#956;m. Back-contact devices using such films display improved efficiencies reaching 11.2&#8201;%, a 3-fold increase in performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back-contact architectures offer a promising route to improve the record efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by eliminating parasitic light absorption. However, the performance of back-contact PSCs is limited by inadequate carrier diffusion in perovskite. Here, we report that perovskite films with a preferred out-of-plane orientation show improved carrier dynamic properties. With the addition of guanidine thiocyanate, the films exhibit carrier lifetimes and mobilities increased by 3&#8211;5&#8197;times, leading to diffusion lengths exceeding 7&#8197;&#956;m. The enhanced carrier diffusion results from substantial suppression of nonradiative recombination and improves charge collection. Devices using such films achieve reproducible efficiencies reaching 11.2&#8201;%, among the best performances for back-contact PSCs. Our findings demonstrate the impact of carrier dynamics on back-contact PSCs and provide the basis for a new route to high-performance back-contact perovskite optoelectronic devices at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide Cyclization by the Use of Acylammonium Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional approach to peptide cyclization involving the use of acyl ammonium species was developed. Rapid and epimerization/dimerization&#8208;free cyclization of synthetically challenging peptides was possible, including a difficult cyclization reaction involving N&#8208;methyl amide bond formation. The approach is characterized by ease of purification of the products, high productivity, and high reaction mass efficiencies.







Abstract
Although cyclic peptides have become increasingly important as drugs, the most conventional peptide cyclization method using moderately active coupling agents suffers from a lot of waste and high cost as well as long reaction times and burdensome purification. Herein, we report an unconventional approach to peptide cyclization that uses acylammonium species generated from inexpensive and less wasteful Me2NBn and ClCO2i&#8208;Pr. Using this approach, we observed the desired rapid activation of the C&#8208;terminus of cyclization precursors by an acylammonium ion for rapid and epimerization/dimerization&#8208;free cyclization of synthetically challenging peptides, including a difficult cyclization involving N&#8208;methyl amide bond formation. The ease of purification, productivities, and reaction mass efficiencies of our approach were significantly superior to those in previous reports. We synthesized a previously reported versicotide D analogue, and our data indicated that its assigned stereostructure should be revised.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis&#8212;Controlling the Competition between Monomeric versus Dimeric Reaction Pathways Enhances Stereoselectivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even sterically demanding chiral phosphoric acids can form highly active catalyst dimers with stereoselectivities inverse to monomers. The two pathways are separable by adjusting temperature and catalyst loading. Significantly enhanced ee values up to 99&#8201;% result from the monomeric and complete inversion up to &#8722;98&#8201;% from the dimeric pathway.







Abstract
Chiral phosphoric acids (CPA) have become a privileged catalyst type in organocatalysis, but the selection of the optimum catalyst is still challenging. So far hidden competing reaction pathways may limit the maximum stereoselectivities and the potential of prediction models. In CPA&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of imines, we identified for many systems two reaction pathways with inverse stereoselectivity, featuring as active catalyst either one CPA or a hydrogen bond bridged dimer. NMR measurements and DFT calculations revealed the dimeric intermediate and a stronger substrate activation via cooperativity. Both pathways are separable: Low temperatures and high catalysts loadings favor the dimeric pathway (ee up to &#8722;98&#8201;%), while low temperatures with reduced catalyst loading favor the monomeric pathway and give significantly enhanced ee (92&#8211;99&#8201;% ee; prior 68&#8211;86&#8201;% at higher temperatures). Thus, a broad impact is expected on CPA catalysis regarding reaction optimization and prediction.

         <title>A Sustainable Wood&#8208;Based Iron Photocatalyst for Multiple Uses with Sunlight: Water Treatment and Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst was made from demethylated lignin as sustainable source and Fe3O4. It can be used in environmental sciences to clean wastewater and in material sciences as a radical photoinitiator, resulting in crosslinking of vinyl monomers by radical photopolymerization. Films obtained showed good water repelling and no tackiness even in an aerobic surrounding.







Abstract
A sustainable photocatalyst for use with multiple purpose comprising demethylated lignin (Fe3O4@D&#8208;wood) was made by treatment of wood and iron oxide. Characterization followed by XRD, UV/Vis, photo&#8208;current studies, and electrochemical measurements. This material became subject of photocatalytic explorations for water treatment and material synthesis by radical photopolymerization. Exposure of Fe3O4@D&#8208;wood with artificial sunlight showed an improved activity considering photochemical oxidation of organic pollutants in the presence of H2O2. The efficient generation of reactive radicals brought this system also to photopolymerization. Here, radicals based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the catalytic cycle can be seen as the dominating species to initiate radical polymerization. A mixture of UDMA and TPGDA showed good reactivity with cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Photocatalyst used for water treatment facilitates reuse for photopolymerization.

         <title>Controlling the Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Overlayer Structure in Pt/TiO2 Catalysts Prevents Particle Evaporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study expands the concept of the condition&#8208;dependence of overlayers induced by strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) in Pt/TiO2 catalysts. TiOX overlayers are studied with in situ TEM, and it is found that the overlayers are stable at high temperatures in oxygen and therefore can protect the platinum nanoparticles from evaporation.







Abstract
Platinum nanoparticles (NPs) supported by titania exhibit a strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI)[1] that can induce overlayer formation and encapsulation of the NP's with a thin layer of support material. This encapsulation modifies the catalyst's properties, such as increasing its chemoselectivity[2] and stabilizing it against sintering.[3] Encapsulation is typically induced during high&#8208;temperature reductive activation and can be reversed through oxidative treatments.[1] However, recent findings indicate that the overlayer can be stable in oxygen.[4,&#8201;5] Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we investigated how the overlayer changes with varying conditions. We found that exposure to oxygen below 400&#8201;&#176;C caused disorder and removal of the overlayer upon subsequent hydrogen treatment. In contrast, elevating the temperature to 900&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining the oxygen atmosphere preserved the overlayer, preventing platinum evaporation when exposed to oxygen. Our findings demonstrate how different treatments can influence the stability of nanoparticles with or without titania overlayers. expanding the concept of SMSI and enabling noble metal catalysts to operate in harsh environments without evaporation associated losses during burn&#8208;off cycling.

         <title>The Sonogashira Coupling on Palladium Milling Balls&#8212;A new Reaction Pathway in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Sonogashira coupling was conducted in a ball mill using a catalytically active milling ball and three additives in low quantities to achieve quantitative yields within 90&#8197;minutes. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic, diffractive, as well as in situ methods led to the discovery of a formed complex of the co&#8208;catalyst copper, which differs from liquid phase Sonogashira coupling.







Abstract
Utilizing direct mechanocatalytical conditions, the Sonogashira coupling was successfully performed on the surface of milling tools by using pure Pd and Pd coated steel balls. The optimization of co&#8208;catalyst forming additives led to a protocol, which generates quantitative yields under aerobic conditions for various substrates within as little as 90&#8197;minutes. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic, diffractive, as well as in situ methods lead to the identification of a previously unknown and highly reactive complex of the co&#8208;catalyst copper. This new complex differs substantially from the known complexes in liquid phase Sonogashira couplings, proving that reaction pathways in mechanochemistry may differ from those in established synthetic procedures.

         <title>Aqueous Processable Two&#8208;Dimensional Triazine Polymers with Superior Photocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general noncovalent functionalization strategy is developed to prepare aqueous processable high&#8208;quality semiconducting 2D triazine polymers on a large scale. The crystalline ultrathin 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be easily processed into ultralight and mechanically strong aerogels and also exhibit superior photocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Efficient and scalable production of high&#8208;quality and processable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers are highly desired but have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate a convenient noncovalent functionalization strategy for producing highly uniform, aqueous processable and semiconducting 2D triazine polymers. Experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that the aromatic amphiphilic 1&#8208;pyrenebutyrate can adsorb and intercalate into the interlayer of bulk crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF) through noncovalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between the pyrene moiety and the porous basal plane of 2D triazine polymer layer, which greatly facilitate the exfoliation of CTF in water in large scale. The as&#8208;prepared highly water&#8208;dispersible single&#8208;layer/few&#8208;layer 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be easily processed into ultralight aerogels with a density of 5&#8211;15&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3, which can be further shaped into mechanically strong films upon simple compression. This noncovalent functionalization not only improve the dispersibility and processability of 2D triazine polymer, but also optimize its band structure and promote the photogenerated carrier separation via an interesting surface molecule doping effect, thus resulting in a remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1249&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (24980&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 27.2&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm for the 2D triazine polymer, outperforming most metal&#8208;free photocatalysts ever reported.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Assembly of Metallacages and Their Supramolecular Catalysis Behaviors in Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of well&#8208;defined metallacages in microdroplets was achieved through a continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic approach. The high efficiency and diversity of this strategy were illustrated by the generation of five representative metallacages with nearly quantitative yields in a few minutes. This approach is promising for the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular systems in a confined space.







Abstract
Developing a new strategy to improve the self&#8208;assembly efficiency of functional assemblies in a confined space and construct hybrid functional materials is a significant and fascinating endeavor. Herein, we present a highly efficient strategy for achieving the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of well&#8208;defined metallacages in microdroplets through continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic devices. The high efficiency and versatility of this approach are demonstrated by the generation of five representative metallacages in different solvents containing water, DMF, acetonitrile, and methanol in a few minutes with nearly quantitative yields, in contrast to the yields obtained with the hour&#8208;scale reaction time in a batch reactor. A ring&#8208;opening catalytic reaction of the metallacages was selected as a model reaction for exploring supramolecular catalysis in microdroplets, whereby the catalytic yield was enhanced by 2.22&#8208;fold compared to that of the same reaction in the batch reactor. This work illustrates a new promising approach for the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular systems.

         <title>A Widespread Glycosidase Confers Lobophorin Resistance and Host&#8208;Dependent Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural diversification of lobophorins (LOBs) in S.&#8197;coelicolor M1154/pCSG5560 through glycosylation, deglycosylation and reglycosylation was unexpectedly found to be correlated with cross&#8208;talk between the endogenous glycosidase KijX and the products encoded by the exogenous lob BGC. KijX homologues are widespread among bacteria, archaea and fungi, and encode the same glycohydrolytic activity on LOBs as a resistance mechanism to detoxify LOBs.







Abstract
Identifying new environmental resistance determinants is significant to combat rising antibiotic resistance. Herein we report the unexpected correlation of a lobophorin (LOB) resistance&#8208;related glycosidase KijX with the host&#8208;dependent chemical diversity of LOBs, by a process of glycosylation, deglycosylation and reglycosylation. KijX homologues are widespread among bacteria, archaea and fungi, and encode the same glycohydrolytic activity on LOBs. The crystal structure of AcvX (a KijX homologue) shows a similar fold to that of the glycoside hydrolase family 113 and a special negatively charged groove to accommodate and deglycosylate LOBs. Antagonistic assays indicate kijX as a defense weapon of actinomycetes to combat LOB producers in environment, reflecting an elegant coevolution relationship. Our study provides insight into the KijX&#8208;related glycosidases as preexisting resistance determinants and represents an example of resistance genes accidentally integrated into natural product assembly.

         <title>Insight into Iron Leaching from an Ascorbate&#8208;Oxidase&#8208;like Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Nanozyme and Oxygen Reduction Selectivity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe leaching from an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom nanozyme mimicking ascorbate (H2A) oxidase was observed in mild biological media. Besides Fe&#8208;Nx sites for well&#8208;known 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction (ORR) via bound iron&#8208;oxo species, 40&#8201;% of &#8220;silent&#8221; N&#8722;C sites on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C were activated for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR via free O2.&#8722; by H2A oxidation, providing a new ORR pathway to regulate the distinct anti&#8208; and pro&#8208;oxidant functions of ascorbate oxidation for various biomedical applications.







Abstract
Ascorbate (H2A) is a well&#8208;known antioxidant to protect cellular components from free radical damage and has also emerged as a pro&#8208;oxidant in cancer therapies. However, such &#8220;contradictory&#8221; mechanisms underlying H2A oxidation are not well understood. Herein, we report Fe leaching during catalytic H2A oxidation using an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C nanozyme as a ferritin mimic and its influence on the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the heterogeneity, the Fe&#8208;Nx sites in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C primarily catalyzed H2A oxidation and 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR via an iron&#8208;oxo intermediate. Nonetheless, trace O2&#8901;&#8722; produced by marginal N&#8722;C sites through 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR accumulated and attacked Fe&#8208;Nx sites, leading to the linear leakage of unstable Fe ions up to 420&#8197;ppb when the H2A concentration increased to 2&#8197;mM. As a result, a substantial fraction (ca. 40&#8201;%) of the N&#8722;C sites on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C were activated, and a new 2+2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR path was finally enabled, along with Fenton&#8208;type H2A oxidation. Consequently, after Fe ions diffused into the bulk solution, the ORR at the N&#8722;C sites stopped at H2O2 production, which was the origin of the pro&#8208;oxidant effect of H2A.

&lt;p&gt;Fe leaching from an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single-atom nanozyme mimicking ascorbate (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A) oxidase was observed in mild biological media. Besides Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; sites for well-known 4&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction (ORR) via bound iron-oxo species, 40&#8201;% of &#8220;silent&#8221; N&#8722;C sites on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C were activated for 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR via free O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A oxidation, providing a new ORR pathway to regulate the distinct anti- and pro-oxidant functions of ascorbate oxidation for various biomedical applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ascorbate (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A) is a well-known antioxidant to protect cellular components from free radical damage and has also emerged as a pro-oxidant in cancer therapies. However, such &#8220;contradictory&#8221; mechanisms underlying H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A oxidation are not well understood. Herein, we report Fe leaching during catalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A oxidation using an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C nanozyme as a ferritin mimic and its influence on the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the heterogeneity, the Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; sites in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C primarily catalyzed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A oxidation and 4&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR via an iron-oxo intermediate. Nonetheless, trace O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; produced by marginal N&#8722;C sites through 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR accumulated and attacked Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; sites, leading to the linear leakage of unstable Fe ions up to 420&#8197;ppb when the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A concentration increased to 2&#8197;mM. As a result, a substantial fraction (ca. 40&#8201;%) of the N&#8722;C sites on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C were activated, and a new 2+2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR path was finally enabled, along with Fenton-type H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A oxidation. Consequently, after Fe ions diffused into the bulk solution, the ORR at the N&#8722;C sites stopped at H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, which was the origin of the pro-oxidant effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polycation&#8208;Regulated Electrolyte and Interfacial Electric Fields for Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycation additive is introduced to simultaneously regulate the electric fields of electrolyte and Zn/electrolyte interface, which improves Zn2+ migration behaviors and guides dominant Zn (002) deposition, thereby facilitating homogeneous Zn nucleation and growth concomitantly, and blocking the parasitic side reactions derived from water.







Abstract
Zn metal as one of promising anode materials for aqueous batteries but suffers from disreputable dendrite growth, grievous hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Here, a polycation additive, polydiallyl dimethylammonium chloride (PDD), is introduced to achieve long&#8208;term and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Specifically, the PDD can simultaneously regulate the electric fields of electrolyte and Zn/electrolyte interface to improve Zn2+ migration behaviors and guide dominant Zn (002) deposition, which is veritably detected by Zeta potential, Kelvin probe force microscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy. Moreover, PDD also creates a positive charge&#8208;rich protective outer layer and a N&#8208;rich hybrid inner layer, which accelerates the Zn2+ desolvation during plating process and blocks the direct contact between water molecules and Zn anode. Thereby, the reversibility and long&#8208;term stability of Zn anodes are substantially improved, as certified by a higher average coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% for Zn||Cu cells and 22 times longer life for Zn||Zn cells compared with that of PDD&#8208;free electrolyte.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled L&#8211;DNA Linkers for Rapid Construction of Multi&#8208;Specific Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates Library</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular platform is reported for rapid construction of multi&#8208;specific Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates (ADCs). The MADC platform offers the combinatorial flexibility to screen for optimal target and payload combinations, while having the potential of becoming viable therapeutic agents themselves.







Abstract
One of the key challenges of improving clinical outcomes of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is overcoming cancer resistance to the antibody and/or drug components of ADCs, and hence the need for ADC platforms with high combinatory flexibility. Here, we introduce the use of self&#8208;assembled left&#8208;handed DNA (L&#8211;DNA) oligonucleotides to link combinatory single&#8208;domain antibodies and toxin payloads for tunable and adaptive delivery of ADCs. We demonstrate that the method allows convenient construction of a library of ADCs with multi&#8208;specific targeting, multi&#8208;specific payloads, and exact drug&#8208;antibody ratio. The newly constructed ADCs with L&#8211;DNA scaffold showed favorable properties of in vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo suppression and eradication of solid tumors. Collectively, our data suggest that the L&#8211;DNA based modular ADC (MADC) platform is a viable option for generating therapeutic ADCs and for potentially expanding ADC therapeutic window via multi&#8208;specificity.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl halides with sulfoximines (as ammonia surrogates) was realized by employing a chiral anionic N,N,N&#8208;ligand with a long spreading side arm under mild conditions. An array of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids could be furnished with good efficiency (up to 95&#8201;% yield) and enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed enantioconvergent cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl halides with ammonia offers a rapid avenue to chiral unnatural &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids. However, the construction of chiral C&#8722;N bonds between tertiary&#8208;carbon electrophiles and nitrogen nucleophiles presented a great challenge owing to steric congestion. We report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl halides with sulfoximines (as ammonia surrogates) under mild conditions by employing a chiral anionic N,N,N&#8208;ligand with a long spreading side arm. An array of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid derivatives were obtained with good efficiency and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility of the strategy has been showcased by the elaboration of the coupling products into different chiral &#945;&#8208;fully substituted amine building blocks.

         <title>Maldistribution of Chemical Bond Strength Inducing Exceptional Anisotropy of Thermal Conductivity in Non&#8208;Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose that maldistribution of chemical bond strength can lead to large anisotropy of &#954; in non&#8208;layered materials. Taking PbSnS3, a typical non&#8208;layered orthorhombic compound, as an example, our result reveals that the maldistribution of Pb&#8722;S bonds leads to an anisotropy ratio up to 7.1 at 200&#8197;K and 5.5 at 300&#8197;K, respectively, which are among the highest values ever reported in non&#8208;layered materials and even surpass many classical layered materials.







Abstract
Currently, the efforts to find materials with high &#954; anisotropy ratios mainly focus on layered materials, however, the limited quantity and lower workability comparing to non&#8208;layered ones boost the exploration of non&#8208;layered materials with high &#954; anisotropy ratios. Here, taking PbSnS3, a typical non&#8208;layered orthorhombic compound, as an example, we propose that maldistribution of chemical bond strength can lead to large anisotropy of &#954; in non&#8208;layered materials. Our result reveals that the maldistribution of Pb&#8722;S bonds lead to obvious collective vibrations of dioctahedron chain units, resulting in an anisotropy ratio up to 7.1 at 200&#8197;K and 5.5 at 300&#8197;K, respectively, which is one of the highest ever reported in non&#8208;layered materials and even surpasses many classical layered materials such as Bi2Te3 and SnSe. Our findings can not only broaden the horizon for exploring high anisotropic &#954; materials but also provide new opportunities for the application of thermal management.

Our findings can not only broaden the horizon for exploring high anisotropic &#954; materials but also provide new opportunities for the application of thermal management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CoN1O2 Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation and Selective Cobalt(IV)=O Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Co sites with a N1O2 coordination pocket were constructed on the surface of Mn3O4 to overcome the difficulties in CoIV=O generation during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Nitrogen in the asymmetric configuration induces significant electronic delocalization at the Co sites, thus facilitating PMS adsorption, dissociation, and subsequent CoIV=O formation. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX).







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo (HVMO) species are powerful non&#8208;radical reactive species that enhance advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) due to their long half&#8208;lives and high selectivity towards recalcitrant water pollutants with electron&#8208;donating groups. However, high&#8208;valent cobalt&#8208;oxo (CoIV=O) generation is challenging in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs because the high 3d&#8208;orbital occupancy of cobalt would disfavor its binding with a terminal oxygen ligand. Herein, we propose a strategy to construct isolated Co sites with unique N1O2 coordination on the Mn3O4 surface. The asymmetric N1O2 configuration is able to accept electrons from the Co 3d&#8208;orbital, resulting in significant electronic delocalization at Co sites for promoted PMS adsorption, dissociation and subsequent generation of CoIV=O species. CoN1O2/Mn3O4 exhibits high intrinsic activity in PMS activation and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation, highly outperforming its counterpart with a CoO3 configuration, carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with CoN4 configuration, and commercial cobalt oxides. CoIV=O species effectively oxidize the target contaminants via oxygen atom transfer to produce low&#8208;toxicity intermediates. These findings could advance the mechanistic understanding of PMS activation at the molecular level and guide the rational design of efficient environmental catalysts.

         <title>Observation of Asymmetric Oxidation Catalysis with B20 Chiral Crystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identification of the driving force for enantiomeric reactions is essential for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. With a pure B20 chiral crystal without any modification, enantiomeric oxidation was achieved at the surface. It is proposed that orbital angular momentum polarization will influence the adsorption of enantiomers and thus change their oxidation kinetics.







Abstract
The study of heterogeneous reactions for enantiomeric processes based on inorganic crystals has been resurgent in recent years. However, the question remains how homochirality develops in nature and chemical reactions. Here, the successful growth of B20 group PdGa single crystals with different chiral lattices enabled us to achieve enantioselective recognition of 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) based on a new mechanism, namely orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization. The orbital textures of PdGa crystals indicate large OAM polarization near the Fermi level and carrying opposite signs. A positive or negative magnetization in the [111] direction is expected depending on the chiral lattice of PdGa crystals. Due to this, the adsorption energies of PdGa crystals and DOPA molecules differ depending on how well the O&#8208;2p orbital of DOPA pairs with the Pd&#8208;4d orbital of PdGa. The results provide one possible explanation for how chirality arises in nature by providing an enantioselective route with pure inorganic crystals.

         <title>Unveiling Atom Migration Abilities Affected Anode Performance of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of &#8220;atomic migration&#8221; is proposed to explain phase separation and poor reaction reversibility in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Instead of standing still, the atoms can migrate dynamically in carbon layers during discharge, which is tracked by in situ transmission electron microscopy. The atomic migration&#8208;induced irreversible reaction that leads to a low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and rapid degradation of electrode performance is unraveled.







Abstract
In sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) is commonly induced by irreversible phase conversion and difficult desodiation, especially on transition metal compounds (TMCs). Yet the underlying physicochemical mechanism of poor reaction reversibility is still a controversial issue. Herein, by using in situ transmission electron microscopy and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, we demonstrate the irreversible conversion of NiCoP@C is caused by the rapid migration of P in carbon layer and preferential formation of isolated Na3P during discharge. By modifying the carbon coating layer, the migration of Ni/Co/P atoms is inhibited, thus the improvement of ICE and cycle stability is realized. The inhibiting of fast atom migration which induces component separation and rapid performance degradation might be applied to a wide range of electrode materials, and guides the development of advanced SIBs.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Azahelicenes through Organocatalyzed Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed multicomponent asymmetric synthesis of azahelicenes by using a central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion strategy is reported. The one&#8208;pot sequential Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;catalyzed Povarov reaction/oxidative aromatization gave access to various substituted pyrido[4] and [5]&#8208;helicenes with high enantioselectivity, and these could be easily derivatized while also displaying promising photophysical and chiroptical properties.







Abstract
We have developed an efficient modular asymmetric synthesis of azahelicenes through an organocatalyzed asymmetric multicomponent reaction from readily available polycyclic aromatic amines, aldehydes, and (di)enamides, by employing a central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion strategy. A series of aza[5]&#8208; and aza[4]helicenes bearing various substituents were readily afforded through this one&#8208;pot sequential enantioselective Povarov reaction/oxidative aromatization process, with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The fruitful and diverse derivatizations of the chiral azahelicene products demonstrated the potential of this method, and a preliminary application of the azahelicene derivative as a chiral organocatalyst was showcased. The photophysical and chiroptical properties of these azahelicenes, particularly the acid/base&#8208;triggered switching of these properties, were also well studied, which may find potential applications in the development of novel organic optoelectronic materials.

Upon heating, the change from intrinsic to extrinsic position of partial WO42&#8722; in Sc2(WO4)3:Ln forms Frenkel defect, which serves as energy reservoir and back&#8208;transfers the stored excitation energy to Ln3+ so that thermally enhanced downshifting and upconversion luminescence at record&#8208;high working temperatures of 500 and 1073&#8197;K are obtained, respectively.







Abstract
Although large amount of effort has been invested in combating thermal quenching that severely degrades the performance of luminescent materials particularly at high temperatures, not much affirmative progress has been realized. Herein, we demonstrate that the Frenkel defect formed via controlled annealing of Sc2(WO4)3:Ln (Ln=Yb, Er, Eu, Tb, Sm), can work as energy reservoir and back&#8208;transfer the stored excitation energy to Ln3+ upon heating. Therefore, except routine anti&#8208;thermal quenching, thermally enhanced 415&#8208;fold downshifting and 405&#8208;fold upconversion luminescence are even obtained in Sc2(WO4)3:Yb/Er, which has set a record of both the Yb3+&#8208;Er3+ energy transfer efficiency (&gt;85&#8201;%) and the working temperature at 500 and 1073&#8197;K, respectively. Moreover, this design strategy is extendable to other hosts possessing Frenkel defect, and modulation of which directly determines whether enhanced or decreased luminescence can be obtained. This discovery has paved new avenues to reliable generation of high&#8208;temperature luminescence.

         <title>Mercaptoamine&#8208;assisted Post&#8208;encapsulation of Metal Nanoparticles within Preformed Zeolites and their Analogues for Hydroisomerization and Methane Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general synthetic strategy for the post&#8208;encapsulating of metal nanoparticles within preformed zeolites by using 2&#8208;aminoethanethiol as the bi&#8208;grafting agent. Thiol groups are coordinated to metal centers, whereas amine moieties are dynamically attached to micropore walls via acid&#8208;base interactions. The zeolite&#8208;encapsulated catalysts demonstrated high resistance to sintering and fouling in hydroisomerization and methane decomposition.







Abstract
We report a general synthetic strategy for post&#8208;encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within preformed zeolites using post&#8208;synthetic modification. Both anionic and cationic precursors to metal nanoparticle are supported on 8&#8208; and 10&#8208;membered ring zeolites and analogues during wet impregnation using 2&#8208;aminoethanethiol (AET) as a bi&#8208;grafting agent. Thiol groups are coordinated to metal centers, whereas amine moieties are dynamically attached to micropore walls via acid&#8208;base interactions. The dynamic acid&#8208;base interactions cause the even distribution of the metal&#8208;AET complex throughout the zeolite matrix. These processes encapsulate Au, Rh, and Ni precursors within the CHA, *MRE, MFI zeolite, and SAPO&#8208;34 zeolite analogues, for which small channel apertures preclude the post&#8208;synthesis impregnation of metal precursors. Sequential activation forms small and uniform nanoparticles (1&#8211;2.5&#8197;nm in diameter), as confirmed through electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Containment within the small micropores protected the nanoparticles against harsh thermal sintering conditions and prevented the fouling of the metal surface by coke, thus resulting in a high catalytic performance in n&#8208;dodecane hydroisomerization and methane decomposition. The remarkable specificity of the thiol to metal precursors and the dynamic acid&#8208;base interaction make these protocols extendable to various metal&#8208;zeolite systems, suitable for shape&#8208;selective catalysts in challenging chemical environments.

         <title>Regulated High&#8208;Spin State and Constrained Charge Behavior of Active Cobalt Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are developed by assembling definite cobalt&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon configurations onto carbon nanotubes using linkers with different electronic effects. The resulting COFs have high&#8208;spin state active cobalt sites, which constrain charge behaviors and serve as an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
A novel type of covalent organic frameworks has been developed by assembling definite cobalt&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon configurations onto carbon nanotubes using linkers that have varying electronic effects. This innovative approach has resulted in an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, which is understood by a combination of in situ spectroelectrochemistry and the bond order theorem. The strong interaction between the electron&#8208;donating carbon nanotubes and the electron&#8208;accepting linker mitigates the trend of charge loss at cobalt sites, while inducing the generation of high spin state. This enhances the adsorption strength and electron transfer between the cobalt center and reactants/intermediates, leading to an improved oxygen reduction capability. This work not only presents an effective strategy for developing efficient non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts through reticular chemistry, but also provides valuable insights into regulating the electronic configuration and charge behavior of active sites in designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Prussian Blue Analogues with Optimized Crystal Plane Orientation and Low Crystal Defects toward 450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost Fe&#8208;based Prussian blue analogue with increased redox potential and high energy density is reported for safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries by introducing potassium into the framework and regulating the crystal phase orientation. The unconventional and highly&#8208;reversible phase evolution is also identified, and preferred guest&#8208;ion storage sites and migration mechanism are analyzed through theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for alkali&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the high water and vacancy content of PBAs lower their energy density and bring safety issues, impeding their large&#8208;scale application. Herein, a facile &#8220;potassium&#8208;ions assisted&#8221; strategy is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs. By manipulating the dominant crystal plane and suppressing vacancies, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs exhibit increased redox potential resulting in high energy density up to &#8776;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is at the same level of the well&#8208;known LiFePO4 cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, unconventional highly&#8208;reversible phase evolution and redox&#8208;active pairs were identified by multiple in situ techniques for the first time. The preferred guest&#8208;ion storage sites and migration mechanism were systematically analysed through theoretical calculations. We believe these results could inspire the design of safe with high energy density.

         <title>Observing Confined Local Oxygen&#8208;induced Reversible Thiol/Disulfide Cycle with a Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible thiol/disulfide cycle under protein confinement was monitored in real&#8208;time using a mutant aerolysin nanopore. Experiments combined with kinetic calculations revealed that confined local O2 can lead to proton&#8208;involved, oxygen&#8208;induced disulfide bond cleavage. The negatively charged neighboring microenvironment facilitates disulfide bond cleavage, which plays a vital role in redox signaling and reactions.







Abstract
Disulfide bonds play an important role in thiol&#8208;based redox regulation. However, owing to the lack of analytical tools, little is known about how local O2 mediates the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle under protein confinement. In this study, a protein&#8208;nanopore inside a glove box is used to control local O2 for single&#8208;molecule reaction, as well as a single&#8208;molecule sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle. The results demonstrate that the local O2 molecules in protein nanopores could facilitate the redox cycle of disulfide formation and cleavage by promoting a higher fraction of effective reactant collisions owing to nanoconfinement. Further kinetic calculations indicate that the negatively charged residues near reactive sites facilitate proton&#8208;involved oxygen&#8208;induced disulfide cleavage under protein confinement. The unexpectedly strong oxidation ability of confined local O2 may play an essential role in cellular redox signaling and enzyme reactions.

Further kinetic calculations indicate that the negatively charged residues near reactive sites facilitate proton-involved oxygen-induced disulfide cleavage under protein confinement. The unexpectedly strong oxidation ability of confined local O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may play an essential role in cellular redox signaling and enzyme reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonance Building&#8208;Block&#8208;Based Electroluminescent Material: Lengthening Emission Maximum and Shortening Delayed Fluorescence Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unique strategy was proposed to develop multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter (m&#8208;DBCz) by arranging two MR&#8208;building blocks in the slipping&#8208;repeat mode in multiple resonance skeleton. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing m&#8208;DBCz as emitter exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with high color purity, external quantum efficiency of 36.3&#8201;% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off at ultra&#8208;high brightness.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are considered a class of organic materials with exceptional electronic and optical properties, which make them promising for the applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we improved, synthesized, and characterized a multiple&#8208;resonance type emitter based on the assembly of MR&#8208;building blocks (MR&#8208;BBs). By optimizing the geometric arrangement of MR&#8208;BBs, we were able to generate narrowband emission in the longer wavelength region and shorten the delayed excited&#8208;state lifetime, resulting in improved emission efficiency compared to the parent molecule. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule, m&#8208;DBCz, exhibited narrowband yellowish&#8208;green TADF emission with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 32&#8197;nm and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 0.04&#8197;eV. The OLED developed using m&#8208;DBCz as the emitter demonstrated electroluminescence at 548&#8197;nm and achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.9&#8201;%. Further optimization of the device resulted in a high external quantum efficiency of 36.3&#8201;% and extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQE values of 30.1&#8201;% and 27.7&#8201;% obtained even at high luminance levels of 50&#8201;000 and 100&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These results demonstrate the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF materials for applications on ultrahigh&#8208;luminance OLEDs.

         <title>Geometric Isomerisation of Bifunctional Alkenyl Fluoride Linchpins: Stereodivergence in Amide and Polyene Bioisostere Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenyl fluorides are valuable amide bioisosteres, but emulating endergonic isomerisation by &#936;[CF=CH] mimicry remains challenging. Herein we report an energy transfer catalysis platform to enable the isomerisation of fluorinated &#946;&#8208;borylacrylate linchpins with an inexpensive sensitiser (up to E/Z 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 in 1&#8197;h). The ambiphilic nature of the products enables facile functionalisation at both termini, and this is demonstrated in a target synthesis.







Abstract
Amide groups are pervasive across the chemical space continuum, where their structural and pharmacological importance, juxtaposed with the hydrolytic vulnerabilities, continues to fuel bioisostere development. Alkenyl fluorides have a venerable history as effective mimics (&#936;[CF=CH]) owing to the planarity of the motif and intrinsic polarity of the C(sp2)&#8722;F bond. However, emulating the s&#8208;cis to the s&#8208;trans isomerisation of a peptide bond with fluoro&#8208;alkene surrogates remains challenging, and current synthetic solutions only enable access to a single configuration. Through the design of an ambiphilic linchpin based on a fluorinated &#946;&#8208;borylacrylate, it has been possible to leverage energy transfer catalysis to affect this unprecedented isomerisation process: this provides geometrically&#8208;programmable building blocks that can be functionalised at either terminus. Irradiation at &#955;max=402&#8197;nm with inexpensive thioxanthone as a photocatalyst enables rapid, effective isomerisation of tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted species (up to E/Z 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 in 1&#8197;h), providing a stereodivergent platform for small molecule amide and polyene isostere discovery. Application of the methodology in target synthesis and initial laser spectroscopic studies are disclosed together with crystallographic analyses of representative products.

         <title>Interfacial Ti&#8722;S Bond Modulated S&#8208;Scheme MOF/Covalent Triazine Framework Nanosheet Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>

An S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction built up from titanium&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;902) @thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine framework (CTF&#8208;Th) nanosheets was prepared. It has controllable interfacial oxygen vacancies (OVs). This heterojunction demonstrates high efficiency in photocatalytic C3&#8208;acylation of indoles with a yield 8.2&#8197;times larger than pristine CTF&#8208;Th or MOF&#8208;902. The reaction could be applied to a range of substrates.







Abstract
Constructing photocatalyst systems to functionalize the inert C&#8722;H bonds has attracted extensive research interest. However, purposeful modulation of interfacial charge transfer in heterostructures remains a challenge, as it usually suffers from sluggish kinetics. Reported herein is an easy strategy to construct the heteroatom&#8208;induced interface for developing the titanium&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;902) @ thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine frameworks (CTF&#8208;Th) nanosheets S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions with controllable oxygen vacancies (OVs). Specifically, Ti atoms were first anchored onto the heteroatom site of CTF&#8208;Th nanosheets, and then grown into MOF&#8208;902 via an interfacial Ti&#8722;S linkage, generating OVs. Using in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the enhanced interfacial charge separation and transfer induced by moderate OVs in the pre&#8208;designed S&#8208;scheme nanosheets was validated. The heterostructures exhibited an improved efficiency in photocatalytic C3&#8208;acylation of indoles under mild conditions with a yield 8.2&#8197;times larger than pristine CTF&#8208;Th or MOF&#8208;902 and enabled an extended scope of substrates (15&#8197;examples). This performance is superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalyst and can be retained, without significant loss, after 12&#8197;consecutive cycles.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Modulated Metal Tetrathiafulvalene Octacarboxylate Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three similar MOFs were constructed with Zn2+/Mn2+/Cd2+ and a new tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;octacarboxylate&#8208;based ligand (o&#8208;H8TTFOB), possessing excellent electrochemical performance as anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The slight difference in the structures introduced by adjusting the radius of the metal ions leads to a change in the coordination environment, which results in the highest reversible specific capacity of 1288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 in Zn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB.







Abstract
Modulation of the ligands and coordination environment of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has been an effective and relatively unexplored avenue for improving the anode performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). In this study, three MOFs are synthesized, namely, M4(o&#8208;TTFOB)(bpm)2(H2O)2 (where M is Mn, Zn, and Cd; o&#8208;H8TTFOB is ortho&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene octabenzoate; and bpm is 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrimidine), based on a new ligand o&#8208;H8TTFOB with two adjacent carboxylates on one phenyl, which allows us to establish the impact of metal coordination on the performance of these MOFs as anode materials in LIBs. Mn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB and Zn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB, with two more uncoordinated oxygen atoms from o&#8208;TTFOB8&#8722;, show higher reversible specific capacities of 1249&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after full activation. In contrast, Cd&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB shows a reversible capacity of 448&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the same condition due to the lack of uncoordinated oxygen atoms. Crystal structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry measurements of the half&#8208;cell configurations, and density functional theory calculations have been performed to explain the lithium storage mechanism, diffusion kinetics, and structure&#8208;function relationship.

&lt;p&gt;Three similar MOFs were constructed with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and a new tetrathiafulvalene-octacarboxylate-based ligand (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;TTFOB), possessing excellent electrochemical performance as anode in lithium-ion batteries. The slight difference in the structures introduced by adjusting the radius of the metal ions leads to a change in the coordination environment, which results in the highest reversible specific capacity of 1288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in Zn-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-TTFOB.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modulation of the ligands and coordination environment of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has been an effective and relatively unexplored avenue for improving the anode performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this study, three MOFs are synthesized, namely, M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-TTFOB)(bpm)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (where M is Mn, Zn, and Cd; &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;TTFOB is ortho-tetrathiafulvalene octabenzoate; and bpm is 2,2&#8242;-bipyrimidine), based on a new ligand &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;TTFOB with two adjacent carboxylates on one phenyl, which allows us to establish the impact of metal coordination on the performance of these MOFs as anode materials in LIBs. Mn-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-TTFOB and Zn-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-TTFOB, with two more uncoordinated oxygen atoms from &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-TTFOB&lt;sup&gt;8&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, show higher reversible specific capacities of 1249&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after full activation. In contrast, Cd-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-TTFOB shows a reversible capacity of 448&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under the same condition due to the lack of uncoordinated oxygen atoms. Crystal structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry measurements of the half-cell configurations, and density functional theory calculations have been performed to explain the lithium storage mechanism, diffusion kinetics, and structure-function relationship. This study demonstrates the advantages of MOFs with high designability in the fabrication of LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Significant Acceleration of Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface of Microdroplets
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency in microdroplets is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding bulk phase reaction. The acceleration is essentially related to an intrinsic strong electric field at the abundant air&#8208;water interface that can promote the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is largely constrained by the sluggish mass transfer and fast combination of photogenerated charge carriers. Herein, we find that the photocatalytic CO2RR efficiency at the abundant gas&#8208;liquid interface provided by microdroplets is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding bulk phase reaction. Even in the absence of sacrificial agents, the production rates of HCOOH over WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.33H2O mediated by microdroplets reaches 2536&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 (vs. 13&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in bulk phase), which is significantly superior to the previously reported photocatalytic CO2RR in bulk phase reaction condition. Beyond the efficient delivery of CO2 to photocatalyst surfaces within microdroplets, we reveal that the strong electric field at the gas&#8208;liquid interface of microdroplets essentially promotes the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. This study provides a deep understanding of ultrafast reaction kinetics promoted by the gas&#8208;liquid interface of microdroplets and a novel way of addressing the low efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to fuel.

         <title>Fused Triangulene Dimers: Facile Synthesis by Intramolecular Radical&#8208;Radical Coupling and Application for Near&#8208;Infrared Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fused triangulene dimers were synthesized by an intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling approach. The obtained material, dispersed in polystyrene films, showed amplified spontaneous emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. Solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers were also successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Large graphene&#8208;like molecules with four zigzag edges are ideal gain medium materials for organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lasers. However, synthesizing them becomes increasingly challenging as the molecular size increases. In this study, we introduce a new intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling approach and successfully synthesize two fused triangulene dimers (1&#8201;a/1&#8201;b) efficiently. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of 1&#8201;a indicates that there is no intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the solid state. When the more soluble derivative 1&#8201;b is dispersed in polystyrene thin films, amplified spontaneous emission in the NIR region is observed. Using 1&#8201;b as the active gain material, we fabricate solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers that exhibit a narrow emission linewidth at around 790&#8197;nm. The laser devices also exhibit low thresholds with high photostability. Our study provides a new synthetic strategy for extended nanographenes, which have diverse applications in electronics and photonics.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Mediated Tumor Energy Remodeling for Sensitizing Mild Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform based on copper sulfide (ADT@CuSNDs) that is able to remodel the tumor energy via hydrogen sulfide (H2S) mediation was developed to sensitize the tumor to mild photothermal therapy (mPTT). ADT@CuSNDs could sustainably deliver H2S to tumor sites, disrupt the mitochondrial respiratory chain, inhibit ATP generation, and reduce heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) overexpression, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic outcome.







Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of tumors requires high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to maintain therapeutic resistance, posing a major challenge for photothermal therapy (PTT). Although raising the temperature helps in tumor ablation, it frequently leads to severe side effects. Therefore, improving the therapeutic response and promoting healing are critical considerations in the development of PTT. Here, we proposed a gas&#8208;mediated energy remodeling strategy to improve mild PTT efficacy while minimizing side effects. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved drug&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor was developed to provide a sustained supply of H2S to tumor sites, serving as an adjuvant to PTT. This approach proved to be highly effective in disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain, inhibiting ATP generation, and reducing the overexpression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which ultimately amplified the therapeutic outcome. With the ability to reverse tumor thermotolerance, this strategy delivered a greatly potent antitumor response, achieving complete tumor ablation in a single treatment while minimizing harm to healthy tissues. Thus, it holds great promise to be a universal solution for overcoming the limitations of PTT and may serve as a valuable paradigm for the future clinical translation of photothermal nanoagents.

         <title>Enhanced CO Adsorption by Modulating the Electron Density Distribution of Graphite&#8208;Copper Porphyrin Sorbents with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from the current methodology depending on the mechanical deformation of photochromic units, the nondeforming photo&#8208;responsiveness of the sorbent is exploited in this study, via the change of electron density distribution at stable excited states. The CO adsorption capability can be dramatically photo&#8208;gained over the sorbent with an ultra&#8208;low specific surface area.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;responsive adsorption has emerged as a vibrant area, but its current methodology is limited by the well&#8208;defined photochromic units and their molecular deformation driven by photo&#8208;stimuli. Herein, a methodology of nondeforming photo&#8208;responsiveness is successfully exploited. With the exploiting agent of Cu&#8208;TCPP framework assembled on the graphite and strongly interacted with it, the sorbent generates two kinds of adsorption sites, over which the electron density distribution of the graphite layer can be modulated at the c&#8208;axis direction, which can further evolve due to photo&#8208;stimulated excited states. The excited states are stable enough to meet the timescale of microscopic adsorption equilibrium. Independent of the ultra&#8208;low specific surface area of the sorbent (20&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), the CO adsorption capability can be improved from 0.50&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the ground state to 1.24&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar) with the visible light radiation, rather than the photothermal desorption.

     alt="Enhanced CO Adsorption by Modulating the Electron Density Distribution of Graphite-Copper Porphyrin Sorbents with Light"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different from the current methodology depending on the mechanical deformation of photochromic units, the nondeforming photo-responsiveness of the sorbent is exploited in this study, via the change of electron density distribution at stable excited states. The CO adsorption capability can be dramatically photo-gained over the sorbent with an ultra-low specific surface area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo-responsive adsorption has emerged as a vibrant area, but its current methodology is limited by the well-defined photochromic units and their molecular deformation driven by photo-stimuli. Herein, a methodology of nondeforming photo-responsiveness is successfully exploited. With the exploiting agent of Cu-TCPP framework assembled on the graphite and strongly interacted with it, the sorbent generates two kinds of adsorption sites, over which the electron density distribution of the graphite layer can be modulated at the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis direction, which can further evolve due to photo-stimulated excited states. The excited states are stable enough to meet the timescale of microscopic adsorption equilibrium. Independent of the ultra-low specific surface area of the sorbent (20&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the CO adsorption capability can be improved from 0.50&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at the ground state to 1.24&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (0&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar) with the visible light radiation, rather than the photothermal desorption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts Derived from a Preorganized Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction</title>

Fe dual&#8208;atom catalysts with Fe2N6C8O2 configuration were fabricated through the one&#8208;step carbonization of a preorganized covalent organic framework, which exhibited high oxygen reduction activity due to the enhanced adsorption of *OOH, and adjustable d&#8208;band center.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DAC) are deemed as promising electrocatalysts due to the abundant active sites and adjustable electronic structure, but the fabrication of well&#8208;defined DAC is still full of challenges. Herein, bonded Fe dual&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe2DAC) with Fe2N6C8O2 configuration were developed through one&#8208;step carbonization of a preorganized covalent organic framework with bimetallic Fe chelation sites (Fe2COF). The transition from Fe2COF to Fe2DAC involved the dissociation of the nanoparticles and the capture of atoms by carbon defects. Benefitting from the optimized d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of OOH* intermediates, Fe2DAC exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.898&#8197;V vs. RHE. This work will guide more fabrication of dual&#8208;atom and even cluster catalysts from preorganized COF in the future.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis via Modulating the Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) into the KOH electrolyte improves the selectivity and activity of H2O2 electrosynthesis. The hydrogen bonds formed between DMSO and water molecules can reduce the activity of water dissociation to active H* species. The suitable H* supply environment improves the selectivity of H2O2 via suppressing 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction.







Abstract
Designing highly efficient and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis remains challenging. Inhibiting the competitive side reaction, 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction to H2O, is essential for highly selective H2O2 electrosynthesis. Instead of hindering excessive hydrogenation of H2O2 via catalyst modification, we discover that adding a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), to the KOH electrolyte enables simultaneous improvement of the selectivity and activity of H2O2 electrosynthesis. Spectral characterization and molecular simulation confirm that the formation of hydrogen bonds between DMSO and water molecules at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface can reduce the activity of water dissociation into active H* species. The suitable H* supply environment hinders excessive hydrogenation of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thus improving the selectivity of 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR and achieving over 90&#8201;% selectivity of H2O2. This work highlights the importance of regulating the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond environment by organic molecules as a means of boosting electrochemical performance in aqueous electrosynthesis and beyond.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Integration of a Hydrophobic and Fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Inorganic Interphase to Stabilize Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ integration of a hydrophobic and fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conductive inorganic interphase layer composed of zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) on Zn by a room&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry method effectively addresses the irreversible issues facing Zn anodes involving dendrite growth and water erosion, while the hydrophilic and loose ZnHCF particles&#8208;based interphase counterpart cannot efficiently prevent water erosion on Zn during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
The irreversible issues of Zn anode stemming from dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced erosion have severely hindered the commercialization of rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries. Herein, a hydrophobic and fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conductive zinc hexacyanoferrate (HB&#8208;ZnHCF) interphase layer is in situ integrated on Zn by a rapid room&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry method to address these dilemmas. Different from currently proposed hydrophilic inorganic cases, the hydrophobic and compact HB&#8208;ZnHCF interphase effectively prevents the access of water molecules to Zn surface, thus avoiding H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. Moreover, the HB&#8208;ZnHCF with large internal ion channels, strong zincophilicity, and high Zn2+ transference number (0.86) permits fast Zn2+ transport and enables smooth Zn deposition. Remarkably, the resultant HB&#8208;ZnHCF@Zn electrode delivers unprecedented reversibility with 99.88&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency over 3000&#8197;cycles, realizes long&#8208;term cycling over 5800&#8197;h (&gt;8&#8197;months, 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and 1000&#8197;h (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and assures the stable operation of full Zn battery with both coin&#8208; and pouch&#8208;type configurations.

         <title>Initiator&#8208;Activation Strategy&#8208;Enabled Organocatalyzed Reversible&#8208;Deactivation Radical Polymerization Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed controlled radical polymerization has been established using a bis(phenothiazine)arene catalyst, enabling efficient initiation from sulfonyl chlorides with pyridine activators via photo&#8208;induced electron transfer. This work furnishes a versatile method to tailor poly(meth)acrylates without transition&#8208;metal concerns. It facilitates grafting polymerization toward brush topologies, &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; temporal control, and chain extensions.







Abstract
Organocatalyzed reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerizations (RDRPs) are attractive for many applications. Here, we developed photoredox&#8208;mediated RDRP by activating (hetero)aryl sulfonyl chloride (ArSO2Cl) initiators with pyridines and designing a novel bis(phenothiazine)arene catalyst. The in situ formed sulfonyl pyridinium intermediates effectively promote controlled chain&#8208;growth from ArSO2Cl, enabling access to various well&#8208;defined polymers with high initiation efficiencies and controlled dispersities under mild conditions. This versatile method allows &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; temporal control, chain&#8208;extension, facile synthesis of different polymer brushes via organocatalyzed grafting reactions from linear chains. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence decay studies and calculations support the reaction mechanism. This work provides a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free RDRP to tailor polymers with readily available aromatic initiators, and will promote the design of polymerization leveraged from photoredox catalysis.

This work provides a transition-metal-free RDRP to tailor polymers with readily available aromatic initiators, and will promote the design of polymerization leveraged from photoredox catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solar Hydrocarbons: Single&#8208;Step, Atmospheric&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of C2&#8722;C4 Alkanes and Alkenes from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
At atmospheric pressure, solar&#8208;energy&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step CO2 hydrogenation to C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons is realized with considerable activity. The photothermal effect of light plays an essential role in the distinct selectivity to hydrocarbons. Promising results obtained from a laboratory demonstration bode well for the development of a solar hydrocarbon pilot refinery.







Abstract
Cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) spinel has been found to produce C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons in a single&#8208;step, ambient&#8208;pressure, photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 with a rate of 1.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, selectivity of 29.8&#8201;% and conversion yield of 12.9&#8201;%. On stream the CoFe2O4 reconstructs to a CoFe&#8722;CoFe2O4 alloy&#8208;spinel nanocomposite which facilitates the light&#8208;assisted transformation of CO2 to CO and hydrogenation of the CO to C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons. Promising results obtained from a laboratory demonstrator bode well for the development of a solar hydrocarbon pilot refinery.

         <title>Uncovering Dynamic Edge&#8208;Sites in Atomic Co&#8722;N&#8722;C Electrocatalyst for Selective Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlated in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy study provides insight into the dynamics of the edge&#8208;sites in atomic Co&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction. Observation of adapted dynamic oxo adsorption and valence state shuttling between Co(2&#8722;&#948;)+ and Co2+ manifests the structural flexibility of unique edge&#8208;hosted atomic Co sites, in contrast to the rigid in&#8208;plane embedded Co1&#8722;Nx counterpart.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of single&#8208;atom catalytic sites and identifying their spectroscopic fingerprints are essential prerequisites for the rational design of target catalysts. Here, we apply correlated in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy to probe the edge&#8208;site&#8208;specific chemistry of Co&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) operation. The unique edge&#8208;hosted architecture affords single&#8208;atom Co site remarkable structural flexibility with adapted dynamic oxo adsorption and valence state shuttling between Co(2&#8722;&#948;)+ and Co2+, in contrast to the rigid in&#8208;plane embedded Co1&#8722;Nx counterpart. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergistic interplay of in situ reconstructed Co1&#8722;N2&#8208;oxo with peripheral oxygen groups gives a rise to the near&#8208;optimal adsorption of *OOH intermediate and substantially increases the activation barrier for its dissociation, accounting for a robust acidic ORR activity and 2e&#8722; selectivity for H2O2 production.

         <title>Enhancing Carrier Transport via &#963;&#8208;Linkage Length Modulation in D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A Semiconductors for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A organic photocatalysts (imidazole&#8208;alkyl&#8208;perylene diimide, denoted as IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDI) are presented with different &#963;&#8208;linkage lengths and high crystallinity. Through tuning &#963;&#8208;linkage length, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance is finely controlled, and the carrier transport rate and photocatalytic performance of materials is improved. The use of an ethyl&#8208;linkage can shorten the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance most significantly to yield the best photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Carrier transport is an equally decisive factor as carrier separation for elevating photocatalytic efficiency. However, limited by indefinite structures and low crystallinities, studies on enhancing carrier transport of organic photocatalysts are still in their infancy. Here, we develop an &#963;&#8208;linkage length modulation strategy to enhance carrier transport in imidazole&#8208;alkyl&#8208;perylene diimide (IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDI, corresponding to D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A) photocatalysts by controlling &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance. Ethyl&#8208;linkage can shorten &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance (3.19&#8197;&#197;) the most among IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDIs (where alkyl=none, ethyl, and n&#8208;propyl) via minimizing steric hindrance between D and A moieties, which leads to the fastest carrier transport rates. Thereby, IMZ&#8208;ethyl&#8208;PDI exhibits remarkable enhancement in phenol degradation with 32&#8208;fold higher rates than IMZ&#8208;PDI, as well as the oxygen evolution rate (271&#8208;fold increased). In microchannel reactors, IMZ&#8208;ethyl&#8208;PDI also presents 81.5&#8201;% phenol removal with high&#8208;flux surface hydraulic loading (44.73&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1). Our findings provide a promising molecular design guideline for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts and elucidate crucial internal carrier transport mechanisms.

         <title>Photosynthetic Fixation of CO2 in Alkenes by Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalysis with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photoredox system is reported for hydrocarboxylation of alkenes. Boron carbonitride with abundant terminal B/N defects was employed as a photo transducer, permitting construction of sterically encumbered Lewis acid&#8208;base sites that are able to synergistically activate CO2 molecules under visible light. Anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity was achieved with good functional group tolerance using CO2 as the carboxyl source.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven fixation of CO2 in organics has emerged as an appealing alternative for the synthesis of value&#8208;added fine chemicals. Challenges remain in the transformation of CO2 as well as product selectivity due to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Here we develop a boron carbonitride (BCN) with the abundant terminal B/N defects around the mesoporous walls, which essentially enhances surface active sites as well as charge transfer kinetics, boosting the overall rate of CO2 adsorption and activation. In this protocol, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrocarboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to an extended carbon chain is achieved with good functional group tolerance and specific regioselectivity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The mechanistic studies demonstrate the formation of CO2 radical anion intermediate on defective boron carbonitride, leading to the anti&#8208;Markovnikov carboxylation. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural products and synthesis of anti&#8208;diabetic GPR40 agonists reveal the utility of this method. This study sheds new insight on the design and application of metal&#8208;free semiconductors for the conversion of CO2 in an atom&#8208;economic and sustainable manner.

         <title>Sequence Control in Asymmetric Terpolymerizations of meso&#8208;Epoxides, CO2, and Phthalic Anhydride: Unprecedented Statistical Ester&#8211;Carbonate Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric terpolymerizations of meso&#8208;epoxides, CO2, and phthalic anhydride mediated by dinuclear aluminum catalysts with multiple stereogenic centers delivered unprecedented statistical ester&#8211;carbonate distributions and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The statistical terpolymerization of epoxides, CO2 and cyclic anhydrides remains challenging, mainly because epoxide/CO2 and epoxide/anhydride copolymerizations typically proceed at considerably different rates. Herein, we report the syntheses of novel chiral terpolymers with unprecedented statistical distributions of carbonate and ester units (up to 50&#8201;% junction units) via the one&#8208;pot reaction of cyclohexene oxide, phthalic anhydride, and CO2 under mild conditions using enantiopure bimetallic aluminum&#8208;complex&#8208;based catalyst systems. Notably, all resulting terpolymers exhibited excellent enantioselectivities (&#8805;96&#8201;% ee) that were independent of the carbonate&#8211;ester distribution. The statistical compositions of the carbonate and ester units in the resulting terpolymers were determined via 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. Furthermore, thermal properties were tuned by altering the ester content of the chiral terpolymer without influencing the enantioselective ring&#8208;opening step involving the meso&#8208;epoxide. This asymmetric terpolymerization methodology is also compatible with a variety of meso&#8208;epoxides to afford the corresponding terpolymers with 17&#8201;%&#8211;25&#8201;% junction units and excellent enantioselectivities (94&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). The present study is expected to provide new guidelines for preparing a broad range of biodegradable polymers with excellent enantioselectivities and adjustable properties.

         <title>Alkali Metal Dihydropyridines in Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysis of Imines: Amide Basicity versus Hydride Surrogacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
When it comes to catalytic transfer hydrogenation of imines to amines using 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene as the hydrogen source, the 2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridyl complexes of the heavyweight alkali metals potassium, rubidium and caesium pack the greater power over their lightweight lithium and sodium rivals with, in best cases, near quantitative yields in minutes and reactions run at room temperature.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of a representative set of imines, both aldimines and ketimines, to amines has been studied using transfer hydrogenation from 1,4&#8208;dicyclohexadiene. Unusually, this has been achieved using s&#8208;block pre&#8208;catalysts, namely 1&#8208;metallo&#8208;2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 2&#8208;tBuC5H5NM, M(tBuDHP), where M=Li&#8211;Cs. Reactions have been monitored in C6D6 and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;d8 (THF&#8208;d8). A definite trend is observed in catalyst efficiency with the heavier alkali metal tBuDHPs outperforming the lighter congeners. In general, Cs(tBuDHP) is the optimal pre&#8208;catalyst with, in the best cases, reactions producing quantitative yields of amines in minutes at room temperature using 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst. Supporting the experimental study, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have also been carried out which reveal that Cs has a pathway with a significantly lower rate determining step than the Li congener. In the postulated initiation pathways DHP can act as either a base or as a surrogate hydride.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries Based on an Ultrathin and Respirable Interphase Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries with high areal capacities, high energy and power densities, as well as long cycle number have been achieved using an ultrathin and respirable interphase layer. It enables highly reversible Li plating/stripping process and unlocks new approaches for designing and screening novel interphase layers towards practical anode&#8208;free batteries.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries are desirable candidates in pursuit of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, their poor cycling performances originated from the unsatisfactory reversibility of Li plating/stripping remains a grand challenge. Here we show a facile and scalable approach to produce high&#8208;performing anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries using a bioinspired and ultrathin (250&#8197;nm) interphase layer comprised of triethylamine germanate. The derived tertiary amine and LixGe alloy showed enhanced adsorption energy that significantly promoted Li&#8208;ion adsorption, nucleation and deposition, contributing to a reversible expansion/shrinkage process upon Li plating/stripping. Impressive Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) of &#8776;99.3&#8201;% were achieved for 250&#8197;cycles in Li/Cu cells. In addition, the anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 full batteries demonstrated maximal energy and power densities of 527&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 1554&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, respectively, and remarkable cycling stability (over 250&#8197;cycles with an average CE of 99.4&#8201;%) at a practical areal capacity of &#8776;3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the highest among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 batteries. Our ultrathin and respirable interphase layer presents a promising way to fully unlock large&#8208;scale production of anode&#8208;free batteries.

A class of stereoisomeric &#945;&#8208;cyano triaryl[3]radialenes was reported, showing state&#8208;dependent light absorption &amp; photoluminescence properties and electron transfer&#8208;driven photoelectromagnetic responsiveness for multimodal information technologies. Specifically, we discussed the special modulation effects of cyano groups on these stereoisomeric radialenes, which may lead to novel design strategy for solid&#8208;state molecular materials.







Abstract
[3]Radialene has a peculiar topology and cross&#8208;conjugation system, representing a unique molecular scaffold in organic materials. Herein, we report a special class of stereoisomeric &#945;&#8208;cyano triaryl[3]radialenes (CTRs) that show concentration&#8208;caused quenching in solution but emit red&#8208;shifted and enhanced luminescence in the crystalline state. Clustering of multiple cyano groups and their through&#8208;space interactions with the [3]radialene ring significantly extend &#960;&#8208;electron communication meanwhile rigidifying the propeller conformation multivalently, thus playing a key role behind the state&#8208;dependent luminescence. These radialenes with a substantial electron affinity undergo a reversible electron transfer transition to anionic radicals with good stability, showing switching of photoabsorption, photoluminescence and electron spin resonance (ESR) signal. We also established proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications of CTRs for multimodal information encryption and chemical sensing.

         <title>Cluster Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Containing Copper Iodine Cube with 100&#8201;% Exciton Utilization Using Host&#8208;Cluster Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cluster light&#8208;emitting diode (CLED) with a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% was demonstrated. Its emissive layer consisted of redox&#8208;active Cu4I4 cluster and thermally activated delayed fluorescence host, which complementarily provided internal and external reverse intersystem crossing channels for 100&#8201;% triplet conversion, 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant.







Abstract
Clusters combine the advantages of organic molecules and inorganic nanomaterials, which are promising alternatives for optoelectronic applications. Nonetheless, recently emerged cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes require further excited state optimization of cluster emitters, especially to reduce population of the cluster&#8208;centered triplet quenching state (3CC). Here we report that redox&#8208;active ligands enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) of Cu4I4 cluster for triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet conversion, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host can provide an external RISC channel. It indicates that the complementarity between TADF host and cluster in RISC transitions gives rise to 100&#8201;% triplet conversion efficiency and complete singlet exciton convergence, rendering 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant. We achieve a photoluminescence quantum yield of 99&#8201;% and a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;%.

         <title>Green, General and Low&#8208;cost Synthesis of Porous Organic Polymers in Sub&#8208;kilogram Scale for Catalysis and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers (POPs) with high surface areas were synthesized using inexpensive diamine and dialdehyde monomers under green synthesis conditions. Sub&#8208;kilogram yields of POP were obtained from a scaled&#8208;up synthesis in ethanol at room temperature. The cost of POPs can be reduced to &#8776;10&#8197;USD/kg, making it significantly more cost&#8208;effective compared to other porous materials.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) with high porosity and tunable functionalities have been widely studied for use in gas separation, catalysis, energy conversion and energy storage. However, the high cost of organic monomers, and the use of toxic solvents and high temperatures during synthesis pose obstacles for large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we report the synthesis of imine and aminal&#8208;linked POPs using inexpensive diamine and dialdehyde monomers in green solvents. Theoretical calculations and control experiments show that using meta&#8208;diamines is crucial for forming aminal linkages and branching porous networks from [2+2] polycondensation reactions. The method demonstrates good generality in that 6 POPs were successfully synthesized from different monomers. Additionally, we scaled up the synthesis in ethanol at room temperature, resulting in the production of POPs in sub&#8208;kilogram quantities at a relatively low cost. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies demonstrate that the POPs can be used as high&#8208;performance sorbents for CO2 separation and as porous substrates for efficient heterogeneous catalysis. This method provides an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective approach for large&#8208;scale synthesis of various POPs.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia in Strong Acid Conditions with Fe2M&#8208;Trinuclear&#8208;Cluster Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient, direct, electrocatalytic ammonia production from nitrate in a strong acid environment is possible by using the efficient electron proton conduction capability of the dinitrogen ligand and the metal active site in an Fe&#8208;based trinuclear cluster metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF).







Abstract
Nitrate&#8208;containing industrial wastewater poses a serious threat to the global food security and public health safety. As compared to the traditional microbial denitrification, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction shows better sustainability with ultrahigh energy efficiency and the production of high&#8208;value ammonia (NH3). However, nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater from most industrial processes, such as mining, metallurgy, and petrochemical engineering, is generally acidic, which contradicts the typical neutral/alkaline working conditions for both denitrifying bacteria and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inorganic electrocatalysts, leading to the demand for pre&#8208;neutralization and the problematic hydrogen evaluation reaction (HER) competition and catalyst dissolution. Here, we report a series of Fe2M (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) trinuclear cluster metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that enable the highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonium under strong acidic conditions with excellent stability. In pH=1 electrolyte, the Fe2Co&#8208;MOF demonstrates the NH3 yield rate of 20653.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1site with 90.55&#8201;% NH3&#8208;Faradaic efficiency (FE), 98.5&#8201;% NH3&#8208;selectivity and up to 75&#8197;hr of electrocatalytic stability. Additionally, successful nitrate reduction in high&#8208;acidic conditions directly produce the ammonium sulfate as nitrogen fertilizer, avoiding the subsequent aqueous ammonia extraction and preventing the ammonia spillage loss. This series of cluster&#8208;based MOF structures provide new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance nitrate reduction catalysts under environmentally&#8208;relevant wastewater conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Mechanism and Chiral Transfer in CuO Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For inorganic material self&#8208;assembly, chiral communication generally aims at transferring and amplifying chirality from the molecules to the superstructure. The demanding fabrication and complex structure seriously hinder understanding the mechanism of chiral transfer and superstructure formation. In this work, we use a simple and mild synthesis method to demonstrate the evolution of the morphology and chirality of hierarchical superstructures.







Abstract
Chiral inorganic superstructures have received considerable interest due to the chiral communication between inorganic compounds and chiral organic additives. However, the demanding fabrication and complex multilevel structure seriously hinder the understanding of chiral transfer and self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. Herein, we use chiral CuO superstructures as a model system to study the formation process of hierarchical chiral structures. Based on a simple and mild synthesis route, the time&#8208;resolved morphology and the in situ chirality evolution could be easily followed. The morphology evolution of the chiral superstructure involves hierarchical assembly, including primary nanoparticles, intermediate bundles, and superstructure at different growth stages. Successive redshifts and enhancements of the CD signal support chiral transfer from the surface penicillamine to the inorganic superstructure. Full&#8208;field electro&#8208;dynamical simulations reproduced the structural chirality and allowed us to predict its modulation. This work opens the door to a large family of chiral inorganic materials where chiral molecule&#8208;guided self&#8208;assembly can be specifically designed to follow a bottom&#8208;up chiral transfer pathway.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia Using Tiara&#8208;like Phenylethanethiolated Nickel Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atom&#8208;precise nickel&#8208;thiolate clusters activate dinitrogen electrochemically and selectively transform it to ammonia with 25&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. A combined approach based on experimental results and theoretical calculations sheds light on the mechanism of this electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction.







Abstract
The fixing of N2 to NH3 is challenging due to the inertness of the N&#8801;N bond. Commercially, ammonia production depends on the energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch (H&#8722;B) process, which emits CO2 while using fossil fuels as the sources of hydrogen and energy. An alternative method for NH3 production is the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) process as it is powered by renewable energy sources. Here, we report a tiara&#8208;like nickel&#8208;thiolate cluster, [Ni6(PET)12] (where, PET=2&#8208;phenylethanethiol)] as an efficient electro&#8208;catalyst for the electrochemical NRR at ambient conditions. Ammonia (NH3: 16.2&#177;0.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was the only nitrogenous product over the potential of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc with a Faradaic efficiency of 25%&#177;1.7. Based on theoretical calculations, NRR by [Ni6(PET)12] proceeds through both the distal and alternating pathways with an onset potential of &#8722;1.84&#8197;V vs. RHE (i.e., &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc) which corroborates with the experimental findings.

&lt;p&gt;Atom-precise nickel-thiolate clusters activate dinitrogen electrochemically and selectively transform it to ammonia with 25&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. A combined approach based on experimental results and theoretical calculations sheds light on the mechanism of this electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fixing of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is challenging due to the inertness of the N&#8801;N bond. Commercially, ammonia production depends on the energy-consuming Haber-Bosch (H&#8722;B) process, which emits CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; while using fossil fuels as the sources of hydrogen and energy. An alternative method for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production is the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) process as it is powered by renewable energy sources.

         <title>Nano&#8208;enabled Quenching of Bacterial Communications for the Prevention of Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new antimicrobial strategy is reported to catalytically cut off cell&#8722;cell communications in biofilm construction. Through tuning the coordination environment around zinc atoms, an efficient lactonase&#8208;like Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C nanomaterial was synthesized to mimic the active domain of lactonase, which significantly prevented biofilm formation in antibiotic&#8208;resistant strains.







Abstract
Biofilm formation is a major threat to industry, the environment and human health. While killing of embedded microbes in biofilms may inevitably lead to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), catalytic quenching of bacterial communications by lactonase is a promising antifouling approach. Given the shortcomings of protein enzymes, it is attractive to engineer synthetic materials to mimic the activity of lactonase. Herein, an efficient lactonase&#8208;like Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C nanomaterial was synthesized by tuning the coordination environment around zinc atoms to mimic the active domain of lactonase for catalytical interception of bacterial communications in biofilm formation. The Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C material could selectively catalyze 77.5&#8201;% hydrolysis of N&#8208;acylated&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine lactone (AHL), a critical bacterial quorum sensing (QS) signal in biofilm construction. Consequently, AHL degradation downregulated the expression of QS&#8208;related genes in antibiotic resistant bacteria and significantly prevented biofilm formation. As a proof of concept, Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C&#8208;coated iron plates prevented 80.3&#8201;% biofouling after a month exposure in river. Overall, our study provides a nano&#8208;enabled contactless antifouling insight to avoid AMR evolution by engineering nanomaterials for mimicking the key bacterial enzymes (e.g., lactonase) functioning in biofilm construction.

         <title>A Recyclable and Scalable High&#8208;Capacity Organic Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practically applicable organic electrode material is proposed for scalable aqueous batteries, which empower Ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale capacity in stacked large pouch cells. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the charge storage were carried out. The recycling of the organic electrode can be achieved at any state of charge with high yields through an economical process.







Abstract
Redox organic electrode materials (OEMs) have attracted extensive attention for batteries due to the possibility to be designed with high performance. However, the practical application of OEMs requires rigor criteria such as low cost, recyclability, scalability and high performance etc. and hence seems still far away. Here, we demonstrate an OEM for high performance aqueous organic batteries. Quantification of the charge storage confirmed the storage of protons with fast reaction kinetics, thereby enabling the high performance at high mass loading. As a result, the laminated pouch cells delivered Ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale capacity with excellent cycling performance. Benefited from the small molecular nature and the stable both charged and discharged states, the electrodes can be recycled at any states of charge with high yields (more than 90&#8201;%). This work provides a substantial step in the practical applications of OEMs for the future sustainable batteries.

         <title>Unlocking the Interfacial Adsorption&#8208;Intercalation Pseudocapacitive Storage Limit to Enabling All&#8208;Climate, High Energy/Power Density and Durable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) for zinc&#8208;ion batteries is mainly limited by the sluggish storage kinetics. This report presents an integrated modulation to unlock the omnidirectional storage kinetics&#8208;enhanced porous VSe2&#8722;x&#8901;n&#8201;H2O host for all&#8208;climate, high energy/power density and durable zinc&#8208;ion batteries. An interfacial adsorption and intercalation pseudocapacitive storage mechanism was also uncovered.







Abstract
Sluggish storage kinetics and insufficient performance are the major challenges that restrict the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) applied for zinc ion storage, especially at the extreme temperature conditions. Herein, a multiscale interface structure&#8208;integrated modulation concept was presented, to unlock the omnidirectional storage kinetics&#8208;enhanced porous VSe2&#8722;x&#8901;n&#8201;H2O host. Theory research indicated that the co&#8208;modulation of H2O intercalation and selenium vacancy enables enhancing the interfacial zinc ion capture ability and decreasing the zinc ion diffusion barrier. Moreover, an interfacial adsorption&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitive storage mechanism was uncovered. Such cathode displayed remarkable storage performance at the wide temperature range (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C) in aqueous and solid electrolytes. In particular, it can retain a high specific capacity of 173&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 5000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, as well as a high energy density of 290&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a power density of 15.8&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at room temperature. Unexpectedly, a remarkably energy density of 465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and power density of 21.26&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C also can be achieved, as well as 258&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 10.8&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work realizes a conceptual breakthrough for extending the interfacial storage limit of layered TMDs to construct all&#8208;climate high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Inside Cover: A Sustainable Wood&#8208;Based Iron Photocatalyst for Multiple Uses with Sunlight: Water Treatment and Radical Photopolymerization (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 27/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable photocatalyst comprising iron oxide and modified lignin provides a greener approach for material synthesis and finishes the job with wastewater cleaning using sunlight as a natural photon source. Monomers participating in radical photopolymerization enjoy these wonderful reaction conditions. The robust photocatalyst can be reused in several reaction cycles for wastewater cleaning, as reported by Bernd Strehmel, Zhijun Chen, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202301242).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile noncovalent functionalization strategy has been developed for the large&#8208;scale preparation of aqueous processable high&#8208;quality semiconducting 2D triazine polymers. In their Research Article (e202301865), Yuxi Xu et&#8197;al. demonstrate that the obtained crystalline ultrathin 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can not only be assembled into ultralight and mechanically strong macroscopic porous aerogels, but also show a new surface molecule doping effect to significantly improve the photocatalytic water splitting activity.

Post&#8208;encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within small&#8208;pore zeolites has posed a significant challenge. In their Research Article (e202303503), Hae&#8197;Sung Cho, Jeong&#8208;Chul Kim, Changbum Jo, and co&#8208;workers showcase the effective utilization of 2&#8208;aminoethanethiol as a bi&#8208;grafting agent, resulting in the even distribution of uniform nanoparticles throughout a microporous zeolite matrix. Containment within the small micropores protected the nanoparticles against harsh thermal sintering and inhibited the fouling of the metal surface by coke.

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Metal/Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbons in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and then comprehensively review the setup and application of in situ XAS, introducing electrochemical XAS cells, experimental methods, as well as primary functions on catalytic applications. The active sites and the structural evolution of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Metal/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) are promising candidates as oxygen electrocatalysts due to their low cost, tunable catalytic activity and selectivity, and well&#8208;dispersed morphologies. To improve the electrocatalytic performance of such systems, it is critical to gain a detailed understanding of their structure and properties through advanced characterization. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) serves as a powerful tool to probe both the active sites and structural evolution of catalytic materials under reaction conditions. In this review, we firstly provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of XAS and then comprehensively review the setup and application of in situ XAS, introducing electrochemical XAS cells, experimental methods, as well as primary functions on catalytic applications. The active sites and the structural evolution of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are subsequently discussed in detail. Finally, major challenges and future opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.

         <title>Driving Polymer Brushes from Synthesis to Functioning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of facile and robust surface&#8208;initiated controlled radical polymerization strategies has encouraged researchers to fabricate well&#8208;defined polymer brushes under mild conditions. This review provides an overview of very recent advances in the architectural design of polymer brushes, which show new and very promising bioapplications such as biolubrication, antifouling and antibacterial coating, biosensing, and drug delivery.







Abstract
The great success of controlled radical polymerizations has encouraged researchers to develop more facile and robust approaches for surface&#8208;initiated polymerizations (SIPs) to fabricate polymer brushes, even for non&#8208;experts. In recent years, external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;mediated radical polymerization methods have come to the fore as SIPs because of their less rigorous synthetic procedures and high controllability, which expand the opportunities for synthesizing macromolecules with desired chemical compositions and structures, as well as tailor&#8208;made polymers and bioconjugates that show broad applicability and physiological compatibility. This review discusses the latest developments in surface&#8208;initiated polymerization methods, in particular, external&#8208;stimuli mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), photo&#8208;induced polymerizations, and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, as well as other methods and their combination for the application in surface grafting. The implementation of these methods is of great interest due to their unique possibilities to temporally control a polymerization process, fast and straightforward polymerization, and environmentally benign features, which lead to established and emerging applications in biolubrication, antifouling, and biosensing.

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation and Recycling of Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve a circular polymer economy, it is desirable to convert polymers into monomers or useful building blocks. This Minireview summarizes recent developments on polymer degradation and recycling enabled by mechanochemistry.







Abstract
The accumulation of plastic waste, due to lack of recycling, has led to serious environmental pollution. Although mechanical recycling can alleviate this issue, it inevitably reduces the molecular weight and weakens the mechanical properties of materials and is not suitable for mixed materials. Chemical recycling, on the other hand, breaks the polymer into monomers or small&#8208;molecule constituents, allowing for the preparation of materials of quality comparable to that of the virgin polymers and can be applied to mixed materials. Mechanochemical degradation and recycling leverages the advantages of mechanical techniques, such as scalability and efficient energy use, to achieve chemical recycling. We summarize recent progress in mechanochemical degradation and recycling of synthetic polymers, including both commercial polymers and those designed for more efficient mechanochemical degradation. We also point out the limitations of mechanochemical degradation and present our perspectives on how the challenges can be mitigated for a circular polymer economy.

         <title>Chiral Control of Gas&#8208;Phase Molecules using Microwave Pulses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in the area of chiral control using rotational spectroscopy are highlighted. Microwave three&#8208;wave mixing is a phase&#8208;sensitive technique for enantiodifferentiation; it is discussed here together with its extension to create coherent enantiomer&#8208;selective population enrichment. This scheme results in enantioselective enrichment in a chosen rotational state that holds interesting promises for advanced chirality experiments.







Abstract
Microwave three&#8208;wave mixing has emerged as a novel approach for studying chiral molecules in the gas phase. This technique employs resonant microwave pulses and is a non&#8208;linear and coherent approach. It serves as a robust method to differentiate between the enantiomers of chiral molecules and to determine the enantiomeric excess, even in complex chiral mixtures. Besides such analytical applications, the use of tailored microwave pulses allows us to control and manipulate chirality at the molecular level. Here, an overview of some recent developments in the area of microwave three&#8208;wave mixing and its extension to enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer is provided. The latter is an important step towards enantiomer separation&#8212;in energy and finally in space. In the last section, we present new experimental results on how to improve enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer to achieve an enantiomeric excess of about 40&#8201;% in the rotational level of interest using microwave pulses alone.

         <title>Outstanding Quadratic to Septic Optical Nonlinearity at Dipolar Alkynylmetal&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>

5&#8208;Alkynylruthenium&#8208;15&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;functionalized nickel porphyrins exhibit record quadratic optical nonlinearities and outstanding two&#8208;, three&#8208;, and four&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;sections. The key optical transitions have been analyzed and their impact on the quadratic to septic nonlinearities has been suggested.







Abstract
Porphyrins are important macrocycles with applications in several areas including therapy, catalysis, and sensing. Strong nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are the key to fully exploiting the potential of these biocompatible molecules. We herein report that certain metal&#8208;alkynyl donor/nitro acceptor&#8208;functionalized porphyrins are attractive candidates for NLO applications. We show that specific examples exhibit record quadratic optical nonlinearity, exceptional two&#8208;photon absorption, and outstanding three&#8208;photon absorption, and we report the first porphyrins that exhibit four&#8208;photon absorption. The two&#8208;, three&#8208;, and four&#8208;photon absorption maxima are found at the corresponding multiples of linear absorption bands that time&#8208;dependent density functional theory assigns as admixtures of porphyrin&#8208;localized &#960;*&#8592;&#960; and donor&#8208;porphyrin to porphyrin&#8208;acceptor charge&#8208;transfer transitions.

         <title>BN&#8208;Butafulvenes and Their Application in the Synthesis of Highly Substituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
BN&#8208;butafulvenes have been synthesized from the reaction of bis(alkynyl)boranes with an uranacyclopropene complex. On the other hand, DMAP&#8208;coordinated BN&#8208;butafulvenes underwent structural rearrangement under thermal conditions, affording 1,2,4,6&#8208;multisubstituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalene products.







Abstract
BN&#8208;butafulvenes, mono&#8208;BN isosteres of butafulvene and highly strained isomers of azaborines and B&#8208;amino boroles, have been synthesized via hydrolysis of the urana&#8208;borabicyclic complexes obtained from the reactions of bis(alkynyl)boranes with an uranacyclopropene complex. Their 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) adducts can further isomerize to 1,2,4,6&#8208;multisubstituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalenes. Both NMR reaction monitoring and theoretical calculations point to a reaction mechanism involving dearomative insertion of DMAP followed by two consecutive 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shifts. The photophysical studies of the highly substituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalenes reveal a notable redshift in both the UV/Vis absorption and emission spectra. The (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations corroborate the experimental data, suggesting that the strong &#960;&#8208;donating amino substitution at the 1&#8208; and/or 6&#8208;positions destabilizes the HOMO, and thus leading to a notable decrease of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Labeling of Hydroxyindoles with Chemoselectivity (PhotoCLIC) for Site&#8208;Specific Protein Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed bioconjugation reaction, PhotoCLIC, has been developed for chemoselective attachment of aromatic amines onto a 5&#8208;hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) residue site&#8208;specifically preinstalled in a full&#8208;length protein using genetic code expansion technology. PhotoCLIC has a wide substrate scope and is compatible with the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition to enable site&#8208;specific dual&#8208;labeling of target proteins.







Abstract
We have developed a novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed bioconjugation reaction, PhotoCLIC, that enables chemoselective attachment of diverse aromatic amine reagents onto a site&#8208;specifically installed 5&#8208;hydroxytryptophan residue (5HTP) on full&#8208;length proteins of varied complexity. The reaction uses catalytic amounts of methylene blue and blue/red light&#8208;emitting diodes (455/650&#8197;nm) for rapid site&#8208;specific protein bioconjugation. Characterization of the PhotoCLIC product reveals a unique structure formed likely through a singlet oxygen&#8208;dependent modification of 5HTP. PhotoCLIC has a wide substrate scope and its compatibility with strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click reaction, enables site&#8208;specific dual&#8208;labeling of a target protein.

         <title>Hyperpolarized 13C&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy of Urine Samples at Natural Abundance by Quantitative Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarized 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization provides a rich and resolved 13C metabolic profile on urine samples at natural abundance while retaining precious quantitative information using a standard addition workflow.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) offers an ensemble of methods that remarkably address the sensitivity issues of conventional NMR. Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (d&#8208;DNP) provides a unique and general way to detect 13C&#8197;NMR signals with a sensitivity enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The expanding application scope of d&#8208;DNP now encompasses the analysis of complex mixtures at natural 13C abundance. However, the application of d&#8208;DNP in this area has been limited to metabolite extracts. Here, we report the first d&#8208;DNP&#8208;enhanced 13C&#8197;NMR analysis of a biofluid &#8208;urine&#8208; at natural abundance, offering unprecedented resolution and sensitivity for this challenging type of sample. We also show that accurate quantitative information on multiple targeted metabolites can be retrieved through a standard addition procedure.

         <title>High&#8208;Current Capable and Non&#8208;Flammable Protic Organic Electrolyte for Rechargeable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protic amide solvent N&#8208;methyl formamide (NMF) is adopted to prepare a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte for Zn anodes, resulting in an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 2000&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/2.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high coulombic efficiency of 99.57&#8201;%, wide electrochemical window (&#8776;3.43&#8197;V), and outstanding durability up to 10.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which might accelerate the development of safe and long cycle&#8208;life rechargeable zinc batteries (RZBs).







Abstract
Rechargeable Zinc batteries (RZBs) are considered a potent competitor for next&#8208;generation electrochemical devices, due to their multiple advantages. Nevertheless, traditional aqueous electrolytes may cause serious hazards to long&#8208;term battery cycling through fast capacity fading and poor Coulombic efficiency (CE), which happens due to complex reaction kinetics in aqueous systems. Herein, we proposed the novel adoption of the protic amide solvent, N&#8208;methyl formamide (NMF) as a Zinc battery electrolyte, which possesses a high dielectric constant and high flash point to promote fast kinetics and battery safety simultaneously. Dendrite&#8208;free and granular Zn deposition in Zn&#8208;NMF electrolyte assures ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 2000&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/2.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high CE of 99.57&#8201;%, wide electrochemical window (&#8776;3.43&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn), and outstanding durability up to 10.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the efficient performance of the protic non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte, which will open new opportunities to promote safe and energy&#8208;dense RZBs.

         <title>Diastereomer Resolution of M4L6 Coordination Cages by Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Resolution Ion&#8208;Mobility Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric coordination cages are separated and individually investigated using ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry. Alongside iron(II), supramolecular species containing cobalt(II) and nickel(II) were also investigated, successfully demonstrating a new approach for the investigation of paramagnetic complexes.







Abstract
Coordination cages can be used for enantio&#8208; and regioselective catalysis and for the selective sensing and separation of isomeric guest molecules. Here, stereoisomers of a family of coordination cages are resolved using ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution cyclic ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (cIM&#8208;MS). The observed ratio of diastereomers is dependent on both the metal ion and counter ion. Moreover, the point groups can be assigned through complementary NMR experiments. This method enables the identification and interrogation of the individual isomers in complex mixtures of cages which cannot be performed in solution. Furthermore, these techniques allow the stability of individual isomers within the mixture to be probed, with the T&#8208;symmetric isomers in this case shown to be more robust than the C3 and S4 analogues.

         <title>Spiroligomer&#8208;Based Macrocycles for Atomically Precise Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangular peptidomimetic macrocycles were synthesized by cyclizing highly structured spiroligomers. They were assembled into nanofilms with atomically precise pores defined by their programmable three&#8208;dimensional structures. This study demonstrates the size and shape&#8208;dependent molecular sieving with macrocycle membranes. The structural stability and diversity of spiroligomer&#8208;based macrocycles make them promising candidates for various applications.







Abstract
Here, we report a new class of peptidomimetic macrocycles with well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional structures and low conformational flexibility. They are assembled from fused&#8208;ring spiro&#8208;ladder oligomers (spiroligomers) by modular solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Two&#8208;dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance confirms their shape persistency. Triangular macrocycles of tunable sizes assemble into membranes with atomically precise pores, which exhibit size and shape&#8208;dependent molecular sieving towards a series of structurally similar compounds. The exceptional structural diversity and stability of spiroligomer&#8208;based macrocycles will be explored for more applications.

         <title>Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Acylation of Arenes by Switching from Ionic&#8208; to Radical&#8208;Type Chemistry Using NHC Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent benzoylation of 2&#8208;methoxynaphthalene with benzoyl fluoride is presented using either Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type chemistry to give selectively the 1&#8208;isomer or cooperative NHC/photoredox catalysis to afford the 4&#8208;isomer exclusively. Along with arenes, regiodivergent aroylation also works for heteroarenes.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation reaction, which belongs to the class of electrophilic aromatic substitutions is a highly valuable and versatile reaction in synthesis. Regioselectivity is predictable and determined by electronic as well as steric factors of the (hetero)arene substrate. Herein, a radical approach for the acylation of arenes and heteroarenes is presented. C&#8722;H acylation is achieved through mild cooperative photoredox/NHC radical catalysis with the cross&#8208;coupling of an arene radical cation with an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical as a key step. As compared to the classical Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation, a regiodivergent outcome is observed upon switching from the ionic to the radical mode. In these divergent reactions, aroyl fluorides act as the acylation reagents in both the ionic as well as the radical process.

         <title>Carboxylation of Acetylene without Salt Waste: Green Synthesis of C4 Chemicals Enabled by a CO2&#8208;Pressure Induced Acidity Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof of concept for a salt waste free carboxylation of acetylene was achieved with the help of a CO2&#8208;pressure dependent pH&#8208;switch. The base can be regenerated for another reaction cycle without loss of activity. This concept enables the synthesis of C4&#8208;platform chemicals such as dimethyl succinate from biogas (CH4+CO2) and hydrogen. Thermodynamic predictions with ePC&#8208;SAFT allowed to model the acidity switch and reaction conditions.







Abstract
The inherent formation of salt waste in C&#8722;H carboxylations is a key obstacle precluding the utilization of CO2 as C1 building block in the industrial synthesis of base chemicals. This challenge is addressed in a circular process for the production of the C4 base chemical dimethyl succinate from CO2 and acetylene. At moderate CO2 pressures, acetylene is doubly carboxylated in the presence of cesium carbonate. Hydrogenation of the C&#8722;C triple bond stabilizes the product against decarboxylation. By increasing the CO2 pressure to 70&#8197;bar, the medium is reversibly acidified, allowing an esterification of the succinate salt with methanol. The cesium base and the hydrogenation catalyst are regenerated and can be reused. This provides the proof of concept for a salt&#8208;free route to C4 chemicals from biogas (CH4/CO2). The origin of this reversible acidity switch and the critical roles of the cesium base and the NMP/MeOH solvents were elucidated by thermodynamic modeling.

         <title>Appealing sheath&#8208;core spun high&#8208;performance composite carbon molecular sieve membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost composite hollow fiber membranes (Matrimid&#174; as core layer and 6FDA&#8208;DAM as sheath layer) were spun with intrinsic O2/N2 selectivity greater than 2.1. High performance carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes were obtained by tuning the pyrolysis temperature. It indicates some defects from the precursor can be eliminated by higher pyrolysis temperature. More porous support layer was desired to achieve high permeability CMS.







Abstract
Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes are attractive candidates to meet requirements for challenging gas separations. The added ability to maintain such intrinsic properties in an asymmetric morphology with a structure that we term a &#8220;Pseudo Wheel+Hub &amp; Spoke&#8221; asymmetric form offers new opportunities. For CMS membrane, specifically, the structure provides both selective layer support and low flow resistance even for high feed pressures and fluxes in CO2 removal from natural gas. This capability is unavailable to even rigid glassy polymers due to the much higher modulus of CMS materials. Combining precursor asymmetric hollow fiber formation and optimized pyrolysis creates a defect free CMS proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept membrane for this application. Facile formation of the sheath&#8208;core spun precursor with a 6FDA&#8208;DAM sheath and Matrimid&#174; core also avoids the need to seal defects before or after the carbonization of the precursors. The composite CMS membrane shows CO2/CH4 (50&#8201;:&#8201;50) mixed gas feed with an attractive CO2/CH4 selectivity of 64.3 and CO2 permeance of 232&#8197;GPU at 35&#8201;&#176;C. A key additional benefit of the approach is reduction in use of the more costly high performance 6FDA&#8208;DAM in a composite sheath&#8208;core CMS membrane with the &#8220;Pseudo Wheel+Hub &amp; Spoke&#8221; structure.

         <title>Piezochromism in Dynamic Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching chromophores are prepared. For first time they are used to study piezochromism under mechanical stimuli by the diamond anvil cell technique.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials with pressure&#8208;dependent photoluminescence tuning properties are important in many fields, such as mechanical sensors, security papers, and storage devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as an emerging class of crystalline porous materials (CPMs) with structural dynamics and tunable photophysical properties, are suitable for designing piezochromic materials, but there are few related studies. Herein, we report two dynamic three&#8208;dimensional COFs based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) chromophores, termed JUC&#8208;635 and JUC&#8208;636 (JUC=Jilin University China), and for the first time, study their piezochromic behavior by diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the various luminescent groups, JUC&#8208;635 has completely different solvatochromism and molecular aggregation behavior in the solvents. More importantly, JUC&#8208;635 with AIE effect exhibits a sustained fluorescence upon pressure increase (&#8776;3&#8197;GPa), and reversible sensitivity with high&#8208;contrast emission differences (&#916;&#955;em=187&#8197;nm) up to 12&#8197;GPa, superior to other CPMs reported so far. Therefore, this study will open a new gate to expand the potential applications of COFs as exceptional piezochromic materials in pressure sensing, barcoding, and signal switching.

&lt;p&gt;Piezochromic materials with pressure-dependent photoluminescence tuning properties are important in many fields, such as mechanical sensors, security papers, and storage devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as an emerging class of crystalline porous materials (CPMs) with structural dynamics and tunable photophysical properties, are suitable for designing piezochromic materials, but there are few related studies.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Self&#8208;sorting in Molecular and Polymeric Architectures Enabled by Spiroborate Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiroborate metathesis has been demonstrated using a small molecule model reaction involving spiroborate&#8208;linked well&#8208;defined polymeric and molecular architectures. The spiroborate bond exchange driven by dynamic covalent self&#8208;sorting led to scrambling between a macrocycle and a 1D helical covalent polymer through formation of a molecular cage, with all structures unambiguously elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Self&#8208;sorting is commonly observed in complex reaction systems, which has been utilized to guide the formation of single major by&#8208;design molecules. However, most studies have been focused on non&#8208;covalent systems, and using self&#8208;sorting to achieve covalently bonded architectures is still relatively less explored. Herein, we first demonstrated the dynamic nature of spiroborate linkage and systematically studied the self&#8208;sorting behavior observed in the transformation between spiroborate&#8208;linked well&#8208;defined polymeric and molecular architectures, which is enabled by spiroborate bond exchange. The scrambling between a macrocycle and a 1D helical covalent polymer led to the formation of a molecular cage, whose structures are all unambiguously elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The results indicate that the molecular cage is the thermodynamically favored product in this multi&#8208;component reaction system. This work represents the first example of a 1D polymeric architecture transforming into a shape&#8208;persistent molecular cage, driven by dynamic covalent self&#8208;sorting. This study will further guide the design of spiroborate&#8208;based materials and open the possibilities for the development of novel complex yet responsive dynamic covalent molecular or polymeric systems.

         <title>Atroposelective Silylation of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diols by a Chiral Counteranion Directed Desymmetrization Enhanced by a Subsequent Kinetic Resolution</title>

         <dc:description>
An enantioselective silylation of biaryl diols is achieved with a silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;like silicon electrophile paired with a List&#8208;type imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi). The initial enantioinduction of the desymmetrization is further enhanced by a downstream kinetic resolution that kinetically selects the monosilylated minor enantiomer to form the corresponding bissilylated diol (see Scheme; TBS=tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl).







Abstract
A desymmetrizing silylation of aromatic diols is reported. The previously unknown asymmetric silyl ether formation of phenol derivatives is achieved by applying List's counteranion directed silylation technique. A silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;like silicon electrophile generated from an allylic silane paired with an imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) enables enantioselective discrimination of achiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diols. The enantioselectivity of that desymmetrization is further improved by a downstream kinetic resolution, converting the monosilylated minor enantiomer into the corresponding, again achiral bissilylated diol.

         <title>Diastereoselective Biomimetic Synthesis of Dimeric Tetrahydrocarbazoles via a Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization&#8208;[3+2] Cyclodimerization Cascade</title>

Discovery and development of a CuII&#8208;catalyzed, diastereoselective, biomimetic cycloisomerization&#8208;[3+2] cyclodimerization of 1&#8208;(indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ols to access structurally unprecedented dimeric&#8208;tetrahydrocarbazoles is reported. Control experiments, isolation of monomer intermediates and their conversion into cyclodimerized products delineated the dimerization as being either homochiral or heterochiral [3+2] annulation of in situ generated monomers.







Abstract
The cyclodimerization (homochiral&#8208; and heterochiral&#8722;) of monomeric units for the construction of stereodefined polycyclic systems is a powerful strategy in both biosynthesis and biomimetic synthesis. Herein we have discovered and developed a CuII&#8208; catalyzed, biomimetic, diastereoselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;[3+2] cyclodimerization of 1&#8208;(indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ol. This novel strategy operates under very mild conditions, providing access to structurally unprecedented dimeric tetrahydrocarbazoles fused to a tetrahydrofuran unit in excellent yields of the products. Several fruitful control experiments, isolation of the monomeric&#8208;cycloisomerized products and their subsequent conversion into the corresponding cyclodimeric products supported their intermediacy and the possible mechanism as a cycloisomerization&#8208;diastereoselective [3+2] cyclodimerization cascade. The cyclodimerization involves a substituent controlled, highly diastereoselective homochiral [3+2] annulation or heterochiral [3+2] annulation of in situ generated 3&#8208;hydroxytetrahydrocarbazoles. The key and important features of this strategy are: a) construction of three new C&#8722;C bonds &amp; one new C&#8722;O bond; b) creation of two new stereocenters, and c) construction of three new rings, in a single operation; d) low catalyst loading (1&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;%); e) 100&#8201;% atom economy; and f) rapid construction of structurally unprecedented natural product like polycyclic frameworks. A chiral pool version using an enantio&#8208; and diastereopure substrate was also demonstrated.

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nitride Additive: A Drop&#8208;in Solution for Lithium/Garnet Wetting in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powder&#8208;form Mg3N2 offers a drop&#8208;in solution to improve lithium metal anode/garnet oxide electrolyte wetting and to suppress dynamic de&#8208;wetting in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting can be applied to the design and processing of other solid&#8208;state materials and devices.







Abstract
Garnet oxides such as Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) are promising solid electrolyte materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries because of high ionic conductivity, low electronic leakage, and wide electrochemical stability window. While LLZTO has been frequently discussed to be stable against lithium metal anode, it is challenging to achieve and maintain good solid&#8208;on&#8208;solid wetting at the metal/ceramic interface in both processing and extended electrochemical cycling. Here we address the challenge by a powder&#8208;form magnesium nitride additive, which reacts with the lithium metal anode to produce well&#8208;dispersed lithium nitride. The in situ formed lithium nitride promotes reactive wetting at the Li/LLZTO interface, which lowers interfacial resistance, increases critical current density (CCD), and improves cycling stability of the electrochemical cells. The additive recipe has been diversified to titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, tantalum nitride, and niobium nitride, thus supporting the general concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting. Such a design can be extended to other solid&#8208;state devices for better functioning and extended cycle life.

While LLZTO has been frequently discussed to be stable against lithium metal anode, it is challenging to achieve and maintain good solid-on-solid wetting at the metal/ceramic interface in both processing and extended electrochemical cycling. Here we address the challenge by a powder-form magnesium nitride additive, which reacts with the lithium metal anode to produce well-dispersed lithium nitride. The in situ formed lithium nitride promotes reactive wetting at the Li/LLZTO interface, which lowers interfacial resistance, increases critical current density (CCD), and improves cycling stability of the electrochemical cells. The additive recipe has been diversified to titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, tantalum nitride, and niobium nitride, thus supporting the general concept of reactive dispersion-plus-wetting. Such a design can be extended to other solid-state devices for better functioning and extended cycle life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Linear Adsorption Enables NO Selective Electroreduction to Hydroxylamine on Single Co Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) were reported for the selective electroreduction of NO to NH2OH and NH3 by regulating the adsorption configuration of NO. The linear adsorption of NO on Co SACs could maintain the N&#8722;O bond in the hydrogenation process to generate NH2OH, while the bridge adsorption of NO on Co NPs would weaken the N&#8722;O bond, leading to the breaking of the N&#8722;O bond to produce ammonia.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH), a vital industrial feedstock, is presently synthesized under harsh conditions with serious environmental and energy concerns. Electrocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) reduction is attractive for the production of hydroxylamine under ambient conditions. However, hydroxylamine selectivity is limited by the competitive reaction of ammonia production. Herein, we regulate the adsorption configuration of NO by adjusting the atomic structure of catalysts to control the product selectivity. Co single&#8208;atom catalysts show state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH2OH selectivity from NO electroreduction under neutral conditions (FE
: 81.3&#8201;%), while Co nanoparticles are inclined to generate ammonia (FE
: 92.3&#8201;%). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical simulations unveil that linear adsorption of NO on isolated Co sites enables hydroxylamine formation and bridge adsorption of NO on adjacent Co sites induces the production of ammonia.

         <title>Methane Carboxylation Using Electrochemically Activated Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>

Direct synthesis of CH3COOH from CH4 and CO2 is made possible. The process first activates CO2 by electrochemistry, producing CO and O2. It is followed by oxidative CH4 carbonylation catalyzed by Rh single atom catalysts. The net result is CH4 carboxylation with 100&#8201;% atom economy.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of CH3COOH from CH4 and CO2 is an appealing approach for the utilization of two potent greenhouse gases that are notoriously difficult to activate. In this Communication, we report an integrated route to enable this reaction. Recognizing the thermodynamic stability of CO2, our strategy sought to first activate CO2 to produce CO (through electrochemical CO2 reduction) and O2 (through water oxidation), followed by oxidative CH4 carbonylation catalyzed by Rh single atom catalysts supported on zeolite. The net result was CH4 carboxylation with 100&#8201;% atom economy. CH3COOH was obtained at a high selectivity (&gt;80&#8201;%) and good yield (ca. 3.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1cat in 3&#8197;h). Isotope labelling experiments confirmed that CH3COOH is produced through the coupling of CH4 and CO2. This work represents the first successful integration of CO/O2 production with oxidative carbonylation reaction. The result is expected to inspire more carboxylation reactions utilizing preactivated CO2 that take advantage of both products from the reduction and oxidation processes, thus achieving high atom efficiency in the synthesis.

         <title>Myocardial&#8208;Targeting Tannic Cerium Nanocatalyst Attenuates Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Medications or surgery have been considered as effective protocols to treat IHD for decades. Yet the reperfusion of the blood flow frequently leads to the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing prominent and irreversible damage to the cardiomyocytes. In the present work, tannic acid&#8208;assembled tetravalent cerium (TA&#8208;Ce) nanocatalysts with appealing cardiomyocyte&#8208;targeting and antioxidation capability have been synthesized and applied for the effective and biocompatible ischemia/reperfusion injury therapeutics. TA&#8208;Ce nanocatalysts could effectively rescue the cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress induced by H2O2 challenge as well as oxygen&#8208;glucose deprivation in vitro. In the murine ischemia/reperfusion model, cardiac accumulation and intracellular ROS scavenging could be achieved against the pathology, substantially reducing the myocardial infarct area and recovering heart functionality. This work illuminates the design of nanocatalytic metal complexes and their therapeutic prospects in ischemic heart diseases with high effectiveness and biocompatibility, paving the way for the clinical translation from bench to bedside.</dc:description>

         <title>ATP Drives the Formation of a Catalytic Hydrazone through an Energy Ratchet Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An energy ratchet mechanism is exploited for the synthesis of a molecule. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), hydrazone&#8208;bond formation between an aldehyde and hydrazide is accelerated and the composition at thermodynamic equilibrium is shifted towards the hydrazone. Enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP installs a kinetically stable state at which hydrazone is present at a higher concentration compared to the composition at thermodynamic equilibrium in the presence of the degradation products of ATP. It is shown that the kinetic state has an enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrolysis of an RNA&#8208;model compound.</dc:description>

         <title>A Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free Molecular Motif Based on Centrosymmetric Bird&#8208;like Structured Tetraphenylenes with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP) Afterglow over 8s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with highly efficient and long&#8208;persistent afterglow has drawn substantial awareness. Commonly, spin&#8208;orbit coupling can be improved by introducing heavy atoms into pure&#8208;organic molecules. However, this strategy will simultaneously increase the radiative and non&#8208;radiative transition rate, further resulting in dramatic decreases in the excited state lifetime and afterglow duration. Here in this work, a highly centrosymmetric bird&#8208;like structure tetraphenylene (TeP), and its three symmetrical halogenated derivatives (TeP&#8208;F, TeP&#8208;Cl and TeP&#8208;Br) are synthesized, while their RTP properties and mechanisms are systematically investigated by both theoretical and experimental approaches. As the results, the rigid, highly twisted conformation of TeP restricts the non&#8208;radiative processes of RTP and gives rise to the enhancement of electron&#8208;exchange, which can contribute to the RTP radiation process. Despite the faint RTP of the bromine and chlorine&#8208;substituted ones (TeP&#8208;Br, TeP&#8208;Cl), the fluoro&#8208;substituted TeP&#8208;F exhibited a long phosphorescent lifetime of up to 890 ms, corresponding to an extremely long RTP afterglow over 8 s, which could be incorporated into the best series of non&#8208;heavy&#8208;atom RTP materials reported in previous literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of the Dynamics of the Human Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor Reveals Insights into the Energy Landscape of the Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total amplitude of reorientational motion extracted from MD is plotted on the GHSR molecule for apo (inactive, left) and ghrelin&#8208;bound (active, right) GHSR. Decrease in dynamics at histidine residues H2586.30 and H2806.52 upon ghrelin&#8208;binding shifts the NMR resonances to higher ppm values, whereas H186ECL2 sees smaller changes in the total motion and correspondingly has a smaller change in chemical shift.







Abstract
G protein&#8208;coupled receptors initiate signal transduction in response to ligand binding. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), the focus of this study, binds the 28 residue peptide ghrelin. While structures of GHSR in different states of activation are available, dynamics within each state have not been investigated in depth. We analyze long molecular dynamics simulation trajectories using &#8220;detectors&#8221; to compare dynamics of the apo and ghrelin&#8208;bound states yielding timescale&#8208;specific amplitudes of motion. We identify differences in dynamics between apo and ghrelin&#8208;bound GHSR in the extracellular loop 2 and transmembrane helices 5&#8211;7. NMR of the GHSR histidine residues reveals chemical shift differences in these regions. We evaluate timescale specific correlation of motions between residues of ghrelin and GHSR, where binding yields a high degree of correlation for the first 8 ghrelin residues, but less correlation for the helical end. Finally, we investigate the traverse of GHSR over a rugged energy landscape via principal component analysis.

         <title>Electrode/Electrolyte Synergy for Concerted Promotion of Electron and Proton Transfers toward Efficient Neutral Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy is devised to enhance the neutral water oxidation. The concerted promotion of electron transfer via the IrOx/NiOOH interface and proton transfer via the near&#8208;surface ion environment synergistically accelerated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer events. The expedited kinetics enabled the direct detection of oxygen intermediates at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Neutral water oxidation is a crucial half&#8208;reaction for various electrochemical applications requiring pH&#8208;benign conditions. However, its sluggish kinetics with limited proton and electron transfer rates greatly impacts the overall energy efficiency. In this work, we created an electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy for simultaneously enhancing the proton and electron transfers at the interface toward highly efficient neutral water oxidation. The charge transfer was accelerated between the iridium oxide and in situ formed nickel oxyhydroxide on the electrode end. The proton transfer was expedited by the compact borate environment that originated from hierarchical fluoride/borate anions on the electrolyte end. These concerted promotions facilitated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) events. Due to the electrode/electrolyte synergy, Ir&#8722;O and Ir&#8722;OO&#8722; intermediates could be directly detected by in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the rate&#8208;limiting step of Ir&#8722;O oxidation was determined. This synergy strategy can extend the scope of optimizing electrocatalytic activities toward more electrode/electrolyte combinations.

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked F&#8208;rich Polymer to Inhibit Lead Leakage for Sustainable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic small&#8208;molecule octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208;hexanediol diacrylate (OF&#8208;HDDA) is introduced to in situ crosslink forming a polymer (POF&#8208;HDDA), which anchors uncoordinated lead ions and prevents lead leakage from water and oxygen invasion, and concurrently improves the long&#8208;term stability of the corresponding devices.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells have demonstrated commercial viability, but still face the risk of contamination from lead leakage and long&#8208;term stability problems caused by defects. Here, an organic small molecule (octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208;hexanediol diacrylate) is introduced into the perovskite film to form a polymer through in situ thermal crosslinking, of which the carbonyl group anchors the uncoordinated Pb2+ of perovskite and reduces the leakage of lead, along with the &#8722;CF2&#8722; hydrophobic group protecting the Pb2+ from water invasion. Additionally, the polymer passivates varieties of Pb&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding interactions, regulating the crystallization of perovskite film with reduced trap density, releasing lattice strain, and promoting carrier transport and extraction. The optimal efficiencies of polymer&#8208;incorporated devices are 24.76&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 20.66&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2). More importantly, the storage stability, thermal stability, and operational stability have been significantly improved.

         <title>Highly Twisted Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Molecules and Their Applications in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly twisted thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This Review discusses and summarizes recent research progress in this domain, mainly covering the molecular design strategies and photophysical properties of twisted molecules, as well as the performance parameters of related OLED devices.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted great potential in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among thousands of TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters have become a hotspot in recent years. Compared with traditional TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This is advantageous for TADF materials, as non&#8208;radiative decay processes can be suppressed to facilitate efficient exciton utilization. Accordingly, OLEDs with excellent device performances have also been reported. In this Review, we have summarized recent progress in highly twisted TADF materials and related devices, and give an overview of the molecular design strategies, photophysical studies, and the performances of OLED devices.

&lt;p&gt;Highly twisted thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters tend to show multi-channel charge-transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This Review discusses and summarizes recent research progress in this domain, mainly covering the molecular design strategies and photophysical properties of twisted molecules, as well as the performance parameters of related OLED devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted great potential in the field of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among thousands of TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters have become a hotspot in recent years. Compared with traditional TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters tend to show multi-channel charge-transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This is advantageous for TADF materials, as non-radiative decay processes can be suppressed to facilitate efficient exciton utilization. Accordingly, OLEDs with excellent device performances have also been reported. In this Review, we have summarized recent progress in highly twisted TADF materials and related devices, and give an overview of the molecular design strategies, photophysical studies, and the performances of OLED devices. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of highly twisted TADF molecules and the related OLEDs are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmed Pore&#8208;Shape Fixing in a Soft Porous Molecular Crystal&#8212;Navigating the Phase Interconversion Landscape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;known organic soft porous crystal is shown to undergo pore&#8208;shape fixing in response to high&#8208;pressure uptake of CO2 gas. Despite two decades of studies of this material, this work formulates, for the first time, an unambiguous phase interconversion Scheme to facilitate navigation of the metastable phase landscape, which now includes a 4th guest&#8208;free polymorph with enhanced porosity.







Abstract
Pore&#8208;shape fixing effects (PSFEs) in soft porous crystals are a relatively unexplored area of materials chemistry. We report the PSFE in the prototypical dynamic van der Waals solid p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (TBC4). Starting with the high&#8208;density guest&#8208;free phase, two porous shape&#8208;fixed phases were programmed using the stimuli of CO2 pressure and temperature. A suite of complementary in situ techniques, including variable&#8208;pressure (VP) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP differential scanning calorimetry, volumetric sorption analysis, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy was used to track dynamic guest&#8208;induced transformations, providing molecular&#8208;level insight into the PSFE. The interconversion between the two metastable phases is particle size dependent, making this the second example of the PSFE by crystal downsizing, and the first example involving a porous molecular crystal: larger particles undergo reversible transitions while smaller particles remain fixed in the metastable phase. A complete phase interconversion scheme was constructed for the material, thus allowing navigation of the phase interconversion landscape of TBC4 using the easily applied stimuli of CO2 pressure and thermal treatment.

         <title>A Pro&#8208;Fluorescent Ubiquitin&#8208;Based Probe to Monitor Cysteine&#8208;Based E3 Ligase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is an increased interest in E3 ligases as drug targets. Here we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye Rhodol triggering a strong fluorescence signal. Our platform allows detection of changes in E3 transthiolation activity in real time for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract ligases, as well as the discovery of new ligands for E3 ligases.







Abstract
Protein post&#8208;translational modification with ubiquitin (Ub) is a versatile signal regulating almost all aspects of cell biology, and an increasing range of diseases is associated with impaired Ub modification. In this light, the Ub system offers an attractive, yet underexplored route to the development of novel targeted treatments. A promising strategy for small molecule intervention is posed by the final components of the enzymatic ubiquitination cascade, E3 ligases, as they determine the specificity of the protein ubiquitination pathway. Here, we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe, which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye, amenable to profile the E3 transthiolation activity for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract E3 ligases. UbSRhodol enabled detection of changes in transthiolation efficacy evoked by enzyme key point mutations or conformational changes, and offers an excellent assay reagent amenable to a high&#8208;throughput screening setup allowing the identification of small molecules modulating E3 activity.

         <title>Noncovalent Modulation of Chemoselectivity in the Gas Phase Leads to a Switchover in Reaction Type from Heterolytic to Homolytic to Electrocyclic Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversity in chemical reactivity unfolds even in the gas phase when noncovalent tools such as macrocyclic encapsulation are being used. Two distinct reaction pathways of a&#160;multifunctional bicyclic&#160;azoalkane (bottom) can be chemoselectively activated inside the cavity of a macrocycle (in gold), leading either to ejection of molecular dinitrogen (top) or ethylene (right),&#160;depending on its protonation state. In sharp contrast, the free substrate prefers to eject ammonia upon thermal activation (left), as reported by Werner&#8197;M. Nau, Elina Kalenius, Tung&#8208;Chun Lee et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202303491).

         <title>Variations in Intracellular Organometallic Reaction Frequency Captured by Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify ruthenium&#8208;promoted allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in live A549 human lung cells. Individual turn&#8208;on events were detected as single fluorescence spots and found to occur more frequently in the mitochondria than the rest of the cell. These results suggest that the subcellular distribution is an important consideration in designing intracellular catalysts.







Abstract
Studies of organometallic reactions in living cells commonly rely on ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements, which can obscure the detection of reaction dynamics or location&#8208;specific behavior. This information is necessary to guide the design of bioorthogonal catalysts with improved biocompatibility, activity, and selectivity. By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy, we have successfully captured single&#8208;molecule events promoted by Ru complexes inside live A549 human lung cells. By observing individual allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in real&#8208;time, our results revealed that they occur with greater frequency inside the mitochondria than in the non&#8208;mitochondria regions. The estimated turnover frequency of the Ru complexes was at least 3&#8208;fold higher in the former than the latter. These results suggest that organelle specificity is a critical factor to consider in intracellular catalyst design, such as in developing metallodrugs for therapeutic applications.

         <title>Elongated Bacterial Pili as a Versatile Alignment Medium for NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for the measurement of residual dipolar couplings by NMR spectroscopy is presented. The medium is based on filamentous type 1 pili from E. coli and shown to withstand a wide range of challenging experimental conditions. Being compatible with biological macromolecules and small molecules alike, its high versatility suggests broad applicability in molecular structure determination by NMR.







Abstract
In NMR spectroscopy, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) have emerged as one of the most exquisite probes of biological structure and dynamics. The measurement of RDCs relies on the partial alignment of the molecule of interest, for example by using a liquid crystal as a solvent. Here, we establish bacterial type 1 pili as an alternative liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for the measurement of RDCs. To achieve alignment at pilus concentrations that allow for efficient NMR sample preparation, we elongated wild&#8208;type pili by recombinant overproduction of the main structural pilus subunit. Building on the extraordinary stability of type 1 pili against spontaneous dissociation and unfolding, we show that the medium is compatible with challenging experimental conditions such as high temperature, the presence of detergents, organic solvents or very acidic pH, setting it apart from most established alignment media. Using human ubiquitin, HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and camphor as spectroscopic probes, we demonstrate the applicability of the medium for the determination of RDCs of proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. Our results show that type 1 pili represent a very useful alternative to existing alignment media and may readily assist the characterization of molecular structure and dynamics by NMR.

         <title>Harmonious Heterointerfaces Formed on 2D&#8208;Pt Nanodendrites by Facet&#8208;Respective Stepwise Metal Deposition for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;Metal Nanohybrids with harmonious heterointerfaces have been synthesized by facet&#8208;respective stepwise metal deposition. These hybrid nanomaterial can approach superior electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance induced by unique multi heterointerfaces in specific facet for effective activation of platinum.







Abstract
The performance of nanocrystal (NC) catalysts could be maximized by introducing rationally designed heterointerfaces formed by the facet&#8208; and spatio&#8208;specific modification with other materials of desired size and thickness. However, such heterointerfaces are limited in scope and synthetically challenging. Herein, we applied a wet chemistry method to tunably deposit Pd and Ni on the available surfaces of porous 2D&#8722;Pt nanodendrites (NDs). Using 2D silica nanoreactors to house the 2D&#8208;PtND, an 0.5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (e&#8208;Pd or e&#8208;Ni) was exclusively formed on the flat {110} surface of 2D&#8722;Pt, while a non&#8208;epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (n&#8208;Pd or n&#8208;Ni) was typically deposited at the {111/100} edge in absence of nanoreactor. Notably, these differently located Pd/Pt and Ni/Pt heterointerfaces experienced distinct electronic effect to influence unequally in electrocatalytic synergy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For instance, an enhanced H2 generation on the Pt{110} facet with 2D&#8208;2D interfaced e&#8208;Pd deposition and faster water dissociation on the edge&#8208;located n&#8208;Ni overpowered their facet&#8208;located counterparts in respective HER catalysis. Therefore, a feasible assembling of the valuable heterointerfaces in the optimal 2D n&#8208;Ni/e&#8208;Pd/Pt catalyst overcame the sluggish alkaline HER kinetics, with a catalytic activity 7.9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C.

         <title>Bright Free&#8208;Radical Emission in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole ionic liquids have been used to protect photoinduced radical emissions from carbonyl through electrostatic interactions and spin delocalization effects, with a highest emission efficiency of 53.3&#8201;% achieved. The radical system could be used to build multi&#8208;color and heat&#8208;responsive luminescence materials. They could also be used to detect different amine compounds based on the change in the emission and photoactivation times.







Abstract
It is challenging to achieve stable and efficient radical emissions under ambient conditions. Herein, we present a rational design strategy to protect photoinduced carbonyl free radical emission through electrostatic interaction and spin delocalization effects. The host&#8208;guest system is constructed from tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules and a series of imidazolium ionic liquids as the guest and host, respectively, whereby the carbonyl anion radical emission can be in situ generated under the light irradiation and further stabilized by electrostatic interaction. More importantly, the anion species and the alkyl chain length of imidazolium ionic liquids show a noticeable effect on luminescence efficiency, with the highest radical emission efficiency is as high as 53.3&#8201;% after optimizing the imidazole ionic liquid's structure, which is about four times higher than the polymer&#8208;protected radical system. Theoretical calculations confirm the synergistic effect of strong electrostatic interactions and that the spin delocalization effect significantly stabilizes the radical emission. Moreover, such a radical emission system also could be integrated with a fluorescent dye to induce multi&#8208;color or even white light emission with reversible temperature&#8208;responsive characteristics. The radical emission system can also be used to detect different amine compounds on the basis of the emission changes and photoactivation time.

         <title>Trinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inert alkyl bromides are rarely used in photoinduced 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes due to their strong reduction potential and bond dissociation energy. In their Research Article (e202305121), Jin Xie and co&#8208;workers overcome the inherent redox potential limit of alkyl bromides and achieve 1,2&#8208;aminoalkylation and 1,2&#8208;alkylarylation of different alkenes by using the inner single electron transfer mechanism of an excited trinuclear gold catalyst.

         <title>Surface Adsorbed Hydroxyl: A Double&#8208;Edged Sword in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction over Oxide&#8208;Derived Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) featured with surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm nanoparticles developed for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR), surface adsorbed hydroxyls (OHad) are demonstrated to act as a double&#8208;edged sword for selective C2 production. OHad with adsorption well optimized and steered would contribute to the stable C2 production with high selectivity over OD&#8722;Cu for long&#8208;term ECO2RR.







Abstract
Oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) featured with surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm nanoparticles (NPs) created via surface structure reconstruction was developed for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR). With surface adsorbed hydroxyls (OHad) identified during ECO2RR, it is realized that OHad, sterically confined and adsorbed at OD&#8722;Cu by surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm NPs, should be determinative to the multi&#8208;carbon (C2) product selectivity. In situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that OHad favors the adsorption of low&#8208;frequency *CO with weak C&#8801;O bonds and strengthens the *CO binding at OD&#8722;Cu surface, promoting *CO dimerization and then selective C2 production. However, excessive OHad would inhibit selective C2 production by occupying active sites and facilitating competitive H2 evolution. In a flow cell, stable C2 production with high selectivity of &#8764;60&#8201;% at &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 could be achieved over OD&#8722;Cu, with adsorption of OHad well steered in the fast flowing electrolyte.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Gated and Self&#8208;Protected Bioorthogonal Catalyst for Nanozyme&#8208;Assisted Safe Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described a self&#8208;protected and responsive bioorthogonal catalyst to achieve efficient and precise intracellular drug synthesis for safe cancer combination therapy. This appealing strategy will promote the development of bioorthogonal catalyst&#8208;mediated novel antineoplastic platforms.







Abstract
Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal uncaging catalysis has sparked increasing interest in prodrug activation. However, due to their &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; catalytic activity as well as the complex and catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment, the biosafety and therapeutic efficiency of TMCs are unsatisfactory. Herein, a DNA&#8208;gated and self&#8208;protected bioorthogonal catalyst has been designed by modifying nanozyme&#8208;Pd0 with highly programmable nucleic acid (DNA) molecules to achieve efficient intracellular drug synthesis for cancer therapy. Monolayer DNA molecules could endow the catalyst with targeting and perform as a gatekeeper to achieve selective prodrug activation within cancer cells. Meanwhile, the prepared graphitic nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanozyme with glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activities could improve the catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment to prevent the catalyst from being inactivated and sensitize the subsequent chemotherapy. Overall, we believe that our work will promote the development of secure and efficient bioorthogonal catalytic systems and provide new insights into novel antineoplastic platforms.

However, due to their &#8220;always-on&#8221; catalytic activity as well as the complex and catalytic-detrimental intracellular environment, the biosafety and therapeutic efficiency of TMCs are unsatisfactory. Herein, a DNA-gated and self-protected bioorthogonal catalyst has been designed by modifying nanozyme-Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; with highly programmable nucleic acid (DNA) molecules to achieve efficient intracellular drug synthesis for cancer therapy. Monolayer DNA molecules could endow the catalyst with targeting and perform as a gatekeeper to achieve selective prodrug activation within cancer cells. Meanwhile, the prepared graphitic nitrogen-doped carbon nanozyme with glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)-like activities could improve the catalytic-detrimental intracellular environment to prevent the catalyst from being inactivated and sensitize the subsequent chemotherapy. Overall, we believe that our work will promote the development of secure and efficient bioorthogonal catalytic systems and provide new insights into novel antineoplastic platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent radicals are gathering constant attention as a new class of luminescent material due to the ground and excited state doublet character. In their Research Article (e202302550), Ken Albrecht and co&#8208;workers report a carbazole dendronized luminescent tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)&#8208;methyl (TTM) radical. Dendron modification increases the photostability and photoluminescence quantum yield up to 63&#8201;% in cyclohexane. The image shows the red luminescent raspberry (TTM radical) protected from sunshine by the raspberry tree (dendron).

         <dc:description>
Axially enantioselective binuclear gold(I) catalysts fly as swallowtail butterflies around a mechanical hand providing a chiral environment. The gold microchip on the hand symbolizes the crucial role of gold catalysis in alkyne activation. Using the gold&#8208;catalyzed condensation of amine and diyne&#8208;ene, the first example of enantioselective 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine synthesis through a formal [3+2+1] fashion is reported by Xin Hong, Xiaodong Shi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202305409).

         <title>A Thiazole&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework for Lithium&#8208;Sulphur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are crystalline and porous materials, which offer a platform for integrating functional moieties in their backbone. Also, these materials can be post&#8208;synthetically modified for targeted applications. Herein, using molecular sulphur (S8), a post&#8208;synthetic topochemical conversion of an imine&#8208;linked COF into a thiazole&#8208;linked COF was performed for enhancing energy storage performance in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulphur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are a promising alternative power source, as they can provide a higher energy density than current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Porous materials are often used as cathode materials as they can act as a host for sulphur in such batteries. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have also been used, however they typically suffer from stability issues, resulting in limited and thus insufficient durability under practical conditions and applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based dimethoxybenzo&#8208;dithiophene functionalized COF (TTT&#8208;DMTD) incorporating high&#8208;density redox sites. The imine linkages were further post&#8208;synthetically transformed to yield a robust thiazole&#8208;linked COF (THZ&#8208;DMTD) by utilizing a sulphur&#8208;assisted chemical conversion method, while maintaining the crystallinity. As a synergistic effect of its high crystallinity, porosity and the presence of redox&#8208;active moieties, the thiazole&#8208;linked THZ&#8208;DMTD exhibited a high capacity and long&#8208;term stability (642&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;C; 78.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles) when applied as a cathode material in a Li&#8722;S battery.

         <title>Influence of Molecular Separation on Through&#8208;Space Intervalence Transient Charge Transfer in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Cofacially arranged Redox Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extent of electronic coupling and through&#8208;space intervalence charge transfer in photo&#8208;conducting metal&#8211;organic frameworks is unveiled through dynamic studies, charge transfer integral and charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;mobility measurement. Their influence on molecular separation is also revealed.







Abstract
We demonstrate direct evidence of photoinduced through&#8208;space intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) between two cofacially arranged redox&#8208;active pairs in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their dynamic variation with their molecular separation. Two homologous MOFs [Co2(NDC)2(DPTTZ)2]. DPTTZ. DMF, 1 and [Co2(BDC)2(DPTTZ)2]. DMF, 2 (where NDC=naphthalene dicarboxylate, BDC=benzene dicarboxylate, DPTTZ=N, N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)thiazolo&#8208;[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole, DMF=N, N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl formamide) are considered for this, whose intra&#8208;dimer distance of redox&#8208;active DPTTZ ligands differs ca. 1&#8197;&#197; from one system to another. Spectroelectrochemical study detects the formation of IVCT band at the NIR region between cofacially oriented DPTTZ molecules in both MOFs. Transient spectroscopy shows faster charge separation as well as charge recombination when intra&#8208;dimer distance is lesser (in MOF 2) due to stronger electronic coupling. We quantify the extent of IVCT by charge transfer integral calculation; and also by optical pump terahertz probe spectroscopy, where MOF 2 shows three times higher carrier mobility due to lesser inter&#8208;DPTTZ distance than MOF 1. These findings reveal a more localized aspect of through&#8208;space IVCT between cofacially organized redox&#8208;active pair in a three&#8208;dimensional framework.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Large Pore Apertures and High Surface Areas for NO2 Selective Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) were synthesized via coordination of a new ligand (HAOTP) with metal ions (Ni2+ and Cu2+). The resulting HIOTP&#8208;Ni MOF has a large pore aperture of 3.3&#8197;nm and a high surface area of 1300&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. As a result, it has exceptional performance as a chemiresistive sensor, with a highly selective (405&#8201;%) and rapid response (1.69&#8197;min) towards 10&#8197;ppm NO2 gas.







Abstract
The emergence of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with pronounced electrical properties (e.g., high conductivity) has provided a novel platform for efficient energy storage, sensing, and electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the limited availability of suitable ligands restricts the number of available types of 2D c&#8208;MOFs, especially those with large pore apertures and high surface areas are rare. Herein, we develop two new 2D c&#8208;MOFs (HIOTP&#8208;M, M=Ni, Cu) employing a large p&#8208;&#960; conjugated ligand of hexaamino&#8208;triphenyleno[2,3&#8208;b:6,7&#8208;b&#8242;:10,11&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]tris[1,4]benzodioxin (HAOTP). Among the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, HIOTP&#8208;Ni exhibits the largest pore size of 3.3&#8197;nm and one of the highest surface areas (up to 1300&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). As an exemplary application, HIOTP&#8208;Ni has been used as a chemiresistive sensing material and displays high selective response (405&#8201;%) and a rapid response (1.69&#8197;min) towards 10&#8197;ppm NO2 gas. This work demonstrates significant correlation linking the pore aperture of 2D c&#8208;MOFs to their sensing performance.

         <title>Photochemically Mediated Ring Expansion of Indoles and Pyrroles with Chlorodiazirines: Synthetic Methodology and Thermal Hazard Assessment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that pyridinium and quinolinium salts can be accessed by the insertion of a single C&#8208;atom from an arylchlorodiazirine into the parent N&#8208;alkyl pyrrole or indole. The azinium products of ring expansion are activated towards oxygenation and hydrogenation, expediting further structural diversification. Safer methods for the use of diazirines as carbene precursors have been developed with insight from differential scanning calorimetry.







Abstract
We demonstrate that arylchlorodiazirines serve as photo&#8208;activated halocarbene precursors for the selective one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of N&#8208;substituted pyrroles and indoles to the corresponding pyridinium and quinolinium salts. Preliminary investigations indicate that the same strategy also enables the conversion of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles to pyrimidinium salts. The N&#8208;substituent of the substrate plays an essential role in: (1) increasing substrate scope by preventing product degradation, (2) enhancing yields by suppressing co&#8208;product inhibition, and (3) activating the azinium products towards subsequent synthetic manipulations. This latter point is illustrated by subjecting the quinolinium salts to four complementary partial reductions, which provide concise access to ring&#8208;expanded products with different degrees of increased C(sp3) character. Thermal analysis of the diazirines by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) provides detailed insight into their energetic properties, and highlights the safety benefits of photolyzing&#8212;rather than thermolyzing&#8212;these reagents.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Stimuli Responsive Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli responsive microgels can be synthesized by a mechanochemical solvent&#8208; and initiator&#8208;free synthesis route via a free&#8208;radical polymerization. The synthesized microgels exhibit excellent colloidal stability in aqueous media, and the size of the microgels can be modulated by controlling the crosslinker concentration in a ball mill.







Abstract
Mechanochemical approaches are widely used for the efficient, solvent&#8208;free synthesis of organic molecules, however their applicability to the synthesis of functional polymers has remained underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that mechanochemically triggered free&#8208;radical polymerization allows solvent&#8208; and initiator&#8208;free syntheses of structurally and morphologically well&#8208;defined complex functional macromolecular architectures, namely stimuliresponsive microgels. The developed mechanochemical polymerization approach is applicable to a variety of monomers and allows synthesizing microgels with tunable chemical structure, variable size, controlled number of crosslinks and reactive functional end&#8208;groups.

         <title>An Extracellular miRNA&#8208;Responsive Artificial Receptor via Dynamic DNA Nano&#8208;assembly for Biomarker&#8208;Driven Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An miRNA&#8208;responsive chimeric DNA receptor (miRNA&#8208;CDR) as a biomarker&#8208;driven therapeutic nanodevice for liver injury repair has been developed. The miRNA&#8208;CDR is highly modular, programmable, and versatile, allowing us to customize sense&#8208;and&#8208;respond programs to diverse user&#8208;defined miRNA inputs with a tunable dynamic range, eliciting orthogonal activation of different receptor tyrosine kinases as signaling outputs, which is ultimately used for miRNA biomarker&#8208;driven acute liver injury repair.







Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various diseases. However, there is currently a lack of molecular strategies that can effectively use disease&#8208;associated extracellular miRNAs as input signals to drive therapeutic functions. Herein, we present a modular and programmable miRNA&#8208;responsive chimeric DNA receptor (miRNA&#8208;CDR) capable of biomarker&#8208;driven therapy. By grafting a miRNA&#8208;responsive DNA nanodevice on a natural membrane receptor via aptamer anchoring, miRNA&#8208;CDR can sense extracellular miRNA levels and autonomously induce dimerization&#8208;mediated receptor activation via the complementary&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction&#8208;induced dynamic DNA assembly. The sequence programmability of miRNA&#8208;CDR allows it to sense and respond to a user&#8208;defined miRNA with tunable sensitivity. Moreover, the miRNA&#8208;CDR is versatile and customizable to reprogram desirable signaling output via adapting a designated receptor, such as MET and FGFR1. Using a mouse model of drug&#8208;induced acute liver injury (DILI), we demonstrate the functionality of a designer miRNA&#8208;CDR in rewiring the recognition of the DILI&#8208;elevated miR&#8208;122 to promote MET signaling of hepatocytes for biomarker&#8208;driven in situ repair and liver function restoration. Our synthetic miRNA&#8208;CDR platform provides a novel molecular device enabling biomarker&#8208;driven therapeutic cellular response, potentially paving the way for improving the precision of cell therapy in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Towards Spintronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances of spintronics based on two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) were summarized in terms of spintronics materials, application of 2D MOFs in spin transport, as well as spin manipulation using 2D MOFs with bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS) characteristics.







Abstract
The intrinsic properties of predesignable topologies and tunable electronic structures, coupled with the increase of electrical conductivity, make two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) highly prospective candidates for next&#8208;generation electronic/spintronic devices. In this Minireview, we present an outline of the design principles of 2D MOF&#8208;based spintronics materials. Then, we highlight the spin&#8208;transport properties of 2D MOF&#8208;based organic spin valves (OSVs) as a notable achievement in the progress of 2D MOFs for spintronics devices. After that, we discuss the potential for spin manipulation in 2D MOFs with bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS) properties as a promising field for future research. Finally, we provide a brief summary and outlook to encourage the development of novel 2D MOFs for spintronics applications.

         <title>Platinum Metallacycle&#8208;Based Molecular Recognition: Establishment and Application in Spontaneous Formation of a [2]Rotaxane with Light&#8208;Harvesting Property</title>

We report a platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest system and its application in efficient construction of a [2]rotaxane with sequential light&#8208;harvesting property.







Abstract
Macrocyclic molecule&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems, which provide contributions for the design and construction of functional supramolecular structures, have gained increasing attention in recent years. In particular, platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems provide opportunities for chemical scientists to prepare novel materials with various functions and structures due to the well&#8208;defined shapes and cavity sizes of platinum(II) metallacycles. However, the research on platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems has been given little attention. In this article, we demonstrate the host&#8211;guest complexation between a platinum(II) metallacycle and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecule, naphthalene. Taking advantage of metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest interactions and the dynamic property of reversible Pt coordination bonds, a [2]rotaxane is efficiently prepared by employing a template&#8208;directed clipping procedure. The [2]rotaxane is further applied to the fabrication of an efficient light&#8208;harvesting system with multi&#8208;step energy transfer process. This work comprises an important supplement to macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems and demonstrates a strategy for efficient production of well&#8208;defined mechanically interlocked molecules with practical values.

         <title>Tailoring Ion Ordering in Perovskite Oxide for High&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the ion ordering of perovskite and high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity was investigated in PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948;. It was found that high&#8208;temperature OER activity was enhanced by the A&#8208;site cation ordering but suppressed by the oxygen vacancy ordering.







Abstract
Perovskites exhibit excellent high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities as the anodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the relationship between ion ordering and OER performances is rarely investigated. Herein, a series of PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948; perovskites with tailored ion orderings are constructed. Physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the oxygen bulk migration and surface transport capacities as well as the OER activities are promoted by the A&#8208;site cation ordering, but weakened by the oxygen vacancy ordering. Hence, SOEC with the A&#8208;site&#8208;ordered and oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;disordered PrBaCo2O5+&#948; anode exhibits the highest performance of 3.40&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 800&#8201;&#176;C and 2.0&#8197;V. This work sheds light on the critical role of ion orderings in the high&#8208;temperature OER performance and paves a new way for screening novel anode materials of SOECs.

         <title>Framework&#8208;Hotspot Enhanced Trans Cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a for Clinical Samples Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We generate framework&#8208;hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities and investigate their impact on trans cleavage activity of Cas12a. Further, a modular platform with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based target recognition and FHR&#8208;based signal transduction is developed, which enables sensitive (100&#8197;fM) and rapid (&lt;15&#8197;min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre&#8208;amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples.







Abstract
The trans&#8208;cleavage property of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a system makes it an excellent tool for disease diagnosis. Nevertheless, most methods based on CRISPR&#8208;Cas system still require pre&#8208;amplification of the target to achieve the desired detection sensitivity. Here we generate Framework&#8208;Hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities to investigate their effect on trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a. We find that the cleavage efficiency increases and the cleavage rate accelerates with increasing reporter density. We further construct a modular sensing platform with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based target recognition and FHR&#8208;based signal transduction. Encouragingly, this modular platform enables sensitive (100&#8197;fM) and rapid (&lt;15&#8197;min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre&#8208;amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples. The design provides a facile strategy for enhanced trans cleavage of Cas12a, which accelerates and broadens its applications in biosensing.

         <title>Multiple Heteroatom&#8208;Hydrogen Bonds Bridging Electron Transport in Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Supramolecular System for Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds bridging electron transport pathway is revealed in a noncovalent&#8208;linked supramolecular photosystem, starting from readily available COF and metal&#8208;bipyridine complex. The hydrogen bonding supramolecular system exhibits enhanced electron transfer and performance for CO2 photoreduction. This work provides an avenue to rationally design easily accessible photosystems.







Abstract
Supramolecular systems consisting of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and Ni complex are designed for robust photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Multiple heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonding between the COF and Ni complex is identified to play a decisive role in the photoexcited electron transfer across the liquid&#8208;solid interface. The diminution of steric groups on COF or metal complex can optimize catalytic performance, which is more attributable to the enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction rather than their intrinsic activity. The photosystem with relatively strong strength of hydrogen bonds exhibits remarkable photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, far superior to photosystems with supported atomic Ni or metal complex alone in the absence of hydrogen&#8208;bond effect. Such heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds bridging electron transport pathway confers supramolecular system with high photocatalytic performance, providing an avenue to rationally design efficient and steadily available photosystems.

         <title>Engineered Histidine&#8208;Rich Peptides Enhance Endosomal Escape for Antibody&#8208;Targeted Intracellular Delivery of Functional Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy has been developed to design and construct endosomal escape peptides. By substituting the Arg/Lys residues in cationic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with histidine, peptides with pH&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;perturbation activity have been obtained. These peptides can mediate the endosomal escape of peptide/protein cargoes upon antibody&#8208;targeted delivery, allowing potential applications such as protein delivery and gene editing.







Abstract
Currently, the clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics is mainly limited to the modulation of diseases in extracellular spaces. Intracellular targets are hardly accessed, owing largely to the endosomal entrapment of internalized proteins/peptides. Here, we report a strategy to design and construct peptides that enable endosome&#8208;to&#8208;cytosol delivery based on an extension of the &#8220;histidine switch&#8221; principle. By substituting the Arg/Lys residues in cationic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with histidine, we obtained peptides with pH&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;perturbation activity. These peptides do not randomly penetrate cells like CPPs, but imitate the endosomal escape of CPPs following cellular uptake. Working with one such 16&#8208;residue peptide (hsLMWP) with high endosomal escape capacity, we engineered modular fusion proteins and achieved antibody&#8208;targeted delivery of diverse protein cargoes&#8212;including the pro&#8208;apoptotic protein BID (BH3&#8208;interacting domain death agonist) and Cre recombinase&#8212;into the cytosol of multiple cancer cell types. After extensive in vitro testing, an in vivo analysis with xenograft mice ultimately demonstrated that a trastuzumab&#8208;hsLMWP&#8208;BID fusion conferred strong anti&#8208;tumor efficacy without apparent side effects. Notably, our fusion protein features a modular design, allowing flexible applications for any antibody/cargo combination of choice. Therefore, the potential applications extend throughout life science and biomedicine, including gene editing, cancer treatment, and immunotherapy.

After extensive in vitro testing, an in vivo analysis with xenograft mice ultimately demonstrated that a trastuzumab-hsLMWP-BID fusion conferred strong anti-tumor efficacy without apparent side effects. Notably, our fusion protein features a modular design, allowing flexible applications for any antibody/cargo combination of choice. Therefore, the potential applications extend throughout life science and biomedicine, including gene editing, cancer treatment, and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrocarbon Oxidation by a Porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Cation Radical Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex without ancillary proton accepting ligand/groups was found to perform oxidative C&#8722;H bond activation, yielding hydroxylated substrates in the presence of air. According to kinetic studies, the nickel porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical accepted an electron to oxidise substrates through a concerted PCET mechanism.







Abstract
Heme and chlorin &#960;&#8208;cation radical oxidants are widely implicated in biological and synthetic oxidation catalysis. Little insight into the role of &#960;&#8208;cation radicals in proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidation is available. We prepared a NiII&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation complex ([NiII(P&#8901;+)]) and found it to be capable of the oxidation of a variety of simple hydrocarbon substrates. Interestingly, some of the products were hydroxylated, with ([NiII(P&#8901;+)]) working in concert with atmospheric O2 to yield hydroxylated hydrocarbons. Kinetic data suggested that the porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical species oxidised substrates through a concerted PCET mechanism, where the porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical accepted the electron, and the proton was transferred to a free anion. Our findings highlight the potential role of &#960;&#8208;cation radicals as hydrocarbon activators, demonstrating that porphyrin ligand non&#8208;innocence could be a readily manipulated resource for oxidation catalyst development.

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;cell analysis is an effective method to reveal cell heterogeneity. In their Research Article (e202302000), Yujun Song et&#8197;al. report an enzyme&#8208;loaded metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;integrated microfluidic chip for highly efficient single&#8208;cell capture followed by real&#8208;time single&#8208;cell metabolite monitoring and analysis. By profiling intracellular glucose and extracellular lactate, the platform could evaluate the single&#8208;cell tumorigenicity of tumor cells in unprocessed whole blood samples.

         <title>High Performance Dynamic X&#8208;ray Flexible Imaging Realized Using a Copper Iodide Cluster&#8208;Based MOF Microcrystal Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray imaging technology has achieved important applications in many fields and has attracted extensive attentions. Dynamic X&#8208;ray flexible imaging for the real&#8208;time observation of the internal structure of complex materials is the most challenging type of X&#8208;ray imaging technology, which requires high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators with high X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) efficiency as well as excellent processibility and stability. Here, a macrocyclic bridging ligand with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature was introduced for constructing a copper iodide cluster&#8208;based MOF scintillator. This strategy endows the scintillator with high XEL efficiency and excellent chemical stability. Moreover, a regular rod&#8208;like microcrystal was prepared through the addition of polyvinyl pyrrolidone during the in&#8208;situ synthesis process, which further enhanced the XEL and processibility of the scintillator. The microcrystal was used for the preparation of a scintillator screen with excellent flexibility and stability, which can be used for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray imaging in extremely humid environments. Furthermore, dynamic X&#8208;ray flexible imaging was realized for the first time.

         <title>Improved Thermal and Chemical Stability of Oxynitride Phosphor from Facile Chemical Synthesis for Cornering Lights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orange Eu2+&#8208;doped phosphors are essential for light&#8208;emitting diodes for cornering lights to prevent fatal road accidents at night, but such phosphors require features of high thermal, chemical stability and facile synthesis. This study reports a series of yellow&#8208;orange&#8208;red emitting SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ oxynitride phosphors, derived from the SrAlSi4N7 nitride iso&#8208;structure by replacing Si4+&#8208;N3&#8208; with Al3+&#8208;O2&#8208;. The introduction of a certain amount of oxygen enabled the facile synthesis under atmospheric pressure using the air&#8208;stable raw materials SrCO3, Eu2O3, AlN and Si3N4. SrAl2Si3ON6 has a smaller band gap and lower structure rigidity than SrAlSi4N7 (5.19 eV vs 5.50 eV, Debye temperature 719 K vs 760 K), but exhibits higher thermal stability with 100% of room temperature intensity remaining at 150 &#176;C compared to 85% for SrAlSi4N7. Electron paramagnetic resonance, thermoluminescence and density functional theory revealed that the oxygen vacancy electron traps compensated the thermal loss. Additionally, no decrease in emission intensity was found after either being heated at 500 &#176;C for 2 hours or being immersed in water for 20 days, implying both of the thermal and chemical stability of SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ phosphors. The strategy of oxynitride&#8208;introduction from nitride promotes the development of low&#8208;cost thermally and chemically stable luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effect to Fine&#8208;Tune Energy Levels of Atom&#8208;Precise [MoOS3]2&#8208; Modified Cu(I) Thiolate Clusters Boosting Recyclable Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The propulsion of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is limited by the rational design and regulation of catalysts with precise structures and excellent activities. In this work, the [MoOS3]2&#8208; unit is introduced into the Cu(I) clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise Mo(VI)&#8208;Cu(I) bimetallic clusters of [Cu6(MoOS3)2(C6H5(CH2)S)2(P(C6H4&#8208;R)3)4]&#183;xCH3CN (R = H, CH3, or F), which show high photocatalytic H2 evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects of the surface ligand, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these Mo(VI)&#8208;Cu(I) clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the resultant visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance. Furthermore, Mo(VI)&#8208;Cu(I) clusters loaded onto the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 carriers significantly reduced the loss of catalysts in the collection process, efficiently addressing the recycling issues of such small cluster&#8208;based catalyst. This work not only highlights a competitively universal approach on the design of high&#8208;efficiency cluster photocatalysts for energy conversion, but also makes it feasible to manipulate the catalytic performance of clusters through a rational substituent strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Driven Assembly of a Penta&#8208;Shell Keplerate Cuprofullerene for Metallofullerene Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two metallofullerene frameworks (MFFs) constructed from a penta&#8208;shell Keplerate cuprofullerene chloride, C60@Cu24@Cl44@Cu12@Cl12, have been successfully prepared via a C60&#8208;templated symmetry&#8208;driven strategy. The icosahedral cuprofullerene chloride is assembled on a C60 molecule through [&#951;2&#8208;(C=C)]&#8208;Cu(I) and Cu(I)&#8208;Cl coordination bonds, resulting in the penta&#8208;shell Keplerate with the C60 core canopied by 24 Cu, 44 Cl, 12 Cu and 12 Cl atoms that fulfill the tic@rco@oae@ico@ico penta&#8208;shell polyhedral configuration. By sharing the outmost&#8208;shell Cl atoms, the cuprofullerene chlorides are connected into 2D or 3D (snf net) frameworks. TD&#8208;DFT calculations reveal that the charge transfer from the outmost Cu(I) and Cl to C60 core is responsible for their light absorption expansion to near&#8208;infrared region, implying anionic halogenation may be an effective strategy to tune the light absorption properties of metallofullerene materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two metallofullerene frameworks (MFFs) constructed from a penta-shell Keplerate cuprofullerene chloride, C60@Cu24@Cl44@Cu12@Cl12, have been successfully prepared via a C60-templated symmetry-driven strategy.

         <title>Hierarchical LTL Zeolite as an Efficient and Sustainable Solid Acid Catalyst for Replacing HCl in the Production of Polyurethane Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In many industrially important reactions, caustic mineral acid catalysts have been successfully replaced with green solid acids such as zeolites. In this context, extensive efforts have been devoted to replacing HCl to produce methylenedianiline (MDA), a key intermediate in polyurethane production. Unfortunately, limited success has been achieved thus far due to low activity, selectivity towards the desired 4,4'&#8208;MDA, and rapid catalyst deactivation. Here we report that meso&#8208;/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits unprecedentedly high activity, selectivity, and stability. The one&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;like micropores of LTL promote the bimolecular reaction between two para&#8208;aminobenzylaniline intermediates to selectively produce 4,4'&#8208;MDA and inhibit the formation of undesired isomers and heavy oligomers. Meanwhile, the secondary mesopores alleviate mass transfer limitations, resulting in a 7.8&#8208;fold higher MDA formation rate compared to solely microporous LTL zeolite. Due to suppressed oligomer formation and fast mass transfer, the catalyst exhibits inappreciable deactivation in an industrially relevant continuous flow reactor.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium Salalen Catalyzed Enantioselective Benzylic Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The titanium complex of the cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH) derived Berkessel&#8208;salalen ligand is a highly efficient and enantioselective catalyst for the asymmetric epoxidation of terminal olefins with hydrogen peroxide ("Berkessel&#8208;Katsuki catalyst"). We herein report that this epoxidation catalyst also effects the highly enantioselective hydroxylation of benzylic C&#8208;H bonds with hydrogen peroxide. Mechanism&#8208;based ligand optimization identified a novel nitro&#8208;salalen Ti&#8208;catalyst of the highest efficiency ever reported for asymmetric catalytic benzylic hydroxylation, with enantioselectivities of up to 98% ee, while overoxidation to ketone is marginal. The novel nitro&#8208;salalen Ti&#8208;catalyst also shows enhanced epoxidation ef&#173;ficiency, as evidenced by e.g. the conversion of 1&#8208;decene to its ep&#173;oxide in 90% yield with 94% ee, at a catalyst loading of 0.1 mol&#8208;% only.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ferrocene 1,3&#8722;Derivatives by Distal C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The third position of cyclopentadienyl ring of a monosubstituted ferrocene has remained as an inaccessible chemical space for direct functionalization. Until recently, functionalizing the C(3)&#8208;position while bypassing the predominantly active C(2)&#8208;position is the most challenging task. Herein, we report a distal C&#8722;H functionalization of monosubstituted ferrocenes using an easily removable directing group with precise site&#8208;selectivity, under a Pd(II)/ mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino&#8208;acid ligand catalytic system. The robust synthetic protocol leads to the synthesis of ferrocene 1,3&#8208;derivatives with broad scope in olefins while functionalizing ferrocenyl methylamine in moderate to good yields via a highly strained ferrocene appended 12&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivated DNA Assembly and Disassembly for On&#8208;Demand Activation and Termination of cGAS&#8208;STING Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite significant progress in DNA self&#8208;assembly for interfacing with biology, spatiotemporally controlled regulation of biological process via in situ dynamic DNA assembly remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we report an optically triggered DNA assembly and disassembly strategy that enables on&#8208;demand activation and termination of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. In the design, an activatable DNA hairpin is engineered with a photocleavable group at defined site to modulate its self&#8208;assembly activity. Light activation induces the configurational switching and consequent self&#8208;assembly of the DNA hairpins to form long linear double&#8208;stranded structures, allowing to stimulate cGAS protein to synthesize 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) for STING stimulation. Furthermore, by endowing the pre&#8208;assembled DNA scaffold with a built&#8208;in photolysis feature, we demonstrate that the cGAS&#8208;STING stimulation can be efficiently terminated through remote photo&#8208;triggering, providing for the first time a route to control the temporal &#8216;&#8216;dose&#8217;&#8217; on&#8208;demand for such a stimulation. We envision that this regulation&#160;strategy will benefit and inspire both fundamental research and therapeutic applications regarding the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Monodisperse Adducts&#8208;Induced Homogeneous Nucleation Towards High&#8208;Quality Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The classic solvent system can't sufficiently separate one&#8208;dimensional edge&#8208;sharing SnI2 crystals in solution, which severely restricts the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tin&#8208;based perovskite film. Herein, a strong Lewis base (hexamethylphosphoramide, HMPA) has been introduced to coordinate Sn2+ to modulate solvation behaviors on perovskite precursor and regulate crystallization kinetics. The large molecular volume of HMPA and stronger bind energy of SnI2&#183;2HMPA (&#8722;0.595 eV vs &#8722;0.118 eV for SnI2&#183;2DMSO) change the solvation structure of SnI2 from edge&#8208;sharing cluster to monodisperse adduct, which contributes to uniform nucleation sites and prolongs crystal growth process. Delightfully, a fully&#8208;covered perovskite film is formed on the large&#8208;area substrate and tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells processed with HMPA exhibit an excellent efficiency of 13.46%. This research provides novel insights and directions for the solution preparation of smooth and uniform large&#8208;area tin&#8208;based perovskite film.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Activation Coupling with Schottky Junction Boosts Electrochemiluminescence of Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Robust electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of carbon nitride (CN) requires efficient electron&#8208;hole recombination and suppression of electrode passivation. In this work, Au nanoparticles and single atoms (AuSA+NP) loaded on CN serve as dual active sites that significantly accelerate charge transfer and activate peroxydisulfate. Meanwhile, the well&#8208;established Schottky junctions between Au NPs and CN act as electron sinks, effectively trapping over&#8208;injected electrons to prevent electrode passivation. As a result, the porous CN modified with AuSA+NP exhibits enhanced and stable ECL emission, with a minimal relative standard deviation of 0.24%. Furthermore, the designed ECL biosensor based on AuSA+NP&#8208;CN shows remarkable performance in detecting organophosphorus pesticides. This innovative strategy has the potential to offer new insights into strong and stable ECL emission for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Difluorocarbene Transfer via Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles has been developed, representing a new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction. The approach uses low&#8208;cost and bulk industrial chemical chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H) as the difluorocarbene precursor. It produces a variety of difluoromethylated (hetero)arenes from widely available aryl halides/triflates and proton sources, featuring high functional group tolerance and synthetic convenience without preparing organometallic reagents. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that an unexpected Pd(0/II) catalytic cycle is involved in this reductive reaction, wherein the oxidative addition of palladium(0) difluorocarbene ([Pd0(Ln)]=CF2) with aryl electrophile to generate the key intermediate aryldifluoromethylpalladium [ArCF2Pd(Ln)X], followed by reaction with hydroquinone, is responsible for the reductive difluorocarbene transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Mediated Coexistence of B&#8592;N Coordination and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry afforded a photoactive cocrystal via coexisting (B)O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and B&#8592;N coordination. Specifically, solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical ball mill grinding and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding of a boronic acid and an alkene resulted in mixtures of hydrogen&#8208;bonded and coordinated complexes akin to mixtures of noncovalent complexes that can be obtained in solution in equilibria processes. The alkenes of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assembly undergo an intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization in quantitative conversion, effectively reporting the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly processes. Our results suggest that interplay involving noncovalent bonds subjected to mechanochemical conditions can lead to functional solids where, in the current case, the weaker hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure predominates.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Bridge on Buried Interface for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly important for charge transfer and device stability, while the buried interface with the impact on perovskite film growth has been paid less attention. Herein, we use a molecular modifier,   glycocyamine (GDA) to build a molecular bridge on the buried interface of SnO2/perovskite, resulting in superior interfacial contact. This is achieved through the strongly interaction between GDA and SnO2, which also appreciably modulates the energy level. Moreover, GDA can regulate the perovskite crystal growth, yielding perovskite film with enlarged grain size and absence of pinholes, exhibiting substantially reduced defect density. Consequently, PSCs with GDA modification demonstrate significant improvement of open circuit voltage (close to 1.2 V) and fill factor, leading to an improved power conversion efficiency from 22.60% to 24.70%. Additionally, stabilities of GDA devices under maximum power point and 85 &#176;C heat are both perform better than the control devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Approach Towards Broadband Spintronics on Nanoscale Pyrene Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The injection of pure spin current into the non&#8208;magnetic layer plays a crucial role in transmitting, processing, and storing data information in the realm of spintronics. To understand broadband molecular spintronics, pyrene oligomer film (~20 nm thickness) was prepared using an electrochemical method forming indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode/pyrene covalent interfaces. Permalloy (Ni80Fe20) films with different nanoscale thicknesses were used as top contact over ITO/pyrene layers to estimate the spin pumping efficiency across the interfaces using broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectra. The spintronic devices are composed of permalloy/pyrene/ITO orthogonal configuration, showing remarkable spin pumping from permalloy to pyrene film. The large spin pumping is evident from the linewidth broadening of 5.4 mT at 9 GHz, which is direct proof of spin angular momentum transfer across the interface. A striking observation is made with the high spin&#8208;mixing conductance of ~1.02 1018 m&#8208;2, a value comparable to the conventional heavy metals. Large spin angular moment transfer was observed at the permalloy&#8208;pyrene interfaces, especially at the lower thickness of permalloy, indicating a strong spinterface effect. Pure spin current injection from ferromagnetic into electrochemically grown pyrene films ensures efficient broadband spin transport, which opens a new area in molecular broadband spintronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Modulation of&#160;d&#8208;Band Holes Quantity in the Early Reaction Stages for Boosting Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of highly active and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts applied in acidic water electrolysis remains a grand challenge. Here, we construct a type of high&#8208;loading iridium single atom catalysts with tunable d&#8208;band holes character (h&#8208;HL&#8208;Ir SACs, ~17.2 wt% Ir) realized in the early OER operation stages. The in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that the quantity of the d&#8208;band holes of Ir active sites can be fast increased by 0.56 unit from the open circuit to a low working potential of 1.35 V. More remarkably, in&#8208;situ synchrotron infrared and Raman spectroscopies demonstrate the quick accumulation of *OOH and *OH intermediates over holes&#8208;modulated Ir sites in the early reaction voltages, achieving a rapid OER kinetics. As a result, this well&#8208;designed h&#8208;HL&#8208;Ir SACs exhibits superior performance for acidic OER with overpotentials of 216 mV @10 mA cm&#8208;2 and 259 mV @100 mA cm&#8208;2, corresponding to a small Tafel slope of 43 mV dec&#8208;1. The activity of catalyst shows no evident attenuation after 60 h operation in acidic environment. This work provides some useful hints for the design of superior acidic OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Water&#8208;Soluble Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen with Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Interactions for Targeted NIR Imaging of Cancer Cells and Type I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low oxygen dependence of type I photosensitizers (PSs) has made them a popular choice for treating solid tumors. However, the drawbacks of poor water solubility, short emission wavelength, poor stability, and inability to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells limit the application of most type I PSs in clinical therapy. Thereby, developing novel type I PSs for overcoming these problems is an urgent but challenging task. Herein, by utilizing the distinctive structural characteristics of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, a highly water&#8208;soluble type I PS (DPBC&#8208;Br) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristic and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is fabricated for the first time. DPBC&#8208;Br displays remarkable water solubility (7.3 mM) and outstanding photobleaching resistance, enabling efficient and precise differentiation between tumor cells and normal cells in a wash&#8208;free and long&#8208;term tracking manner via NIR&#8208;I imaging. Additionally, the superior type I reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by DPBC&#8208;Br provide both specific killing of cancer cells in vitro and inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, with negligible systemic toxicity. This study rationally constructs a highly water&#8208;soluble type I PS, which has higher reliability and controllability compared with conventional nanoparticle formulating procedures, offering great potential for clinical cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Zinc Diazoalkyl Complex: [3+2] Cycloaddition Reaction with Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of the first example of a well&#8208;defined zinc &#945;&#8208;diazoalkyl complex. Treatment of zinc(I)&#8208;zinc(I) bonded compound L2Zn2 [L = CH3C(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)CHC(CH3)(NCH2CH2PPh2)] or zinc(II) hydride LZnH with trimethylsilyldiazomethane affords zinc diazoalkyl complex LZnC(N2)SiMe3. This complex liberates N2 in the presence of a nickel catalyst to form an &#945;&#8208;zincated phosphorus ylide by reacting with the pendant phosphine. It selectively undergoes formal [3+2] cycloaddition with CO2 or CO to form the corresponding product with a five&#8208;membered heterocyclic core. Notably, the use of CO in such a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is unprecedented, reflecting a novel CO reaction mode.</dc:description>

This complex liberates N2 in the presence of a nickel catalyst to form an &#945;-zincated phosphorus ylide by reacting with the pendant phosphine. It selectively undergoes formal [3+2] cycloaddition with CO2 or CO to form the corresponding product with a five-membered heterocyclic core. Notably, the use of CO in such a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is unprecedented, reflecting a novel CO reaction mode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing Capacity Degradation of Ge Anodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Triggered by Interfacial LiH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ge anode failure mechanism in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is analyzed. There is a clear correlation between Ge electrode failure and the interfacial evolution of LiH. It is revealed that Li4Ge2H, as a new species derived from LiH, is the culprit of Ge anode degradation.







Abstract
The Germanium (Ge), as a fast&#8208;charging and high specific capacity (1568&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) alloy anode, is greatly hampered in practical application by poor cyclability. To date, the understanding of cycling performance degradation remains elusive. This study illustrates that, contrary to conventional beliefs, most of the Ge material in failed anodes still retains good integrity and does not undergo severe pulverization. It is revealed that capacity degradation is clearly correlated to the interfacial evolution of lithium hydride (LiH). Tetralithium germanium hydride (Li4Ge2H), as a new species derived from LiH, is identified as the culprit of Ge anode degradation, which is the dominant crystalized component in an ever&#8208;growing and ever&#8208;insulating interphase. The significantly increased thickness of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is accompanied by the accumulation of insulating Li4Ge2H upon cycling, which severely retards the charge transport process and ultimately triggers the anode failure. We believe that the comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism presented in this study is of great significance to promoting the design and development of alloy anode for the next generation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Remote Borylation of Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric remote borylation of alkyl bromides is reported. The application of this migratory borylation was extended to other alkyl electrophiles (alkyl&#8208;X with X=I, Cl, OTs) and aryl halides. Additionally, a gram&#8208;scale reaction could be conducted while further transformation of the borylated products was demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated a radical reaction pathway may be involved.







Abstract
Enantioselective functionalization of racemic alkyl halides is an efficient strategy to assemble complex chiral molecules, but remains one of the biggest challenges in organic chemistry. The distant and selective activation of unreactive C&#8722;H bonds in alkyl halides has received growing interest as it enables rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple building blocks. Here, we reported a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed remote borylation of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl&#8722;X, X=I, Br, Cl, OTs) with pinacolborane (HBpin) and presented a robust approach for the generation of valuable chiral secondary organoboronates from racemic alkyl halides. This migration borylation reaction is compatible with primary, secondary, and tertiary bromides, offering direct access to a broad range of alkylboronates. The extension of this catalytic system to the borylation of aryl halides was also demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that this remote borylation involved a radical reaction pathway.

         <title>Metallaphotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Using Alcohols as Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective coupling of &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and aryl bromides, using Ni/photoredox catalysis and alcohols as reducing agents, is reported. This protocol offers modular access to enantioenriched benzylic amines from abundant precursors, and is suitable for late&#8208;stage diversification with broad functional group tolerance. The alcohol&#8208;based approach holds potential as a general platform for enantioselective cross&#8208;electrophile couplings.







Abstract
The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) represents a powerful strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation. However, controlling the enantioselectivity in these processes remains a challenge. Here, we report an unprecedented enantioselective XEC of &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with aryl bromides, enabled by alcohols as reducing agents via Ni/photoredox catalysis. This mechanistically distinct approach exploits the ability of photocatalytically generated &#945;&#8208;hydroxyalkyl radicals to convert alkyl electrophiles to the corresponding alkyl radicals that are then enantioselectively coupled with aryl bromides. The readily scalable protocol allows modular access to valuable enantioenriched benzylic amines from abundant and inexpensive precursors, and is applicable to late&#8208;stage diversification with broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies rationalize the versatility of this alcohol&#8208;based reactivity for radical generation and subsequent asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. We expect that this alcohol&#8208;based cross&#8208;coupling will render a general platform for the development of appealing yet challenging enantioselective XECs.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenative Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination Using a Chiral Pyridine&#8208;Derived Half&#8208;Sandwich Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherently challenging enantioselective direct reductive amination reaction under mild and operationally simple transfer hydrogenative conditions was developed using a rationally designed, chiral pyridine&#8208;derived half&#8208;sandwich iridium catalyst. The reaction was compatible with various functional groups and coordinative heterocycles.







Abstract
Chiral amines are broadly used compounds in pharmaceutical industry and organic synthesis, and reductive amination reactions have been the most appreciated methods for their syntheses. However, one&#8208;step transfer hydrogenative direct asymmetric reductive amination (THDARA) that could expand the scope, simplify the operation and eliminate the use of additives has been challenging. In this work, based on the Xiao's racemic transfer hydrogenative reductive amination in 2010 and our recent work in novel chiral pyridine ligands, chiral half&#8208;sandwich iridium catalysts were rationally designed and synthesized. Using the optimized catalyst and azeotropic mixture of formic acid and triethylamine as the hydrogen source, a broad range of &#945;&#8208;chiral (hetero)aryl amines, including various polar functional groups and heterocycles, were prepared in generally high yield and enantioselectivity under mild and operationally simple conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the catalytically active Ir&#8722;H species and the key hydride transfer step supported the chiral pyridine&#8208;induced stereospecific generation of the iridium center, and the enantioselection by taming the highly flexible key transition structure with multiple attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions. This work introduced a type of effective chiral catalysts for simplified approach to medicinally important chiral amines, as well as a rare example of robust enantioselective transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Drug Release for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced drug release surmounts numerous limitations inherent in traditional light&#8208;controlled drug release and radiochemotherapy. However, further enhancements are required in areas such as drug carrier design, advancements in radiation chemistry, and X&#8208;ray dosage control. Therefore, this article aims to explore X&#8208;rays as a stimulus for controlled drug release in DDSs development, the mechanisms of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced drug release, and its future prospects.







Abstract
Drug delivery systems (DDSs) are designed to deliver therapeutic agents to specific target sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Recent developments in drug&#8208;loaded DDSs have demonstrated promising characteristics and paved new pathways for cancer treatment. Light, a prevalent external stimulus, is widely utilized to trigger drug release. However, conventional light sources primarily concentrate on the ultraviolet (UV) and visible light regions, which suffer from limited biological tissue penetration. This limitation hinders applications for deep&#8208;tissue tumor drug release. Given their deep tissue penetration and well&#8208;established application technology, X&#8208;rays have recently received attention for the pursuit of controlled drug release. With precise spatiotemporal and dosage controllability, X&#8208;rays stand as an ideal stimulus for achieving controlled drug release in deep&#8208;tissue cancer therapy. This article explores the recent advancements in using X&#8208;rays for stimulus&#8208;triggered drug release in DDSs and delves into their action mechanisms.

         <title>Alleviating Side Reactions on Zn Anodes for Aqueous Batteries by a Cell Membrane Derived Phosphorylcholine Zwitterionic Protective Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyzwitterionic protective layer with phosphate and choline groups was engineered to alleviate the side reactions on Zn anode. The choline group can adsorb on Zn anode to expel H2O and regulate the Zn deposition behavior, and the phosphate group can decrease the Zn2+ desolvation energy barrier and form transfer route for faster ion migration, thus rendering the Zn anode with excellent rate performance and stability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) ion batteries are attractive for next generation batteries with high safety, yet their applications are still hindered by the uncontrollable dendrite formation and side reactions on Zn anode. Here, a polyzwitterion protective layer (PZIL) was engineered by polymerizing 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) in carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), which renders the following merits: the choline groups of MPC can preferentially adsorb onto Zn metal to avoid side reactions; the charged phosphate groups chelate with Zn2+ to regulate the solvation structure, further improving side reaction inhibition; the Hofmeister effect between ZnSO4 and CMCS can enhance the interfacial contact during electrochemical characterization. Consequently, the symmetrical Zn battery with PZIL can keep stable for more than 1000&#8197;hours under the ultra&#8208;high current density of 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The PZIL confers the Zn/MnO2 full battery and Zn/active carbon (AC) capacitor with stable cycling performance under high current density.

         <title>Nascent Proteomics: Chemical Tools for Monitoring Newly Synthesized Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nascent proteomics selectively analyzes newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) by labeling them with either isotopes or chemical tags, allowing for the detection of rapid changes in translational profiles upon acute biological modulations. Programmable variants of nascent proteomics enable the control of NSP labeling via optical or genetic manipulations, ensuring selectivity towards cell types and/or cellular states.







Abstract
Cellular proteins are dynamically regulated in response to environmental stimuli. Conventional proteomics compares the entire proteome in different cellular states to identify differentially expressed proteins, which suffers from limited sensitivity for analyzing acute and subtle changes. To address this challenge, nascent proteomics has been developed, which selectively analyzes the newly synthesized proteins, thus offering a more sensitive and timely insight into the dynamic changes of the proteome. In this Minireview, we discuss recent advancements in nascent proteomics, with an emphasis on methodological developments. Also, we delve into the current challenges and provide an outlook on the future prospects of this exciting field.

         <title>A Multifunctional Liquid Crystal as Hole Transport Layer Additive Enhances Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a multifunctional liquid crystal (LQ) into (2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD)&#8208;based hole transport layer (HTL) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can strongly enhance hot carriers extraction/transfer from perovskite layer into HTL, reducing charge&#8208;carrier recombination in device. Moreover, LQ can efficiently prevent the Li ions migration and agglomeration of Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li&#8208;TFSI) HTL dopant through chemical interaction. Using this approach, highly efficient and stable PSCs are achieved.







Abstract
Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li&#8208;TFSI) has been identified as the most used and effective p&#8208;dopant for hole transport layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the migration and agglomeration of Li&#8208;TFSI in HTL negatively impact PSCs performance and stability. Herein, we report an effective strategy for adding a liquid crystal organic small molecule (LQ) into Li&#8208;TFSI doped (2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208; spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) HTL. It was found that the introduction of LQ into Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD HTL can efficiently enhance the charge carrier extraction and transportation in device, which can strongly retard the charge carrier recombination in device. Consequently, the PSCs efficiency is significantly enhanced to 24.42&#8201;% (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD+LQ) from 21.03&#8201;% (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD). The chemical coordination between LQ and Li&#8208;TFSI can strongly confine Li+ ions migration and agglomeration of Li&#8208;TFSI, thus, achieving the enhanced device stability. Only a 9&#8201;% efficiency degradation is observed for un&#8208;encapsulated device prepared with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and LQ after 1700&#8197;h under air environment, while the efficiency drops by 30&#8201;% for the reference device. This work provides an effective strategy for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs, and gives some important insights for understanding intrinsic hot carriers dynamics for perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Dual Atom Catalysts for Energy and Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by paired metal sites in enzymes, dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) were developed as a frontier in heterogeneous catalysis. DACs possess many unique advantages and surpass their counterparts in various catalytic processes. Herein, we summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advancements in synthesis, characterization, structure&#8208;activity relationship of DACs and outlook the future development in this field with combination from computational insights.







Abstract
The pursuit of high metal utilization in heterogeneous catalysis has triggered the burgeoning interest of various atomically dispersed catalysts. Our aim in this review is to assess key recent findings in the synthesis, characterization, structure&#8208;property relationship and computational studies of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), which cover the full spectrum of applications in thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In particular, combination of qualitative and quantitative characterization with cooperation with DFT insights, synergies and superiorities of DACs compare to counterparts, high&#8208;throughput catalyst exploration and screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms are highlighted. Undoubtably, it would be wise to expect more fascinating developments in the field of DACs as tunable catalysts.

A Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydrodifluoromethylation of alkynes with BrCF2H via nickel catalysis is described, enabling straightforward access to diverse branched CF2H&#8208;alkenes with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
A Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydrodifluoromethylation of alkynes with BrCF2H via nickel catalysis is described. This protocol proceeds via a migratory insertion of nickel hydride to alkyne followed by a CF2H&#8208;coupling, enabling straightforward access to diverse branched CF2H&#8208;alkenes with high efficiency and exclusive regioselectivity. The mild condition applies to a wide array of aliphatic and aryl alkynes with good functional group compatibility. Mechanistic studies are presented to support the proposed pathway.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic micelles enable the solubilization of virtually insoluble, unsubstituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic polymers (&#960;CAPs) in water through non&#8208;covalent encircling. The &#960;CAPs are solubilized as fine bundles within the micelles and can be facilely analyzed by UV/Visible, emission, AFM, and/or SEM analyses. The obtained aqueous solutions are processable into free&#8208;standing &#960;CAP thin films using a simple filtration&#8208;annealing protocol.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated aromatic polymers (&#960;CAPs) are central components of functional materials yet suffer from insolubility without multiple covalent substituents on their backbones. We herein disclose a new strategy for the facile processing of unsubstituted heterocyclic &#960;CAPs (i.e., poly(para&#8208;phenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;benzobisoxazole) and poly(benzimidazobenzo&#8208;phenanthroline)), independent of the polymer length, via non&#8208;covalent encircling with aromatic micelles, composed of bent aromatic amphiphiles, in water. The UV/Visible studies reveal that the efficiencies of the present encircling method are &#8776;10 to 50&#8208;fold higher than those using conventional amphiphiles under the same conditions. The AFM and SEM analyses of the resultant aqueous polymer composites show that otherwise insoluble &#960;CAPs form fine bundles (e.g., &#8776;1&#8197;nm in thickness) in the tubular aromatic micelles, through efficient &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. In the same way, pristine poly(para&#8208;phenylene) can be dissolved in water, displaying enhanced fluorescence (10&#8208;fold), relative to the polymer solid. Two types of unsubstituted &#960;CAPs are likewise co&#8208;encircled in water, indicated by UV/Visible analysis. Importantly, aqueous processing of the encircled &#960;CAPs into free&#8208;standing single&#8208; or multicomponent films with submicrometer thickness is demonstrated through a simple filtration&#8208;annealing protocol.

         <title>Organopotassium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic&#8208;in&#8208;metal undirected silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under ambient, transition metal&#8208;free conditions is described. Using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR3) as silicon source, various mono&#8208; or gem&#8208;bis benzyl(di)silanes were prepared from methylarenes precursors. Mechanistic studies demonstrate the involvement of organopotassium reagents, including synthetically&#8208;elusive tert&#8208;butylpotassium.







Abstract
Benzylsilanes have found increasing applications in organic synthesis as bench&#8208;stable synthetic intermediates, yet are mostly produced by stoichiometric procedures. Catalytic alternatives based on the atom&#8208;economical silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds remain scarcely available as specialized directing groups and catalytic systems are needed to outcompete the kinetically&#8208;favored silylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we describe the first general and catalytic&#8208;in&#8208;metal undirected silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under ambient, transition metal&#8208;free conditions using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR3) as silicon source. The high activity and selectivity of the catalytic system, exemplified by the preparation of various mono&#8208; or gem&#8208;bis benzyl(di)silanes, originates from the facile generation of organopotassium reagents, including tert&#8208;butylpotassium.

         <title>A Chemical Proteomic Strategy Reveals Inhibitors of Lipoate Salvage in Bacteria and Parasites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinct from humans, lipoic acid (LA) salvage by lipoate protein ligase (LPL) is an essential scavenging pathway for auxotrophic bacteria and parasites. Probes as LA&#8208;mimics were designed and shown to label LA&#8208;dependent proteins in living cells on lysines. This tool enabled us to perform competitive screens in order to identify two cell&#8208;permeable LPL inhibitors with activity against P.&#8197;falciparum in erythrocytes.







Abstract
The development of novel anti&#8208;infectives requires unprecedented strategies targeting pathways which are solely present in pathogens but absent in humans. Following this principle, we developed inhibitors of lipoic acid (LA) salvage, a crucial pathway for the survival of LA auxotrophic bacteria and parasites but non&#8208;essential in human cells. An LA&#8208;based probe was selectively transferred onto substrate proteins via lipoate protein ligase (LPL) in intact cells, and their binding sites were determined by mass spectrometry. Probe labeling served as a proxy of LPL activity, enabling in situ screenings for cell&#8208;permeable LPL inhibitors. Profiling a focused compound library revealed two substrate analogs (LAMe and C3) as inhibitors, which were further validated by binding studies and co&#8208;crystallography. Importantly, LAMe exhibited low toxicity in human cells and achieved killing of Plasmodium falciparum in erythrocytes with an EC50 value of 15&#8197;&#956;M, making it the most effective LPL inhibitor reported to date.

         <title>Living Cationic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Hetero Diels&#8211;Alder Adducts to Give Multifactor&#8208;Controlled and Fast&#8208;Photodegradable Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The living cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of a hetero Diels&#8211;Alder adduct is reported. Vinyl polymers are produced with control of multiple structural parameters, including alternating sequence and head&#8208;to&#8208;head regioregularity. The photodegradability of the obtained polymers has been thoroughly investigated for the first time.







Abstract
Precise control of multiple structural parameters associated with vinyl polymers is important for producing materials with the desired properties and functions. While the development of living polymerization methods has provided a way to control the various structural parameters of vinyl polymers, the concomitant control of their sequence and regioregularity remains a challenging task. To overcome this challenge, herein, we report the living cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of hetero Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. The scalable and modular synthesis of the cyclic monomers was achieved by a one&#8208;step protocol using readily available vinyl precursors. Subsequently, living polymerization of the cyclic monomers was examined, allowing the synthesis of vinyl polymers while controlling multiple factors, including molecular weight, dispersity, alternating sequence, head&#8208;to&#8208;head regioregularity, and end&#8208;group functionality. The living characteristics of the developed method were further demonstrated by block copolymerization. The synthesized vinyl polymers exhibited unique thermal properties and underwent fast photodegradation even under sunlight.

         <title>Size&#8208;Transformable Superoxide&#8208;Triggered Nanoreporters for Crosstalk&#8208;Free Dual Fluorescence/Chemiluminescence Imaging and Urinalysis in Living Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size&#8208;transformable nanoreporters with superoxide anion&#8208;triggered luminescent turn&#8208;on response and nanostructure decomposition are synthesized. The conversion from nanoparticles to renal clearable fragments allows for crosstalk&#8208;free duplex chemo&#8208;fluorescence imaging of peritonitis, drug induced hepatoxicity and in vitro urinalysis.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence imaging has been recognized as a valuable tool for ultrasensitive detection of physio&#8208;pathological events through elimination of background autofluorescence. However, most chemiluminescent nanoprobes suffer from shallow imaging depths and slow clearance from living bodies, which impede their use in clinical settings. We herein report size&#8208;transformable nanoreporters (ADN1 and ADN2) that could be activated at disease site by superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;) to trigger nanostructure disassembly into renal excretable fluorescent fragments as well as chemiluminescence turn&#8208;on for crosstalk&#8208;free duplex chemo&#8208;fluorescence imaging and in vitro urinalysis. In peritonitis mouse model, we demonstrate that the representative nanoreporter ADN1 spontaneously accumulates at the disrupted peritoneum and is cleaved by upregulated O2&#8901;&#8722; to initiate depolymerization and result in red chemiluminescence at 620&#8197;nm, enabling sensitive detection of peritonitis at least 19&#8197;h earlier than gold standard histological assays. Additionally, the incorporation of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye into ADN1 results in ADN2 exhibiting intense and red&#8208;shifted chemiluminescence at &#8776;800&#8197;nm, which permits early detection of deeply seated diseases such as drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity. This study thus showcases a modular design strategy that is not only applicable to developing versatile chemiluminescent nanoprobes with switchable pharmacokinetics for early disease diagnosis, but also promising for future clinical translations.

In peritonitis mouse model, we demonstrate that the representative nanoreporter ADN1 spontaneously accumulates at the disrupted peritoneum and is cleaved by upregulated O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to initiate depolymerization and result in red chemiluminescence at 620&#8197;nm, enabling sensitive detection of peritonitis at least 19&#8197;h earlier than gold standard histological assays. Additionally, the incorporation of a near-infrared (NIR) dye into ADN1 results in ADN2 exhibiting intense and red-shifted chemiluminescence at &#8776;800&#8197;nm, which permits early detection of deeply seated diseases such as drug-induced hepatotoxicity. This study thus showcases a modular design strategy that is not only applicable to developing versatile chemiluminescent nanoprobes with switchable pharmacokinetics for early disease diagnosis, but also promising for future clinical translations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#963;&#8208;Cyclopropyl to &#960;&#8208;Allyl Rearrangement at AuIII</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(P,C)/(N,C)&#8208;cyclometalated as well as (P,N)&#8208;chelated AuIII &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes readily undergo ring&#8208;opening to give the corresponding &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes by cleavage of the distal &#963;(C&#8722;C) bond. The possible existence of &#963;(C&#8722;C) agostic interactions at AuIII is supported computationally.







Abstract
The possibility for AuIII &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes to undergo ring&#8208;opening and give &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes was interrogated. The transformation was first evidenced within (P,C)&#8208;cyclometalated complexes, it occurs within hours at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C. It was then generalized to other ancillary ligands. With (N,C)&#8208;cyclometalated complexes, the rearrangement occurs at room temperature while it proceeds already at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C with a dicationic (P,N)&#8208;chelated complex. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the mechanism of the transformation, a disrotatory electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening. Intrinsic Bond Orbital (IBO) analysis along the reaction profile shows the cleavage of the distal &#963;(CC) bond to give a &#960;&#8208;bonded allyl moiety. Careful inspection of the structure and bonding of cationic &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes support the possible existence of C&#8722;C agostic interactions at AuIII.

         <title>Dynamical Equilibrium between Br&#248;nsted and Lewis Sites in Zeolites: Framework&#8208;Associated Octahedral Aluminum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The details of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminum are revealed for the first time, based on a combined experimental and computational study. Framework&#8208;associated Al(Oh) becomes kinetically allowed and thermodynamically stable under wet conditions at sufficiently low Si/Al, while its thermodynamic stability with respect to regular Br&#248;nsted tetrahedral site decreases with decreasing water loading.







Abstract
While the structures of Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in zeolites are well understood, those of Lewis acid sites (LAS) remain an active area of investigation. Under hydrated conditions, the reversible formation of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminum has been observed in zeolites in the acidic form. However, the structure and formation mechanisms are currently unknown. In this work, combined experimental 27Al NMR spectroscopy and computational data reveal for the first time the details of the zeolite framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminium. The octahedral LAS site becomes kinetically allowed and thermodynamically stable under wet conditions in the presence of multiple nearby BAS sites. The critical condition for the existence of such octahedral LAS appears to be the availability of three protons: at lower proton concentration, either by increasing the Si/Al or by ion&#8208;exchange to non&#8208;acidic form, the tetrahedral BAS becomes thermodynamically more stable. This work resolves the question about the nature and reversibility of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminium in zeolites.

         <title>A Humidity&#8208;Induced Large Electronic Conductivity Change of 107 on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Sensitive Water Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;induced large electronic conductivity change of 107 on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 was observed. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8211;base pairs formed with the &#8722;NH2 groups, and H2SO4 played an important role in regulating the conductivity. Based on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, a high&#8208;performance chemiresistive humidity sensor was developed with the highest sensitivity, broadest detection range and lowest limit of detection amongst all the reported sensing materials to date.







Abstract
The electronic conductivity (EC) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is sensitive to strongly oxidizing guest molecules. Water is a relatively mild species, however, the effect of H2O on the EC of MOFs is rarely reported. We explored the effect of H2O on the EC in the MOFs (NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and its derivatives with experimental and theoretical investigations. Unexpectedly, a large EC increase of 107 on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 by H2O was observed. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8211;base pairs formed with the &#8722;NH2 groups, and H2SO4 played an important role in promoting the charge transfer from H2O to the MOF. Based on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, a high&#8208;performance chemiresistive humidity sensor was developed with the highest sensitivity, broadest detection range, and lowest limit of detection amongst all reported sensing materials to date. This work not only demonstrated that H2O can remarkably influence the EC of MOFs, but it also revealed that post&#8208;modification of the structure of MOFs could enhance the influence of the guest molecule on their EC to design high&#8208;performance sensing materials.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Emitters Enable High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Red Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of narrowband red fluorescent emitters based on a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton were designed. These emitters explore the use of a methyl&#8208;shield strategy to assemble high&#8208;performance narrowband red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on traditional fluorescent emitters.







Abstract
Narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are receiving significant attention and have demonstrated impressive performance in blue and green OLEDs. However, developing high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs remains a highly desired yet challenging task. Herein, we have developed narrowband red fluorescent emitters by utilizing a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton in combination with a methyl&#8208;shield strategy. These emitters exhibit small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHM) ranging from 21&#8197;nm (0.068&#8197;eV) to 25&#8197;nm (0.081&#8197;eV) and high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) ranging from 88.5&#8201;% to 99.0&#8201;% in toluene solution. Using BODIPY&#8208;based luminescent materials as emitters, high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs have been assembled with external quantum efficiency as high as 18.3&#8201;% at 623&#8197;nm and 21.1&#8201;% at 604&#8197;nm. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first successful case of achieving NTSC pure&#8208;red OLEDs with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of [0.67, 0.33] based on conventional fluorescent emitters.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Illisimonin&#8197;A and Merrilactone&#8197;A</title>

A comprehensive biosynthetic pathway was proposed for illicium sesquiterpenes. The key transformations of the biosynthetic pathway, which include retro&#8208;Dieckmann condensation, oxidative cleavage and aldol reaction, were supported by the total syntheses of illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A from a common intermediate.







Abstract
Illicium sesquiterpenes are a large family of biologically active secondary metabolites isolated from Illicium species of plants and are well&#8208;known for their activity of neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. Herein, we propose a comprehensive biosynthetic pathway for illicium sesquiterpenes and report a synthetic route to illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A based on it. We think that the carbon scaffolds of most of the illicium sesquiterpenes could be synthesized from a dicarbonyl derivative of allo&#8208;cedrane through retro&#8208;Dieckmann condensation, oxidative cleavage and aldol reaction at suitable oxidation states in Nature. The common intermediate for illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A similar to the dicarbonyl derivative of allo&#8208;cedrane was assembled with up to 82&#8201;% ee by an asymmetric intramolecular desymmetrizing reductive Heck reaction by the use of a new type of chiral phosphine ligand. The syntheses of illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A supported the key transformations of the proposed biosynthetic pathway.

         <title>Pure and Metal&#8208;confining Carbon Nanotubes through Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide in Ca&#8208;based Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in affordable Ca&#8208;based molten salt is demonstrated as an efficient preparation of carbon nanotube (CNT, above) and metal&#8208;confining CNT (M@CNT, below) by a CaC2&#8208;mediated mechanism.







Abstract
To be successfully implemented, an efficient conversion, affordable operation and high values of CO2&#8208;derived products by electrochemical conversion of CO2 are yet to be addressed. Inspired by the natural CaO&#8208;CaCO3 cycle, we herein introduce CaO into electrolysis of SnO2 in affordable molten CaCl2&#8208;NaCl to establish an in situ capture and conversion of CO2. In situ capture of anodic CO2 from graphite anode by the added CaO generates CaCO3. The consequent co&#8208;electrolysis of SnO2 and CaCO3 confines Sn in carbon nanotube (Sn@CNT) in cathode and increases current efficiency of O2 evolution in graphite anode to 71.9&#8201;%. The intermediated CaC2 is verified as the nuclei to direct a self&#8208;template generation of CNT, ensuring a CO2&#8208;CNT current efficiency and energy efficiency of 85.1&#8201;% and 44.8&#8201;%, respectively. The Sn@CNT integrates confined responses of Sn cores to external electrochemical or thermal stimuli with robust CNT sheaths, resulting in excellent Li storage performance and intriguing application as nanothermometer. The versatility of the molten salt electrolysis of CO2 in Ca&#8208;based molten salts for template&#8208;free generation of advanced carbon materials is evidenced by the successful generation of pure CNT, Zn@CNT and Fe@CNT.

         <title>Bimetal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoboxes Enable Accelerated Redox Kinetics and Polysulfide Trapping for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnCo&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs) are rationally designed and prepared via the cation and ligand exchange reactions to serve as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li&#8722;S batteries. Benefiting from the hollow architecture and atomically dispersed Co&#8722;O4 sites in ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs, the ZnCo&#8208;MOF/S cathode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and superior cycling stability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems in view of the high theoretical energy density and low cost of sulfur resources. The suppression of polysulfide diffusion and promotion of redox kinetics are the main challenges for Li&#8722;S batteries. Herein, we design and prepare a novel type of ZnCo&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs) to serve as a functional sulfur host for Li&#8722;S batteries. The hollow architecture of ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs can ensure fast charge transfer, improved sulfur utilization, and effective confinement of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The atomically dispersed Co&#8722;O4 sites in ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs can firmly capture LiPSs and electrocatalytically accelerate their conversion kinetics. Benefiting from the multiple structural advantages, the ZnCo&#8208;MOF/S cathode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate capability, and prolonged cycling performance for 300&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Cesium Methylammonium Lead Iodide (CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3) Nanocrystals with Wide Range Cation Composition Tuning and Enhanced Thermal Stability of the Perovskite Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite phase&#8208;pure mixed&#8208;cation CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals were obtained by post&#8208;synthesis cation exchange between CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 nanocrystals at room temperature. The CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals exhibit composition&#8208;tunable photoluminescence (PL) with their thermal stability that is enhanced compared to the parent CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 nanocrystals.







Abstract
Cesium methylammonium lead iodide (CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3) nanocrystals were obtained with a wide range of A&#8208;site Cs&#8208;MA compositions by post&#8208;synthetic, room temperature cation exchange between CsPbI3 nanocrystals and MAPbI3 nanocrystals. The alloyed CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals retain their photoactive perovskite phase with incorporated Cs content, x, as high as 0.74 and the expected composition&#8208;tunable photoluminescence (PL). Excess methylammonium oleate from the reaction mixture in the MAPbI3 nanocrystal dispersions was necessary to obtain fast Cs&#8208;MA cation exchange. The phase transformation and degradation kinetics of films of CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals were measured and modeled using an Avrami expression. The transformation kinetics were significantly slower than those of the parent CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 nanocrystals, with Avrami rate constants, k, at least an order of magnitude smaller. These results affirm that A&#8208;site cation alloying is a promising strategy for stabilizing iodide&#8208;based perovskites.

         <title>B7Be6B7: A Boron&#8208;Beryllium Sandwich Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the discovery of a previously unknown sandwich&#8208;type complex consisting of beryllium and boron, which exhibits remarkable thermochemical and kinetical stability and displays aromatic characteristics. Through chemical bonding analysis, we show that B7Be6B7 can be conceptualized as a [B7]3&#8722;[Be6]6+[B7]3&#8722; complex.







Abstract
Planar boron clusters have often been regarded as &#8220;&#960;&#8208;analogous&#8221; to aromatic arenes because of their similar delocalized &#960;&#8208;bonding. However, unlike arenes such as C5H5&#8722; and C6H6, boron clusters have not previously shown the ability to form sandwich complexes. In this study, we present the first sandwich complex involving beryllium and boron, B7Be6B7. The global minimum of this combination adopts a unique architecture having a D6h geometry, featuring an unprecedented monocyclic Be6 ring sandwiched between two quasi&#8208;planar B7 motifs. The thermochemical and kinetic stability of B7Be6B7 can be attributed to strong electrostatic and covalent interactions between the fragments. Chemical bonding analysis shows that B7Be6B7 can be considered as a [B7]3&#8722;[Be6]6+[B7]3&#8722; complex. Moreover, there is a significant electron delocalization within this cluster, supported by the local diatropic contributions of the B7 and Be6 fragments.

     alt="B7Be6B7: A Boron-Beryllium Sandwich Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the discovery of a previously unknown sandwich-type complex consisting of beryllium and boron, which exhibits remarkable thermochemical and kinetical stability and displays aromatic characteristics. Through chemical bonding analysis, we show that B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; can be conceptualized as a [B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;[Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; complex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planar boron clusters have often been regarded as &#8220;&#960;-analogous&#8221; to aromatic arenes because of their similar delocalized &#960;-bonding. However, unlike arenes such as C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, boron clusters have not previously shown the ability to form sandwich complexes. In this study, we present the first sandwich complex involving beryllium and boron, B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. The global minimum of this combination adopts a unique architecture having a &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; geometry, featuring an unprecedented monocyclic Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ring sandwiched between two quasi-planar B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; motifs. The thermochemical and kinetic stability of B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; can be attributed to strong electrostatic and covalent interactions between the fragments. Chemical bonding analysis shows that B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; can be considered as a [B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;[Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; complex. Moreover, there is a significant electron delocalization within this cluster, supported by the local diatropic contributions of the B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and Be&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; fragments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic Modulation of an Unstable Dehydrosecodine&#8208;type Intermediate and Its Encapsulation into a Confined Cavity Enable Its X&#8208;ray Crystallographic Observation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of a labile dehydrosecodine&#8208;type intermediate was achieved by designing a functionally modulated analogue, enabling its inclusion within a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage. The unique folded conformation of this intermediate, stabilized inside the hydrophobic cavity, was supported by DFT calculations and supports the postulation of its involvement in divergent metabolic pathways to various monoterpene indole alkaloids.







Abstract
Numerous indole alkaloids such as the iboga&#8208; and aspidosperma&#8208;type are believed to be biosynthesized via a common hypothetical intermediate, dehydrosecodine. The highly reactive nature of dehydrosecodine&#8208;type compounds has hampered their isolation and structural elucidation. In this study, we achieved the first X&#8208;ray structural determination of a dehydrosecodine&#8208;type compound by integrating synthetic optimization of the reactivity and stabilizing the fragile molecule by encapsulation into a supramolecular host. Formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex of the dehydrosecodine&#8208;type labile guest bearing both vinyl indole and dihydropyridine units with the host was observed. This integrated approach not only provides insights into the biosynthetic conversions but also allows stabilization and storage of the reactive and otherwise short&#8208;lived intermediate within the confined hydrophobic cavity.

         <title>Ketyl Radical Anion Mediated Radical Polymerization and Anionic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization to Give Polymers with Low Molecular Weight Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One ketyl radical anion can enable a 3&#8211;3 coupling reaction, radical polymerization at a carbon radical site, and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization at an oxygen anion site. This results in simultaneous organic synthesis and polymerization in one pot; thereby cyclopentane derivates and polymers with low &#272; are successfully prepared under mild conditions.







Abstract
The development of novel polymerization capable of yielding polymers with low molecular weight distribution (&#272;) is essential and significant in polymer chemistry, where monofunctional initiator contains only one initiation site in these polymerizations generally. Here, ketyl radical anion species is introduced to develop a novel Ketyl Mediated Polymerization (KMP), which enables radical polymerization at carbon radical site and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization at oxygen anion site, respectively. Meanwhile, polymerization and corresponding organic synthesis generally couldn't be performed simultaneously in one pot. Through KMP, organic synthesis and polymerization are achieved in one pot, where small molecules (cyclopentane derivates) and polymers with low &#272; are successfully prepared under mild condition simultaneously. At the initiation step, both organic synthesis and polymerization are initiated by single electron transfer reaction with ketyl radical anion formation. Cyclopentane derivates are synthesized through 3&#8211;3 coupling reaction and cyclization. Polystyrene and polycaprolactone with low &#272; and a full monomer conversion are prepared by KMP via radical polymerization and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization, respectively. This work therefore enables both organic synthesis and two different polymerizations from same initiation system, which saves time, labour, resource and energy and expands the reaction mode and method libraries of organic chemistry and polymer chemistry.

         <title>Chitin&#8208; and Streptavidin&#8208;Mediated Affinity Purification Systems: A Screening Platform for Enzyme Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protein purification system, designated CSAP (chitin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;mediated affinity purification), has been developed for enzyme library screening. The system utilizes chitin powder as a chromatography matrix to purify Strep&#8208;tag&#8197;II fusion proteins. Given the cost of chitin and the availability of Strep&#8208;tag&#8197;II, the CSAP system offers a powerful platform for the screening of purified proteins.







Abstract
Affinity purification of recombinant proteins is an essential technique in biotechnology. However, current affinity purification methods are very cost&#8208;intensive, and this imposes limits on versatile use of affinity purification for obtaining purified proteins for a variety of applications. To overcome this problem, we developed a new affinity purification system which we call CSAP (chitin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;mediated affinity purification) for low&#8208;cost purification of Strep&#8208;tag&#8197;II fusion proteins. The CSAP system is designed to utilize commercially available chitin powder as a chromatography matrix, thereby significantly improving the cost&#8208;efficiency of protein affinity purification. We investigated the CSAP system for protein screening in 96&#8208;well format as a demonstration. Through the screening of 96&#8197;types of purified hemoproteins, several proteins capable of the catalytic diastereodivergent synthesis of cyclopropanes were identified as candidates for an abiotic carbene transfer reaction.

         <title>Emodin&#8208;Based Nanoarchitectonics with Giant Two&#8208;Photon Absorption for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited photodynamic therapy (TPE&#8208;PDT) has significant advantages over conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, obtaining easily accessible TPE photosensitizers (PSs) with high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that emodin (Emo), one kind of natural anthraquinone (NA), is a promising TPE PS with a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section (TPAC: 380.9 GM) and high singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield (31.9 %). When co&#8208;assembled with human serum albumin (HSA), the formed Emo/HSA nanoparticles (E/H NPs) possess a giant TPAC (4.02&#215;107 GM) and desirable 1O2 generation capability, thus showing outstanding TPE&#8208;PDT properties against cancer cells. In vivo experiments reveal that E/H NPs exhibit improved retention time in tumors and can ablate tumors at an ultra&#8208;low dosage (0.2 mg/kg) under an 800 nm femtosecond pulsed laser irradiation. This work is beneficial for the use of natural extracts NAs for high&#8208;efficiency TPE&#8208;PDT.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this work, we achieved a triggering degradation of polymers composed of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) bonded backbone without relying on introduction of labile heteroatom&#8208;based bond.&#160; The crucial point for the achievement is using vinyl ether (VE) as a comonomer in radical copolymerization of (meth)acrylate for introduction of the carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8208;H) bonds active for photocatalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) as triggers in the pendant.&#160; Interestingly, methyl methacrylate (MMA)&#8208;n&#8208;butyl vinyl ether (NBVE) copolymer underwent degradation in acetonitrile in the presence of benzophenone (Ph2CO) under UV irradiation at 80&#730;C.&#160; The degradation did not take place, when any one of UV, Ph2CO, heat, and NBVE unit was removed or HAT&#8208;active solvent such as toluene and 1,4&#8208;dioxane was used.&#160; These control experiments strongly supported the HAT&#8208;triggering degradation.&#160; Furthermore, the degradation behaviors of the copolymers with other vinyl ethers such as tert&#8208;butyl vinyl ether and methyl isopropenyl ether indicated that the C&#8208;H bond neighboring to oxygen on the pendant is mainly responsible for the trigger leading to degradation. The HAT&#8208;triggering degradation was also demonstrated even with the acrylate&#8208;based copolymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Photosynthesis&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Biomineralization of Gold Nanoparticles&#160;inside Chlorella Cells towards Hydrogen Boosting under Green Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering living microorganisms to enhance green biomanufacturing for the development of sustainable and carbon&#8208;neutral energy strategies has attracted the interest of researchers from a wide range of scientific communities. In this study, we develop&#160;a method to achieve the photosynthesis&#8208;mediated intracellular biomineralization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inside Chlorella cells, where the photosynthesis&#8208;dominated reduction of Au3+ to Au0 allows the formed AuNPs to locate preferentially around the thylakoid membrane domain. In particular, we reveal that the electrons generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs could greatly augment hypoxic photosynthesis, which then promotes the generation and transferring of photoelectrons throughout photosynthetic chain for augmented hydrogen production under sunlight. Significantly, we demonstrate that the electrons from AuNPs could be directly transferred to hydrogenase, giving rise to an 8.3&#8208;fold enhancement of algal hydrogen production independent of cellular photosynthetic process under monochromatic 560 nm light irradiation. Overall, the photosynthesis&#8208;mediated intracellular biomineralization of AuNPs could contribute to a novel paradigm for functionalizing Chlorella cells to augment biomanufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Backbone&#8208;Installed Split Intein&#8208;Assisted Ligation for the Chemical Synthesis of Mirror&#8208;Image Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;associated D&#8208;proteins are an important class of synthetic molecules needed for D&#8208;peptide drug discovery, but their chemical synthesis using canonical ligation methods such as native chemical ligation is often hampered by the poor solubility of their constituent peptide segments. Here, we describe a Backbone&#8208;Installed Split Intein&#8208;Assisted Ligation (BISIAL) method for the synthesis of these proteins, wherein the native L&#8208;forms of the N&#8208; and C&#8208;intein fragments of the unique consensus&#8208;fast (Cfa) (i.e. L&#8208;CfaN and L&#8208;CfaC) are separately installed onto the two D&#8208;peptide segments to be ligated via a removable backbone modification. The ligation proceeds smoothly at micromolar (&#956;M) concentrations under strongly chaotropic conditions (8.0 M urea), and the subsequent removal of the backbone modification groups affords the desired D&#8208;proteins without leaving any &#8220;ligation scar&#8221; on the products. The effectiveness and practicality of the BISIAL method are exemplified by the synthesis of the D&#8208;enantiomers of the extracellular domains of T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC). The BISIAL method further expands the chemical protein synthesis ligation toolkit and provides practical access to challenging D&#8208;protein targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete Amphiphilic Oligourethanes with Cascade Self&#8208;Immolative Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrete polymers offer an excellent platform for comprehending the interplay between precise chain structures, distinctive self&#8208;assembly behaviors, and functional applications, whereas the development of discrete polymers with self&#8208;immolative properties remains scarce. Here, we modularly synthesize a library of discrete self&#8208;immolative oligourethanes containing N&#8208;naphthylcarbamate or N&#8208;(3&#8208;fluorophenyl)carbamate) repeating units via iterative stepwise growth. These oligourethanes undergo not only cascade 1,6&#8208;elimination depolymerizations via photo&#8208;mediated removal of o&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbamate triggers but also selective cleavage of benzyl&#8208;O linkages under MS/MS conditions even without UV light irradiation. In aqueous media, these discrete oligourethanes self&#8208;assemble into different morphologies such as flat nanosheets, nanofibers, and nanoribbons, depending on the chain lengths and backbone compositions, and further morphological transitions are observed upon annealing treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective 1,4&#8208;Oxyamination of Conjugated gem&#8208;Difluorodienes via Coupling with Carboxylic Acids and Dioxazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of fluorine atoms in organics conduces to improvement of their bioactivity and lipophilicity. Catalytic functionalization of gem&#8208;difluorodienes represents one of the most straightforward approaches to access fluorinated alkenes. However, the regio&#8208; and enantioselective oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodienes remains untouched. Herein, we report asymmetric 1,4&#8208;oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodiene via chiral rhodium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling with readily available carboxylic acid and dioxazolone to forge a gem&#8208;difluorinated and enantioenriched 1,4&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives. Our asymmetric protocol exhibits high 1,4&#8208;regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Stoichiometric experiments provide evidences for the &#960;&#8208;allylrhodium pathway. Related oxyamination was also realized when trifluoroethanol was used as an oxygen nucleophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Lewis Acid&#8211;1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium&#8211;Aryloxide Catalysis: Pyrazolone Addition to Nitroolefins as Entry to Diaminoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrazolones represent an important structural motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients. Their asymmetric synthesis is thus widely studied. Still, a generally highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition to nitroolefins providing products with adjacent stereocenters is elusive. In this article,&#160;a new polyfunctional&#160;Cu(II)&#8211;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium&#8211;aryloxide catalyst is presented which enables this reaction type with high stereocontrol. DFT studies revealed that the triazolium stabilizes the transition state by hydrogen bonding between C(5)&#8208;H and the nitroolefin and verify a cooperative mode of activation. Moreover, they show that the catalyst adopts a rigid chiral cage/ pore&#160;structure by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, by which stereocontrol is achieved. Control catalyst systems confirm the crucial role of the triazolium, aryloxide and Cu(II), requiring a sophisticated structural orchestration for high efficiency. The addition products were used to form pyrazolidinones by chemoselective C=N reduction. These heterocycles are shown to be valuable precursors toward &#946;,&#947;&#8217;&#8208;diaminoamides by chemoselective nitro and N&#8208;N bond reductions. Morphological profiling using the Cell painting assay identified biological activities for the pyrazolidinones and suggest modulation of DNA synthesis as a potential mode of action. One product showed biological similarity to Camptothecin, a lead structure for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Network Formation via Two Colour Light Activated &#955;&#8208;Orthogonal Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Independently addressing photoreactive sites within one molecule with two colours of light is a formidable challenge. Here, we combine two sequence independent &#955;&#8208;orthogonal chromophores in one heterotelechelic dilinker molecule, to exploit their disparate reactivity utilizing the same reaction partner, a maleimide&#8208;containing polymer. We demonstrate that polymer network formation only proceeds if two colours of light are employed. Upon single colour irradiation, linker&#8208;decorated post&#8208;functionalized polymers are generated at either wavelength and in either sequence. Network formation, however, is only achieved by sequential or simultaneous two colour irradiation. The herein introduced photoreactive system demonstrates the power of wavelength orthogonal chemistry in macromolecular synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Reorganization: Aluminium Promoted 1,5&#8208;Hydride Shifts Allow the Controlled Synthesis of Multisubstituted Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient synthesis of cyclohexenes has been achieved from easily accessible tetrahydropyrans via a tandem 1,5&#8208;hydride shift&#8211;aldol condensation. We discovered that readily available aluminium reagents, e.g. Al2O3 or Al(OtBu)3 are essential for this process, promoting the 1,5&#8208;hydride shift with complete regio&#8208; and enantiospecificity (in stark contrast to results obtained under basic conditions). The mild conditions, coupled with multiple methods available to access the tetrahydropyran starting materials makes this a versatile method with exceptional functional group tolerance. A wide range of cyclohexenes (&gt;40 examples) have been prepared, many in enantiopure form, showing our ability to selectively install a substituent at each position around the newly forged cyclohexene ring. Experimental and computational studies revealed that aluminium serves a dual role in facilitating the hydride shift, activating both the alkoxide nucleophile and the electrophilic carbonyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisted Diindeno&#8208;Fused Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene Derivatives and their Dianions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a facile synthesis of diindeno&#8208;fused dibenzo[a,h]anthracene derivatives (DIDBA&#8208;2Cl, DIDBA&#8208;2Ph, and DIDBA&#8208;2H) with different degrees of non&#8208;planarity using three substituents (chloro, phenyl, and hydrogen) of varying sizes. The planarization of their cores, as evidenced by the decreased end&#8208;to&#8208;end torsional angles, was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their enhanced energy gaps with twisting were investigated by a combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods with density functional theory, resulting in a transition from singlet open&#8208;shell to closed&#8208;shell configuration. Moreover, their doubly&#8208;reduced states, DIDBA&#8208;2Ph2&#8208; and DIDBA&#8208;2H2&#8208;, were achieved by chemical reduction. The structures of dianions were identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, elucidating that the electron charging further distorted the backbones. The electronic structure of the dianions was demonstrated by experimental and theoretical approaches, suggesting decreased energy gaps with larger non&#8208;planarity, different from the neutral species.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Glucose Oxidation by the Pt Oxidation State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic glucose oxidation can produce high value chemicals, but selectivity needs to be improved. Here we elucidate the role of the Pt oxidation state on the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose with a new analytical approach, using high&#8208;pressure liquid chromatography and high&#8208;pressure anion exchange chromatography. It was found that the type of oxidation, i.e. dehydrogenation of primary and secondary alcohol groups or oxygen transfer to aldehyde groups, strongly depends on the Pt oxidation state. Pt0 has a 7&#8208;fold higher activity for dehydrogenation reactions than for oxidation reactions, while PtOx is equally active for both reactions. Thus, Pt0 promotes glucose dialdehyde formation, while PtOx favors gluconate formation. The successive dehydrogenation of gluconate is achieved selectively at the primary alcohol group by Pt0, while PtOx also promotes the dehydrogenation of secondary alcohol groups, resulting in more complex reaction mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable and High&#8208;Rate Electrosynthesis of Nitrogen Fertilizer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conventional industrial production of nitrogen&#8208;containing fertilizers, such as urea and ammonia, relies heavily on energy&#8208;intensive processes, accounting for approximately 3% of global annual CO2 emissions. Herein, we report a sustainable electrocatalytic approach that realizes direct and selective synthesis of urea and ammonia from co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and nitrates under ambient conditions. With the assistance of a copper (Cu)&#8208;based salphen organic catalyst, unprecedented urea (3.64 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1) and ammonia (9.73 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1) yield rates are achieved, in addition to a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 57.9 &#177; 3% for the former. This work proposes an appealing sustainable route to converting greenhouse gas and waste nitrates by renewable energies into value&#8208;added fertilizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;Selective Alkyne Hydroamination and Hydrophenoxylation using Tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;Sulfanyl Alkynes under Superbasic, Naked Anion Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyne hydroamination is an effective approach for the production of enamines and enamine&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocycles. However, stereoselectivity control is a considerable challenge in this reaction because of the electronic repulsion between an incoming nitrogen lone pair and the alkyne &#960;&#8208;system. Herein, we propose a methodology involving &#946;&#8208;regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selective alkyne hydroamination by using tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl (SF4) alkynes under superbasic, naked anion conditions. The reaction is compatible with a wide variety of N&#8208;heterocycles, including indoles, carbazoles, pyrazoles, and imidazoles, and selectively furnishes SF4&#8208;linked Z&#8208;vinyl enamines with &#946;&#8208;regioselectively. Moreover, the method can be extended to the &#946;&#8208; and Z&#8208;controlled, base&#8208;mediated alkyne hydrophenoxylation with phenols to provide SF4&#8208;linked Z&#8208;vinyl ethers in high yields. As the SF4 unit has attracted attention as a bioisostere for alkynes, p&#8208;benzenes, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP) groups, and cubanes in medicinal chemistry, this chemistry represents an effective approach to creating novel drug candidates incorporating SF4&#8208;containing molecules.</dc:description>

As the SF4 unit has attracted attention as a bioisostere for alkynes, p-benzenes, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP) groups, and cubanes in medicinal chemistry, this chemistry represents an effective approach to creating novel drug candidates incorporating SF4-containing molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Earth's original atmosphere was rich in ammonia and methane. To understand the evolution of the atmosphere, these two gases were used to make photoredox active nitrogen doped carbon (NDC). Photocatalysts such as NDC might play an important role in the development of geological and atmospheric chemistry during the Archean era. This study describes the synthesis of NDC directly from NH3 and CH4 gases. The photocatalyst product can be used to selectively synthesize imine by photo&#8208;oxidization of amine, producing H2O2 simultaneously by the photoreduction reaction. Our findings would shed light on the chemical evolution of the Earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Oxidative&#8208;Resistant Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Lithium Borate Salt for Enhanced Cycling Performance of Practical Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) has been widely investigated in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its advantageous thermal stability and excellent aluminum passivation property. However, LiDFOB tends to suffer from severe decomposition and generate a lot of gas species (e.g., CO2). Herein, a novel cyano&#8208;functionalized lithium borate salt, namely lithium difluoro(1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) borate (LiDFTCB), is innovatively synthesized as a highly oxidative&#8208;resistant salt to alleviate above dilemma. It is revealed that the LiDFTCB&#8208;based electrolyte enables LiCoO2/graphite cells with superior capacity retention at both room and elevated temperatures (e.g., 80% after 600 cycles) with barely any CO2&#160;gas evolution. Systematic studies reveal that LiDFTCB tends to form thin and robust interfacial layers at both electrodes. This work emphasizes the crucial role of cyano&#8208;functionalized anions in improving cycle lifespan and safety of practical LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Guest&#8208;Host&#8208;Receptor Recognitions Precisely Guide Ciprofloxacin to Eliminate Intracellular Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is able to hide within host cells to escape immune clearance and antibiotic action, causing life&#8208;threatening infections. To boost the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics, new intracellular delivery approaches are urgently needed. Herein, by rational design of an adamantane (Ada)&#8208;containing antibiotic&#8208;peptide precursor Ada&#8208;Gly&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Asp&#8208;Cys(StBu)&#8208;Lys(Ciprofloxacin)&#8208;CBT (Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada), we propose a&#160;strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to eliminate intracellular S. aureus. Via guest&#8208;host recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada is decorated with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;heptamannoside (CD&#8208;M) derivative to yield Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M, which is able to target mannose receptor&#8208;overexpressing macrophages via multivalent ligand&#8208;receptor recognition. After uptake, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M undergoes caspase&#8208;1 (an overexpressed enzyme during S. aureus infection)&#8208;initiated CBT&#8208;Cys click reaction to self&#8208;assemble into ciprofloxacin nanoparticle Nano&#8208;Cip. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that, compared with ciprofloxacin or Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M shows superior intracellular bacteria elimination and inflammation alleviation efficiency in S. aureus&#8208;infected RAW264.7 cells and mouse infection models, respectively. This work provides a&#160;supramolecular platform of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide antibiotics to eliminate intracellular S. aureus infection efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Recoverable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells for Next&#8208;Generation Portable Power Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) with excellent recoverability show a wide range of potential applications in portable power sources. The recoverability of FPSCs requires outstanding bendability of each functional layer, including the flexible substrates, electrodes,&#160;perovskite light absorbers, and charge transport materials. This review highlights the recent progress and practical applications of high&#8208;recoverability FPSCs, and illustrates the routes toward improvement of the recoverability and environmental stability&#160;through the choice of flexible substrates and the preparation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films, as well as the optimization of charge&#8208;selective contacts. In addition, we explore the intrinsic properties of each functional layer from the physical perspective and analyze how to select suitable functional layers. Additionally, some effective strategies are summarized, including material modification engineering of selective contacts, additives and interface engineering of interlayers, which can release mechanical stress and increase the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) and recoverability of the FPSCs. The challenges of making high&#8208;performance FPSCs with long&#8208;term stability and high recoverability are discussed. Finally,&#160;future applications and perspectives for FPSCs are discussed, aiming to promote more extensive commercialization processes for lightweight and durable FPSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric (4+n) Cycloadditions of Indolyldimethanols for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Indole&#8208;Fused Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric construction of chiral indole&#8208;fused rings has become an important issue in the chemical community because of the significance of such scaffolds. In this work, we have accomplished the first catalytic asymmetric (4+2) and (4+3) cycloadditions of 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols by using indoles and 2&#8208;naphthols as suitable reaction partners under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acids, constructing enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused six&#8208;membered and seven&#8208;membered rings in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In addition, this approach is used to realize the first enantioselective construction of challenging tetrahydroindolocarbazole scaffolds, which are found to show promising anticancer activity. More importantly, theoretical calculations of the reaction pathways and activation mode offer an in&#8208;depth understanding of this class of indolylmethanols. This work not only settles the challenges in realizing catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of indolyldimethanols but also provides a powerful strategy for the construction of enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;P Alkenylphosphonamidates through Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;P coupling of Phosphoramidites and Alkenyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;stereogenic compounds are widely used as ligands in asymmetric catalysis and are present in a myriad of bioactive compounds and pharmaceuticals. Yet, their stereocontrolled preparation remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel strategy towards versatile chiral&#8208;at&#8208;P alkenylphosphonamidates through a one&#8208;pot Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;P coupling/diastereoselective hydrolysis of readily available phosphoramidites and alkenyl halides. Remarkably, a chemo&#8208; and diastereodivergent behavior was observed upon subtle changes in the reaction conditions. Additionally, selective derivatizations of chiral alkenylphosphonamidates demonstrate their versatility as building blocks for the synthesis of structurally diverse P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru&#8208;FeNi Alloy Heterojunctions on Liginin&#8208;derived Carbon as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of efficient, stable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is a key challenge to realize green hydrogen production via electrolytic water splitting. Herein, Ru nanoparticles andFeNi alloy heterojunction catalyst (Ru&#8211;FeNi@NLC)encapsulated via lignin&#8208;derived carbon was prepared by self&#8208;assembly precipitation and in situ pyrolysis. The designed catalyst displays excellent performance at 10 mA cm&#8722;2with low overpotentials of 36 mV for HER and 198 mV for OER, and only needs 1.48 V for overall water splitting. Results and DFT calculations show the unique N&#8208;doped lignin&#8208;derived&#160;carbon layer and Ru&#8211;FeNi heterojunction contribute to optimized electronic structure for enhancing electron transfer, balanced free energy of reactants and intermediates in the sorption/desorption process, and significantly reduced reaction energy barrier for the HER and OER rate&#8208;determining steps,thus improved reaction kinetics. This work provides a new in situ pyrolysis doping strategy based on renewable biomass for the construction of highly active, stable and cost&#8208;effectivecatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogen Generation and Exciplex Stimulated Emission in Photobasic Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach to generating sustainable hydrogen. However, the transport of photoelectrons to the catalyst sites, usually within ps&#8208;to&#8208;ns timescales, is much faster than proton delivery (~&#181;s), which limits the activity. Therefore, the acceleration of abstraction of protons from water molecules towards the catalytic sites to keep up with the electron transfer rate can significantly promote hydrogen production. The photobasic effect that is the increase in proton affinity upon excitation offers means to achieve this objective. Herein, we design photobasic carbon dots and identify that internal pyridinic N sites are intrinsically photobasic. This is supported by steady&#8208;state and ultrafast spectroscopic measurements that demonstrate proton abstraction with a few picoseconds of excitation. Furthermore, we show that in water, they form a unique four&#8208;level lasing scheme with optical gain and stimulated emission. The latter competes with photocatalysis, revealing a rather unique mechanism for efficiency loss, such that the stimulated emission can act as a toggle for photocatalytic activity. This provides additional means of controlling the photocatalytic process and helps the rational design of photocatalytic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Binuclear Copper(I)&#160;Complexes for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two binuclear heteroleptic CuI&#160;complexes, namely&#160;Cu&#8208;NIR1&#160;and&#160;Cu&#8208;NIR2, bearing rigid chelating diphosphines and&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated 2,5&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole&#160;as the&#160;bis&#8208;bidentate ligand are presented. The proposed dinuclearization strategy yields a large bathochromic shift of the emission when compared to the mononuclear counterparts (M1&#8211;M2) and enables pushing luminescence into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region in both solution and solid state, showing emission maximum&#160;at&#160;ca.&#160;750 and 712 nm, respectively. The radiative process is assigned to an excited state with triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) character as demonstrated by in&#8208;depth photophysical and computational investigation. Noteworthy, X&#8208;ray analysis of the binuclear complexes unravels two interligand&#160;&#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions yielding a doubly locked structure that disfavours flattening of the tetrahedral coordination around the CuI&#160;centre in the excited state and maintain enhanced NIR luminescence. No such interaction is present in&#160;M1&#8211;M2. These findings prompt the successful use of&#160;Cu&#8208;NIR1&#160;and&#160;Cu&#8208;NIR2&#160;in NIR light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), which display electroluminescence maximum up to&#160;756 nm&#160;and peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.43%. Their suitability for the fabrication of white&#8208;emitting LEC is also demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of NIR electroluminescent devices based on earth&#8208;abundant CuI&#160;emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross Relaxation Channel Tailored Temperature Response in Er3+&#8208;rich Upconversion Nanophosphor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently high doping of lanthanide ions (till 100%) is realized unprecedentedly in nanostructured upconversion (UC) phosphors. However, oddly enough, this significant breakthrough did not result in a corresponding UC enhancement at ambient temperature, which hinders the otherwise very interesting applications of these materials in various fields. In this work, taking the Er3+&#8208;rich UC nanosystem as an example, we confirm unambiguously that the phonon&#8208;assisted cross relaxation (CR) is the culprit. More importantly, combining the theoretical modeling and experiments, the precise roles of different CR channels on UC energy loss are quantitatively revealed. As a result, lowering the temperature can exponentially enhance the relevant UC luminescence by more than two orders of magnitude. Our comprehension will play an important role in promoting the UC performance and further application of high doping rare earth materials. As a proof of concept, an Er3+&#8208;rich core/multi&#8208;shell nanophosphor is exploited which demonstrates the great potential of our finding in the field of ultra&#8208;sensitive temperature sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Photonic Modulation Enabled by Controlling the Edge Structures of Boron&#8208;Doped Molecular Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over topological edges of molecular carbons (MCs) is of importance for achieving diverse molecular topologies and desirable physical properties. However, it remains very challenging for heteroatom&#8208;doped MCs due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, we report control over the edge structures of boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs) via the sequential cyclization strategy. Three BMC molecules that feature the C56B2 or C84B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeletons with selective cove/fjord or cove/bay edges, respectively, were synthesized through the rational combination of Mallory photoreaction and Scholl reaction. We not only obtain the largest boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system reported so far, but also disclose that fine control of their edges and length greatly affects electronic structures and thereby photonic properties of BMCs, such as tunable aromaticity, decreased band gaps, as well as redshifted absorptions and fluorescence. Remarkably, the C56B2 molecule exhibits stimulated emission behavior and amplified spontaneous emission property, both of which have never been reported for pristine boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems, thus demonstrating the potential of BMCs as optical gain materials for laser cavities.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The past decade has witnessed the great potential of Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis in catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, it remains a grand challenge to substantially improve their intrinsic activity and long&#8208;term stability in acidic electrolytes. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy, by which high&#8208;density Fe atoms (3.97 wt%) are coordinated with square&#8208;planar para&#8208;positioned nitrogen and phosphorus atoms in a hierarchical carbon framework. The as&#8208;crafted Fe&#8208;SA/PNC manifest an outstanding activity towards ORR over the entire pH range. Specifically, the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92 V, 0.83 V, and 0.86 V vs. RHE are attained in alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes, respectively, representing the high performance among reported catalysts to date. Furthermore, after 30,000 durability cycles, the Fe&#8208;SA/PNC remains to be stable with no visible performance decay when tested in 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, and only a minor negative shift of 40 mV detected in 0.1 M HClO4, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C counterpart. The coordination motif of Fe&#8208;SA/PNC is validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides atomic&#8208;level insight into improving the activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal ORR catalysts, opening up an avenue to craft the desired single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular control of the oxidative addition as a way to improve the catalytic efficiency of pincer&#8208;rhodium (I) complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1H NMR studies using a cationic complex with a pyridine&#8208;di&#8208;imidazolylidene pincer ligand of formula [Rh(CNC)(CO)]+ revealed that this compound showed high binding affinity with coronene in CH2Cl2. The interaction between coronene and the planar Rh(I) complex is established by means of p&#8208;stacking interactions. This interaction has a strong impact on the electrondonating strength of the pincer CNC ligand, which is increased significantly, as demonstrated by the shifting of the n(CO) stretching bands to lower frequencies. The addition of coronene increases the reaction rate of the nucleophilic attack of methyl iodide on the rhodium (I) pincer complex, and also has a positive effect on the performance of the complex as catalyst in the cycloisomerization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid. These findings highlight the importance of supramolecular interactions for tuning the reactivity and catalytic activity of square planar metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by 8&#8208;Connected Quadrangular Prism Ligands for Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of rigid, highly connected organic linkers is critical for the reticular synthesis of functional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, highly&#8208;stable MOFs (e.g. Al/Cr/Zr&#8208;based MOFs) based on rigid ligands with more than 6 coordinating functions have been rarely achieved thus far. Herein, we describe the construction of two&#160;bcu Zr&#8208;based MOFs (named ZrMOF&#8208;1 and ZrMOF&#8208;2) from peripherally extended pentiptycene ligands (H8PEP&#8208;1 and H8PEP&#8208;2) with rigid quadrangular prism shape possessing 8 carboxylic groups at the prism vertices. Particularly, ZrMOF&#8208;1 exhibits microporous structure with large Bruno&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface area and high water stability, endowing it a promising water harvesting material with a high water uptake capacity of 0.83 gH2O gMOF&#8208;1 at P/P0 = 0.90 and 25 &#176;C, a steep uptake at a low P/P0 of 0.30, and excellent durability over 500 water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Moreover, self&#8208;consistent charge density functional tight&#8208;binding calculations were carried out, rationalizing the water adsorbing process and amount in ZrMOF&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized a (1&#8208;propylpyridinium)2[ReN(CN)4]&#8208;type organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid exhibiting water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced drastic structural changes of the [ReN(CN)4]2&#8722; assemblies. Specifically, upon exposure to water vapor, dehydrated nitrido&#8208;bridged chains were converted to hydrated cyanido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear clusters via rearrangements of large molecular building units in the crystals. These switchable assembly forms display substantially different photo&#8208;physical properties, although in both cases the emission is caused by a metal&#8208;centered d&#8211;d transition. The nitrido&#8208;bridged chain exhibited a near&#8208;infrared (749 nm) emission, which blue&#8208;shifted as the temperature increased, while a visible (561 nm) emission and its red shift was demonstrated by the cyanido&#8208;bridged cluster.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation of Confinement&#8208;Free Neutral Group Three Transition Metal Carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM = Y, La)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spectroscopic characterization of neutral highly&#8208;coordinated compounds is essential in fundamental and applied research, but has been proven to be a challenging experimental target because of the difficulty in mass selection. Here, we report the preparation and size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet (IR&#8208;VUV) spectroscopic identification of group&#8208;3 transition metal carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM = Y, La) in the gas phase, which are the first confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl and octacarbonyl complexes. The results indicate that Sc(CO)7 has a C2v structure and TM(CO)8 (TM = Y, La) have a D4h structure. Theoretical calculations predict that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM = Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase. These highly&#8208;coordinated carbonyls are 17&#8208;electron complexes when only those valence electrons that occupy metal&#8211;CO bonding orbitals are considered, in which the ligand&#8208;only 4b1u molecular orbital is ignored. This work opens new avenues toward the design and chemical control of a large variety of compounds with unique structures and properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions or clusters and organic linkers. Typical MOFs are rather simple, comprising just one type of joint and linker. An additional degree of structural complexity can be introduced by using multiple different components that are assembled into the same framework In the early days of MOF chemistry, conventional wisdom held that attempting to prepare frameworks starting from such a broad set of components would lead to multiple different phases. However, this view was mistaken and the focus of this review is the deliberate design and synthesis of frameworks comprising multiple different components. When coupled to structural order and periodicity, the presence of multiple components leads to exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Anodic and cathodic platinum dissolution processes involve different oxide species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The degradation of Pt&#8208;containing oxygen reduction catalysts for fuel cell applications is strongly linked to the electrochemical surface oxidation and reduction of Pt. Here, we study the surface restructuring and Pt dissolution mechanisms during oxidation/reduction for the case of Pt(100) in 0.1 M HClO4&#160;by combined operando&#160;high&#8208;energy surface X&#8208;ray diffraction, online mass spectrometry, and density functional theory study. Our atomic&#8208;scale structural studies reveal that anodic dissolution, detected during oxidation, and cathodic dissolution, observed during the subsequent reduction, are linked to two different oxide phases. Anodic dissolution occurs predominantly during nucleation and growth of the first, stripe&#8208;like oxide. Cathodic dissolution is linked to a second, amorphous Pt oxide phase that resembles bulk PtO2&#160;and starts to grow when the coverage of the stripe&#8208;like oxide saturates. In addition, we find the amount of surface restructuring after an oxidation/reduction cycle to be potential&#8208;independent after the stripe&#8208;like oxide has reached its saturation coverage.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Desulfurative Transformations with Thioethers as Alkyl Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioethers are highly prevalent functional groups in organic compounds of natural and synthetic origin but remain remarkably underexplored as starting materials in desulfurative transformations. As such, new synthetic methods are highly desirable to unlock the potential of the compound class and electrochemistry is an ideal tool to enable new reactivity and selectivity under mild conditions. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient use of aryl alkyl thioethers as alkyl radical precursors in electroreductive transformations, along with mechanistic details. The transformations proceed with complete selectivity for C(sp3)&#8208;S bond cleavage, orthogonal to that of established transition metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron routes. We showcase a hydrodesulfurization protocol with broad functional group tolerance, the first example of desulfurative C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bond formation in Giese&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling and the first protocol for electrocarboxylation of synthetic relevance with thioethers as starting materials. Finally, the compound class is shown to outcompete their well&#8208;established sulfone analogues as alkyl radical precursors, demonstrating their synthetic potential for future desulfurative transformations in a one&#8208;electron manifold.</dc:description>
