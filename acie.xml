      <title>Integrating Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging Information by Single&#8208;Luminophore Dual Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>The fact that the lifetime of photoluminescence often is difficult to access because of&#160; the weakness of the emission signals, seriously limits the possibility to gain local bioimaging information in time&#8208;resolved luminescence probing. We herein aim to provide a solution to this problem by creating a general photophysical strategy based on the use of molecular probes designed for single&#8208;luminophore dual thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The structural and conformational design makes the dual TADF strong both in diluted solution and in aggregated state, enabling less sensitivity to oxygen quenching and a unique dual&#8208;channel time&#8208;resolved imaging capability. As the two TADF signals show mutual complementarity during probing, a dual&#8208;channel mean lifetime mapping is established to reduce the time&#8208;resolved&#160; imaging distortion by 30&#8208;40%. Consequently, the leading intracellular local imaging information is serialized and integrated as compared to any single time&#8208;resolved signal, leading to a significant improvement of the probing capacity.</dc:description>

      <title>DMSO Enabled Selective Radical O&#8208;H Activation of 1,3(4)&#8208;Diols</title>
      <dc:description>Selectivity control is one of the central topics in organic chemistry. Although the alkoxyl radical induced unprecedented transformations have drawn more attentions, compared to the booming selective C&#8208;H activation, the selective radical O&#8208;H activation remains less explored. Herein, we report a novel selective radical O&#8208;H activation strategy of diols by combining spatial effect with proton coupled electron transfer (PCET). The common molecule DMSO is found to be an essential reagent that enables the regioselective transformation of diols. Mechanistic studies indicated the existence of the alkoxyl radical and the selective interaction between DMSO and hydroxyls. Moreover, the distal C&#8208;C cleavage is realized by this selective alkoxyl radical initiation protocol.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic oxidation of CO on a curved Pt(111) surface: simultaneous ignition at all facets through a transient CO&#8208;O complex</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) on transition metals, such as platinum (Pt), is commonly viewed as a sharp transition from the CO&#8208;inhibited surface to the active metal, covered with oxygen (O). However, we find that minor amounts of O are present in the CO&#8208;poisoned layer that explain why, surprisingly, CO desorbs at stepped and flat Pt crystal planes at once, regardless of the reaction conditions. Using near&#8208;ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoemission and a curved Pt(111) crystal we probe the chemical composition at surfaces with variable step density during the CO oxidation reaction. The systematic analysis of carbon and oxygen core levels across the curved crystal reveals that, right before light&#8208;off, subsurface O builds up within (111) terraces. This is key to trigger the simultaneous ignition of the catalytic reaction at different Pt surfaces, as indicated by ab&#8208;initio theory: a CO&#8208;Pt&#8208;O complex is formed that equals the CO chemisorption energy at terraces and steps, leading to the abrupt desorption of poisoning CO from all crystal facets at the same temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Planar cyclopenten&#8208;4&#8208;yl cations &#8211; highly delocalized &#960; aromatics stabilized by hyperconjugation</title>
      <dc:description>Theoretical studies predicted the planar cyclopenten&#8208;4&#8208;yl cation to be a classical carbocation, and the highest&#8208;energy isomer of C5H7+. Hence, its existence has not been verified experimentally so far. We were now able to isolate two stable derivatives of the cyclopenten&#8208;4&#8208;yl cation by reaction of bulky alanes CpRAlBr2 with AlBr3. Elucidation of their (electronic) structures by X ray diffraction and quantum chemistry studies revealed planar geometries and strong hyperconjugation interactions primarily from the C&#8208;Al &#963; bonds to the empty p orbital of the cationic sp2 carbon center. A close inspection of the molecular orbitals (MOs) and of the anisotropy of current (induced) density (ACID), as well as the evaluation of various aromaticity descriptors indicated distinct aromaticity for these cyclopenten&#8208;4&#8208;yl derivatives, which strongly contrasts the classical description of this system. Here, strong delocalization of &#960; electrons spanning the whole carbocycle has been verified, thus providing rare examples of &#960; aromaticity involving saturated sp3 carbon atoms.</dc:description>

      <title>On&#8208;Demand Synthesis of H2O2 by Water Oxidation for Sustainable Resource&#160;Production and Organic Pollutant Degradation</title>
      <dc:description>H  2  O  2  is a versatile and environmentally friendly chemical involved in water treatment, such as advanced oxidation processes. Anthraquinone oxidation is widely used for large&#8208;scale production of H  2  O  2  , which requires significant energy input and periodic replacement of the carrier molecule. H  2  O  2  production method should be customized considering the specific usage scenario. Electrochemical synthesis of H  2  O  2  can be adopted as alternatives to traditional method, which avoids the concentration, transportation and storage processes. Herein, we identified Bi  2  WO  6  :Mo as a low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;selectivity choice from a series of Bi based oxide electrodes for H  2  O  2  generation via 2e&#8208;water oxidation reaction. It can continuously provide H  2  O  2  for  in situ  degradation of persistent pollutants in aqueous like Norfloxacin. Simultaneously, clean energy of H  2  can be produced at the cathode. This kind of water splitting producing sustainable resources H  2  O  2  and H  2  presents an advance in environmental treatment and energy science.</dc:description>

      <title>Identification of amino acid residues responsible for C&#8208;H activation in type&#8208;III copper enzymes by generating tyrosinase activity in a catechol oxidase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosinases (TYRs) catalyze the hydroxylation of phenols and the oxidation of the resulting  o  &#8208;diphenols to  o  &#8208;quinones, while catechol oxidases (COs) exhibit only the latter activity. Aurone synthase (AUS) is not able to react with classical tyrosinase substrates like tyramine and  L  &#8208;tyrosine, while it can hydroxylate its natural substrate isoliquiritigenin. The structural difference of TYRs, COs and AUS at the base of their divergent catalytic activities is still a puzzle. Therefore, a library of 39 mutants of AUS from  Coreopsis grandiflora  (  Cg  AUS) was generated and the activity studies proved that the reactivity of the three conserved histidines (HisA  2  , HisB  1  and HisB  2  ) is tuned by their adjacent residues (HisB  1  +1, HisB  2  +1 and waterkeeper residue) either to react as stronger bases or / and to stabilize a position permissive for substrate proton shuffling. In the newly proposed monophenolase reaction cycle the deprotonation of the incoming monophenolic substrate  en route  to the active  oxy&#8208;  site is supported by one of the three conserved histidines HisA  2  , HisB  1  and HisB  2  , initiating the C&#8208;H activation in TYRs in contrast to COs. In particular, we present mutants with a TYR activity of the same order of magnitude as found in natural plant TYRs, which is a strong indication that the molecular basis of TYR against CO activity has been revealed. This provides the understanding for C&#8208;H activation based on the type&#8208;III copper center to be used in future biotechnological processes.</dc:description>

      <title>Tillandsia&#8208;inspired Hygroscopic Photothermal Organogels for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
      <dc:description>Tillandsia species with degenerated roots have evolved into hygroscopic leaves that absorb moisture from air, transport water molecules from the leaves surface to internal network via osmotic pressure and further hold them for sustainable growing requirements. This interesting biological adaptability has inspired us to develop an integrated hygroscopic photothermal organogel (POG) to achieve a solar&#8208;powered atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). The well&#8208;designed hydrophilic co&#8208;polymeric skeleton is fabricated to accommodate hygroscopic glycerin medium, which enables the POG self&#8208;contained property, mechanically flexibility and synergistic enhancement of moisture sorption. Moreover, the glycerin in the POG allows a rapid water diffusion driven by osmotic effect, thereby quickly reactivating the sorption binding sites for continuous and high&#8208;capacity moisture sorption. In addition, the integration of interpenetrated photothermal component of poly&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;dopamine (P&#8208;Py&#8208;DA) can endow the POG an efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal property for controllable solar&#8208;driven interfacial water releasing. As a result, the integrated POG presents the superhigh equilibrium moisture sorption of 16.01 kg m &#8208;2  at the RH of 90%, and daily water production as high as 2.43 kg m &#8208;2  day &#8208;1  is achieved in actual outdoor experiments.

      <title>On&#8208;resin Preparation of Allenamidyl Peptides: a Versatile Chemoselective Conjugation and Intramolecular Cyclisation Tool</title>
      <dc:description>The ability to modify peptides and proteins chemoselectively is of continued interest in medicinal chemistry, with peptide conjugation, lipidation, stapling and disulfide engineering at the forefront of modern peptide chemistry. Herein we report a robust method for the on&#8208;resin preparation of allenamide&#8208;modified peptides, an unexplored functionality for peptides that provides a versatile chemical tool for chemoselective inter&#8208; or intramolecular bridging reactions with thiols. The bridging reaction is biocompatible, occurring spontaneously at pH 7.4 in catalyst free aqueous media. Employing this &#8220;click&#8221; approach, a model peptide was successfully modified with a diverse range of alkyl and aryl thiols with excellent conversions. Furthermore, this technique was demonstrated as a valuable tool to induce spontaneous intramolecular cyclisation by preparation of an oxytocin analogue where the native disulfide bridge was replaced by a vinyl sulfide moiety that in turn was formed via thia&#8208;Michael addition of a cysteine thiol to the allenamide handle.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing CO2 Reduction Pathways in Copper Catalysts using Ionic Liquid as a Chemical Trapping Agent</title>
      <dc:description>The key to fully leveraging the potential of electrochemical CO2  reduction reaction (CO2RR) to achieve a sustainable solar power&#8208;based economy is the development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. The development process relies heavily on trial and error methods due to poor mechanistic understanding of the reaction. Here we demonstrate that ionic liquids (ILs) can be employed as a chemical trapping agent to probe CO2RR mechanistic pathways. This method is implemented by introducing a small amount of IL ([BMIm][NTf2]) to a copper foam catalyst, on which a wide range of CO2RR products, including formate, CO, alcohols, and hydrocarbons, can be produced. IL can selectively suppress the formation of ethylene, ethanol and n&#8208;propanol while having little impact on others. Thus reaction networks leading to various products can be disentangled. The results shed new light on the mechanistic understanding of the CO2RR, and provide guidelines for modulating CO2RR properties. Chemical trapping using IL adds to the toolbox to deduce mechanistic understanding of electrocatalysis and could be applied to other reactions as well.</dc:description>

      <title>General synthesis of single&#8208;atom catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions and room&#8208;temperature Na&#8208;S batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been successfully used for various electrochemical reactions. The synthetic methods for different single metal atoms are specific, however; it is extremely challenging to develop a universal synthesis method for a large range of single&#8208;atom metals. Herein, we report a comprehensive strategy to synthesize a full range of single&#8208;atom metals on carbon matrix, including vanadium (V1), manganese (Mn1), iron (Fe1), cobalt (Co1), nickel (Ni1), copper (Cu1), germanium (Ge1), molybdenum (Mo1), ruthenium (Ru1), rhodium (Rh1), palladium (Pd1), silver (Ag1), indium (In1), tin (Sn1), tungsten (W1), iridium (Ir1), platinum (Pt1), lead (Pb1), and bismuth (Bi1). The extensive applications of various SACs are manifested via their ability to electro&#8208;catalyze typical hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and conversion reactions in novel room&#8208;temperature sodium sulfur batteries (RT&#8208;Na&#8208;S). The enhanced performances for these electrochemical reactions stem from the ability of different single active atoms on local structures to tune their electronic configuration. Significantly, the electrocatalytic behaviors of diverse SACs, assisted by density functional theory calculations, are systematically revealed by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and in&#8208;situ transmission electronic microscopy, providing a strategic library for the general synthesis and extensive applications of SACs in energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

      <title>Cocrystallization Tailoring Multiple Radiative Decay Pathways for Amplified Spontaneous Emission</title>
      <dc:description>Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) is intrinsically associated with lasing applications. Inefficient photon energy transfer to ASE is a long&#8208;standing issue for organic semiconductors that consist of multiple competing radiative decay pathways, far from being rationally regulated from the perspective of molecular arrangements. Herein, we achieve controllable molecular packing motifs by halogen&#8208;bonded cocrystallization, leading to ten times increased radiative decay rate, four times larger ASE radiative decay selectivity and thus remarkable ASE threshold decrease from 223 to 22 &#956;J/cm  2  albeit with a low photoluminescence quantum yield. We have made an in&#8208;depth investigation on the relationship between molecular arrangements, vibration modes, radiative decay profiles and ASE properties. The results suggest that cocrystallization presents a powerful approach to tailor the radiative decay pathways, which is fundamentally important to the development of organic ASE and lasing materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Trapping of Trace Acetylene from Ethylene in an Ultramicroporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework via Synergistic Effect of High&#8208;Density Open Metal Sites and Electronegative Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Acetylene removal from ethylene is a crucial step in the production of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene, but remains as a daunting challenge due to the similar physicochemical properties between acetylene and ethylene, and is currently met industrially by energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation processes. Herein, we report a robust ultramicroporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), Ni3(pzdc)2(7Hade)2 for efficient C2H2/C2H4 separation. Interestingly, this MOF is constructed by hydrogen&#8208;bonding linked one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chains, and features both high&#8208;density open metal sites (OMSs, 2.7 nm&#8208;3) and electronegative oxygen and nitrogen sites arranged on the pore surface as cooperative binding sites. Notably, such cooperative binding sites rarely co&#8208;exist in other MOFs due to the strong coordination tendency between metal ions and electronegative or basic sites in organic linkers. Systematic studies by theoretical calculations as well as in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) experiments provide evidence for the synergistic adsorption mechanism. As expected, Ni3(pzdc)2(7Hade)2 with S&#8208;shaped 1D pore channels exhibits excellent trace C2H2 capture performance at 0.01 bar with a C2H2 uptake of 60.6 cm3 cm&#8208;3 and high C2H2/C2H4 selectivity, making it a promising material for trace C2H2 trapping from C2H2/C2H4 mixtures.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We here report the synthesis of a new tetraborylethylene (TBE) and its application in the preparation of [4+0]&#8208;tetraarylethenes (TAEs) that have widespread applications in material science and supramolecular chemistry due to their aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nature. The divergent and stereoselective synthesis of [3+1]&#8208;, [2+2]&#8208;, [2+1+1]&#8208;TAEs via multi&#8208;couplings of vinylboronates with aryl bromides were also demonstrated. These couplings feature broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility due to mild reaction conditions, providing facile access to various tetraarylethenes. This strategy represents an important complement to the conventional methods for the synthesis of TAEs, and would be a valuable tool for synthesizing TAE&#8208;based molecules used in functional material, biological imaging and chemical sensing.</dc:description>

      <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Polynorbornenes with Fixed and Controllable Spatial Alignment of Donor and Acceptor for High&#8208;Efficiency Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Through&#8208;space charge transfer polynorbornenes with fixed and controllable spatial alignment of donor and acceptor in edge&#8208;to&#8208;face/face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking patterns are developed for achieving high&#8208;efficiency blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The alignment is realized by two aspects of molecular engineering on stereo&#8208;configuration of polymer skeleton and topological architecture of donor, including (i) using  cis, exo&#8208;configuration of norbornene to confine donor and acceptor in close proximity with distance of 3.52&#8764;3.90 &#197;, and (ii) utilizing orthogonal and dendritic structures of donors to provide either perpendicular or parallel stacking motif relative to acceptors. Compared to edge&#8208;to&#8208;face counterparts, polynorbornenes with face&#8208;to&#8208;face aligned donor and acceptor exhibit much larger oscillator strength and higher photoluminescence quantum yield up to 81% in neat film owing to the enforced cofacial &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The resulting polymers exhibit deep blue (422 nm) to sky blue (482 nm) emission and TADF effect with reverse intersystem crossing rates of 0.4&#8764;5.9&#215;10  6  s  &#8722;1  , giving the maximum external quantum efficiency of 18.8% for non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes by solution process, which represents the best efficiency for blue TADF polymers so far.</dc:description>

      <title>The Power of Iodane&#8208;Guided C&#8722;H Coupling: A Group&#8208;Transfer Strategy in Which a Halogen Works for Its Money</title>
      <dc:description>
I of the tiger: The iodine atom in Ar&#8722;I bonds is commonly conceived as a leaving group. This Minireview discusses a powerful alternative reactivity of iodine substituents by which &#955;3&#8208;iodoarenes direct C&#8722;H coupling events at the corresponding aromatic ring.







Abstract
Hypervalent organoiodane reagents are ubiquitous in organic synthesis, both as oxidants and as electrophilic group&#8208;transfer agents. In addition to these hallmark applications, a complementary strategy is gaining momentum that exploits the ability of &#955;3&#8208;iodanes to undergo iodine&#8208;to&#8208;arene group transfer, for example, via iodonio&#8208;Claisen&#8208;type rearrangement processes. This Minireview discusses recent advances in the use of this method to access a variety of the C&#8722;H&#8208;functionalized iodoarenes. While Section&#8197;2 is focused on the ortho C&#8722;H propargylation, allylation, and the more unusual para C&#8722;H benzylation, Section&#8197;3 is devoted to the C&#8208;arylation of enol and phenol substrates. The accompanying discussion includes mechanistic considerations and goes into the synthetic applications of the final iodoarene cores. The Minireview concludes with further conceptual extensions of the method, including the use of non&#8208;conventional coupling partners (for example, cyanoalkylation), improved access to &#955;3&#8208;iodane building blocks, and the development of iterative approaches to polysubstituted iodoarenes.

      <title>N&#8208;bridged Acyclic Trimeric poly&#8208;Cyclodiphosphazanes: Highly Tuneable Building Blocks within the Cyclodiphosphazane Family</title>
      <dc:description>We have synthesized a complete new family of acyclic trimeric cyclodiphosphazanes compounds comprising NH, N  i  Pr, N  t  Bu and NPh bridging groups. In addition, the first NH&#8208;bridged acyclic dimeric cyclophosphazane has been also produced. The trimeric species display highly tuneable characteristics whereby the distance between the terminal N(H)R moieties can be readily modulated by the steric bulk present in the bridging groups (ranging from ~6 to ~10 &#197;). Moreover, these species exhibit pronounced topological changes when a weak non&#8208;bonding NH&#8943;&#960; aryl interaction is introduced. Finally, the NH&#8208;bridged chloride binding affinities have been calculated and benchmarked along with the existing experimental data available for monomeric cyclodiphosphazanes.

      <dc:description>A straightforward alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated protocol for hydroamination of styrenes using biorenewable 2&#8209;methyltetrahydrofuran as a solvent is reported. Refuting the conventional wisdom of the incompatibility of organolithium reagents with air and moisture, we show that the presence of moisture is key in favouring formation of the target phenethylamines over competing olefin polymerisation products.

      <title>Selective loading of atomic Pt on a RuCeOx support enables stable hydrogen evolution at high current densities</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have an important role to play in the development of renewable energy. Despite the enormous efforts to find cheaper alternative materials, platinum remains the most efficient known HER electrocatalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to maximize Pt utilization in actual practical applications. Here we demonstrate a facile strategy for synthesizing RuCeO  x  &#8208;supported selectively loaded atomic Pt (0.49 wt.%) (denoted Pt/RuCeO  x  &#8208;PA) by photoactivation at ambient temperature and pressure. Due to the photoelectron transfer at the Mott&#8211;Schottky heterojunction in RuCeO  x  , Pt atoms became directionally embedded into the RuO  2  lattice. The resulting selectively loaded Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ru moieties in Pt/RuCeO  x  &#8208;PA exhibit a stronger hydrogen spillover effect than Pt complexes randomly loaded by either chemical activation or thermal activation. As a result, Pt/RuCeO  x  &#8208;PA shows superior HER performance to the materials prepared by random loading and is even better than a commercial Pt/C catalyst with much higher Pt loading (20 wt.%) at high current densities (from 50&#8211;600 mA cm  &#8211;2  ). The selective loading strategy employed in our work not only provides an effective approach for constructing controllable active sites in HER catalysts but should also be applicable in the fabrication of other atomic catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Trifunctional soluble redox mediator enabled high&#8208;capacity and stable Li&#8208;O2 batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Li&#8208;O  2  batteries with ultrahigh theoretical energy densities usually suffer from low practical discharge capacities and inferior cycling stability owing to the cathode passivation caused by insulating discharge products and by&#8208;products. Here, we firstly introduce a new kind of trifunctional ether&#8208;based redox mediator, 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dimethoxybenzene (DBDMB), into the electrolyte to capture the reactive O  2  &#8208;  and alleviate the rigorous oxidative environment during cycling of Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. Thanks to the strong solvation of DBDMB towards Li  +  and O  2  &#8208;  , it can not only reduce the formation of by&#8208;products (a high Li  2  O  2  yield of 96.6%), but also promote the solution growth of large&#8208;sized Li  2  O  2  particles, avoiding the passivation of cathode as well as enabling a large discharge capacity. More encouragingly, DBDMB makes the oxidization of Li  2  O  2  and the decomposition of main by&#8208;products (Li  2  CO  3  and LiOH) proceed in a highly effective manner, prolonging the stability of Li&#8208;O  2  batteries (243 cycles at 1000 mAh g  &#8208;1  and 1000 mA g  &#8208;1  ). DFT calculations also unravel the intrinsic functional mechanism of DBDMB for facilitating the reversible O  2  involved redox reactions. Our strategy of using trifunctional electrolyte additive to capture reactive discharge intermediates with reduced formation of by&#8208;products, regulate solution growth of Li  2  O  2  , and co&#8208;oxidize Li  2  O  2  and by&#8208;products, will open up a new avenue to promote the performance of Li&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>The Cupin Protein Pac13 is Suggested by the Data to Be a Homodimer</title>
      <dc:description>
Seeing double: Cupin proteins form one of the largest protein superfamilies and usually exist in homooligomeric states. Goss and co&#8208;workers recently reported that the cupin protein Pac13, which is a dehydratase that mediates the formation of the 3&#8242;&#8208;deoxy nucleoside of pacidamycins, is an unusual small monomer.

Abstract
Cupin proteins share a double&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;helix fold, form one of the largest protein superfamilies, and possess remarkable functional diversity. They usually exist in homooligomeric states. Goss and co&#8208;workers recently reported that the cupin protein Pac13, which is a dehydratase that mediates the formation of the 3&#8242;&#8208;deoxy nucleoside of pacidamycins, is an unusual small monomer. However, a careful analysis of the biophysical and structural data provided by the authors suggests that Pac13 is in fact a homodimer, similar to many other cupin proteins.

      <title>From  Glucose to Polymers&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;A Continuous Chemoenzymatic Process</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:    Aiming for sustainable development, the syntheses of degradable polymers from renewable resources are highly encouraging. Unfortunately, such efforts are deterred by technical and economic challenges; especially, the conversion of natural building blocks to polymerizable monomers is inefficient, requiring multistep synthesis and chromatographic purification. Herein we report a chemoenzymatic process to address these challenges. In this work, a novel enzymatic reaction system was designed, which allowed for regioselective functional group transformation efficiently, converting glucose to a polymerizable monomer in quantitative yield, thus removing the need for chromatographic purification. With this key success, we further designed a continuous, 3&#8208;step process, which enabled the synthesis of a sugar polymer [sugar poly(orthoester)] directly from glucose in high yield (73% from glucose). The work reported here may provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in developing technically and economically viable approaches to address the many issues associated with current petroleum&#8208;based polymers.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Emulating the function of natural carboxylases to convert CO2 under atmospheric condition is a grand challenge. Here we report a class of CO2&#8208;folded single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) that can function as recyclable, function&#8208;intensified carboxylase mimics. Using Lewis pair polymer containing bulky Lewis acidic and basic groups as the precursor, it can bind CO2 to drive an intramolecular folding into SCNP, in which CO2 as the folded nodes can form gas&#8208;bridged bonds. Such bridging linkages highly activate CO2, which endows the SCNPs with extraordinary catalytic ability that can not only catalyze CO2&#8208;insertion of C(sp3)&#9472;H for imitating natural enzyme's function, and also act on non&#8208;natural carboxylation pathways for C(sp2 and sp)&#9472;H substrates. The nanocatalysts are of highly catalytic efficiency and recyclability, and can work at room temperature and near ambient CO2 condition, inspiring a new vista on sustainable C1 utilization.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Functionalization via Chiral Transient Directing Group Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of C&#8211;H bond, the most abundant functionality in organic molecules, has emerged as an expedient synthetic approach to streamline the synthesis of complex chiral molecules. Despite significant progress, traditional directing group&#8208;enabled strategy requires additional steps for the installation and removal of directing groups from the target molecule. The recent developed asymmetric C&#8211;H functionalization using chiral transient directing groups (  c  TDGs) offers a promising alternative that can circumvent this obstacle and therefore simplify the process. In this minireview, we briefly discuss the advent and recent advances of this emerging concept, with an emphasis on discussing the creation of various stereogenic centers and the developments of  c  TDGs. Applications in natural product synthesis and ligand derivatizations are also discussed.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of C&#8211;H bond, the most abundant functionality in organic molecules, has emerged as an expedient synthetic approach to streamline the synthesis of complex chiral molecules. Despite significant progress, traditional directing group&#8208;enabled strategy requires additional steps for the installation and removal of directing groups from the target molecule. The recent developed asymmetric C&#8211;H functionalization using chiral transient directing groups (  c  TDGs) offers a promising alternative that can circumvent this obstacle and therefore simplify the process. In this minireview, we briefly discuss the advent and recent advances of this emerging concept, with an emphasis on discussing the creation of various stereogenic centers and the developments of  c  TDGs. Applications in natural product synthesis and ligand derivatizations are also discussed. We hope this minireview will highlight the great potential of this strategy and help to inspire further endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>
Non&#8208;ionic polysubstituted azopyrimidines with strong push&#8211;pull character are promising candidates for extremely fast photochromic oscillators. The fast oscillation is based on photoinduced (E)&#8208;to&#8208;(Z) isomerization of the azo group and the accordingly very fast (Z)&#8208;to&#8208;(E) thermal relaxation. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202007065), E. Proch&#225;zkov&#225;, M. Cig&#225;&#328; et&#8197;al. demonstrate how the relaxation lifetime can be tuned by proper substitution over 8 orders of magnitude from hundreds of milliseconds to several nanoseconds.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Biomolecule&#8208;Based Hydrogels and Their Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Having control: Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with triggered stiffness properties are attracting growing interest as smart materials for different applications. The Review discusses the design of biomolecule&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels and their applications as self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;memory, and controlled drug&#8208;release matrices, as well as mechanical actuators. Surface&#8208;confined switchable hydrogels and their uses are also introduced.







Abstract
This Review presents polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, nucleic acids, peptides, and proteins as functional stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer scaffolds that yield hydrogels with controlled stiffness. Different physical or chemical triggers can be used to structurally reconfigure the crosslinking units and control the stiffness of the hydrogels. The integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular complexes and stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecular units as crosslinkers leads to hybrid hydrogels undergoing reversible triggered transitions across different stiffness states. Different applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogels are discussed. The assembly of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogel films on surfaces and their applications are discussed. The coating of drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles with stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels for controlled drug release is also presented.

      <title>Reversible Luminescent Switching in an Organic Cocrystal: Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Phase Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>
The crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformation of organic cocrystals under multiple external stimuli, such as solvent vapor and heating, accompanied by reversible luminescent switching, is demonstrated by B. Xu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002220). The results indicate that the luminescence switching originates from the unique molecular rearrangement of a hydrogen/halogen bond&#8208;directed stack to a &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction&#8208;directed stack in response to an external stimulus.

      <title>PI by NMR: Probing CH&#8211;&#960; Interactions in Protein&#8211;Ligand Complexes by NMR Spectroscopy</title>

The CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between the CH donor groups of Trp81&#8208;&#950; and Trp81&#8208;&#951; with the aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems of ligand 3 (stylized in blue and green, respectively) are illustrated in the cover picture. The backdrop shows a NMR chemical shift scale into which the Trp81 CH cross peaks are schematically drawn. In the complexed form the CH groups are shifted by up to 2.3&#8197;ppm as they are shielded by the aromatic ring systems of the ligand. As explained by G. Platzer, M. Mayer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003732), these upfield shifts are indicative of favorable CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, which are difficult to detect directly in solution by other methods.

&lt;p&gt;Solar eBiorefinery: Inspired by natural photosynthesis, biocatalytic photoelectrochemical (PEC) platforms are gaining prominence for the conversion of solar energy into useful chemicals by combining redox biocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. Deliberate integration of&#160;PEC&#160;systems with redox biocatalytic reactions can simultaneously produce valuable chemicals on both electrodes using solar&#8208;powered electrons and water. C.&#8197;B. Park et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Communication (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200689310.1002/anie.202006893&lt;/a&gt;) how this study offers a new direction for solar biotransformation toward eBiorefinery for sustainable synthesis of fine chemicals.

      <title>Smart magnetofluorogenic photosensitizer nanoassemblies enabling redox&#8208;driven disassembly for photodynamic therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive smart photosensitizer (PS) nanoassemblies that allow enhanced delivery and controllable release of PSs are promising for imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors. However, the lack of high&#8208;sensitivity and spatial&#8208;resolution signals and fast washout of released PSs from tumor tissues have impeded PDT efficacy in vivo. Herein, we report tumor targeting and redox&#8208;responsive megnetofluorogenic PS nanoasssemblies (  NP&#8208;RGD  ) via self&#8208;assembly of a cRGD&#8208; and disulfide&#8208;containing fluorogenic and paramagnetic small molecule (  1&#8208;RGD  ) for fluorescence/magnetic resonance bimodality imaging&#8208;guided tumor PDT.  NP&#8208;RGD  show high  r  1  relaxivity but quenched fluorescence and PDT activity; disulfide reduction by glutathione (GSH) promotes efficient disassembly into small&#8208;molecule probe (  2&#8208;RGD  ) and organic PS (PPa&#8208;SH), which could further bind with intracellular albumin, allowing (1) prolonged retention and (2) cascade activation of fluorescence and PDT activity to ablate tumors. Findings demonstrate great potential of combining self&#8208;assembly and stimuli&#8208;responsive disassembly to design smart PSs for precise bimodality imaging&#8208;guided on&#8208;demand tumor PDT in vivo.</dc:description>

      <title>Size&#8208;dependent Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle by converting CO  2  into reusable chemicals is recognized as an attractive solution to mitigate rising concentrations of CO  2  in the atmosphere. Herein, we prepared Ni metal catalysts ranging in size from single atoms to over 100 nm and distributed them across N&#8208;doped carbon substrates obtained from converted zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF). Results show variance in CO  2  reduction performance with variance in Ni metal size. Ni single atoms demonstrate a superior Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO selectivity of ~97% at &#8722;0.8 V  vs.  RHE, while results for 4.1 nm Ni nanoparticles are slightly lower (~93%). Further increase the particle size to 37.2 nm in Ni allows the H  2  evolution reaction (HER) to compete with CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR), with a FE towards CO production decrease to &lt; 30% and HER efficiency increase to &gt; 70%. These results uncover a size&#8208;dependent tendency towards CO  2  reduction for various sizes of Ni metal catalysts. The successful demonstration of metal size effects towards CO  2  RR resulting from this study will not only benefit renewable utilization for CO  2  , but also guide the future design of size&#8208;controlled electrocatalysts for efficient conversion of CO  2  into more useful chemicals.</dc:description>

      <title>Replacement of the Cobalt&#8208;Center of Vitamin B12 by Nickel &#8208; 

Nibalamin and Nibyric Acid Prepared from Metal&#8208;Free B12&#8208;Ligands Hydrogenobalamin and Hydrogenobyric Acid</title>
      <dc:description>The (formal) replacement of the cobalt&#8208;centre in cobalamin (Cbl) by a Ni(II) generates nibalamin (Nibl), a new type of transition metal analogue of vitamin B12. Here, we describe Nibl, synthesized by incorporation of a Ni(II)&#8208;ion into the complete metal&#8208;free B12&#8208;ligand hydrogenobalamin (Hbl), which was prepared from hydrogenobyric acid (Hby). The related Ni(II)&#8208;corrin nibyric acid (Niby) was similarly synthesized from Hby, the metal&#8208;free cobyric acid ligand. The solution structures of Hbl, as well as of the Ni&#8208;corrins Niby and Nibl, were characterized by detailed spectroscopic studies that included heteronuclear NMR. The metal&#8208;free corrin Hbl featured two inner protons bound at N2 and at N4 of the corrin ligand, as discovered in Hby. An X&#8208;ray analysis of single crystals of Niby provided detailed insights into both the structural adaptation of the natural corrin ligand to Ni(II)&#8208;ions and the coordination behavior of Ni(II) when corrin&#8208;bound. The diamagnetic d8&#8208;metal corrins Niby and Nibl, and corresponding iso&#8208;electronic Co(I)&#8208;corrins, were deduced to be closely iso&#8208;structural from DFT&#8208;calculated models. Nibl represents a specific new structural mimic of 4&#8208;coordinate base&#8208;off Cbls, a conclusion verified by its ability to act as a strong inhibitor of the bacterial adenosyltransferase (BtuR), which mediates its reaction through such an intermediate.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Developing non&#8208;cationic gene carrier and achieving efficient endo/lysosome escape of functional nucleic acids in cytosol are two major challenges faced by the field of gene delivery. Herein, we demonstrate a concept of self&#8208;escape spherical nucleic acid (SNA) to achieve light controlled non&#8208;cationic gene delivery with sufficient endo/lysosome escape capacity. In this system, Bcl&#8208;2 antisense oligonucleotides (OSAs) were conjugated onto the surface of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS) nanoparticles to form core&#8208;shell SNAs. Once the SNAs were uptaken by tumor cells, upon light irradiation, the accumulative  1  O  2  produced by AIE PSs could rupture the lysosome structure to promote OSA escape. Prominent in vitro and in vivo results validated that the AIE based core&#8208;shell SNAs could remarkably downregulate the anti&#8208;apoptosis protein (Bcl&#8208;2) and induce tumor cell apoptosis without any transfection reagent.</dc:description>

      <title>Molten Salt Assisted Synthesis of Bismuth Nanosheets for Long&#8208;term Continuously Electrocatalytic Conversion CO2 to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monometallic pnictogens (antimony or Sb, and bismuth or Bi) nanosheets, thanks to their unique physical&#8208;chemical, electronic and optical properties, show great potential for applications in a variety of fields including quantum devices, catalysis, biomedical, and energy, while the development of general and high&#8208;efficiency route for preparation of high&#8208;quality pnictogens nanosheets remains a challenge yet. In this work, we report a general method for the synthesis of Sb and Bi nanosheets in high yields (&gt; 90%), which is implemented by molten salts&#8208;assisted aluminothermic reduction process. The electrocatalytic properties toward CO  2  reduction are systematically studied on bismuth nanosheets, which shows high catalytic selectively to reduce CO  2  to formate with a considerable current density at a low overpotential, and holds quite impressive stability over one&#8208;month catalysis operation. The theory calculations suggest that the edge sites of Bi are far more active than terrace sites based on its lowest thermodynamic barrier. We further demonstrate the Bi nanosheets hold the ultrahigh catalytic stability for continuously conversion of CO  2  into formate with a yield rate of 787.5 mmol cm  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  in a flow cell upon one&#8208;month running. The present study shed light on a promising route to facilely prepare monometallic nanosheets and a system&#8208;engineering strategy for sustainable conversion of CO  2  into valuable chemicals by virtue of the highly desirable catalytic selectivity and stability of Bi nanosheets.</dc:description>

      <title>Butadienyl Diiron Complexes: Nonplanar Metalla&#8208;Aromatics Involving &#963;&#8208;Type Orbital Overlap</title>
      <dc:description>A new class of nonplanar metalla&#8208;aromatics, diiron complexes  2  bridged by a 1,3&#8208;butadienyl dianionic ligand were synthesized in high yields from dilithio reagents and two equivalents of FeBr  2  . Complexes  2  consist of two antiferromagnetically coupled high&#8208;spin Fe(II) centers as revealed by magnetometry, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Furthermore, experimental (X&#8208;ray structural analysis) and theoretical analyses (NICS, ICSS, AICD, MOs) suggest that  2  is aromatic. Remarkably, such nonplanar metalla&#8208;aromaticity is achieved by an uncommon &#963;&#8208;type overlap between the ligand p and metal d orbitals, in sharp contrast to the intensively studied planar aromatic systems featuring delocalized &#960;&#8208;type bonding. Specifically, the &#963;&#8208;type interaction between the two Fe 3d  xz  orbitals and the butadienyl &#960; orbital results in the formation of a six&#8208;electron conjugated system and hence endows the aromatic character to  2  .</dc:description>

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu Clusters via a Double&#8208;Confinement Enables Selective Reduction of Carbon Dioxide towards Methane</title>
      <dc:description>Previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations have fully proven that the sub&#8208;nanometric Cu clusters (i.e., 13 atoms) are more favorable for the generation of CH  4  from CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) than larger nanoparticles (NPs) due to the upshifted d center. However, it still lacks direct experimental evidence and remains unclear. Herein, we developed a facile impregnation&#8208;calcination route for the crafting of Cu clusters in diameter of ~1.0 nm with ~10 atoms via a double&#8208;confinement of carbon defects and micropores. The obtained Cu clusters enable a high selectivity for the CO  2  RR with a maximum Faraday efficiency of 81.7% towards CH  4  . Both DFT calculations and experimental results reveal that the Cu clusters can enhance the adsorption strength of *H and *CO intermediates and thus promotes the generation of CH  4  other than H  2  and CO, compared with larger Cu nanoparticles (~19 nm). Moreover, the strong interaction between Cu clusters and defective carbon optimizes the electronic structures of Cu clusters for further enhancing the selectivity and stability towards generation of CH  4  . Clearly, this work provides the first experimental evidence that the sub&#8208;nanometric Cu clusters indeed facilitate the production of CH  4  from CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

      <title>Responsive Photonic Liquid Marbles</title>
      <dc:description>Liquid marbles have potential to serve as mini&#8208;reactors for fabricating new materials. While this was realized soon after their discovery, the opportunity has been exploited little and mostly for &#8220;conventional&#8221; chemical reactions. Here, we uncover the unparalleled capability of liquid marbles to act as platforms for precisely controlling the self&#8208;assembly of a bio&#8208;derived polymer, hydroxypropyl cellulose, into a cholesteric liquid crystalline phase showing structural coloration by Bragg reflection. By adjusting the cholesteric pitch via quantitative water extraction, we achieve liquid marbles that we can tailor for structural color anywhere in the visible. Liquid marbles respond with color change that can be detected by eye, to changes in temperature, exposure to toxic chemicals and mechanical deformation. Our concept demonstrates the advantages of using liquid marbles as a miniature platform for precisely controlling the liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly of bio&#8208;derived polymers, and their exploitation to fabricate sustainable, responsive soft photonic objects.</dc:description>
