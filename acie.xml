         <title>Aggregative Luminescence from CsPbBr&#8323; Perovskite Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the properties of the precursor can provide deeper insight into the crystallization and nucleation mechanisms of perovskites, which is vital for the solution&#8208;process device performance. In this work, we conducted a detailed investigation into the photophysics properties of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr&#8323;) precursors in a broad concentration and various solvents. The precursor gradually transformed from the solution state into the colloidal state and exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) character as the concentration increased. The aggregative luminescence from the precursors originates from the polybromide plumbous that is formed through the coordination of solvent molecules to the lead metal center. Two adducts with monodentate (PbBr&#8322;&#8901;solvent) and bidentate (PbB&#8322;&#8901;2solvent) ligands can be obtained based on the coordination capability, accompanied by a red and green emission with photoluminescence peak at 610 and 565 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the aggregative luminescence intensity and color could be regulated by changing the solvent and precursor ratio. Besides, we discussed the difference between the molecular aggregate in the organic system and the ionic aggregate in the inorganic system. The fluorescence that is sensitive to Pb&#178;&#8314; coordination reported here could be applied to screen perovskite additives and judge the precursor aging.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Complex&#8208;Templated Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry for the Selection and Identification of Homo&#8208;PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry meets PROTAC screening: Stability of ternary complexes formed by PROTACs is shown to act as selection criterion in multi&#8208;protein templated dynamic combinatorial libraries. Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry allows rapid identification of novel VHL&#8208;targeting Homo&#8208;PROTACs from complex library mixtures.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) leverages a reversible reaction to generate compound libraries from constituting building blocks under thermodynamic control. The position of this equilibrium can be biased by addition of a target macromolecule towards enrichment of bound ligands. While DCC has been applied to select ligands for a single target protein, its application to identifying chimeric molecules inducing proximity between two proteins is unprecedented. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we develop a DCC approach to select bifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) based on their ability to stabilize the ternary complex. We focus on VHL&#8208;targeting Homo&#8208;PROTACs as model system, and show that the formation of a VHL2&#8201;:&#8201;Homo&#8208;PROTAC ternary complex reversibly assembled using thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry leads to amplification of potent VHL Homo&#8208;PROTACs with degradation activities which correlated well with their biophysical ability to dimerize VHL. Ternary complex templated dynamic combinatorial libraries allowed identification of novel Homo&#8208;PROTAC degraders. We anticipate future applications of ternary&#8208;complex directed DCC to early PROTAC screenings and expansion to other proximity&#8208;inducing modalities beyond PROTACs.

         <title>A Dicopper(II)&#8208;Based Carbonic Anhydrase Model&#8212;Quantum&#8208;Chemical Evaluation of the Mechanistic Pathway</title>

         <dc:description>
Prochloron didemni, an obligate symbiont of ascidians produces large amounts of patellamides, known to form dinuclear copper(II) complexes, which are efficient carbonic anhydrases. However, at the pH in the ascidians, catalysis is shown to be product&#8208;inhibited. All data available support the hypothesis that the function of the patellamides is to transport carbonate from the ascidian to the photosynthetically active symbiont Prochloron.







Abstract
The cyanobacterium Prochloron didemni, an obligate symbiont of different species of colonial ascidians, occurring in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, produces a variety of cyclic peptides. These patellamide&#8208;type macrocycles lead to relatively stable dicopper(II) complexes that are extremely efficient carbonic anhydrase mimics, the most active model systems known so far. Importantly, it recently was shown that copper(II) is coordinated to patellamide derivatives in Prochloron cells. An interesting question therefore is, whether the biological function of patellamide&#8208;type macrocycles is related to the catalytic activity in CO2 hydration or its reverse. Here, we present a computational study to evaluate the energetics of the catalytic cycle in search of a possible answer to these questions and compare the computed energy barriers with the experimental kinetic data. It emerges that release of the bridging carbonate is a critical step and that the catalysis product inhibits catalysis at pH values above approx.&#8197;7. Therefore, carbonate transport rather than CO2 hydrolysis is proposed as the biological function of copper(II)&#8208;patellamide complexes in the Prochloron&#8208;Ascidian symbiosis.

         <title>Engineering of Halide Methyltransferase BxHMT through Dynamic Cross&#8208;Correlation Network Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine assumes a crucial role in biocatalytic alkylation. To improve the catalytic ability of BxHMT towards methyl toluene sulfonate, a strategy named dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) was proposed for the identification of potential mutation sites, both distal and proximal. Experimental results proved the efficiency of the approach, which is expected to be a useful tool for other enzyme engineering studies.







Abstract
Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) provide an effective way to regenerate S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine and reactive electrophiles, such as methyl iodide (MeI) and methyl toluene sulfonate (MeOTs). As compared with MeI, the cost&#8208;effective unnatural substrate MeOTs can be accessed directly from cheap and abundant alcohols, but shows only limited reactivity in SAM production. In this study, we developed a dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) strategy for quickly identifying hot spots influencing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, and applied it to the evolution of HMT from Paraburkholderia xenovorans. Finally, the optimal mutant, M4 (V55T/C125S/L127T/L129P), exhibited remarkable improvement, with a specific activity of 4.08&#8197;U/mg towards MeOTs, representing an 82&#8208;fold increase as compared to the wild&#8208;type (WT) enzyme. Notably, M4 also demonstrated a positive impact on the catalytic ability with other methyl donors. The structural mechanism behind the enhanced enzyme activity was uncovered by molecular dynamics simulations. Our work not only contributes a promising biocatalyst for the regeneration of SAM, but also offers a strategy for efficient enzyme engineering.

         <title>Stabilization of Pd0 by Cu Alloying: Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Pd3Cu Electrocatalyst for Anodic Methanol Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the anodic electrocarbonylation of methanol to produce DMC, our theoretical studies suggest Cu&#8722;Pd alloy not only stabilizes Pd0, the true active site, but also reduces the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. The theoretically predicted Pd3Cu, synthesized by a two&#8208;step thermal shock method, achieves FEDMC of 93&#8201;%@1.0&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, far surpassing existing Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbonylation of CO and CH3OH to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) on metallic palladium (Pd) electrode offers a promising strategy for C1 valorization at the anode. However, its broader application is limited by the high working potential and the low DMC selectivity accompanied with severe methanol self&#8208;oxidation. Herein, our theoretical analysis of the intermediate adsorption interactions on both Pd0 and Pd4+ surfaces revealed that inevitable reconstruction of Pd surface under strongly oxidative potential diminishes its CO adsorption capacity, thus damaging the DMC formation.

&lt;p&gt;Here, the anodic electrocarbonylation of methanol to produce DMC, our theoretical studies suggest Cu&#8722;Pd alloy not only stabilizes Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, the true active site, but also reduces the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. The theoretically predicted Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu, synthesized by a two-step thermal shock method, achieves FE&lt;sub&gt;DMC&lt;/sub&gt; of 93&#8201;%@1.0&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, far surpassing existing Pd-based electrocatalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic carbonylation of CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) on metallic palladium (Pd) electrode offers a promising strategy for C1 valorization at the anode. However, its broader application is limited by the high working potential and the low DMC selectivity accompanied with severe methanol self-oxidation. Herein, our theoretical analysis of the intermediate adsorption interactions on both Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and Pd&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; surfaces revealed that inevitable reconstruction of Pd surface under strongly oxidative potential diminishes its CO adsorption capacity, thus damaging the DMC formation. Further theoretical modeling indicates that doping Pd with Cu not only stabilizes low-valence Pd in oxidative environments but also lowers the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. Guided by this insight, we developed a facile two-step thermal shock method to prepare PdCu alloy electrocatalysts for DMC. Remarkably, the predicted Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu demonstrated the highest DMC selectivity among existing Pd-based electrocatalysts, reaching a peaked DMC selectivity of 93&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. (Quasi) &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; spectra investigations further confirmed the predicted dual role of Cu dopant in promoting Pd-catalyzed DMC formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Electron Delocalization of Redox&#8208;Active Porous Aromatic Framework for Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zn&#8722;K Hybrid Batteries with Air Self&#8208;Chargeability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first case of applying redox&#8208;active porous organic polymer for aqueous Zn&#8722;K hybrid batteries with air self&#8208;chargeability, presenting a redox chemistry with K+ as the charge carriers and regulates Zn&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to guide uniform Zn plating/stripping, thus showing the impressively electrochemical properties in bending, all&#8208;climate and air self&#8208;charging conditions.







Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries promise to integrate energy harvesting technology and battery systems, potentially overcoming a heavy reliance on energy and the spatiotemporal environment. However, the exploitation of multifunctional air self&#8208;charging battery systems using promising cathode materials and suitable charge carriers remains challenging. Herein, for the first time, we developed low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8722;K hybrid ion batteries (AZKHBs) using a fully conjugated hexaazanonaphthalene (HATN)&#8208;based porous aromatic framework as the cathode material, exhibiting redox chemistry using K+ as charge carriers, and regulating Zn&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to guide uniform Zn plating/stripping. The unique AZKHBs exhibit the exceptional electrochemical properties in all&#8208;climate conditions. Most importantly, the large potential difference causes the AZKHBs discharged cathode to be oxidized using oxygen, thereby initiating a self&#8208;charging process in the absence of an external power source. Impressively, the air self&#8208;charging AZKHBs can achieve a maximum voltage of 1.15&#8197;V, an impressive discharge capacity (466.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and exceptional self&#8208;charging performance even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, the development of self&#8208;charging AZKHBs offers a solution to the limitations imposed by the absence of a power grid in harsh environments or remote areas.

         <title>Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry with On&#8208;Paper Electrokinetic Manipulations: Part&#8208;Per&#8208;Trillion Detection of Per/Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Water and Opioids in Urine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paper&#8208;based device that combines electrokinetic stacking and separations with MS ionization is developed to enable trace analysis without prior sample preparation. Sub part&#8208;per&#8208;trillion detection of harmful per/polyfluoroalkyl substances from tap water in 10&#8197;minutes is demonstrated.







Abstract
We developed a simple, paper&#8208;based device that enables sensitive detection by mass spectrometry (MS) without solid phase extraction or other sample preparation. Using glass fiber filter papers within a 3D printed holder, the device employs electrokinetic manipulations to stack, separate, and desalt charged molecules on paper prior to spray into the MS. Due to counter&#8208;balanced electroosmotic flow and electrophoresis, charged analytes stack on the paper and desalting occurs in minutes. One end of the paper strip was cut into a sharp point and positioned near the inlet of a MS. The stacked analyte bands move toward the paper tip with the EOF where they are ionized by paper spray. The device was applied to analysis of PFAS in tap water with sub part&#8208;per&#8208;trillion detection limits in less than ten minutes with no sample pretreatment. Analysis of opioids in urine also occurs in minutes. The crucial parameters to enable stacking, separation, and MS ionization of both positively and negatively charged analytes were determined and optimized. Experimental and computational modeling studies confirm the electrokinetic stacking and analyte transport mechanisms. On&#8208;paper separations were carried out by stacking analyte bands at different locations depending on their electrophoretic mobility, achieving baseline separation in some cases.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Open&#8208;Shell Conjugated Polymer with High&#8208;Spin Ground&#8208;State and High Intrinsic Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;shell conjugated polymer has been synthesized with the ultralow&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels (&#8722;4.63&#8197;eV) and high&#8208;spin ground&#8208;state, affording a high intrinsic conductivity of 1.04&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 without additional dopants and a power factor of 12.59&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 in organic thermoelectrics.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell conjugated polymers with a high intrinsic conductivity and high&#8208;spin ground state hold considerable promise for applications in organic electronics and spintronics. Herein, two novel acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8211;A) conjugated polymers based on a highly electron&#8208;deficient quinoidal benzodifurandione unit have been developed, namely DPP&#8208;BFDO&#8208;Th and DPP&#8208;BFDO. The incorporation of the quinoidal moiety into the polymers backbones enables deeply aligned lower&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of below &#8722;4.0&#8197;eV. Notably, DPP&#8208;BFDO exhibits an exceptionally low LUMO (&#8722;4.63&#8197;eV) and a high&#8208;spin ground state characterized by strong diradical characters. Moreover, a self&#8208;doping through intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer is observed for DPP&#8208;BFDO, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. The high carrier concentration in combination with a planar and linear conjugated backbone yields a remarkable electrical conductivity (&#963;) of 1.04&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the &#8220;undoped&#8221; native form, ranking among the highest values reported for n&#8208;type radical&#8208;based conjugated polymers. When employed as an n&#8208;type thermoelectric material, DPP&#8208;BFDO achieves a power factor of 12.59&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. Furthermore, upon n&#8208;doping, the &#963; could be improved to 65.68&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. This study underscores the great potential of electron&#8208;deficient quinoidal units in constructing dopant&#8208;free n&#8208;type conductive polymers with a high&#8208;spin ground state and exceptional intrinsic conductivity.

         <title>Fabrication of Large&#8208;Area Multi&#8208;Stimulus Responsive Thin Films via Interfacially Confined Irreversible Katritzky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films were fabricated through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions, vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination.







Abstract
Fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films through irreversible reactions remains a formidable task. This study reports a breakthrough strategy for in situ synthesis of large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The as resulted films are featured with adjustable thickness of 1&#8211;3&#8197;&#956;m and an area up to 50&#8197;cm2. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions (a response time of ca 0.1&#8197;s), vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. It was revealed that the reason behind the observable motions is proton transfer from the imine groups to the carbonyl structures within the film induced by photo&#8208; and/or dimethyl sulfoxide&#8208;stimulus. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination. This study provides a new strategy for fabricating smart thin films via interfacially confined irreversible Katritzky reaction.

         <title>Radical Homopolymerization of Linear &#945;&#8208;Olefins Enabled by 1,4&#8208;Cyano Group Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical homopolymerization of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins has been developed. The success of this polymerization relies on the high efficiency of 1,4&#8208;cyano group migration. This approach can be applied to homopolymerize &#945;&#8208; substituted styrenes or acrylates. As a chain transfer agent, a symmetric allylic sulfide is created to regulate the propagating thiyl radicals over the polymerization process.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Olefins are valued and abundant building blocks from fossil resources. They are widely used to provide small&#8208;molecule or polymeric products. Despite numerous advantages of radical polymerization, it has been well&#8208;documented as textbook knowledge that &#945;&#8208;olefins and their functionalized derivatives cannot be radically homopolymerized because of the degradative chain transfer side reactions. Herein, we report our studies on the homopolymerization of thiocyanate functionalized &#945;&#8208;olefins enabled by 1,4&#8208;cyano group migration under radical conditions. By this approach, a library of ABC sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with high molecular weights can be prepared. We can also extend this strategy to the homopolymerization of &#945;&#8208;substituted styrenic and acylate monomers which are known to be challenging to achieve. Overall, the demonstrated functional group migration radical polymerization could provide new possibilities to synthesize polymers with unprecedented main chain sequences and structures. These polymers are promising candidates for novel polymeric materials.

         <title>Construct Phenylethanoid Glycosides Harnessing Biosynthetic Networks, Protein Engineering and One&#8208;Pot Multienzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascade platform was established to synthesize various phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs). In total 12 catalytic enzymes were characterized to illustrate a complex biosynthetic network; 3&#8197;enzymes were engineered to broaden sugar donor and substrate selectivity; 46&#8197;PhGs could be constructed. PhGs with additional glycosyl and hydroxyl modules demonstrated liver cell protection effect.







Abstract
Phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) exhibit a multitude of structural variations linked to diverse pharmacological activities. Assembling various PhGs via multienzyme cascades represents a concise strategy over traditional synthetic methods. However, the challenge lies in identifying a comprehensive set of catalytic enzymes. This study explores biosynthetic PhG reconstruction from natural precursors, aiming to replicate and amplify their structural diversity. We discovered 12 catalytic enzymes, including four novel 6&#8242;&#8208;OH glycosyltransferases and three new polyphenol oxidases, revealing the intricate network in PhG biosynthesis. Subsequently, the crystal structure of CmGT3 (2.62&#8197;&#197;) was obtained, guiding the identification of conserved residue 144# as a critical determinant for sugar donor specificity. Engineering this residue in PhG glycosyltransferases (FsGT61, CmGT3, and FsGT6) altered their sugar donor recognition. Finally, a one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascade was established, where the combined action of glycosyltransferases and acyltransferases boosted conversion rates by up to 12.6&#8208;fold. This cascade facilitated the reconstruction of 26&#8197;PhGs with conversion rates ranging from 5&#8211;100&#8201;%, and 20 additional PhGs detectable by mass spectrometry. PhGs with extra glycosyl and hydroxyl modules demonstrated notable liver cell protection. This work not only provides catalytic tools for PhG biosynthesis, but also serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for cell&#8208;free enzymatic construction of diverse natural products.

         <title>Atomically Precise Nanometer&#8208;Sized Pt Catalysts with an Additional Photothermy Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected, ambient&#8208;stable Pt23 nanoclusters (~1&#8197;nm) are synthesized using a mixed ligand protection strategy and structurally resolved by single&#8208;crystal XRD and ESI&#8208;MS. The nanoclusters exhibit far higher activity than commercial Pt/C catalysts in catalyzing ORR without calcination before use and additional photothermal properties, which are attributed to the special size and structure by DFT and d&#8208;band center calculations.







Abstract
Atomically precise ~1&#8208;nm Pt nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) with ambient stability are important in fundamental research and exhibit diverse practical applications (catalysis, biomedicine, etc.). However, synthesizing such materials is challenging. Herein, by employing the mixture ligand protecting strategy, we successfully synthesized the largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected (~1&#8208;nm) Pt23 NCs precisely characterized with mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Interestingly, natural population analysis and Bader charge calculation indicate an alternate, varying charge &#8208;layer distribution in the sandwich&#8208;like Pt23 NC kernel. Pt23 NCs can catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions without requiring calcination and other treatments, and the resulting specific and mass activities without further treatment are sevenfold and eightfold higher than those observed for commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Density functional theory and d&#8208;band center calculations interpret the high activity. Furthermore, Pt23 NCs exhibit a photothermal conversion efficiency of 68.4&#8201;% under 532&#8208;nm laser irradiation and can be used at least for six cycles, thus demonstrating great potential for practical applications.

         <title>Regulating Sulfur Redox Kinetics by Coupling Photocatalysis for High&#8208;Performance Photo&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (PA&#8208;LSBs) exhibit outstanding performance through the selective catalysis mechanism of photocatalysis. The PHK composite cathode demonstrates exceptional solar energy conversion capabilities. PA&#8208;LSBs showcase excellent rate performance, long cycling stability, and high areal capacity, emphasizing their practical potential for energy storage applications in this advanced materials context.







Abstract
Challenges such as shuttle effect have hindered the commercialization of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), despite their potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage devices. To address these issues, we explore the integration of solar energy into LSBs, creating a photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (PA&#8208;LSB). The PA&#8208;LSB provides a novel and sustainable solution by coupling the photocatalytic effect to accelerate sulfur redox reactions. Herein, a perovskite quantum dot&#8208;loaded MOF material serves as a cathode for the PA&#8208;LSB, creating built&#8208;in electric fields at the micro&#8208;interface to extend the lifetime of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers. The band structure of the composite material aligns well with the electrochemical reaction potential of lithium&#8208;sulfur, enabling precise regulation of polysulfides in the cathode of the PA&#8208;LSB system. This is attributed to the selective catalysis of the liquid&#8208;solid reaction stage in the lithium&#8208;sulfur electrochemical process by photocatalysis. These contribute to the outstanding performance of PA&#8208;LSBs, particularly demonstrating a remarkably high reversible capacity of 679&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C, maintaining stable cycling for 1500&#8197;cycles with the capacity decay rate of 0.022&#8201;% per cycle. Additionally, the photo&#8208;charging capability of the PA&#8208;LSB holds the potential to compensate for non&#8208;electric energy losses during the energy storage process, contributing to the development of lossless energy storage devices.

The PA-LSB provides a novel and sustainable solution by coupling the photocatalytic effect to accelerate sulfur redox reactions. Herein, a perovskite quantum dot-loaded MOF material serves as a cathode for the PA-LSB, creating built-in electric fields at the micro-interface to extend the lifetime of photo-generated charge carriers. The band structure of the composite material aligns well with the electrochemical reaction potential of lithium-sulfur, enabling precise regulation of polysulfides in the cathode of the PA-LSB system. This is attributed to the selective catalysis of the liquid-solid reaction stage in the lithium-sulfur electrochemical process by photocatalysis. These contribute to the outstanding performance of PA-LSBs, particularly demonstrating a remarkably high reversible capacity of 679&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;C, maintaining stable cycling for 1500&#8197;cycles with the capacity decay rate of 0.022&#8201;% per cycle. Additionally, the photo-charging capability of the PA-LSB holds the potential to compensate for non-electric energy losses during the energy storage process, contributing to the development of lossless energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling Crucial Chemical Processing Parameters Influencing the Performance of Solution&#8208;Processed Inorganic Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical changes occur throughout the entire process of producing thermoelectric materials from particles in solution. Especially during the purification steps, which consequently influences the materials composition, microstructure and ultimately results in variations in the transport properties. Understanding the chemistry that occurs is crucial for material optimization and reproducibility.







Abstract
Production of thermoelectric materials from solution&#8208;processed particles involves the synthesis of particles, their purification and densification into pelletized material. Chemical changes that occur during each one of these steps render them performance determining. Particularly the purification steps, bypassed in conventional solid&#8208;state synthesis, are the cause for large discrepancies among similar solution&#8208;processed materials. In present work, the investigation focuses on a water&#8208;based surfactant free solution synthesis of SnSe, a highly relevant thermoelectric material. We show and rationalize that the number of leaching steps, purification solvent, annealing, and annealing atmosphere have significant influence on the Sn&#8201;:&#8201;Se ratio and impurity content in the powder. Such compositional changes that are undetectable by conventional characterization techniques lead to distinct consolidated materials with different types and concentration of defects. Additionally, the profound effect on their transport properties is demonstrated. We emphasize that understanding the chemistry and identifying key chemical species and their role throughout the process is paramount for optimizing material performance. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the necessity of comprehensive reporting of these steps as a standard practice to ensure material reproducibility.

         <title>Boost the Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Chiral Organometallic Platinum Complexes by Hierarchical Assembly into Fibrillar Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thin films of chiral Pt(II) complexes exhibit giantly&#8208;amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with |glum| of 0.53 at 560&#8197;nm and &#934; of ~50&#8201;% in air, as a result of the hierarchical formation of crystalline fibrillar networks upon spin coating. These films display promising potentials in CPL&#8208;contrast imaging and inducing circularly polarized light generation from achiral emitters and common LED lamps.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active molecular materials have drawn increasing attention due to their promising applications for next&#8208;generation display and optoelectronic technologies. Currently, it is challenging to obtain CPL materials with both large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and high quantum yield (&#934;). A pair of enantiomeric N&#8201;N&#8201;C&#8208;type Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;1 modified with chiral Leucine methyl ester are presented herein. Though the solutions of these complexes are CPL&#8208;inactive, the spin&#8208;coated thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 exhibit giantly&#8208;amplified circularly polarized phosphorescences with |glum| of 0.53 at 560&#8197;nm and &#934;air of ~50&#8201;%, as well as appealing circular dichroism (CD) signals with the maximum absorption dissymmetry factor |gabs| of 0.37&#8211;0.43 at 480&#8197;nm. This superior CPL performance benefits from the hierarchical formation of crystalline fibrillar networks upon spin coating. Comparative studies of another pair of chiral Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;2 with a symmetric N&#8201;C&#8201;N coordination mode suggest that the asymmetric N&#8201;N&#8201;C coordination of (L/D)&#8208;1 are favorable for the efficient exciton delocalization to amplify the CPL performance. Optical applications of the thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 in CPL&#8208;contrast imaging and inducing CP light generation from achiral emitters and common light&#8208;emitting diode lamps have been successfully realized.

         <title>Ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;Based Small Molecular Donor with Multiple Conformation Locks for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.3&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylenedioxythiophene was adopted to construct small molecular donor with multiple conformation locks, which can serve as efficient guest donor in ternary organic solar cells to provide cascade energy levels and two&#8208;dimensional charge transport channels, thus enabling high efficiency of 19.3&#8201;% compared to 18.2&#8201;% of the binary device.







Abstract
Ternary organic solar cells (T&#8208;OSCs) represent an efficient strategy for enhancing the performance of OSCs. Presently, the majority of high&#8208;performance T&#8208;OSCs incorporates well&#8208;established Y&#8208;acceptors or donor polymers as the third component. In this study, a novel class of conjugated small molecules has been introduced as the third component, demonstrating exceptional photovoltaic performance in T&#8208;OSCs. This innovative molecule comprises ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) bridge and 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine as the end group, with the EDOT unit facilitating the creation of multiple conformation locks. Consequently, the EDOT&#8208;based molecule exhibits two&#8208;dimensional charge transport, distinguishing it from the thiophene&#8208;bridged small molecule, which displays fewer conformation locks and provides one&#8208;dimensional charge transport. Furthermore, the robust electron&#8208;donating nature of EDOT imparts the small molecule with cascade energy levels relative to the electron donor and acceptor. As a result, OSCs incorporating the EDOT&#8208;based small molecule as the third component demonstrate enhanced mobilities, yielding a remarkable efficiency of 19.3&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiency of 18.7&#8201;% observed for OSCs incorporating thiophene&#8208;based small molecule as the third component. The investigations in this study underscore the excellence of EDOT as a building block for constructing conjugated materials with multiple conformation locks and high charge carrier mobilities, thereby contributing to elevated photovoltaic performance in OSCs.

         <title>Chemical Control of Fluorescence Lifetime towards Multiplexing Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>

This work demonstrates the chemical control of fluorescence lifetimes of boron dipyrromethene derivatives through the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process and the intramolecular charge transfer process. The resulting fluorophores were applied in fluorescence lifetime multiplexing imaging both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime imaging has been a powerful tool for biomedical research. Recently, fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based multiplexing imaging has expanded imaging channels by using probes that harbor the same spectral channels and distinct excited state lifetime. While it is desirable to control the excited state lifetime of any given fluorescent probes, the rational control of fluorescence lifetimes remains a challenge. Herein, we chose boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as a model system and provided chemical strategies to regulate the fluorescence lifetime of its derivatives with varying spectral features. We find electronegativity of structural substituents at the 8&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions is important to control the lifetime for the green&#8208;emitting and red&#8208;emitting BODIPY scaffolds. Mechanistically, such influences are exerted via the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer and the intramolecular charge transfer processes for the 8&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions of BODIPY, respectively. Based on these principles, we have generated a group of BODIPY probes that enable imaging experiments to separate multiple targets using fluorescence lifetime as a signal. In addition to BODIPY, we envision modulation of electronegativity of chemical substituents could serve as a feasible strategy to achieve rational control of fluorescence lifetime for a variety of small molecule fluorophores.

         <title>Activating and Stabilizing a Reversible four Electron Redox Reaction of I&#8722;/I+ for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an efficient inter&#8208;halogen activation strategy together with an interlayer confinement design, which successfully triggers and stabilizes a highly reversible four&#8208;electron redox reaction from I&#8722; to I+ for Zn&#8208;Iodine batteries. As a result, the specific capacity, output voltage and cycling performance of zinc&#8208;iodide battery are greatly improved.







Abstract
Low capacity and poor cycle stability greatly inhibit the development of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. Herein, a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;iodine battery has been reached by designing and optimizing both electrode and electrolyte. The Br&#8722; is introduced as the activator to trigger I+, and coupled with I+ forming interhalogen to stabilize I+ to achieve a four&#8208;electron reaction, which greatly promotes the capacity. And the Ni&#8722;Fe&#8722;I LDH nanoflowers serve as the confinement host to enable the reactions of I&#8722;/I+ occurring in the layer due to the spacious and stable interlayer spacing of Ni&#8722;Fe&#8722;I LDH, which effectively suppresses the iodine&#8208;species shuttle ensuring high cycling stability. As a result, the electrochemical performance is greatly enhanced, especially in specific capacity (as high as 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 far higher than two&#8208;electron transfer Zn&#8208;iodine batteries) and cycling performance (94.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000&#8197;cycles). This strategy provides a new way to realize high capacity and long&#8208;term stability of Zn&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Small Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Based Molecule Drives Strong Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a facile supramolecular modification strategy for the construction of ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule adhesives. A fundamental understanding of the mechanism underlying the high adhesion strength could serve as a guiding principle for the molecular design of novel adhesive materials. We anticipate that our work will facilitate the advancement and application of small&#8208;molecule adhesives in many burgeoning fields.







Abstract
Nature has inspired scientists to fabricate adhesive materials for applications in many burgeoning areas. However, it is still a significant challenge to develop small&#8208;molecule adhesives with high&#8208;strength, low&#8208;temperature and recyclable properties, although these merits are of great interest in various aspects. Herein, we report a series of strong adhesives based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecular solids driven by the terminal modification of ionic liquids (ILs) and subsequent supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The emergence of high strength and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for these supramolecular aggregates relies on modifying IL with a high melting point motif and enriching the types of noncovalent interactions in the original ILs. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that our IL&#8208;based molecular solids can efficiently obtain a high adhesion strength (up to 8.95&#8197;MPa). Importantly, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the reversible and strong adhesion enabled by monomer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer transitions. These fundamental findings provide guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance supramolecular adhesive materials.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Radical Aromatic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Alloxazine and Flavin through Ground&#8208;State Single Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective functionalization of flavin analogues is desirable for property tuning but requires de novo synthesis. A synthetic strategy involving the introduction of a remote redox site followed by copper complexation turns an alloxazine and a flavin into redox&#8208;active structures and activates their aromatic ring for site&#8208;selective aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization. This unprecedented mechanism opens new vistas in the chemistry of flavins and analogues.







Abstract
Flavins and their alloxazine isomers are key chemical scaffolds for bioinspired electron transfer strategies. Their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned by functional groups, which must be introduced at an early stage of the synthesis as their aromatic ring is inert towards post&#8208;functionalization. We show that the introduction of a remote metal&#8208;binding redox site on alloxazine and flavin activates their aromatic ring towards direct C&#8722;H functionalization. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a synthetic sequence involving ground&#8208;state single electron transfer (SET) with an electrophilic source followed by radical&#8208;radical coupling. This unprecedented reactivity opens new opportunities in molecular editing of flavins by direct aromatic post&#8208;functionalization and the utility of the method is demonstrated with the site&#8208;selective C6 functionalization of alloxazine and flavin with a CF3 group, Br or Cl, that can be further elaborated into OH and aryl for chemical diversification.

         <title>Selective Arylation of RNA 2&#8242;&#8208;OH Groups via SNAr Reaction with Trialkylammonium Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic trialkylammonium arylating agents are shown to react efficiently with RNA in water, placing aryl ethers at 2&#8242;&#8208;O positions in the biopolymer. The reagents, which are stable for weeks in water but react with RNA in minutes to hours, can be used to modify and label RNA, and to probe its structure.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule reactions at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA enable useful applications for transcriptome technology and biology. To date, all reactions have involved carbonyl acylation and mechanistically related sulfonylation, limiting the types of modifications and properties that can be achieved. Here we report that electron&#8208;deficient heteroaryl species selectively react with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA in water via SNAr chemistry. In particular, trialkyl&#8208;ammonium (TAA)&#8208;activated aromatic heterocycles, prepared in one step from aryl chloride precursors, give high conversions to aryl ether adducts with RNAs in aqueous buffer in ~2&#8211;3&#8197;h. Remarkably, a TAA triazine previously used only for reaction with carboxylic acids, shows unprecedented selectivity for RNA over water, reacting rapidly with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups while exhibiting a half&#8208;life in water of &gt;10&#8197;days. We further show that a triazine aryl species can be used as a probe at trace&#8208;level yields to map RNA structure in vitro. Finally, we prepare a number of functionalized trialkylammonium triazine reagents and show that they can be used to covalently label RNA efficiently for use in vitro and in living cells. This direct arylation chemistry offers a simple and distinct structural scaffold for post&#8208;synthetic RNA modification, with potential utility in multiple applications in transcriptome research.

         <title>N&#8208;(Sulfonio)Sulfilimine Reagents: Non&#8208;Oxidizing Sources of Electrophilic Nitrogen Atom for Skeletal Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under rhodium catalysis N&#8208;sulfonio(sulfilimines) act as sulfonitrene precursors. Reaction of such species with indenes presumably delivers N&#8208;sulfonio aziridines, which evolve to isoquinolines via electrocyclic ring expansion. Contrarily, 1&#8208;arycyclobutenes are transformed into 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclopropanes via ring contraction.

This compound reacts with Rh2(esp)2 (esp=&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8242;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedipropionic acid) generating a Rh&#8208;coordinated sulfonitrene species, which is able to transfer the electrophilic nitrene moiety to olefins. When indenes are used as substrates, isoquinolines are obtained in good yields. We assumed that after formation of the corresponding N&#8208;sulfonio aziridine, a ring expansion occurs via selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage and concomitant elimination of dibenzothiophene. Unexpectedly, a similar protocol transforms 1&#8208;arylcyclobutenes into 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclopropanes. Our calculations indicate that aziridination is not favored in this case; instead, sulfilimine&#8208;substituted cyclobutyl carbocations are initially formed, and these evolve to the isolated cyclopropanes via ring contraction. Both procedures are operationally simple, tolerate a range of functional groups, including oxidation&#8208;sensitive alcohols and aldehydes, and enable the convenient preparation of valuable 15N&#8208;labelled products. These results demonstrate the potential of 1 to provide alternative pathways for the selective transfer of N&#8208;atoms in organic molecules.

         <title>Mitigating Sodium Ordering for Enhanced Solid Solution Behavior in Layered NaNiO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective reduction of multiple phase transformations in NaNiO2 has been achieved through divalent Mg2+ doping, which deshields the electron density from Na+ ions. This outcome can be attributed to the more ionic nature of Mg&#8722;O bond, creating free space for the mobility of Na+ ions and mitigating the Na+ion ordering.







Abstract
The O&#8208;type layered nickel oxides suffer from undesired cooperative Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion stemming from Ni3+ ions and undergo multiple biphasic structural transformations during the insertion/extraction of large Na+ ions, posing a significant challenge to stabilize the structural integrity. We present here a systematic investigation of the impact of substituting 5&#8201;% divalent (Mg2+) or trivalent (Al3+ or Co3+) ions for Ni3+ to alleviate Na+ion ordering and perturb the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect to enhance structural stability. We gauge a fundamental understanding of the Mg&#8722;O and Na&#8722;O or Mg&#8722;O&#8722;Na bonding interactions, noting that the ionicity of the Mg&#8722;O bond deshields the electronic cloud of oxygen from Na+ ions. Furthermore, calculations of the Van Vleck distortion modes reveal a relaxation of NiO6 octahedra from Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and a reduced electron density at the interlayer with Mg2+ substitution. Long&#8208;range (operando
X&#8208;ray diffraction) and short&#8208;range (magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance) structural analyses provide insights into reduced ordering, allowing a stable continuous solid solution. Overall, Mg&#8208;substitution results in a high&#8208;capacity retention of ~96&#8201;% even after 100&#8197;cycles, showcasing the potential of this strategy for overcoming the structural instabilities and enhancing the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Blue Long Afterglow and Ultra Broadband Vis&#8208;NIR Emission from All&#8208;Inorganic Copper&#8208;Doped Silver Halide Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of copper(I) ions into all&#8208;inorganic Rb2AgBr3 single crystals achieves ultralong blue afterglow (&gt;300&#8197;s) by manipulating the formation of bromine vacancies. Moreover, this doping strategy enables a cascade of energy transfer among distinct emission centers, resulting in near&#8208;unity&#8208;yield white light emission and extending the emission into the near&#8208;infrared region.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic metal halides with afterglow emission have attracted increasing attention due to their significantly longer afterglow duration and higher stability compared to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their afterglow colors have not yet reached the blue spectral region. Here, we report all&#8208;inorganic copper&#8208;doped Rb2AgBr3 single crystals with ultralong blue afterglow (&gt;300&#8197;s) by modulating defect states through doping engineering. The introduction of copper(I) ions into Rb2AgBr3 facilitates the formation of bromine vacancies, thus increasing the density of trap states available for charge storage and enabling bright, persistent emission after ceasing the excitation. Moreover, cascade energy transfer between distinct emissive centers in the crystals results in ultra&#8208;broadband photoluminescence, not only covering the whole white light with near&#8208;unity quantum yield but also extending into the near&#8208;infrared region. This &#8216;cocktail&#8217; of exotic light&#8208;emission properties, in conjunction with the excellent stability of copper&#8208;doped Rb2AgBr3 crystals, allowed us to demonstrate their implementation to solid&#8208;state lighting, night vision, and intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>A Dielectric MXene&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Built Electric Field in Polymer Electrolyte Triggering Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport and High&#8208;Voltage Cycling Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;built electric field strategy is proposed to enhance Li+ transportation and accelerate the degradation dynamics of LiTFSI by optimizing the termination of MXene, resulting in the formation of LiF&#8208;enriched SEI and CEI enhanced stable interfaces, as evidenced by XPS etching and ToF&#8208;SIMS. It showcases prolonged cycle life at a high voltage up to 4.6&#8197;V, showing promising applications for quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QPE) lithium (Li)&#8208;metal battery holds significant promise in the application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, yet it suffers from low ionic conductivity and poor oxidation stability. Herein, a novel self&#8208;built electric field (SBEF) strategy is proposed to enhance Li+ transportation and accelerate the degradation dynamics of carbon&#8208;fluorine bond cleavage in LiTFSI by optimizing the termination of MXene. Among them, the SBEF induced by dielectric Nb4C3F2 MXene effectively constructs highly conductive LiF&#8208;enriched SEI and CEI stable interfaces, moreover, enhances the electrochemical performance of the QPE. The related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism and dual&#8208;reinforced stable interface are thoroughly investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics, COMSOL, XPS depth profiling, and ToF&#8208;SIMS. This comprehensive approach results in a high conductivity of 1.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, leading to a small polarization of approximately 25&#8197;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 6000&#8197;h. Furthermore, it enables a prolonged cycle life at a high voltage of up to 4.6&#8197;V. Overall, this work not only broadens the application of MXene for QPE but also inspires the great potential of the self&#8208;built electric field in QPE&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Taylor Dispersion&#8208;Induced Phase Separation for the Efficient Characterisation of Protein Condensate Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein phase separation (PPS) is important in functional and disease biology but is challenging to study. We present Taylor dispersion induced phase separation (TDIPS) to study PPS in a reaction&#8208;diffusion system inside a microfluidic capillary. The resulting data is highly information&#8208;rich and allows for thermodynamic analysis but also efficient screening campaigns of phase separation&#8208;modulating compounds using only nanoliters of sample per data point.







Abstract
Biomolecular condensates have emerged as important structures in cellular function and disease, and are thought to form through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Thorough and efficient in vitro experiments are therefore needed to elucidate the driving forces of protein LLPS and the possibility to modulate it with drugs. Here we present Taylor dispersion&#8208;induced phase separation (TDIPS), a method to robustly measure condensation phenomena using a commercially available microfluidic platform. It uses only nanoliters of sample, does not require extrinsic fluorescent labels, and is straightforward to implement. We demonstrate TDIPS by screening the phase behaviour of two proteins that form biomolecular condensates in vivo, PGL&#8208;3 and Ddx4. Uniquely accessible to this method, we find an unexpected re&#8208;entrant behaviour at very low ionic strength, where LLPS is inhibited for both proteins. TDIPS can also probe the reversibility of assemblies, which was shown for both &#945;&#8208;synuclein and for lysozyme, relevant for health and biotechnology, respectively. Finally, we highlight how effective inhibition concentrations and partitioning of LLPS&#8208;modifying compounds can be screened highly efficiently.

         <title>Alveoli&#8208;Inspired Carbon Cathodes with Interconnected Porous Structure and Asymmetric Coordinated Vanadium Sites for Superior Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alveoli&#8208;inspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S1N3 sites has been proposed for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The asymmetric electronic distribution and large atom radius of S resulted in the sloping adsorption for polysulfide and low thermodynamic energy barriers, which resulted in enhanced sulfur adsorption&#8208;catalytic conversion and stable long&#8208;cycle performance for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Accelerating sulfur conversion catalysis to alleviate the shuttle effect has become a novel paradigm for effective Li&#8722;S batteries. Although nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom (M&#8722;N4) catalysts have been investigated, further optimizing its utilization rate and catalytic activities is urgently needed for practical applications. Inspired by the natural alveoli tissue with interconnected structure and well&#8208;distributed enzyme catalytic sites on the wall for the simultaneously fast diffusion and in situ catalytic conversion of substrates, here, we proposed the controllable synthesis of bioinspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S1N3 sites for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The enzyme&#8208;mimetic V&#8722;S1N3 shows asymmetric electronic distribution and high tunability, therefore enhancing in situ polysulfide conversion activities. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the high charge asymmetry degree and large atom radius of S in V&#8722;S1N3 result in sloping adsorption for polysulfide, thereby exhibiting low thermodynamic energy barriers and long&#8208;range stability (0.076&#8201;% decay over 600&#8197;cycles).

         <title>SilE&#8208;R and SilE&#8208;S&#8212;DABB Proteins Catalying Enantiospecific Hydrolysis of Organosilyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S, members of the DABB protein family, are the first two enzymes described that catalyse the enantiospecific hydrolysis of organosilyl ethers. They accept a wide range of substrates, including TBDMS&#8208;protected alcohols. The natural function of SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S is still unknown, but their discovery paves the way towards a green and selective transformation of organosilane organosilanol substrates.







Abstract
Silyl ethers fulfil a fundamental role in synthetic organic chemistry as protecting groups and their selective cleavage is an important factor in their application. We present here for the first time two enzymes, SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S, which are able to hydrolyse silyl ethers. They belong to the stress&#8208;response dimeric A/B barrel domain (DABB) family and are able to cleave the Si&#8722;O bond with opposite enantiopreference. Silyl ethers containing aromatic, cyclic or aliphatic alcohols and, depending on the alcohol moiety, silyl functions as large as TBDMS are accepted. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of SilE&#8722;R, determined to a resolution of 1.98&#8197;&#197;, in combination with mutational studies, revealed an active site featuring two histidine residues, H8 and H79, which likely act synergistically as nucleophile and Br&#248;nsted base in the hydrolytic mechanism, which has not previously been described for enzymes. Although the natural function of SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S is unknown, we propose that these &#8216;silyl etherases&#8217; may have significant potential for synthetic applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated Ethers to Mitigate Electrode Surface Reactivity in High&#8208;Voltage NCM811&#8208;Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a non&#8208;fluorinated ether&#8208;based electrolyte to prolong the lifespan of high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich ternary LMBs. The electrolyte simultaneously solves the challenges of both the high&#8208;voltage cathode and Li metal anode by mitigating the electrode surface reactivity. The problems of NiO rock&#8208;salt transition, intragranular crack/microstructural defect formation, gas releases, and over&#8208;growth SEI have been alleviated.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel (Ni)&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes exhibit twice the energy density of conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their lifespan is limited by severe side reactions caused by high electrode reactivity. Fluorinated solvent&#8208;based electrolytes can address this challenge, but they pose environmental and biological hazards. This work reports on the molecular engineering of fluorine (F)&#8208;free ethers to mitigate electrode surface reactivity in high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich LMBs. By merely extending the alkyl chains of traditional ethers, we effectively reduce the catalytic reactivity of the cathode towards the electrolyte at high voltages, which suppresses the oxidation decomposition of the electrolyte, microstructural defects and rock&#8208;salt phase formation in the cathode, and gas release issues. The high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich NCM811&#8208;Li battery delivers capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;%, even superior to that in carbonate electrolytes. Additionally, this strategy facilitates passivation of the Li anode by forming a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, boosting the Li reversibility to 99.11&#8201;% with a cycling life of 350&#8197;cycles, which outperforms conventional F&#8208;free ether electrolytes. Consequently, the lifespan of practical LMBs has been prolonged by over 100&#8201;% and 500&#8201;% compared to those in conventional carbonate&#8208; and ether&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively.

         <title>Probing Energy&#8208;Funneling Kinetics in Nanocrystal Sublattices for Superior X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208;funneling kinetics in NaLuF4: Mn2+/Gd3+ nanocrystals were explored through precise microenvironment engineering within nanocrystal sublattices. The resulting tailorable radioluminescence afterglow enabled high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with an ultralong optical memory.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lasting radioluminescence scintillators have recently attracted substantial attention from both research and industrial communities, primarily due to their distinctive capabilities of converting and storing X&#8208;ray energy. However, determination of energy&#8208;conversion kinetics in these nanocrystals remains unexplored. Here we present a strategy to probe and unveil energy&#8208;funneling kinetics in NaLuF4:Mn2+/Gd3+ nanocrystal sublattices through Gd3+&#8208;driven microenvironment engineering and Mn2+&#8208;mediated radioluminescence profiling. Our photophysical studies reveal effective control of energy&#8208;funneling kinetics and demonstrate the tunability of electron trap depth ranging from 0.66 to 0.96&#8197;eV, with the corresponding trap density varying between 2.38&#215;105 and 1.34&#215;107&#8197;cm&#8722;3. This enables controlled release of captured electrons over durations spanning from seconds to 30&#8197;days. It allows tailorable emission wavelength within the range of 520&#8211;580&#8197;nm and fine&#8208;tuning of thermally&#8208;stimulated temperature between 313&#8211;403&#8197;K. We further utilize these scintillators to fabricate high&#8208;density, large&#8208;area scintillation screens that exhibit a 6&#8208;fold improvement in X&#8208;ray sensitivity, 22 lp/mm high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, and a 30&#8208;day&#8208;long optical memory. This enables high&#8208;contrast imaging of injured mice through fast thermally&#8208;stimulated radioluminescence readout.

&lt;p&gt;Energy-funneling kinetics in NaLuF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; nanocrystals were explored through precise microenvironment engineering within nanocrystal sublattices. The resulting tailorable radioluminescence afterglow enabled high-sensitivity, high-resolution X-ray imaging with an ultralong optical memory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-lasting radioluminescence scintillators have recently attracted substantial attention from both research and industrial communities, primarily due to their distinctive capabilities of converting and storing X-ray energy. However, determination of energy-conversion kinetics in these nanocrystals remains unexplored. Here we present a strategy to probe and unveil energy-funneling kinetics in NaLuF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; nanocrystal sublattices through Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-driven microenvironment engineering and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated radioluminescence profiling. Our photophysical studies reveal effective control of energy-funneling kinetics and demonstrate the tunability of electron trap depth ranging from 0.66 to 0.96&#8197;eV, with the corresponding trap density varying between 2.38&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.34&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This enables controlled release of captured electrons over durations spanning from seconds to 30&#8197;days. It allows tailorable emission wavelength within the range of 520&#8211;580&#8197;nm and fine-tuning of thermally-stimulated temperature between 313&#8211;403&#8197;K. We further utilize these scintillators to fabricate high-density, large-area scintillation screens that exhibit a 6-fold improvement in X-ray sensitivity, 22 lp/mm high-resolution X-ray imaging, and a 30-day-long optical memory. This enables high-contrast imaging of injured mice through fast thermally-stimulated radioluminescence readout. These findings offer new insights into the correlation of radioluminescence dynamics with energy-funneling kinetics, thereby contributing to the advancement of high-energy nanophotonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems with Linear and Bottlebrush Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyelectrolyte complex, comprising anionic bottlebrush polymer and cationic linear polymer, exhibits a broader phase separation diagram and higher salt resistance capacity and vary spherical&#8208;like to core&#8211;shell&#8208;like conformation. Utilizing this system creates a tubular&#8208;like flow structure at the interface of two aqueous liquids, enhancing the structural stability, offering a more efficient and easy method for particle transport.







Abstract
We formed core&#8211;shell&#8208;like polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) from an anionic bottlebrush polymer with poly (acrylic acid) side chains with a cationic linear poly (allylamine hydrochloride). By varying the pH, the number of side chains of the polyanionic BB polymers (Nbb), the charge density of the polyelectrolytes, and the salt concentration, the phase separation behavior and salt resistance of the complexes could be tuned by the conformation of the BBs. By combining the linear/bottlebrush polyelectrolyte complexation with all&#8208;liquid 3D printing, flow&#8208;through tubular constructs were produced that showed selective transport across the PEC membrane comprising the walls of the tubules. These tubular constructs afford a new platform for flow&#8208;through delivery systems.

         <title>Molecular Engineering for Modulating Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fully conjugated 3D covalent organic frameworks were synthesized by using the molecular engineering strategy. The influences of key factors including the D&#8208;A structure, hydrophilicity, porosity, as well as the conjugated/non&#8208;conjugated structures on their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution properties were discussed. The as&#8208;synthesized fully conjugated 3D COFs could generate H2 up to 40.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently shown great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Currently almost all reports are focused on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs, while the 3D counterparts are rarely explored due to their non&#8208;conjugated frameworks derived from the sp3 carbon based tetrahedral building blocks. Here, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of fully conjugated 3D COFs by using the saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene derivative as the building block. Through molecular engineering strategies, we thoroughly discussed the influences of key factors including the donor&#8208;acceptor structure, hydrophilicity, specific surface areas, as well as the conjugated/non&#8208;conjugated structures on their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution properties. The as&#8208;synthesized fully conjugated 3D COFs could generate the hydrogen up to 40.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. This is the first report on intrinsic metal&#8208;free 3D COFs in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution application. Our work provides insight on the structure design of 3D COFs for highly&#8208;efficient photocatalysis, and also reveals that the semiconducting fully conjugated 3D COFs could be a useful platform in clear energy&#8208;related fields.

         <title>Unveiling the Pivotal Role of dx2&#8722;y2 Electronic States in Nickel&#8208;Based Hydroxide Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dx2&#8722;y2 electronic state within antibonding bands plays a decisive role in the Ni(OH)2&#8208;based methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The onset potential depends on the deprotonation ability (Ni2+ to Ni3+), which was closely related to the band center of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital. The closer of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital to the Fermi level showed the stronger the deprotonation ability. Meanwhile, in the high potential region, the broadening of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital would facilitate the electron transfer from methanol to catalysts (Ni3+ to Ni2+), further enhancing the catalytic properties. This work provides a new design paradigm for developing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;efficiency Ni(OH)2&#8208;based catalysts for MOR.







Abstract
The anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) plays a crucial role in coupling with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enables the sustainable production of the high&#8208;valued formate. Nickel&#8208;based hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) as MOR electrocatalyst has attracted enormous attention. However, the key factor determining the intrinsic catalytic activity remains unknown, which significantly hinders the further development of Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst. Here, we found that the

 electronic state within antibonding bands plays a decisive role in the whole MOR process. The onset potential depends on the deprotonation ability (Ni2+ to Ni3+), which was closely related to the band center of

         <title>Catalytic Kinetic Resolution of Monohydrosilanes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic kinetic resolution strategy was developed for the access of chiral Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes. By employing Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation, both dihydrobenzosilole&#8208;based organosilanes and monohydrosilane containing ortho&#8208;vinyl group could be prepared with high efficiency and good to excellent selectivity factors in one single operation.







Abstract
The catalytic access of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes remains a big challenge, and largely depends on the desymmetrization of the symmetric precursors with two identical substitutes attached to silicon atom. Here we report the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes via catalytic kinetic resolution of racemic monohydrosilanes with good to excellent selectivity factors. Both Si&#8208;stereogenic dihydrobenzosiloles and Si&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes could be efficiently accessed in one single operation via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intramolecular hydrosilylation, employing (R,R)&#8208;Et&#8208;DuPhos as the optimal ligand. This catalytic protocol features mild conditions, a low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% [Rh(cod)Cl]2), high stereoinduction (S factor up to 152), and excellent scalability. Moreover, further derivatizations led to the efficient synthesis of uncommon middle&#8208;size (7&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered) Si&#8208;stereogenic silacycles. Preliminary mechanistic study indicates this reaction might undergo a modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism.

By employing Rh-catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation, both dihydrobenzosilole-based organosilanes and monohydrosilane containing &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-vinyl group could be prepared with high efficiency and good to excellent selectivity factors in one single operation.

         <title>An Indocyanine Green&#8208;Based Nanoprobe for In Vivo Detection of Cellular Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>

Sound of Senescence: A nanostructured organic probe, NanoJaggs, can be used as photoacoustic contrast agent for in vivo imaging of the senescent cell burden in post&#8208;chemotherapy tumors. Made of indocyanine green (ICG) dimers, 30&#8197;nm nanoparticles exploit an active endocytosis mechanism and increase the number of lysosomes to specifically light up senescent cells implicated in cancer initiation and progression.







Abstract
There is an urgent need to improve conventional cancer&#8208;treatments by preventing detrimental side effects, cancer recurrence and metastases. Recent studies have shown that presence of senescent cells in tissues treated with chemo&#8208; or radiotherapy can be used to predict the effectiveness of cancer treatment. However, although the accumulation of senescent cells is one of the hallmarks of cancer, surprisingly little progress has been made in development of strategies for their detection in vivo. To address a lack of detection tools, we developed a biocompatible, injectable organic nanoprobe (NanoJagg), which is selectively taken up by senescent cells and accumulates in the lysosomes. The NanoJagg probe is obtained by self&#8208;assembly of indocyanine green (ICG) dimers using a scalable manufacturing process and characterized by a unique spectral signature suitable for both photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and fluorescence imaging. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies all indicate that NanoJaggs are a clinically translatable probe for detection of senescence and their PAT signal makes them suitable for longitudinal monitoring of the senescence burden in solid tumors after chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

         <title>Easy Synthetic Access to High&#8208;Melting Sulfurated Copolymers and their Self&#8208;Assembling Diblock Copolymers from Phenylisothiocyanate and Oxetane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of phenylisothiocyanate and oxetane yields sulfurated polymers with melting points of up to 181&#8201;&#176;C. Kinetic linkage control and minimal substitution are crucial to maximizing melting temperatures. Their controlled synthesis and tolerance to macro&#8208;chain transfer agents provide access to amphiphiles that can be used in crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, forming cylindrical micelles.







Abstract
Although sulfurated polymers promise unique properties, their controlled synthesis, particularly when it comes to complex and functional architectures, remains challenging. Here, we show that the copolymerization of oxetane and phenyl isothiocyanate selectively yields polythioimidocarbonates as a new class of sulfur containing polymers, with narrow molecular weight distributions (Mn=5&#8211;80&#8197;kg/mol with &#272;&#8804;1.2; Mn,max=124&#8197;kg/mol) and high melting points of up to 181&#8201;&#176;C. The method tolerates different substituent patterns on both the oxetane and the isothiocyanate. Self&#8208;nucleation experiments reveal that &#960;&#8208;stacking of phenyl substituents, the presence of unsubstituted polymer backbones, and the kinetically controlled linkage selectivity are key factors in maximising melting points. The increased tolerance to macro&#8208;chain transfer agents and the controlled propagation allows the synthesis of double crystalline and amphiphilic diblock copolymers, which can be assembled into micellar&#8208; and worm&#8208;like structures with amorphous cores in water. In contrast, crystallization driven self&#8208;assembly in ethanol gives cylindrical micelles or platelets.

         <title>Breaking Highly Ordered PtPbBi Intermetallic with Disordered Amorphous Phase for Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin amorphous/intermetallic heterophase PtPbBi NSs were synthesized for the first time, which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance in HER and AORs owing to their unique heterointerfaces and abundant exposed active sites. Construction of amorphous/crystalline heterophase structures with multimetallic composition can effectively optimize the Gibbs free energy and enhance the electron transfer from the surface of the catalyst to *CH2OH.







Abstract
Constructing amorphous/intermetallic (A/IMC) heterophase structures by breaking the highly ordered IMC phase with disordered amorphous phase is an effective way to improve the electrocatalytic performance of noble metal&#8208;based IMC electrocatalysts because of the optimized electronic structure and abundant heterophase boundaries as active sites. In this study, we report the synthesis of ultrathin A/IMC PtPbBi nanosheets (NSs) for boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alcohol oxidation reactions. The resulting A/IMC PtPbBi NSs exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of only 25&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the HER in an acidic electrolyte, together with outstanding stability for 100&#8197;h. In addition, the PtPbBi NSs show high mass activities for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), which are 13.2 and 14.5 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of amorphous/intermetallic components and multimetallic composition facilitate the electron transfer from the catalyst to key intermediates, thus improving the catalytic activity of MOR. This work establishes a novel pathway for the synthesis of heterophase two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials with high electrocatalytic performance across a wide range of electrochemical applications.

         <title>Similarities and Differences in Benzene Reduction with Ca, Sr, Yb and Sm: Strong Evidence for Tetra&#8208;Anionic Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse sandwich benzene complexes are prone to metal oxidation state ambiguities. Based on comparisons between alkaline&#8208;earth and lanthanide metals, we provide strong evidence for the formal formation of a SmIII&#8208;benzene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complex.







Abstract
Inverse sandwich complexes of Yb and Sm stabilized by a bulky &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) ligand have been prepared: (BDI)Ln(&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;C6H6)Ln(BDI); Ln=lanthanide. Coordinated benzene ligands can be neutral, di&#8208;anionic or, often controversially discussed, even tetra&#8208;anionic. The formal charge on benzene is correlated to assignment of the metal oxidation state which generally poses a problem. Herein, we take advantage of the structural similarities found when comparing CaII with YbII, and SrII with SmII complexes. In this work, we found an excellent overlap of the Ca/Yb inverse sandwich structures but a striking difference for the Sr/Sm pair. The much shorter Sm&#8722;N and Sm&#8208;C6H6 distances are strong evidence for a SmIII&#8208;benzene&#8722;4&#8208;SmIII assignment. This was further supported by NMR spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, reactivity and comprehensive computational investigation.

Herein, we take advantage of the structural similarities found when comparing Ca&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; with Yb&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, and Sr&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; with Sm&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. In this work, we found an excellent overlap of the Ca/Yb inverse sandwich structures but a striking difference for the Sr/Sm pair. The much shorter Sm&#8722;N and Sm-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; distances are strong evidence for a Sm&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-benzene&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;-Sm&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; assignment. This was further supported by NMR spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, reactivity and comprehensive computational investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugation and Topology Engineering of 2D &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Robust Potassium Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first case of the application of conjugation and topology engineering to regulate the cation/anion storage feature of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with the rhombus/kagome structure as well as three/four&#8208;arm core, which presents robust framework structure and successive storage of cations/anions, thus showing the impressively electrochemical properties in potassium&#8208;ion half/full cells.







Abstract
The evolution of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) provides a significant prospect for researching the next generation of green and advanced energy storage systems (ESSs). Especially, conjugation and topology engineering serve as an irreplaceable character in adjusting the electrochemical properties of ESSs. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy using conjugation and topology engineering to demonstrate the application of 2D c&#8208;MOFs in robust potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) for the first time. By comparing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with the rhombus/kagome structure as well as three/four&#8208;arm core, the rhombus structure (sql&#8208;Cu&#8208;TBA&#8208;MOF) cathode for PIBs can display the impressive electrochemical performance, including a high specific discharge capacity of 178.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a well long&#8208;term cycle stability of more than 9,000 (at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, full PIBs (FPIBs) are constructed by pairing sql&#8208;Cu&#8208;TBA&#8208;MOF cathode with dipotassium terephthalate (KTP) anode, which delivers a high reversible discharge specific capacity of 146.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and great practical application prospect. These findings provide reasonable implications for the design of 2D c&#8208;MOFs from the perspective of conjugation and topology engineering for advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Commercializable Naphthalene Diimide Anolytes for Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed the hydrothermal synthesis methodology for the preparation of high&#8208;performance naphthalene diimide materials on a hundred&#8208;gram scale, and showed great commercial potential offering cost&#8208;effective production. Under the synergistic effects of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and H&#8208;bonding networks, naphthalene diimide delivered excellent battery performance including high capacity/power, and long lifetime.







Abstract
Neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) hold the potential to facilitate the transition of renewable energy sources from auxiliary to primary energy, the commercial production of anolyte materials still suffers from insufficient performance of high&#8208;concentration and the high cost of the preparation problem. To overcome these challenges, this study provides a hydrothermal synthesis methodology and introduces the charged functional groups into hydrophobic naphthalene diimide cores, and prepares a series of high&#8208;performance naphthalene diimide anolytes. Under the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and H&#8208;bonding networks, the naphthalene diimide exhibits excellent structural stability and the highest water solubility (1.85&#8197;M for dex&#8208;NDI) reported to date. By employing the hydrothermal method, low&#8208;cost naphthalene diimides are successfully synthesized on a hundred&#8208;gram scale of $0.16&#8197;g&#8722;1 ($2.43&#8197;Ah&#8722;1), which is also the lowest price reported to date. The constructed full battery achieves a high electron concentration of 2.4&#8197;M, a high capacity of 54.4&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1, and a power density of 318&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with no significant capacity decay observed during long&#8208;duration cycling. These findings provide crucial support for the commercialization of AORFBs and pave the way for revolutionary developments in neutral AORFBs.

         <title>Unified Approach to Deamination and Deoxygenation Through Isonitrile Hydrodecyanation: A Combined Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>

We report a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol using isonitrile intermediates. Employing photoredox catalysis, a nucleophilic boryl radical mediates the scission of a relatively inert C&#8722;NC bond, accomplishing deletion of the isonitrile group. This strategy applies to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol&#8208;containing compounds and extends to the reduction of carbonyls, olefins, and alkyl nitriles.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol of alcohols and amines through a common isonitrile intermediate. To cleave the relatively inert C&#8722;NC bond, we leveraged dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and photoredox catalysis to generate a nucleophilic boryl radical, which readily forms an imidoyl radical intermediate from the isonitrile. Rapid &#946;&#8208;scission then accomplishes defunctionalization. This method has been applied to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol&#8208;containing pharmaceuticals, natural products, and biomolecules. We extended this approach to the reduction of carbonyls and olefins to their saturated counterparts, as well as the hydrodecyanation of alkyl nitriles. Both experimental and computational studies demonstrate a facile &#946;&#8208;scission of the imidoyl radical, and reconcile differences in reactivity between nitriles and isonitriles within our protocol.

         <title>PolyBorylated Alkenes as Energy&#8208;Transfer Reactive Groups: Access to Multi&#8208;Borylated Cyclobutanes Combined with Hydrogen Atom Transfer Event</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of polyborylated cyclobutanes by photochemical [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition is reported. The reaction is enabled by triplet energy transfer to the polyborylated alkenes and operates with a wide array of polyborylated alkenes, and olefins, allowing for the creation of polyborylated&#8208;biradical intermediates. A side&#8208;product resulting from a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) via a photo&#8208;ene&#8208;type reaction was also obtained.







Abstract
While polyborylated alkenes are being recognized for their elevated status as highly valuable reagents in modern organic synthesis, allowing efficient access to a diverse array of transformations, including the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds, their potential as energy&#8208;transfer reactive groups has remained unexplored. Yet, this potential holds the key to generating elusive polyborylated biradical species, which can be captured by olefins, thereby leading to the construction of new highly&#8208;borylated scaffolds. Herein, we report a designed energy&#8208;transfer strategy for photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of poly&#8208;borylated alkenes with various olefins enabling the regioselective synthesis of diverse poly&#8208;borylated cyclobutane motifs, including the 1,1&#8208;di&#8208;, 1,1,2&#8208;tri&#8208;, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra&#8208;borylated cyclobutanes. In fact, these compounds belong to a family that presently lacks efficient synthetic pathways. Interestingly, when &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene was used, the reaction involves an interesting 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Mechanistic deuterium&#8208;labeling studies have provided insight into the outcome of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process. In addition, the polyborylated cyclobutanes are then demonstrated to be useful in selective oxidation processes resulting in the formation of cyclobutanones and &#947;&#8208;lactones.

         <title>Reversal of the Regioselectivity of Iron&#8208;Promoted Hydrogenation and Hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described an unprecedented iron&#8208;promoted hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes in reversed regioselectivity for the generation of difluoroalkyl radicals. Hydrogenation and halogenation of the in situ generated radicals gave difluoromethylated, chlorodifluoromethylated, bromodifluoromethylate and iododifluoromethylated products respectively. Mechanism experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the kinetic effect of the irreversible HAT process resulted in the reversal of the regioselectivity.







Abstract
The reaction regioselectivity of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes is dependent on the intrinsic polarity. Thus, the reversal of the regioselectivity of the addition reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we described an unprecedented reversal of regioselectivity of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes triggered by Fe&#8722;H species for the formation of difluoroalkyl radicals. Hydrogenation of the in situ generated radicals gave difluoromethylated products. Mechanism experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the kinetic effect of the irreversible HAT process resulted in the reversal of the regioselectivity of this scenario, leading to the formation of a less stable &#945;&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical regioisomer. On basis of this new reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkene, the iron&#8208;promoted hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the efficient synthesis of aliphatic chlorodifluoromethyl&#8208;, bromodifluoromethyl&#8208; and iododifluoromethyl&#8208;containing compounds was developed. Particularly, this novel hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes provided an effect and large&#8208;scale access to various iododifluoromethylated compounds of high value for synthetic application.

         <title>A Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide with Ultrahigh Porosity for High&#8208;temperature and High&#8208;humidity Alkyne/Alkene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on phosphomolybdate is synthesized. The micropore of material is readily opened, which is suitable for adsorption of small molecules. The material shows high separation performance of alkyne and alkene particularly under high temperature and humidity conditions.







Abstract
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxide is a newly synthesized all&#8208;inorganic zeolitic material and has been used for adsorption, separation, and catalysis. Herein, a new zeolitic octahedral metal oxide was synthesized and characterized. The porous framework was established through the assembly of [P2Mo13O50] clusters with PO4 linkers. Guest molecules occupied the framework, which could be removed through heat treatment, thereby opening the micropores. The pore characteristics were controlled by the cations within the micropore, enabling the adjustment of the interactions with alkynes and alkenes. This resulted in good separation performance of ethylene/acetylene and propylene/propyne even under high temperature and humidity conditions. The high stability of the material enabled the efficient recovery and reuse without discernible loss in the separation performance. Due to the relatively weak interaction between the adsorbed alkyne and the framework, the adsorbent facilitated the recovery of a highly pure alkyne. This feature enhances the practical applicability of the material in various industrial processes.

         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with high melting points can be easily obtained from the copolymerization of phenylisothiocyanate and oxetane, as reported by Alex&#8197;J. Plajer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202405047). The resulting polythioimidocarbonate can then serve as the core&#8208;forming block in the crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a diblock copolymer, accessed employing a macro&#8208;chain transfer agent strategy.

The largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected Pt nanoclusters with atomic precision were reported by Lingwen Liao, Jun Yang, and Zhikun Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402565). The as&#8208;obtained Pt23 nanoclusters via a mixture ligand protecting strategy exhibit superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts, without requiring calcination or other treatments. An excellent photothermal conversion efficiency was also revealed, indicating great potential for applications of such materials.

The energy density of aqueous zinc ion batteries is greatly affected by the low energy density, low potential and low power density of the cathode material. In their Research Article (e202403187), Xijin Xu, Huiqiao Li et&#8197;al. report a method to activate and stabilize a highly reversible four&#8208;electron redox reaction between I&#8722; and I+ by introducing Br&#8722; as a mediator, which greatly promotes the capacity and effectively suppresses iodine shuttling for high cycling stability.

         <title>Detergent Chemistry Modulates the Transgression of Planetary Boundaries including Antimicrobial Resistance and Drug Discovery</title>

It's detergent o'clock and the role of detergent chemistry in transgressing Earth's resources is reviewed to support future research that secures safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival.







Abstract
Detergent chemistry enables applications in the world today while harming safe operating spaces that humanity needs for survival. Aim of this review is to support a holistic thought process in the design of detergent chemistry. We harness the planetary boundary concept as a framework for literature survey to identify progresses and knowledge gaps in context with detergent chemistry and five planetary boundaries that are currently transgressed, i.e., climate, freshwater, land system, novel entities, biosphere integrity. Our survey unveils the status of three critical challenges to be addressed in the years to come, including (i) the implementation of a holistically, climate&#8208;friendly detergent industry; (ii) the alignment of materialistic and social aspects in creating technical solutions by means of sustainable chemistry; (iii) the development of detergents that serve the purpose of applications but do not harm the biosphere in their role as novel entities. Specifically, medically relevant case reports revealed that even the most sophisticated detergent design cannot sufficiently accelerate drug discovery to outperform the antibiotic resistance development that detergents simultaneously promote as novel entities. Safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival may be secured by directing future efforts beyond sustainable chemistry, resource efficiency, and net zero emission targets.

         <title>In situ/Operando Synchrotron Radiation Analytical Techniques for CO2/CO Reduction Reaction: From Atomic Scales to Mesoscales</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically introduces the cross&#8208;scale applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR, covering electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal structure, and devices, spanning from atomic scales to mesoscopic scales.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CO(2)RR) has emerged as a prospective and appealing strategy to realize carbon neutrality for manufacturing sustainable chemical products. Developing highly active electrocatalysts and stable devices has been demonstrated as effective approach to enhance the conversion efficiency of CO(2)RR. In order to rationally design electrocatalysts and devices, a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic structure evolution within catalysts and micro&#8208;environment change around electrode interface, particularly under operation conditions, is indispensable. Synchrotron radiation has been recognized as a versatile characterization platform, garnering widespread attention owing to its high brightness, elevated flux, excellent directivity, strong polarization and exceptional stability. This review systematically introduces the applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR. By virtue of in situ/operando synchrotron radiationanalytical techniques, we also summarize relevant dynamic evolution processes from electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal lattice and devices, spanning scales from the angstrom to the micrometer. The merits and limitations of diverse synchrotron characterization techniques are summarized, and their applicable scenarios in CO(2)RR are further presented. On the basis of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fourth&#8208;generation synchrotron facilities, a perspective for further deeper understanding of the CO(2)RR process using synchrotron radiation analytical techniques is proposed.

The formation of inactive lithium is one of the main culprits of lithium metal battery failures. In this Minireview, the first of this kind, we summarized the formation of inactive lithium and reassessed its impact on battery performance metrics, discussed the cutting&#8208;edge of various strategies that have been devised to rejuvenate inactive lithium. By concluding existing strategies, we raised some unsolved questions and highlighted opportunities regarding inactive lithium and essential factors for reactivation strategies.







Abstract
The loss of active materials is one of the main culprits of the battery failures. As a typical example, the presence of inactive lithium, also known as &#8220;dead lithium&#8221;, contributes to the rapid capacity deterioration and reduces energy output in lithium batteries. This phenomenon has long been recognized as irreversible. In this Minireview, the first of this kind, we aim to summarize the formation of inactive lithium and reassess its impact on battery performance metrics. Additionally, we explore various strategies that have been devised to rejuvenate inactive lithium. This comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in reactivating inactive lithium not only offers insights into restoring capacity and enhancing battery performance metrics but also provides a foundation for future research in reviving other inactive materials found in next&#8208;generation batteries, such as lithium metal batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, other alkali metal batteries, and liquid flow batteries.

         <title>Molecular Symmetry and Art: Visualizing the Near&#8208;Symmetry of Molecules in Piet Mondrian's De Stijl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can we use asymmetric art to show symmetry? A new plot style, the Mondrian graph, is proposed as a method of displaying the concerted distortions of molecules, highlighting symmetry and the contribution of normal modes to solid&#8208;state conformation. The method of display borrows its artistic stylings from the works of Piet Mondrian&#8212;and speaks to how artistic and scientific conceptions of symmetry can be brought together.







Abstract
Symmetry and shape are essential aspects of molecular structure and how we interpret molecules and their properties. We, as chemists, are comfortable with pictorial representations of structure, in which some nuance is lost&#8212;investigating molecular shape numerically by looking at how closely it fits a reference, such as a plane, or a set of vectors or coordinates, is informative, though far from engaging. Often relationships between chemical structure and derived values are obscured. Taking our inspiration from Piet Mondrian's Compositions, we have depicted the symmetry information encoded within 3D data as blocks of color, to show clearly how chemical arguments and resultant molecular distortion may contribute to symmetry. Great art gives us a new perspective on the world; as a pastiche, this art may allow us to look at familiar molecules, such as porphyrins, in a new light, understanding how their shape and properties are intertwined.

         <title>Regiodivergent Hydrosilylation of Polar Enynes to Synthesize Site&#8208;Specific Silyl&#8208;Substituted Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, regiodivergent hydrosilylation reactions of enynoates were developed using platinum and ruthenium catalysts. Through meticulous substrate and catalyst design, high yields and stereoselectivities were achieved in obtaining silyl&#8208;substituted dienoates at various positions. Detailed DFT calculations identified the key factors governing regiocontrol in all three instances, which were consistent with experimental findings.







Abstract
Herein, we present catalyst&#8208;regulated switchable site&#8208;selective hydrosilylation of enynes, which are suitable for a wide range of alkyl and aryl substituted polar enynes and exhibit excellent functional group compatibility. Under the optimized conditions, silyl groups can be precisely installed at various positions of 1,3&#8208;dienes. While &#945;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;silylation products were obtained under platinum&#8208;catalytic systems, &#946;&#8208;silylation products were delivered with [Cp*RuCl]4 as catalyst. This process lead to the formation of 1,3&#8208;dienoates with diverse substitutions, which would pose challenges with other methodologies.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation Polymerization at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylative polymerization. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers with high molecular weights. Notably, the mild reaction conditions are beneficial in terms of chemoselectivity. Our strategy thus opens a new avenue for sustainable and highly selective polymerizations.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation polymerization (CHAP) is an attractive tool for constructing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers in a sustainable manner. However, the existing methods primarily rely on palladium catalysis, which usually entails harsh reaction conditions and branching/cross&#8208;linking. Here we report the first example of an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation polymerization induced by visible light irradiation. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers in excellent yields with high molecular weights. The remarkable feature of our mild reaction platform is represented by high chemoselectivity, leading to polymers that are otherwise inaccessible under conventional reaction conditions at high temperatures.

         <title>Electrochemical Asymmetric Radical Functionalization of Aldehydes Enabled by a Redox Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminocatalysis and electrochemistry cooperate, enabling SOMO&#8208;type transformations for asymmetric electrochemical synthesis. Electricity drives enantioselective radical processes via oxidation of catalytically generated enamines. Key is the use of a biphenyl redox shuttle to prevent catalyst degradation, yielding desired compounds with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Aminocatalysis is a well&#8208;established tool that enables the production of enantioenriched compounds under mild conditions. Its versatility is underscored by its seamless integration with various synthetic approaches. While the combination of aminocatalysis with metal catalysis, photochemistry, and stoichiometric oxidants has been extensively explored, its synergy with electrochemical activation remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present the successful merger of electrochemistry and aminocatalysis to perform SOMO&#8208;type transformations, expanding the toolkit for asymmetric electrochemical synthesis. The methodology harnesses electricity to drive the oxidation of catalytically generated enamines, which ultimately partake in enantioselective radical processes, leading to &#945;&#8208;alkylated aldehydes. Crucially, mechanistic studies highlight how this electrochemical strategy is enabled by the use of a redox shuttle, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxybiphenyl, to prevent catalyst degradation and furnishing the coveted compounds in good yield and high enantioselectivity.

         <title>An Artificial Enzyme for Asymmetric Nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes&#8212;Design and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of an artificial enzyme that features a secondary amine residue by genetic code expansion is described. The designer enzyme was evolved to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of cinnamaldehydes at high conversions with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The introduction of an abiological catalytic group into the binding pocket of a protein host allows for the expansion of enzyme chemistries. Here, we report the generation of an artificial enzyme by genetic encoding of a non&#8208;canonical amino acid that contains a secondary amine side chain. The non&#8208;canonical amino acid and the binding pocket function synergistically to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes by the iminium activation mechanism. The designer enzyme was evolved to an optimal variant that catalyzes the reaction at high conversions with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

     alt="An Artificial Enzyme for Asymmetric Nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated Aldehydes&#8212;Design and Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generation of an artificial enzyme that features a secondary amine residue by genetic code expansion is described. The designer enzyme was evolved to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of cinnamaldehydes at high conversions with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of an abiological catalytic group into the binding pocket of a protein host allows for the expansion of enzyme chemistries. Here, we report the generation of an artificial enzyme by genetic encoding of a non-canonical amino acid that contains a secondary amine side chain. The non-canonical amino acid and the binding pocket function synergistically to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes by the iminium activation mechanism. The designer enzyme was evolved to an optimal variant that catalyzes the reaction at high conversions with high diastereo- and enantioselectivity. This work demonstrates the application of genetic code expansion in enzyme design and expands the scope of enzyme-catalyzed abiological reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of an FeII Complex Exhibiting Intermolecular Proton Shifting Coupled Spin Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline material based on an FeII hydrazone complex was synthesized to observe intermolecular proton shifting. The complex exhibits reversible intermolecular proton shifting&#8208;coupled spin transition. This study paves the way for the development of novel functional materials with tunable properties.







Abstract
In this study, we investigated reversible intermolecular proton shifting (IPS) coupled with spin transition (ST) in a novel FeII complex. The host FeII complex and the guest carboxylic acid anion were connected by intermolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs). We extended the intramolecular proton transfer coupled ST phenomenon to the intermolecular system. The dynamic phenomenon was confirmed by variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron crystallography, and infrared spectroscopy. The mechanism of IPS was further validated using density functional theory calculations. The discovery of IPS&#8208;coupled ST in crystalline molecular materials provides good insights into fundamental processes and promotes the design of novel multifunctional materials with tunable properties for various applications, such as optoelectronics, information storage, and molecular devices.

A novel tetraphenylethene&#8208;based octacationic spirobicycle has been easily synthesized via one&#8208;step bicyclization based on the size&#8208;matching strategy. Through host&#8211;guest interaction with d(GpC) dinucleotide, the spirobicycle can capture a biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex within its dual cavities in the crystalline state and show the adaptive chirality sensing in the aqueous solution.







Abstract
In biological systems, nucleotide quadruplexes (such as G&#8208;quadruplexes) in DNA and RNA that are held together by multiple hydrogen bonds play a crucial functional role. The biomimetic formation of these hydrogen&#8208;bonded quadruplexes captured by artificial systems in water poses a significant challenge but can offer valuable insights into these complex functional structures. Herein, we report the formation of biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex captured by a tetraphenylethene (TPE) based octacationic spirobicycle (1). The spirobicyclic compound possesses a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crossing dual&#8208;cavity structure, which enables the encapsulation of four d(GpC) dinucleotide molecules, thereby realizing 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 host&#8211;guest complexation in water. The X&#8208;ray structure reveals that four d(GpC) molecules further form a two&#8208;layer G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex with Watson&#8211;Crick hydrogen bonds, which are stabilized within the dual hydrophobic cavities of 1 through the cooperative non&#8208;covalent interactions of hydrogen bonds, CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and hydrophobic effect. Due to the dynamically&#8208;rotational propeller chirality of TPE units, 1 with adaptive chirality can further serve as a chiroptical sensor to exhibit opposite Cotton effects with mirror&#8208;image CD spectra for the pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies of d(GpC) including the Watson&#8211;Crick G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C (pH&#8197;9.22) and Hoogsteen G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C+ (pH&#8197;5.74) quartets through the host&#8211;guest chirality transfer in water.

         <title>Efficient Tandem Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Click Synthesis of Multisugar&#8208;Modified Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional dendrimeric linker was developed that allows the modification of oligonucleotides in a tandem click reaction with multiple sugars in just one step. The method exploits different click reactivities of the linker azides in a copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction with alkynes. The new method is fast, highly selective and allows the modification of the oligonucleotide with multiple sugars at any given position.







Abstract
Nucleic acids in the form of siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides or mRNA are currently explored as new promising modalities in the pharmaceutical industry. Particularly, the success of mRNA&#8208;vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, along with the successful development of the first sugar&#8208;modified siRNA therapeutics has inspired the field. The development of nucleic acid therapeutics requires efficient chemistry to link oligonucleotides to chemical structures that can improve stability, boost cellular uptake, or enable specific targeting. For the siRNA therapeutics currently in use, modification of the 3&#8242;&#8208;end of the oligonucleotides with triple&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)3 was shown to be of significance. This modification is currently achieved through cumbersome multistep synthesis and subsequent loading onto the solid support material. Herein, we report the development of a bifunctional click&#8208;reactive linker that allows the modification of oligonucleotides in a tandem click reaction with multiple sugars, regardless of the position within the oligonucleotide, with remarkable efficiency and in a one&#8208;pot reaction.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive &#945;&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Carbonyl Addition of Ketimine to Construct the &#946;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl electrophile has been developed to access diversified enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;tertiary amino acid with excellent enantioselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of this protocol includes the efficient assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Tertiary amino acid derivatives constitute one of the most frequently occurring units in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this motif still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl compound as a radical precursor, providing expedient access to a diverse array of enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;quaternary amino acid analogues. This protocol exhibits outstanding enantioselectivity and broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanism studies rule out the possibility of Reformatsky&#8208;type addition and confirm the involvement of radical species in stereoselective addition process. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated through the rapid assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide, showcasing its versatile platform for late&#8208;stage modification of drug candidates.

         <title>Boryl Radical as a Catalyst in Enabling Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cascade Radical Cyclization Reactions: Construction of Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzimidazolium&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical catalyzes cascade cyclization reactions to construct polycyclic compounds both intra&#8208; and intermolecularly. This catalytic cascade radical reaction allows rapid construction of complex molecular architectures through the formation of two or three bonds in a single operation, respectively.







Abstract
Cascade radical cyclization constitutes an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route for rapid assembly of polycyclic molecular skeletons. Although an array of redox&#8208;active metal catalysts has recently shown robust applications in enabling various catalytic cascade radical processes, the use of free organic radical as the catalyst, which is capable of triggering strategically distinct cascades, has rarely been developed. Here, we disclosed that the benzimidazolium&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical is capable of catalyzing cascade cyclization reactions in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular pathways, assembling [5,5] fused bicyclic and [6,6,6] fused tricyclic molecules, respectively. The catalytic reactions start with the chemo&#8208; and regioselective addition of the boryl radical catalyst to a tethered alkene or alkyne moiety, followed by either an intramolecular formal [3+2] or an intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition process to construct bicyclo[3.3.0]octane or tetrahydrophenanthridine skeletons, respectively. Eventually, a &#946;&#8208;elimination occurs to release the boryl radical catalyst, completing a catalytic cycle. High to excellent diastereoselectivity is achieved in both catalytic reactions under substrate control.

         <title>Dissecting Exciton Dynamics in pH&#8208;Activatable Long&#8208;Wavelength Photosensitizers for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;specific activatable long&#8208;wavelength (LW) photosensitizers (PSs) show promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT), such as systemic phototoxicity and shallow tissue penetration. However, their insufficient LW light absorption and low singlet oxygen quantum yield (F1O2) usually require high laser power density to produce thermal energy and synergistically enhance PDT. The strong photothermal radiation causing acute pain significantly reduces patient compliance and hinders the broader clinical application of LW PDT. Through the exciton dynamics dissection strategy, we have developed a series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based LW PSs (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, I), among which the activated LET&#8208;I exhibits strong light absorption at 808 nm and a remarkable 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in F1O2 compared to indocyanine green. Transient spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed its significantly promoted intersystem crossing and simultaneously enhanced LW fluorescence emission characteristics. These features enable the activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;escorted complete photodynamic eradication of tumors by the folic acid (FA)&#8208;modified LET&#8208;I probe (LET&#8208;I&#8208;FA), under the ultralow 808 nm laser power density (0.2 W cm&#8208;2) for irradiation, without the need for photothermal energy synergy. This research presents a novel strategy of dissecting exciton dynamics to screen activatable LW PSs for traceable PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Structural Properties of the Rho GDP&#8208;Dissociation Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rho GTPases, master spatial regulators of a wide range of cellular processes, are orchestrated by complex formation with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs). These have been thought to possess an unstructured N&#8208;terminus that inhibits nucleotide exchange of their client upon binding/folding. Via NMR analyses, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical assays, we reveal instead pertinent structural properties transiently maintained both, in the presence and absence of the client, imposed onto the terminus context&#8208;specifically by modulating interactions with the surface of the folded C&#8208;terminal domain. These observations revise the long&#8208;standing textbook picture of the GTPases&#8217; mechanism of membrane extraction. Rather than by a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition upon binding of an inhibitory peptide, the intricate and highly selective extraction process of RhoGTPases is orchestrated via a dynamic ensemble bearing preformed transient structural properties, suitably modulated by the specific surrounding along the multi&#8208;step process.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Modulated Formation of Cyanine J&#8208;aggregates with Sharp and Tunable Spectra for Multiplexed Optoacoustic and Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>J&#8208;aggregation brings intriguing optical and electronic properties to molecular dyes and significantly expands their applicability across diverse domains, yet the challenge for rationally designing J&#8208;aggregating dyes persists. Herein, we developed a large number of J&#8208;aggregating dyes from scratch by progressively refining structure of a common heptamethine cyanine. J&#8208;aggregates with sharp spectral bands (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum &#8201;&#8804; &#8201;38&#8201;nm) are attained by introducing a branched structure featuring a benzyl and a trifluoroacetyl group at meso&#8208;position of dyes. Fine&#8208;tuning the benzyl group enables spectral regulation of J&#8208;aggregates. Analysis of single crystal data of nine dyes reveals a correlation between J&#8208;aggregation propensity and molecular arrangement within crystals. Some J&#8208;aggregates are successfully implemented in multiplexed optoacoustic and fluorescence imaging in animals. Notably, three&#8208;color multispectral optoacoustic tomography imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution is achieved, owing to the sharp and distinct absorption bands of the J&#8208;aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrate Upcycling Mediated by Organonickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are major environmental pollutants and to neutralize this long&#8208;term environmental threat, new catalytic methods are needed. Although there are biological denitrification processes involving four different enzymatic reactions to convert nitrate (NO3&#8211;) to dinitrogen (N2), it is unfortunately difficult to apply in industry due to the complexity of the processes. In particular, nitrate is difficult to functionalize because of its chemical stability. Thus, there is no organometallic catalysis to convert nitrate to useful chemicals. In this article, we present that a nickel pincer complex is effective as a bifunctional catalyst to stepwise deoxygenate NO3&#8211; by carbonylation and further to C&#8211;N coupling. By using this nickel catalysis, nitrate salts can be selectively transformed into various oximes (&gt;20 substrates) with excellent conversion (&gt;90%). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the highly inert nitrate ion can be functionalized to produce useful chemicals by a new organonickel catalysis. Our results show that the NOx conversion and utilization (NCU) technology is a successful pathway for environmental restoration coupled with value&#8208;added chemical generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Symmetry Breaking&#8208;induced Hubbard Gap Near&#8208;Closure in N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), however, their performance is hindered by a substantial Hubbard gap, which limits electron transfer and battery cyclability. Addressing this, we introduce a heteroatom coordination approach, using triethanolamine to induce axial N coordination on Mn centers in MnO2, yielding N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 (TEAMO). This approach leverages the change of electronegativity disparity between Mn and ligands (O and N) to disrupt spin symmetry and augment spin polarization. This enhancement leads to the closure of the Hubbard gap, primarily driven by the intensified occupancy of the Mn eg orbitals. The resultant TEAMO exhibit a significant increase in storage capacity, reaching 351 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1. Our findings suggest a viable strategy for optimizing the electronic structure of TMO cathodes, enhancing the potential of ZIBs in energy storage technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(Dibenzothiophene&#8208;Terphenyl Piperidinium) for High&#8208;performance Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is widely regarded as the next&#8208;generation technology for producing green hydrogen. The OH&#8208; conductivity of the anion exchange membrane plays a key role in the practical implementation of this device. Here, we present a series of Z&#8208;S&#8208;x membranes with dibenzothiophene groups. These membranes contain sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks that link surrounding surface site hopping regions, forming continuous OH&#8208; conducting highways. Z&#8208;S&#8208;20 has a high through&#8208;plane OH&#8208; conductivity of 182 &#177; 28 mS cm&#8208;1 and ultralong stability of 2650 h in KOH solution at 80 &#176;C. Based on rational design, we achieved a high PGM&#8208;free alkaline water electrolysis performance of 7.12 A cm&#8208;2 at 2.0 V in a flow cell and demonstrated durability of 650 h at 2 A cm&#8208;2 at 40 &#176;C with a cell voltage increase of 0.65 mV/h.</dc:description>

         <title>Stochastic Sensing of Chloride Anions Using an &#945;&#8208;Hemolysin Pore with semiaza&#8208;Bambusuril Adapter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pores containing molecular adapters provide internal selective binding sites, thereby allowing the stochastic sensing of analytes. Herein, we demonstrate that semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) acts as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter when lodged within the lumen of the wild&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (WT&#8208;&#945;HL) protein pore. Because the bambusurils are recognized as anion receptors, the anion binding site within the adapter&#8208;nanopore complex allows the detection of chloride anions, thus converting a non&#8208;selective pore into an anion sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced UV Nonlinear Optical Properties in Layered Germanous Phosphites through Functional Group Sequential Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study pioneers a novel strategy for synthesizing   solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals through functional groups sequential construction, effectively addressing the inherent trade&#8208;offs among broad transmittance, enhanced second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and optimal birefringence. We have developed two innovative van der Waals layered germanous phosphites: GeHPO3, the first Ge(II)&#8208;based oxide NLO crystal which exhibits a black phosphorus&#8208;like structure, and K(GeHPO3)2Br, distinguished by its exceptional birefringence and graphene&#8208;like structure. Significantly, GeHPO3 exhibits a remarkable array of NLO properties, including the highest SHG coefficient recorded among all NLO crystals for phase&#8208;matching and generating 266 nm coherent light via quadruple frequency conversion. It delivers a potent SHG intensity, surpassing KH2PO4 (KDP) by 10.3 times at 1064 nm and &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 by 1.3 times at 532 nm, complemented by a distinct UV absorption edge at 211 nm and moderate birefringence of 0.062 at 546 nm. Comprehensive theoretical analysis links these exceptional characteristics to the unique NLO&#8208;active GeO34&#8208; units and the distinctive, highly ordered layered structures. Our findings deliver essential experimental insights into the development of Ge(II)&#8208;based optoelectronic materials and present a strategic blueprint for engineering structure&#8208;driven functional materials with customized properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Activated Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Fluorescence and SERS Dynamic&#8208;Reversible Probes for Long&#8208;Term Assessment of Osteoarthritis In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The abnormal fluctuation of temperature in vivo usually reflects the progression of inflammatory diseases. Noninvasive, real&#8208;time, and accurate monitoring and imaging of temperature variation in vivo is advantageous for guiding the early diagnosis and treatment of disease, but it remains difficult to achieve. Herein, we developed a temperature&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II FL) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobe for long&#8208;term monitoring of temperature changes in rat arthritis and timely assessment of the status of osteoarthritis. The thermosensitive polymer bearing NIR&#8208;II FL dye was grafted onto the surface of nanoporous core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructures to form the nanoprobe, wherein the nanoprobe contains NIR&#8208;II FL and Raman reference signals that are independent of temperature change. The ratiometric FL1150/FL1550 and S1528/S2226 values of the nanoprobe exhibited a reversible conversion with temperature changes. The nanoprobe accurately distinguishes the temperature variations in the inflamed joint versus the normal joint in vivo by ratiometric FL and SERS imaging, allowing for an accurate diagnosis of inflammation. Meanwhile, it can continuously monitor fluctuations in temperature over an extended period during the onset and treatment of inflammation. The tested temperature change trend could be used as an indicator for early diagnosis of inflammation and real&#8208;time evaluation of therapeutic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Cross&#8208;Electrophile C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) Coupling via a NiII Aryl Amido Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) between aryl halides and alkyl halides is a streamlined approach for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond construction, which is highly valuable in medicinal chemistry. Based on a key NiII aryl amido intermediate, we developed a highly selective and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical XEC reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and primary and secondary alkyl halides. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that an amine secondary ligand slows down the oxidative addition process of the Ni&#8208;polypyridine catalyst to the aryl bromide and a NiII aryl amido intermediate is formed in&#8208;situ during the reaction process. The relatively slow oxidative addition is beneficial for enhancing the selectivity of the XEC reaction. The NiII aryl amido intermediate stabilizes the NiII&#8722;aryl species to prevent the aryl&#8722;aryl homo&#8208;coupling side reactions and acts as a catalyst to activate the alkyl bromide substrates. This electrosynthesis system provides a facile, practical, and scalable platform for the formation of (hetero)aryl&#8722;alkyl bonds using standard Ni catalysts under mild conditions. The mechanistic insights from this work could serve as a great foundation for future studies on Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a photochemical method for the semipinacol rearrangement of unactivated allylic alcohols. Aliphatic as well as aromatic groups participate as migrating groups, yielding a variety of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with ethers, esters, halides, nitriles, carbamates, and substituted arenes. The operationally simple and fully catalytic conditions prescribe 1 mol% benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst, 0.5 mol% Co&#8208;salen, and 10 mol% lutidinium triflate and, importantly, display reactivity complementary to procedures employing Br&#248;nsted acid. We showcase the utility of the protocol in late&#8208;stage drug diversifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Picturing the Gap Between the Performance and US&#8208;DOE's Hydrogen Storage Target: A Data&#8208;Driven Model for MgH2 Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a data&#8208;driven strategy, we developed models to illustrate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of MgH2&#8208;based materials in solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. This model also shows the current gap between their performance and the US&#8208;DOE goal.







Abstract
Developing solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials is as pressing as ever, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the dehydrogenation chemistry of a solid&#8208;state hydride. Transition state search and kinetics calculations are essential to understanding and designing high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials by filling in the knowledge gap that current experimental techniques cannot measure. However, the ab initio analysis of these processes is computationally expensive and time&#8208;consuming. Searching for descriptors to accurately predict the energy barrier is urgently needed, to accelerate the prediction of hydrogen storage material properties and identify the opportunities and challenges in this field. Herein, we develop a data&#8208;driven model to describe and predict the dehydrogenation barriers of a typical solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride (MgH2), based on the combination of the crystal Hamilton population orbital of Mg&#8722;H bond and the distance between atomic hydrogen. By deriving the distance energy ratio, this model elucidates the key chemistry of the reaction kinetics. All the parameters in this model can be directly calculated with significantly less computational cost than conventional transition state search, so that the dehydrogenation performance of hydrogen storage materials can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we found that this model leads to excellent agreement with typical experimental measurements reported to date and provides clear design guidelines on how to propel the performance of MgH2 closer to the target set by the United States Department of Energy (US&#8208;DOE).

         <title>A Versatile Microfluidic Platform for Extravasation Studies Based on DNA Origami&#8212;Cell Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier using a porous membrane decorated with DNA origami nanostructures displaying adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device allows visualization of cell transmigration under physiological flow conditions, revealing influences of adhesion peptide type, spatial arrangement, and density on the extravasation of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.







Abstract
The adhesion of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to the endothelial lumen and their extravasation to surrounding tissues are crucial in the seeding of metastases and remain the most complex events of the metastatic cascade to study. Integrins expressed on CTCs are major regulators of the extravasation process. This knowledge is primarily derived from animal models and biomimetic systems based on artificial endothelial layers, but these methods have ethical or technical limitations. We present a versatile microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier by using a porous membrane functionalized with DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) that display nanoscale patterns of adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device simulates physiological flow conditions and allows direct visualization of cell transmigration through microchannel pores using 3D confocal imaging. Using this system, we studied integrin&#8208;specific adhesion in the absence of other adhesive events. Specifically, we show that the transmigration ability of the metastatic cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 is influenced by the type, distance, and density of adhesion peptides present on the DONs. Furthermore, studies with mixed ligand systems indicate that integrins binding to RGD (arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid) and IDS (isoleucine&#8208;aspartic acid&#8208;serine) did not synergistically enhance the extravasation process of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.

         <title>Ligand Meta&#8208;Anchoring Strategy in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Remarkable Promotion of Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is reported to promote the quantum yields of luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks through the restriction of intramolecular motions.







Abstract
Aggregation is a conventional method to enhance the quantum yields (QYs) of pure organic luminophores due to the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM). However, how to realize RIM in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is still unclear and challenging. In this work, the ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is first proposed and proved to be an effective and systematic approach to restrict the intramolecular motions of MOFs for the QY improvement. By simply shifting the substituent position in the ligand from para to meta, the QY of the resulting MOF is significantly enhanced by eleven&#8208;fold. The value is even higher than that of ligand aggregates, demonstrating the strong RIM effect of this ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy. The introduction of co&#8208;ligand induces the appearance of visible yellow room temperature phosphorescence with a lifetime of 222&#8197;ms due to the QY enhancement and the charge transfer between the donor and accepter units. The present work thus broadens the understanding of the RIM mechanism from a new perspective, develops a novel method to realize RIM and expands the applicable objects from pure organic materials to organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Enhanced Photoreforming of Biomass Furans over a Urea&#8208;Incorporated Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A urea&#8208;incorporated porphyrin framework can activate molecular oxygen to generate selectively &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 and enable the flat adsorption of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural in a low&#8208;energy configuration leveraging on hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, leading to highly efficient photo&#8208;oxidation that produces bioplastic monomers from renewable feedstocks without over&#8208;oxidation and photo&#8208;corrosion.

Solar&#8208;driven upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) holds great promise for sustainable production of bio&#8208;plastics and resins. However, the process is limited by poor selectivity and sluggish kinetics due to the vertical coordination of HMF at relatively strong metal sites. Here, we purposely developed a Cu(II) porphyrin framework featuring side&#8208;chain incorporated urea linkages, denoted as TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF, to render HMF a weak hydrogen bond at the urea site and flat adsorption via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking with the benzene moiety. The unique configuration promotes the approaching of &#8722;CHO of HMF to the photoexcited porphyrin ring towards kinetically and thermodynamically favourable intermediate formation and subsequent desorption. The charge localisation and orbital energy alignment enable the selective activation of O2 over the porphyrin to generate &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 instead of highly oxidative H2O2 and &#8901;OH via spin&#8208;flip electron transfer, which drive the ambient oxidation of proximal &#8722;CHO. The effective utilisation of redox species and circumvented over&#8208;oxidation facilitate a FDCA selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% with a high turnover number of 193&#8197;molHMF&#8201;molCu&#8722;1. The facile purification of high&#8208;purity FDCA and zero&#8208;waste recycling of intermediates and durable catalyst feature TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF a promising photo&#8208;oxidation platform towards net&#8208;zero biorefining and organic transformations.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Growth of Convex Sphere with Adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) Interfaces for Effective C2 Production from CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tightly&#8208;coupled adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface manufactured by a bottom&#8208;up growth strategy exhibits outstanding selectivity and stability of CO2RR. The convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface promotes the dimerization of localized *CO adsorbate, thus form the C2 products with a lowered energy barrier.







Abstract
One challenge confronting the Cu2O catalysts in the electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is the reduction of active Cu(I) species, resulting in low selectivity and quick deactivation. In this study, we for the first time introduce a bottom&#8208;up growth of convex sphere with adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interfaces (Cux@Cu2O convex spheres). Interestingly, the interfaces are dynamically modulated by varying hydrothermal time, thus regulating the conversion of C1 and C2 products. In particular, the 4&#8197;h hydrothermal treatment applied to Cu0.25@Cu2O convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface results in the highest selectivity for C2 products (90.5&#8201;%). In situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface lowers the energy barrier for the production of ethylene and ethanol while increasing the coverage of localized *CO adsorbate for increased dimerization. This work establishes a novel approach for transforming the state of valence&#8208;sensitive electrocatalysts into high&#8208;value energy&#8208;related engineering products.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Driven Dispersion of Bismuth Nanoparticles among Carbon Matrix for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique thermal&#8208;driven strategy is proposed to re&#8208;disperse bismuth core into nanoparticles among porous carbon shell, inhibiting the aggregation to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability.







Abstract
The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C&#8208;700&#8208;4) simply by a thermal&#8208;driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for CO2 reduction into formate. The in situ experimental observations on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO2 and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8&#8201;% and the long&#8208;time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar&#8208;driven system renders the high 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2&#8201;%, presenting the impressive solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Kinase Inhibition via Small Molecule&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Protein Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report ynamide&#8208;based, small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. This strategy exploits the close distance between highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues present in almost all protein kinases, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and cellular potency.







Abstract
Remarkable progress has been made in the development of cysteine&#8208;targeted covalent inhibitors. In kinase drug discovery, covalent inhibitors capable of targeting other nucleophilic residues (i.e. lysine, or K) have emerged in recent years. Besides a highly conserved catalytic lysine, almost all human protein kinases possess an equally conserved glutamate/aspartate (e.g. E/D) that forms a K&#8211;E/D salt bridge within the enzyme's active site. Electrophilic ynamides were previously used as effective peptide coupling reagents and to develop E/D&#8208;targeting covalent protein inhibitors/probes. In the present study, we report the first ynamide&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of various protein kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. Our strategy took advantage of the close distance between the highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues in a targeted kinase, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and desirable cellular potency. Finally, this ynamide&#8208;facilitated, ligand&#8208;induced mechanism leading to intramolecular kinase cross&#8208;linking and inhibition was unequivocally established by using recombinant ABL kinase as a representative.

Cyclotetramerization of 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrroles affords a novel class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins in good yields. Both regioisomers of the Ir&#8208;complex catalyze efficiently the carbene C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion reaction.







Abstract
A hitherto unknown class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins has been synthesized and the application of their iridium (Ir) complexes in catalytic asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization is documented. Cyclotetramerization of enantioenriched axially chiral 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;naphthyl pyrroles under mild acidic conditions affords, after oxidation with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ), the C4&#8208;symmetric &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;atropenantiomer as an only isolable diastereomer. Both regioisomeric Ir(Por*)(CO)(Cl) complexes catalyze the carbene C&#8722;H insertion reaction affording the same enantiomer, albeit with slight difference in enantioselectivity. With the optimum Ir&#8208;complex 3&#8201;e, the 2&#8208;substituted arylacetic acid derivatives were generated from diazo compounds and cyclohexadiene in excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

Cyclotetramerization of enantioenriched axially chiral 2-hydroxymethyl-3-naphthyl pyrroles under mild acidic conditions affords, after oxidation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ), the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;-atropenantiomer as an only isolable diastereomer. Both regioisomeric Ir(Por*)(CO)(Cl) complexes catalyze the carbene C&#8722;H insertion reaction affording the same enantiomer, albeit with slight difference in enantioselectivity. With the optimum Ir-complex &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;e&lt;/b&gt;, the 2-substituted arylacetic acid derivatives were generated from diazo compounds and cyclohexadiene in excellent yields and enantioselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Condensed and Super&#8208;Incompressible Be2PN3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be&#8208;containing nitrides are sparsely investigated. The herein presented Be2PN3 expands the synthetic approach to highly condensed beryllium nitrides under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions. The comprehensive analytic combines powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, 9Be and 31P solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as infrared spectroscopy, among others.

Abstract
Although beryllium and its compounds show outstanding properties, owing to its toxic potential and extreme reaction conditions the chemistry of Be under high&#8208;pressure conditions has only been investigated sparsely. Herein, we report on the highly condensed wurtzite&#8208;type Be2PN3, which was synthesized from Be3N2 and P3N5 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 9&#8197;GPa and 1500&#8201;&#176;C. It is the missing member in the row of formula type M2PN3 (M&#160;=&#160;Mg, Zn). The structure was elucidated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), revealing that Be2PN3 is a double nitride, rather than a nitridophosphate. The structural model was further corroborated by 9Be and 31P solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We present 9Be NMR data for tetrahedral nitride coordination for the first time. Infrared and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (FTIR and EDX), as well as temperature dependent PXRD complement the analytical characterization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal super&#8208;incompressible behavior and the remarkable hardness of this low&#8208;density material. The formation of Be2PN3 through a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach expands the synthetic access to Be&#8208;containing compounds and may open access to various multinary beryllium nitrides.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Concentration Mediating Asymmetric Transformations of Silver Nanoclusters: NIR&#8208;II Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence Lighting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral ligand&#8208;concentration mediating asymmetric transformations of silver nanoclusters realize visible and second near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized phosphorescences.







Abstract
Near infrared (NIR) emitter with circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), known as NIR CPP, has emerged as a key part in the research of cutting&#8208;edge luminescent materials. However, it remains a challenge to obtain nanoclusters with NIR CPP activity. Here, we propose an asymmetric transformation approach to efficiently synthesize two pairs of chiral silver nanoclusters (R/S&#8208;Ag29 and R/S&#8208;Ag16) using an achiral Ag10 nanocluster as starting material in the presence of different concentration chiral inducer (R/S)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl hydrogenphosphate (R/S&#8208;BNP). R/S&#8208;Ag29, formed in the low&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, exhibits a unique kernel&#8208;shell structure consisting of a distorted Ag13 icosahedron and an integrated cage&#8208;like organometallic shell with a C3 symmetry, and possesses a superatomic 6&#8208;electron configuration (1S2|1P4). By contrast, R/S&#8208;Ag16, formed in the high&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, features a sandwich&#8208;like pentagram with AgI&#8208;pure kernel. Profiting from the hierarchically chiral structures and superatomic kernel&#8208;dominated phosphorescence, R/S&#8208;Ag29 exhibits infrequent CPP activity in the second near&#8208;infrared (975&#8197;nm) region, being the first instance of NIR&#8208;II CPP observed among CPL&#8208;active metal nanoclusters. This study presents a new approach to reduce the difficulty of de novo synthesis for chiral silver nanomaterials, and facilitates the design of CPP&#8208;active superatomic nanoclusters in NIR region.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution Polymerization Enabled Chemical Synthesis of Perfectly Isotactic Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of chemically synthetic methods to prepare isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) has been a formidable challenge. Here we report the successful synthesis of a perfectly isotactic PTE via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalysed by binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al). This kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure monomer, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block.







Abstract
Isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) that are thioester analogs to natural polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted growing attention due to their distinct properties. However, the development of chemically synthetic methods for preparing isotactic PTEs has long been an intricate endeavour. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of perfectly isotactic PTEs via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization. This binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al) catalyst promoted a robust polymerization of rac&#8208;&#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;propiothiolactones (rac&#8208;BTL and rac&#8208;PTL) with highly kinetic resolution, affording perfectly isotactic P(BTL) and P(PTL) with Mn up to 276&#8197;kDa. Impressively, the isotactic P(BTL) formed a supramolecular stereocomplex with improved thermal property (Tm=204&#8201;&#176;C). Ultimately, this kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure (S)&#8208;BTL, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block (S)&#8208;2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;propanoic acid. Isotactic P(PTL) served as a tough and ductile material comparable to the commercialized polyolefins. This synthetic system allowed to access of isotactic PTEs, establishing a powerful platform for the discovery of sustainable plastics.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Bearing Large Pore Apertures and Multiple Active Sites for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two mesoporous 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF) were synthesized as cathode host materials for polyiodides in aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries. Among them, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, distinguished by the largest pore size (3.9&#8197;nm) among reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, demonstrated higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and exceptional cycling performance (maintaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with large pore sizes and high surface areas are advantageous for adsorbing iodine species to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs). However, most of the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs feature microporous structures, with few examples exhibiting mesoporous characteristics. Herein, we developed two mesoporous 2D c&#8208;MOFs, namely PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, using newly designed arylimide based multitopic catechol ligands (6OH&#8208;PA&#8208;TAPA and 8OH&#8208;PA&#8208;PyTTA). Notably, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF exhibits the largest pore sizes (3.9&#8197;nm) among all reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs.

&lt;p&gt;Two mesoporous 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (PA-TAPA&#8722;Cu-MOF and PA-PyTTA&#8722;Cu-MOF) were synthesized as cathode host materials for polyiodides in aqueous dual-ion batteries. Among them, PA-TAPA&#8722;Cu-MOF, distinguished by the largest pore size (3.9&#8197;nm) among reported 2D &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-MOFs, demonstrated higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and exceptional cycling performance (maintaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-MOFs) with large pore sizes and high surface areas are advantageous for adsorbing iodine species to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous dual-ion batteries (ADIBs). However, most of the reported 2D &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-MOFs feature microporous structures, with few examples exhibiting mesoporous characteristics. Herein, we developed two mesoporous 2D &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-MOFs, namely PA-TAPA&#8722;Cu-MOF and PA-PyTTA&#8722;Cu-MOF, using newly designed arylimide based multitopic catechol ligands (6OH-PA-TAPA and 8OH-PA-PyTTA). Notably, PA-TAPA&#8722;Cu-MOF exhibits the largest pore sizes (3.9&#8197;nm) among all reported 2D &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-MOFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these 2D &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-MOFs can serve as promising cathode host materials for polyiodides in ADIBs for the first time. The incorporation of triphenylamine moieties in PA-TAPA&#8722;Cu-MOF resulted in a higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and superior cycling performance, retaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; compared to PA-PyTTA&#8722;Cu-MOF. Our comparative analysis revealed that the increased number of N anchoring sites and larger pore size in PA-TAPA&#8722;Cu-MOF facilitate efficient anchoring and conversion of I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>A New Family of High Oxidation State Antiperovskite Nitrides: La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn and Mo)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) are the first examples of ternary antiperovskite (Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type) nitrides containing [MN4]6&#8722; anions for M=Cr and Mo, but for M=Mn off&#8208;stoichiometry modelled by excess&#8208;nitride clusters gives La3MnN5.30 with Mn oxidised almost to the +7 state. This is the first report of excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials, and this or other mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.







Abstract
Three new nitrides La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) have been synthesized using a high pressure azide route. These are the first examples of ternary Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type nitrides, and show that this (MN4)NLa3 antiperovskite structure type may be used to stabilise high oxidation&#8208;state transition metals in tetrahedral molecular [MN4]n&#8722; nitridometallate anions. Magnetic measurements confirm that Cr and Mo are in the M6+ state, but the M=Mn phase has an anomalously small paramagnetic moment and large cell volume. Neutron powder diffraction data are fitted using an anion&#8208;excess La3MnN5.30 model (space group I4/mcm, a=6.81587(9)&#8197;&#197; and c=11.22664(18)&#8197;&#197; at 200&#8197;K) in which Mn is close to the +7 state. Excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials has not been previously reported, and this or other substitution mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.

         <title>Design of Solid Polycationic Electrolyte to Enable Durable Chloride&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion battery based on a low&#8208;cost Al metal anode supported by a solid polycation electrolyte. This polycation electrolyte tailors a coordination structure that facilitates ions transport and eliminates hazard issues, thus enabling Al||FeOCl cells with high capacity, excellent interfacial compatibility, and long lifespan.







Abstract
The high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of chloride&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) make them promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of CIBs is greatly restricted by the lack of compatible electrolytes to support cost&#8208;effective anodes. Herein, we present a rationally designed solid polycationic electrolyte (SPE) to enable room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion batteries utilizing aluminum (Al) metal as an anode. This SPE endows the CIB configuration with improved air stability and safety (i.e. free of flammability and liquid leakage). A high ionic conductivity (1.3&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) has been achieved by the well&#8208;tailored coordination structure of the SPE. Meanwhile, the solid polycationic electrolyte ensures stable electrodes|electrolyte interfaces, which effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites on the Al anodes and degradation of the FeOCl cathodes. The Al|SPE|FeOCl chloride&#8208;ion batteries showcased a high discharge capacity around 250&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (based on the cathodes) and extended lifespan. Our electrolyte design opens a new avenue for developing low&#8208;cost chloride&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Molecular Wiring of Electrocatalytic Nitrate reduction to Ammonia and Water Oxidation by Iron&#8208;Coordinated Macroporous Conductive Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site active iron electrocatalysts is reported by integration of a solvated iron complex in conductive organic networks. Sufficient coordinatively unsaturated active sites can be created electrochemically for simultaneous NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 and H2O oxidation to O2 in basic media.







Abstract
Developing stable electrocatalysts with accessible isolated sites is desirable but highly challenging due to metal agglomeration and low surface stability of host materials. Here we report a general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site Fe electrocatalysts by integrating a solvated Fe complex in conductive macroporous organic networks through redox&#8208;active coordination linkages. Electrochemical activation of the electrode exposes high&#8208;density coordinately unsaturated Fe sites for efficient adsorption and conversion of reaction substrates such as NO3&#8722; and H2O. Using the electrode with isolated active Fe sites, electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction and H2O oxidation can be coupled in a single cell to produce NH3 and O2 at Faradaic efficiencies of 97&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively. The electrode exhibits excellent robustness in electrocatalysis for 200&#8197;hours with small decrease in catalytic efficiencies. Both the maximized Fe&#8208;site efficiency and the microscopic localization effect of the conductive organic matrix contribute to the high catalytic performances, which provides new understandings in tuning the efficiencies of metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic cells.

         <title>H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;Derived Chiral &#951;6&#8208;Benzene Ligands: New Opportunities for the Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of (S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene ligands has been developed, which can coordinate with ruthenium(II) highly site&#8208;selectively.The related chiral ruthenium(II) catalysts proved highly effective for the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a series of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Given the tremendous success of (p&#8208;cymene)RuII&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation over the past 20&#8197;years, the community has long been aware that the development of chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene (Ben) ligands should be a potent strategy for achieving the attractive but incredibly underdeveloped ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. However, it has rarely been achieved due to the severe difficulty in developing proper chiral Ben ligands. In particular, designing chiral Ben ligands by connecting a benzene fragment to a chiral framework including benzene rings remained an unsolved challenge until this effort.

&lt;p&gt;A class of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-BINOL-derived chiral &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-benzene ligands has been developed, which can coordinate with ruthenium(II) highly site-selectively.The related chiral ruthenium(II) catalysts proved highly effective for the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N-sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a series of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% ee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the tremendous success of (p-cymene)Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed C&#8722;H activation over the past 20&#8197;years, the community has long been aware that the development of chiral &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-benzene (Ben) ligands should be a potent strategy for achieving the attractive but incredibly underdeveloped ruthenium(II)-catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. However, it has rarely been achieved due to the severe difficulty in developing proper chiral Ben ligands. In particular, designing chiral Ben ligands by connecting a benzene fragment to a chiral framework including benzene rings remained an unsolved challenge until this effort. Here we present a novel class of axially chiral Ben ligands derived from readily available (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;-octahydro-1,1&#8242;-bi-2-naphthol ((&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-BINOL) in 4&#8211;8 steps. Notably, when coordinated with ruthenium, such chiral Ben ligand containing three benzene rings only forms one of the three possible isomeric BenRu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. The related chiral BenRu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; catalysts could effectively catalyze the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N-sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a range of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% ee. These catalysts are expected to find broad applications in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinetic Control of Complexity in Multiple Dynamic Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report how all the components of two dynamic libraries generated by two reversible processes, were eventually funneled towards kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Moreover, such intercommunication can be designed to be latent, and emergent supramolecular and luminescent properties could be modified by simply activating the communication.







Abstract
Multiple dynamic libraries of compounds are generated when more than one reversible reaction comes into play. Commonly, two or more orthogonal reversible reactions are used, leading to non&#8208;communicating dynamic libraries which share no building blocks. Only a few examples of communicating libraries have been reported, and in all those cases, building blocks are reversibly exchanged from one library to the other, constituting an antiparallel dynamic covalent system. Herein we report that communication between two different dynamic libraries through an irreversible process is also possible. Indeed, alkyl amines cancel the dynamic regime on the nucleophilic substitution of tetrazines, generating kinetically inert compounds. Interestingly, such amine can be part of another dynamic library, an imine&#8208;amine exchange. Thus, both libraries are interconnected with each other by an irreversible process which leads to kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Additionally, a latent irreversible intercommunication could be developed. In such a way, a stable molecular system with specific host&#8211;guest and fluorescence properties, could be irreversibly transformed when the right stimulus was applied, triggering the cancellation of the original supramolecular and luminescent properties and the emergence of new ones.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Driven Efficient Conversion of CO2 and H2O into Pure Syngas with Controllable Wide H2/CO Ratios over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Featuring In Situ Evolved Ligand Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and confined H2O into pure syngas with controllable wide H2/CO ratios is presented. The ligand defect&#8208;induced in situ dynamic structure evolution of porous MOF catalyst favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics and the resultantly reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps.







Abstract
While the mild production of syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) from CO2 and H2O is a promising alternative to the coal&#8208;based chemical engineering technologies, the inert nature of CO2 molecules, unfavorable splitting pathways of H2O and unsatisfactory catalysts lead to the challenge in the difficult integration of high CO2 conversion efficiency with produced syngas with controllable H2/CO ratios in a wide range. Herein, we report an efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic system for mild production of pure syngas over porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalysts with rich confined H2O molecules, where their syngas production capacity is regulated by the in situ evolved ligand defects and the plasma&#8208;activated intermediate species of CO2 molecules. Specially, the Cu&#8208;based catalyst system achieves 61.9&#8201;% of CO2 conversion and the production of pure syngas with wide H2/CO ratios of 0.05&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;4.3&#8201;:&#8201;1. As revealed by the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the in situ dynamic structure evolution of Cu&#8208;containing MOF catalysts favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics, the adsorption of reactants, and the reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps of the hydrogenation of CO2 to *COOH and the protonation of H2O to *H.

         <title>Dimensional Regulation in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskites by Compositional Engineering to Achieve Record Low X&#8208;Ray Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work innovatively utilizes compositional engineering to tailor octahedra, achieving a dimensional evolution in metal&#8208;free perovskites, and reports on metal&#8208;free perovskites with a two&#8208;dimensional structure for the first time. With the evolution in dimensions, there is a significant variation in their fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Importantly, the 2D SC&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector achieved an ultra&#8208;low LOD of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Utilizing the manipulation of perovskite dimensions has been proven as an effective approach in regulating perovskite properties. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over the dimensions of perovskites within the same system poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a sophisticated method to attain precise dimensional control in metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs), specifically through the process of octahedron tailoring by compositional engineering. Accordingly, we successfully instigated a transition from HPIP&#8722;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (3D), HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 (2D) and HPIP3&#8722;NH4I7 (1D) structures. Notably, HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 is the first 2D MFP. As anticipated, these perovskites exhibited completely distinct fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities due to their differing dimensions. Remarkably, the 2D HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 device effectively hindered ion migration perpendicular to the 2D layers, achieving the lowest detection limit of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 among metal&#8208;free single crystals&#8208;based detectors. This study expands the dimensionality control strategies for MFPs and introduces, for the first time, the potential of 2D MFPs as high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors, thereby enriching the diversity of the MFPs family.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Heterostructured Lamellar Membranes Enable Highly Efficient Rejection of Charged Mass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D nanochannels with built&#8208;in electric fields were constructed by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets to manipulate ion transport, achieving a high rejection of salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases and simultaneously ultrafast water transport, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous charge nanochannel membranes.







Abstract
Separation membranes with homogeneous charge channels are the mainstream to reject charged mass by forming electrical double layer (EDL). However, the EDL often compresses effective solvent transport space and weakens channel&#8208;ion interaction. Here, built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs) are constructed in lamellar membranes by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets, which contain alternate positively&#8208;charged nanodomains and negatively&#8208;charged nanodomains. We demonstrate that the BIEFs are perpendicular to horizontal channel and the direction switches alternately, significantly weakening the EDL effect and forces ions to repeatedly collide with channel walls. Thus, highly efficient rejection for charged mass (salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases) and ultrafast water transport are achieved. Moreover, for desalination on four&#8208;stage filtration option, salt rejection reaches 99.9&#8201;% and water permeance reaches 19.2&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1. Such mass transport behavior is quite different from that in homogeneous charge channels. Furthermore, the ion transport behavior in nanochannels is elucidated by validating horizontal projectile motion model.

Here, built-in electric fields (BIEFs) are constructed in lamellar membranes by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets, which contain alternate positively-charged nanodomains and negatively-charged nanodomains. We demonstrate that the BIEFs are perpendicular to horizontal channel and the direction switches alternately, significantly weakening the EDL effect and forces ions to repeatedly collide with channel walls. Thus, highly efficient rejection for charged mass (salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases) and ultrafast water transport are achieved. Moreover, for desalination on four-stage filtration option, salt rejection reaches 99.9&#8201;% and water permeance reaches 19.2&#8197;L&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;bar&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Such mass transport behavior is quite different from that in homogeneous charge channels. Furthermore, the ion transport behavior in nanochannels is elucidated by validating horizontal projectile motion model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3+2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ConPET as a powerful and novel technique for photoredox catalysis has been first employed in asymmetric synthesis. In collaboration with chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis, an unprecedented redox&#8208;neutral [3+2] photocycloaddition has been developed, facilitating the synthesis of a wide range of valuable azaarene&#8208;functionalized cyclopentyl ketones with high yields, ees and dr.







Abstract
Consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) is a powerful and atom&#8208;economical protocol to overcome the limitations of the intrinsic redox potential of visible light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers, thereby considerably improving the substrate and reaction types. Likely because such an exothermic single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process usually does not require the aid of chiral catalysts, resulting in an inevitable racemic background reaction, notably, no enantioselective manifolds have been reported. Herein, we report on the viability of cooperative ConPET and chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis for the [3+2] photocycloaddition of cyclopropyl ketones with vinylazaarenes. In addition to enabling the first use of olefins that preferentially interact with chiral catalysts, this catalysis platform paves the way for the efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically and synthetically important cyclopentyl ketones functionalized by azaarenes with high yields, ees and dr. The robust capacity of the method can be further highlighted by the low loading of the chiral catalyst (1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the good compatibility of both 2&#8208;azaarene and 3&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based olefins, and the successful concurrent construction of three stereocenters on cyclopentane rings involving an elusive but important all&#8208;carbon quaternary.

         <title>Construction of Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Poly(heptazine imide) Nanosheets via Hydrogen Bonds for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of frustrated Lewis pairs on catalyst surface is an effective strategy for tuning CO2 activation. The critical step in the formation of frustrated Lewis pairs is the spatial effect of proximal Lewis acid&#8208;Lewis base pairs. Here, we demonstrate a facile surface functionalization methodology that enables hydrogen bonding between N and H atoms to mediate the construction of frustrated Lewis pairs in poly(heptazine imide), thereby increasing the propensity to activate CO2 molecules. Experimental and theoretical results show that the construction of active hydrogen bonding regions can facilitate the bending of CO2 molecules. Furthermore, the delocalization of electron clouds induced by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated frustrated Lewis pairs can promote the heterolytic cleavage and photocatalytic conversion of CO2. This work highlights the potential of utilizing hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated strategy in heterogeneously photocatalytic activation of CO2 over polymer materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ionic Selectivity and Osmotic Energy by Using an Ultrathin Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Membrane with Trilayered Continuous Porous Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing a nanofluidic membrane with high selectivity and fast ion transport property is the key towards high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. However, most of reported membranes can produce power density less than commercial benchmark (5 W/m2), due to the imbalance between ion selectivity and permeability. Here, we report a novel nanoarchitectured design of a heterogeneous membrane with an ultrathin and dense zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) layer and a highly aligned and interconnected branched alumina nanochannel membrane. The design leads to a continuous trilayered pore structure of large geometry gradient in the sequence from angstrom&#8208;scale to nano&#8208;scale to sub&#8208;microscale, which enables the enhanced directional ion transport, and the angstrom&#8208;sized (~6.6&#8208;7 &#197;) UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 windows render the membrane with high ion selectivity. Consequently, the novel heterogeneous membrane can achieve a high&#8208;performance power of ~8 W/m2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water. The power density can be largely upgraded to an ultrahigh ~17.1 W/m2 along with ~48.5% conversion efficiency at a 50&#8208;fold KCl gradient. This work not only presents a new membrane design approach but also showcases the great potential of employing the zirconium&#8208;based MOF channels as ion&#8208;channel&#8208;mimetic membranes for highly efficient blue energy harvesting.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Transformation from Membrane&#8208;less Coacervates to Membranized Coacervates and Giant Vesicles: toward Multicompartmental Protocells with Complex (Membrane) Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The membranization of membrane&#8208;less coacervates paves the way for the exploitation of complex protocells with regard to structural and cell&#8208;like functional behaviors. However, the controlled transformation from membranized coacervates to vesicles remains a challenge. This can provide stable (multi)phase and (multi)compartmental architectures through the reconfiguration of coacervate droplets in the presence of (bioactive) polymers, bio(macro)molecules and/or nanoobjects. Herein, we present a continuous protocell transformation from membrane&#8208;less coacervates to membranized coacervates and, ultimately, to giant hybrid vesicles. This transformation process is orchestrated by altering the balance of non&#8208;covalent interactions through varying concentrations of an anionic terpolymer, leading to dynamic processes such as spontaneous membranization of terpolymer nanoparticles at the coacervate surface, disassembly of the coacervate phase mediated by the excess anionic charge, and the redistribution of coacervate components in membrane. The diverse protocells during the transformation course provide distinct structural features and molecular permeability. Notably, the introduction of multiphase coacervates in this continuous transformation process signifies advancements toward the creation of synthetic cells with different diffusible compartments. Our findings emphasize the highly controlled continuous structural reorganization of coacervate protocells and represents a novel step toward the development of advanced and sophisticated synthetic protocells with more precise compositions and complex (membrane) structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (XOFs) Based on N&#8943;Br+&#8943;N Bonds: Robust Organic Networks Constructed by Fragile Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic frameworks face a trade&#8208;off between the framework stability and the bonds dynamics, which necessitates the development of innovative linkages that enable stable frameworks without hindering efficient synthesis. While iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) have been developed, constructing XOFs based on bromine(I) is desirable yet challenging due to the high sensitivity of bromine(I) species. Here, we present the inaugural construction of stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, XOF(Br)&#8208;TPy&#8208;BF4/OTf, based on sensitive [N&#8230;Br&#8230;N]+ halogen bonds. The formation of XOF(Br)&#8208;TPy&#8208;BF4/OTf was monitored by 1H NMR, XPS, IR, SEM, TEM, HR&#8208;TEM, SEAD. Their framework structures were established by the results from PXRD, theoretical simulations and SAXS. More importantly, XOF(Br)&#160;exhibited stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents and aqueous media, even over a wide pH range (pH 3&#8208;12), while the corresponding modelcompounds BrPy2BF4/OTf decomposed quickly even in the presence of minimal water. Furthermore, the influence of the counterions were investigated by replacing BF4 with OTf, which obviously improved the stability of XOF(Br). This characteristic enabled XOF(Br) to serve as efficient oxidizing reagents in aqueous environments, contrasting with the sensitivity of BrPy2BF4/OTf, which performed well only in organic media. This study opens new avenues for the development and application of multifunctional XOFs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Layered oxides with ultrahigh nickel content are considered promising high energy cathode materials. However, their cycle stability is constrained by a series of heterogeneous structural transformations during the complex solid&#8208;state lithiation process. By in&#8208;depth investigation into the solid&#8208;state lithiation process of LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, it is found that the protruded parts on the surface of precursor particles tend to be surrounded by locally excessive LiOH, which promotes the formation of a rigid and dense &#160;shell during the early stage of lithiation process. The shell will hinder the diffusion of lithium and topotactic lithiation within the particles, culminating in spatially heterogeneous intermediates that can impair the electrochemical properties of the cathode material. The spheroidization of the precursor can enhance uniformity in structural evolution during solid&#8208;phase lithiation. Ultrahigh nickel cathodes derived from spherical precursors demonstrate high initial discharge specific capacity (234.2 mAh g&#8208;1, in the range of 2.7&#8208;4.3V) and capacity retention (89.3% after 200 cycles), significantly superior to the non&#8208;spherical samples. This study not only sheds light on the intricate relationship between precursor shape and structural transformation but also introduces a novel strategy for enhancing cathode performance through precursor spheroidization.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Current Rectification Activity Induced by Boron Hydride Nanosheets to Enhance Magnesium Analgesia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low analgesic efficiency has limited magnesium used in analgesia. Here, we report boron hydride (BH) with ion current rectification activity can significantly improve the analgesic efficiency of magnesium, even higher than morphine. The synthesized injectable MgB2 composes of hexagonal boron sheets alternating with Mg2+. In pathological environment, while the intercalated Mg2+ will be exchanged by H+, the 2&#8208;dimensional borophene&#8208;analogue BH sheets will be formed to interact with the charged cations via the cation&#8208;pi interaction, synergistically leading to a sort of two&#8208;way dynamic modulation of sodium and potassium ion currents in neurons. By coordinating with the released Mg2+ to compete Ca2+, the threshold potential remarkably increases from the normal &#8208;35.9 mV to &#8208;5.9 mV, which significantly suppresses neuronal excitability, providing a potent analgesic effect. In three typical pain models&#160;, including CFA&#8208;induced inflammatory pain, PINP&#8208; or CCI&#8208;induced neuropathic pain, MgB2 demonstrates its analgesic efficiency&#160;approximately 2.23, 3.20, and 2.0 times higher than the clinical MgSO4, respectively. The development of MgB2 as analgesic drugs addresses the unmet medical need of pain relief without the risks of drug tolerance or addiction to opioids.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of the Structural Analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 in the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the significant attention directed toward alloy metal nanoclusters, it is crucial to explore the relationship between their structures and their performance during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and discover potential synergistic effects for the design of novel functional nanoclusters. However, a lack of suitable analogs makes this investigation challenging. In this study, we synthesized and characterized a&#160; pair of structural analogs, [Au8Cu1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ and [Au8Ag1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ (Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1, respectively). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au8M1 consists of a tetrahedral Au3M1 core capped by three (Dppm)Au staples, one Au2(SR)3 staple, one lone SR ligand, and a terminal Cl ligand. Ag and Cu were doped at the same site . Au8Cu1 exhibited a significantly higher CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO; ~82.2%) during eCO2RR than that of Au8Ag1 (FECO; ~33.1%). DFT demonstrated that *COOH is the key intermediate in the reduction of CO2 to CO. The formation of *COOH on Au8Cu1 is more thermodynamically stable than on Au8Ag1, and Au8Cu1 shows a smaller *CO formation energy than that on Au8Ag1, which promotes the reduction of CO2. We believe that the structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 offer a suitable template for the in&#8208;depth investigation of structure&#8208;property correlations at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of High&#8208;Capacity Sulfur Cathodes via In&#8208;Situ Polymerization of a Porous Imine&#8208;Based Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerization techniques encapsulate sulfur within microporous imine polymers, addressing the sulfur&#8208;shuttle issue and boosting electrochemical performance. This innovative strategy marks a new direction for creating efficient sulfur&#8208;based cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, essential for electronics and electric vehicles, predominantly use cathodes made from critical materials like cobalt. Sulfur&#8208;based cathodes, offering a high theoretical capacity of 1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and environmental advantages due to sulfur's abundance and lower toxicity, present a more sustainable alternative. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sulfur&#8208;based electrodes do not reach the theoretical capacities, mainly because conventional electrode production relies on mixing of components into weakly coordinated slurries. Consequently, sulfur&#8216;s mobility leads to battery degradation&#8212;an effect known as the &#8220;sulfur&#8208;shuttle&#8221;. This study introduces a solution by developing a microporous, covalently&#8208;bonded, imine&#8208;based polymer network grown in situ around sulfur particles on the current collector. The polymer network (i) enables selective transport of electrolyte and Li&#8208;ions through pores of defined size, and (ii) acts as a robust host to retain the active component of the electrode (sulfur species). The resulting cathode has superior rate performance from 0.1&#8197;C (1360&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) to 3&#8197;C (807&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Demonstrating a high&#8208;performance, sustainable sulfur cathode produced via a simple one&#8208;pot process, our research underlines the potential of microporous polymers in addressing sulfur diffusion issues, paving the way for sulfur electrodes as viable alternatives to traditional metal&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Reversible Modulation of Plasmonic Coupling of Gold Nanoparticles Confined within Swellable Polymer Colloidal Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic optical modulation in response to stimuli provides exciting opportunities for designing novel sensing, actuating, and authentication devices. Here, we demonstrate that the reversible swelling and deswelling of crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres in response to pH and temperature changes can be utilized to drive the assembly and disassembly of the embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), inducing their plasmonic coupling and decoupling and, correspondingly, color changes. The multi&#8208;responsive colloids are created by depositing a monolayer of AuNPs on the surface of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) nanospheres, then overcoating them with an additional RF layer, followed by a seeded growth process to enlarge the AuNPs and reduce their interparticle separation to induce significant plasmonic coupling. This configuration facilitates dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling through the reversible swelling/deswelling of the polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes. The rapid and repeatable transitions between coupled and decoupled plasmonic states of AuNPs enable reversible color switching when the polymer spheres are in colloidal form or embedded in hydrogel substrates. Furthermore, leveraging the photothermal effect and stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic coupling of the embedded AuNPs enables the construction of hybrid hydrogel films featuring switchable anticounterfeiting patterns, showcasing the versatility and potential of this multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Cascade Hydrogen Atom Transfers for Assembly of Multi&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H Cyclopentanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed to construct original polysubstituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 cyclopentanones in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. This building block approach leverages trifluoromethylthio alkynes and branched / linear aldehydes, as readily available reaction partners, in consecutive hydrogen atom transfers and C&#8211;C bond formations. Difluoromethylthio alkynes are also compatible subtrates. Furthermore, the potential for telescoped reaction starting from alcohols instead of aldehydes was demonstrated, as well as process automatization and scale&#8208;up under continuous microflow conditions. This prompted density functional theory calculations to support a free radical&#8208;mediated cascade hydrogen atom transfer process.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsymmetric Chiral Ligands for Large Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles: Selectivity of Orientational Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature uses various chiral and unsymmetric building blocks to form substantial and complex supramolecular assemblies. In contrary, majority of organic ligands used in metallosupramolecular chemistry are symmetric and achiral. Here we extend on the group of unsymmetric chiral bile acids used as a scaffold for organic bispyridyl ligands employing the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), epimer of previously used ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Ligands&#8217; epimerism, flexibility, and bulkiness leads to large structural differences of coordination products upon reaction with Pd(NO3)2. The UDCA&#8208;bispyridyl ligand self&#8208;assembles quantitatively into a single crown&#8208;like Pd3L6 complex, whereas the CDCA&#8208;ligand provides a mixture of coordination complexes of general formula PdnL2n, i.e., Pd2L4, Pd3L6, Pd4L8, Pd5L10, and even Pd6L12 containing impressive 120 chiral centers. The coordination products were studied by a combination of analytical methods, where the ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) provided valuable details on their structure and allowed an effective separation of m/z 1461 to individual signals according to arrival time distribution, revealing four different ions of [Pd3L6(NO3)3]3+, [Pd4L8(NO3)4]4+, [Pd5L10(NO3)5]5+, and [Pd6L12(NO3)6]6+. The structures of all complexes were modelled using DFT calculations. Finally, challenges and conclusions in determination of specific structural identity of these unsymmetric species are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherently chiral&#160;calix[4]arenes&#160;are&#160;an excellent structural scaffold&#160;for asymmetric synthesis, chiral recognition,&#160;sensing, and circularly polarized luminescence. However,&#160;their&#160;catalytic asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arene&#160;derivatives via cascade asymmetric cyclization and oxidation reactions. The three&#8208;component&#160;reaction features a broad substrate scope (33 examples), high efficiency (up to 90% yield), and excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;95%&#160;ee on average). The potential applications of calix[4]arene&#160;derivatives&#160;are highlighted by their&#160;synthetic transformation and a detailed investigation of their photophysical and chiroptical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Changes in Transition Metal Interfacial Magnetic Properties: A Blatter Derivative on Polycrystalline Cobalt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we study the interface obtained by depositing a monolayer of a Blatter radical derivative on polycrystalline cobalt. By examining the occupied and unoccupied states at the interface, using soft X&#8208;ray techniques, combined with electronic structure calculations, we could simultaneously determine the electronic structure of both the molecular and ferromagnetic sides of the interface, thus obtaining a full understanding of the interfacial magnetic properties. We found that the molecule is strongly hybridized with the surface. Changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allowed us to screen, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces in view of their potential applications in spintronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Anhydrous Proton Transport in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Pore Chemistry and Its Impacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton conduction is important in both fundamental research and technological development. Here we report designed synthesis of crystalline porous covalent organic frameworks as a new platform for high&#8208;rate anhydrous proton conduction. By developing nanochannels with different topologies as proton pathways and loading neat phosphoric acid to construct robust proton carrier networks in the pores, we found that pore topology is crucial for proton conduction. Its effect on increasing proton conductivity is in an exponential mode other than linear fashion, endowing the materials with exceptional proton conductivities exceeding 10&#8211;2 S cm&#8211;1 over a broad range of temperature and a low activation energy barrier down to 0.24 eV. Remarkably, the pore size controls conduction mechanism, where mesopores promote proton conduction via a fast&#8208;hopping mechanism, while micropores follow a sluggish vehicle process. Notably, decreasing phosphoric acid loading content drastically reduces proton conductivity and greatly increases activation energy barrier, emphasizing the pivotal role of well&#8208;developed proton carrier network in proton transport. These findings and insights unveil a new general and transformative guidance for designing porous framework materials and systems for high&#8208;rate ion conduction, energy storage, and energy conversion.</dc:description>

Notably, decreasing phosphoric acid loading content drastically reduces proton conductivity and greatly increases activation energy barrier, emphasizing the pivotal role of well-developed proton carrier network in proton transport. These findings and insights unveil a new general and transformative guidance for designing porous framework materials and systems for high-rate ion conduction, energy storage, and energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Super Hydrous Solvated Structure of Chaotropic Ca2+ Contributes Superior Anti&#8208;Freezing Aqueous Electrolytes and Stabilizes the Zn anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The further development of aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is constrained by the high freezing points and the instability on Zn anodes. Current improvement strategies mainly focus on regulating hydrogen bond (HB) donors (H) of solvent water to disrupt HBs, while neglecting the environment of HB&#8208;acceptors (O). Herein, we propose a mechanism of chaotropic cation&#8208;regulated HB&#8208;acceptor via a &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure. Chaotropic Ca2+ can form a solvated structure via competitively binding O atoms in H2O, effectively breaking the HBs among H2O molecules, thereby reducing the freezing point of hybrid 1 mol L&#8208;1 (M) ZnCl2 + 4 M CaCl2 electrolyte (&#8208;113.2 &#176;C). Meanwhile, the high hydratability of Ca2+ contributes to the water&#8208;poor solvated structure of Zn2+, suppressing side reactions and uneven Zn deposition. Benefiting from the anti&#8208;freezing electrolyte and high reversible Zn anode, the Zn||Pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 183.9 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 over 1600&#8208;time stable cycling at &#8208;60 &#176;C. This work presents a cheap and efficient aqueous electrolyte to simultaneously improve low&#8208;temperature performances and Zn stability, broadening the design concepts for antifreeze electrolytes.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose a mechanism of chaotropic cation-regulated HB-acceptor via a &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure. Chaotropic Ca2+ can form a solvated structure via competitively binding O atoms in H2O, effectively breaking the HBs among H2O molecules, thereby reducing the freezing point of hybrid 1 mol L-1 (M) ZnCl2 + 4 M CaCl2 electrolyte (-113.2 &#176;C).

         <title>Tailoring the Degradation of Cyano&#8208;arene based Photocatalysts for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Halogen Atom Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the strategic design of donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene&#8208;based photocatalysts (PCs) aiming to augment beneficial PC degradation for halogen atom transfer (XAT)&#8208;induced dehalogenation reactions.&#160;Our investigation reveals a competitive nature between the catalytic cycle and the degradation pathway, with degradation becoming dominant, particularly for less activated alkyl halides. The degradation behavior of PCs significantly impacts the efficiency of the XAT process, leading to exploration into manipulating the degradation behavior in a desirable direction. Recognizing the variation in the nature and rate of PC degradation, as well as its influence on the reaction across the range of PC structures, we carefully engineered the PCs to develop&#160;a pre&#8208;catalyst, named 3DP&#8208;DCDP&#8208;IPN. This pre&#8208;catalyst undergoes rapid degradation into an active form, 3DP&#8208;DCDP&#8208;Me&#8208;BN, exhibited an enhanced reducing ability in its radical anion form to induce better PC regeneration and consequently effectively catalyzes the XAT reaction, even with a challenging substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Channels Based on Bottlebrush Polymers: Enhanced Ion Transport Through Polymer Topology Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic structures mimicking the transport function of natural ion channel proteins have a wide range of applications, including therapeutic treatments, separation membranes, sensing, and biotechnologies. However, the development of polymer&#8208;based artificial channels has been hampered due to the limitation on available models. In this study, we demonstrate the great potential of bottlebrush polymers as accessible and versatile molecular scaffolds for developing efficient artificial ion channels. Adopting the bottlebrush configuration enhanced ion transport activity of the channels compared to their linear analogs. Matching the structure of lipid bilayers, the bottlebrush channel with a hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic triblock architecture exhibited the highest activity among the series. Functionalized with urea groups, these channels displayed high anion selectivity. Additionally, we illustrated that the transport properties could be fine&#8208;tuned by modifying the chemistry of ion binding sites. This work not only highlights the importance of polymer topology control in channel design, but also reveals the great potential for further developing bottlebrush channels with customized features and diverse functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Nonaqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with high energy densities are essential for efficient and sustainable long&#8208;term energy storage on a grid scale. To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as a high energy density catholyte was developed.&#160;When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two&#8208;electron&#8208;active (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56 V for the first reduction and 3.92 V for the second reduction process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|(PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF batteries, with concentrations of 0.1 M and 0.5 M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94% (99.87% per cycle, 97.52% per day) and 90% (99.93% per cycle, 99.16% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38% and 98.35%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129 mW/cm2. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72 Wh/L (100 Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75 M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96 Wh/L (150 Wh/L theoretical).</dc:description>

Selective reactions demonstrate the selectivity of [naphthaleneF]+&#8729; for deelectronation of a multitude of organ(ometall)ic molecules and elements in solution: providing the molecular struc&#173;tures of the acene dications [tetracene]2+, [pentacene]2+ or spectroscopic evi&#173;dence for the carbo&#173;nyl complex of the ferrocene dication [Fc(CO)]2+, the [P9]+ cation from white phosphor&#173;us, the solvent-free copper(I) salt starting from copper metal and the dicationic Fe(IV)-scorpionate complex [Fe(sc)2]2+.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecule Engineering of Sugar Derivatives as Electrolyte Additives for Deep&#8208;Reversible Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycling performance of zinc&#8208;ion batteries is greatly affected by dendrite formation and side reactions on zinc anode, particularly in scenarios involving high depth of discharge (DOD) and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratios in full cells. Herein, drawing upon principles of host&#8208;guest interaction chemistry, we investigate the impact of molecular structure of electrolyte additives, specifically the &#8208;COOH and &#8208;OH groups, on the zinc negative electrode through molecular design. Our findings reveal that molecules containing these groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane. This effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition of exposed (002) facets, enhancing stability and reversibility of an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89% with the introduction of Lactobionic acid (LA) additive. Under harsh conditions of 92% DOD, Zn//Zn cells exhibit stable cycling at challenging current densities of 15 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2. Even at a low N/P ratio of 1.3, Zn//NH4V4O10 full cells with LA electrolyte exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention of 73% after 300 cycles, significantly surpassing that of the blank electrolyte. Moreover, in a conversion type Zn//Br static battery with a high areal capacity (~ 5 mAh&#183;cm&#8208;2), LA electrolyte sustains an improved cycling stability of 700 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of &#8220;Structural Pin&#8221; Interactions and their Significance for the Conformational Control of Macrocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we identify structural pins as intramolecular hydrogen bonds in macrocycles that are predominantly responsible for conformational stabilization. Characterization and structural analysis of macrocycles with NMR and molecular modelling indicates that removal of a structural pin drastically influences the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased conformational heterogeneity.







Abstract
While peptide macrocycles with rigidified conformations have proven to be useful in the design of chemical probes of protein targets, conformational flexibility and rapid interconversion can be equally vital for biological activity and favorable physicochemical properties. This study introduces the concept of &#8220;structural pin&#8221;, which describes a hydrogen bond that is largely responsible for stabilizing the entire macrocycle backbone conformation. Structural analysis of macrocycles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X&#8208;ray diffraction indicates that disruption of the structural pin can drastically influence the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased flexibility. This finding provides a new tool to interrogate dynamic behaviour of macrocycles. Identification of structural pins offers a useful conceptual framework to understand positions that can either be modified to give flexible structures or retained to maintain the rigidity of the scaffold.

         <title>Understanding Ligand Effects on Bielectronic Transitions: Chemo&#8208; and Electroreduction of Rhodium Bis(Diphosphine) Complexes to Low Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodium complexes in the &#8211;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood. Herein, we investigate the two&#8208;electron reduction of a parameterized series of bis(diphosphine) Rh complexes [Rh(dxpy)2]NTf2 (x = P&#8208;substituent, y = alkanediyl bridging P atoms). Through (electro)reductions from the RhI parents, Rh&#8211;I&#160;d10&#8208;complexes were obtained and characterized spectroscopically, including 103Rh NMR data. The reductive steps convolute with structural rearrangements from square planar to tetrahedral coordination. We found that the extent of these reorganisations defines whether the first E0(RhI/0) and second E0(Rh0/&#8211;I) reduction potentials are normally ordered, leading to monoelectronic stepwise events, or inverted, giving bielectronic transitions. Reductionist approaches based on Hammett parameters or the P&#8208;Rh&#8208;P bite angles provide only partial correlations with the redox potentials. However, we identified the C&#8208;O stretch of analogue diphosphine complexes as an expedient computational parameter that enables these correlations through both electronic and geometric features, even in a predictive manner. Gaining control over two&#8208;electron reduction behaviors through rationalized ligand effects has potential impact beyond Rh complexes, for molecular and enzymatic metal sites commonly exhibiting bielectronic transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetics of Strand Displacement Reaction with Acyclic Artificial Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction, one of the DNA nanotechnologies, has great potential as s biological programmable platform in the cellular environment. Various artificial nucleic acids have been developed to improve stability and affinity for biological applications. However, the lack of understanding of the kinetics of TMSD reaction among artificial nucleic acids has limited their applications. We herein systematically characterized the kinetics of TMSD reactions with acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs): serinol nucleic acid (SNA), acyclic D&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (D&#8208;aTNA), and acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (L&#8208;aTNA). We found that the strand displacement reactions by D&#8208;aTNA and by L&#8208;aTNA were highly dependent on temperature. D&#8208;aTNA and L&#8208;aTNA systems were orthogonal to each other, and chirality of the input can be switched by using SNA as an interface. We also applied TMSD reactions of XNAs to a seesaw gate amplification system which utilizes the orthogonality. This work will contribute to the developments of thermoresponsive and bioorthogonal nucleic acid circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropic Dual S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions Mimic Natural Photosynthetic System for Boosting Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of heterojunctions that mimic natural photosynthetic systems holds great promise for enhancing photoelectric response. However, the limited interfacial space charge layer (SCL) often fails to provide sufficient driving force for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Drawing inspiration from the electron transport chain (ETC) in natural photosynthesis system, we developed a novel anisotropic dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction artificial photosynthetic system composed of Bi2O3&#8208;BiOBr&#8208;AgI for the first time, with Bi2O3 and AgI selectively distributed along the bicrystal facets of BiOBr. Compared to traditional semiconductors, the anisotropic carrier migration in BiOBr overcomes the recombination resulting from thermodynamic diffusion, thereby establishing a potential ETC for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Importantly, this pioneering bioinspired design overcomes the limitations imposed by the limited distribution of SCL in heterojunctions, resulting in a remarkable 55&#8208;fold enhancement in photoelectric performance. Leveraging the etching of thiols on Ag&#8208;based materials, this dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is further employed in the construction of photoelectrochemical sensors for the detection of acetylcholinesterase and organophosphorus pesticides.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4 Using a Dual&#8208;Sites Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework Coupled with Cu2O Nanoparticles via a Synergetic&#8208;Tandem Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low *CO coverage on the active sites is a major hurdle in the tandem electrocatalysis, resulting in unsatisfied C2H4 production efficiencies. In this work, we developed a synergetic&#8208;tandem strategy to construct a copper&#8208;based composite catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4, which was constructed via the template&#8208;directed polymerization of ultrathin Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework incorporating atomically isolated Cu(II) porphyrin and Cu(II) bipyridine sites on a carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold, and then Cu2O nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the CNT scaffold. The presence of dual active sites within the Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework create a synergetic effect, leading to an increase in local *CO availability to enhance the C&#8211;C coupling step implemented on the adjacent Cu2O nanoparticles for further C2H4 production. Accordingly, the resultant catalyst affords an exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FEC2H4) of 71.0% at &#8211;1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), making it one of the most effective copper&#8208;based tandem catalysts reported to date. The superior performance of the catalyst is further confirmed through operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic calculations.</dc:description>

In this work, we developed a synergetic-tandem strategy to construct a copper-based composite catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4, which was constructed via the template-directed polymerization of ultrathin Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework incorporating atomically isolated Cu(II) porphyrin and Cu(II) bipyridine sites on a carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold, and then Cu2O nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the CNT scaffold. The presence of dual active sites within the Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework create a synergetic effect, leading to an increase in local *CO availability to enhance the C&#8211;C coupling step implemented on the adjacent Cu2O nanoparticles for further C2H4 production. Accordingly, the resultant catalyst affords an exceptional CO2-to-C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FEC2H4) of 71.0% at &#8211;1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), making it one of the most effective copper-based tandem catalysts reported to date. The superior performance of the catalyst is further confirmed through operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast&#8208;Healing Glassy Hyperbranched Plastics Capable of Restoring 26.4 MPa Tensile Strength within One Minute at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing concern regarding widespread plastic pollution has propelled the development of sustainable self&#8208;healing plastics. Although considerable efforts have been dedicated to fabricating self&#8208;healing plastics, achieving rapid healing at room temperature is extremely challenging. Herein, we have developed an ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane (UGPU) by designing a hyperbranched molecular structure with a high density of multiple hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) on compliant acyclic heterochains and introducing trace water to form water bridge across the fractured surfaces. The compliant acyclic heterochains allow the dense multiple hydrogen bonds to form a frozen network, enabling tensile strength of up to 70 MPa and storage modulus of 2.5 GPa. The hyperbranched structure can drive the reorganization of the H&#8208;bonding network through the high mobility of the branched chains and terminals, thereby leading to self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Intriguingly, the presence of trace water vapor facilitates the formation of activated layers and the rearrangement of networks across the fractured UGPU sections, thereby enabling ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;healing at room temperature. Consequently, the restored tensile strength after healing for 1 minute achieves a historic&#8208;record of 26.4 MPa. Furthermore, the high transparency (&gt;90%) and ultra&#8208;fast healing property of UGPU make it an excellent candidate for advanced optical and structural materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Pore Engineering of Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Cages for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures (C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) can greatly reduce the energy consumption of the separation process, but it is extremely challenging. Herein, we use crystal engineering and reticular chemistry to introduce unsaturated bonds (ethynyl and alkyne) into ligands, and successfully design and synthesized two novel Zr&#8208;MOCs (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne). The introduction of carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds provides abundant adsorption sites within the framework while modulating the pore window size. Comprehensive characterization techniques including single crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as electrospray ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS) confirm that ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne possess an isostructural framework with ZrT&#8208;1 and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;Me, respectively. Adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments combined with theoretical calculations demonstrate that ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can effectively remove trace C2H2 and C2H6 in C2H4 and achieve separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2. ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can also directly purify C2H4 in liquid solutions. This work provides a benchmark for MOCs that one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape Shifting and Locking in Mechanically Responsive Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials for Thermoelastic Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of mechanically responsive materials with reversible shape&#8208;shifting, shape&#8208;locking, and stretchability holds promise for a wide range of applications in fields such as soft robotics and flexible electronics. Here, we report novel thermoelastic one&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids (R/S&#8208;Hmpy)PbI3 (Hmpy = 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrrolidinium) to show mechanical responses. The single crystals undergo two phase transitions at 310 K and 380 K. When heated to 380 K, they show shape&#8208;shifting and expansion along the b&#8208;axis by about 13.4%, corresponding to a larger deformation than that of thermally activated shape memory alloys (8.5%), and exhibit a strong actuation force. During cooling process, the stretched crystal shape maintains and a shape&#8208;locking phenomenon occurs, which is lifted when the temperature decreasing to 305 K. Meanwhile, due to the introduction of chiral ions, the thermal switching shows a 10&#8208;fold second&#8208;order nonlinear switching contrast (common values typically below 3&#8208;fold). This study presents a thermoelastic actuator based on shape&#8208;shifting and &#8208;locking of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids for the first time. The dielectric and nonlinear optical switching properties of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids broaden the range of applications of mechanically responsive crystals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The Li&#8208;CO&#8322; batteries utilizing greenhouse gas CO&#8322; possess advantages of high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, these batteries following Li&#8322;CO&#8323;&#8208;product route typically exhibit low work voltage (&lt;2.5 V) and energy efficiency. Herein, we have demonstrated for the first time that cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) as homogeneous catalyst can elevate the work plateau towards 2.98 V, which is higher than its theoretical discharge voltage without changing the Li&#8322;CO&#8323;&#8208;product route. This unprecedented discharge voltage is illustrated by mass spectrum and electrochemical analyses that CoPc has powerful adsorption capability with CO&#8322;&#160;(&#8208;7.484 kJ/mol) and forms discharge intermediate of C&#8323;&#8323;H&#8321;&#8326;CoN&#8328;O&#8322;. Besides high discharge capacity of 18724 mAh/g and robust cyclability over 1600 hours (1000 mAh/g&#160;cut&#8208;off) at a current density of 100 mA/g&#160;, the batteries show high temperature adaptability (&#8208;30~80 &#8304;C).

         <title>Copper&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Peptide Assemblies for Multi&#8208;pathway Cell Death and Tumor Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although self&#8208;assembly has emerged as an effective tool for fabricating biomaterials, achieving precise control over the morphologies and functionalities of the resultant assemblies remains an ongoing challenge. Inspired by the copper peptide naturally present in human plasma, in this study, we designed a synthetic precursor, FcGH. FcGH can self&#8208;assemble via two distinct pathways: spontaneous and Cu2+&#8208;induced. These two assembly pathways enabled the formation of assemblies with tunable morphologies by adjusting the amount of added Cu2+. We found that the nanoparticles formed by Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly exhibited a significantly higher cellular uptake efficiency than the wormlike fibers formed spontaneously. Moreover, this Cu2+&#8208;induced assembly process occurred spontaneously at a 1:1 molar ratio of Cu2+ to FcGH, avoiding the excessive use of Cu&#178;&#8314; and a tedious preparation procedure. By co&#8208;assembling with FcGH&#8208;conjugated 10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), Cu2+&#8208;induced supramolecular nanodrugs elicited multiple cell death modalities in cancer cells with elevated immunogenicity, enhancing the therapeutic effect compared to free HCPT. This study highlights Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly as an efficient tool for directing the assembly of nanodrugs and for synergistic tumor therapy.</dc:description>

Herein, we report novel core&#8208;shell hierarchical fibers for high&#8208;performance FSCs, in which the ordered NiCoMoS nanosheets arrays are chemically anchored on Ti3C2Tx fiber. Beneficial from architecting stable polymetallic sulfide arrays and conductive networks, the NiCoMoS&#8208;Ti3C2Tx fiber maintains fast charge transfer, low diffusion and OH&#8208; adsorption barrier, and stabilized multi&#8208;electronic reaction kinetics of polymetallic sulfide. Consequently, the NiCoMoS&#8208;Ti3C2Tx fiber exhibits a large volumetric capacitance (2472.3 F cm&#8208;3) and reversible cycling performance (20,000 cycles). In addition, the solid&#8208;state symmetric FSCs deliver a high energy density of 50.6 mWh cm&#8208;3 and bending stability, which can significantly power electronic devices and offer sensitive detection for dopamine.</dc:description>

         <title>The effective separation of photogenerated carriers in MIL101 nanocomposites promoting the efficient photocatalytic desulfurization in air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extensive industrial applications of fuel oil, a critical strategic resource, are accompanied by significant environmental and health concerns due to the presence of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in its composition, which result in hazardous combustion waste. Extensive research has been conducted to develop technologies for low&#8208;vulcanization fuel production to address this issue. Consequently, the investigation of catalysts for environmentally friendly and safe photocatalytic desulfurization becomes imperative. To that end, we have designed efficient MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/CQDs@g&#8208;C3N4 (MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts with high carrier separation and mobility through a thermal polymerization&#8208;hydrothermal strategy. The high concentration of photogenerated carriers facilitates the activation of oxygen and H2O2, leading to increased production of ROS (&#183;O2&#8208;, &#183;OH, h+), thereby enhancing the photocatalytic desulfurization (PODS). Additionally, DFT calculations were utilized to determine the electron migration pathways of the catalysts and adsorption energies of DBT (dibenzothiophene). Moreover, Gibbs free energy calculations indicated that MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4 exhibited the lowest activation energy for oxygen and H2O2. The mechanism of photocatalytic desulfurization was proposed through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. This study provides guidance for the development of MOF&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme systems and their practical application in desulfurization processes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The structure of molecular aggregates is crucial for charge transport and photovoltaic performance in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, the intermolecular interactions and aggregated structures of nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) are precisely regulated through a halogen transposition strategy, resulting in a noteworthy transformation from a 2D&#8208;layered structure to a 3D&#8208;interconnected packing network. Based on the 3D electron transport pathway, the binary and ternary devices deliver outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.46% and 18.24%, respectively, marking the highest value for NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;azopyrazole Photoswitches for Efficient Solar Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although natural sunlight is one of the most abundant and sustainable energy resources, only a fraction of its energy is currently harnessed and utilized in photoactive systems. The development of molecular photoswitches that can be directly activated by sunlight is imperative for unlocking the full potential of solar energy and addressing the growing energy demands. Herein,&#160;we designed a series of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;azopyrazoles that features a coupled &#960;n system, resulting in a pronounced redshift in its spectral absorption, reaching up to 661 nm in the red region. By varying the amino substituents of these molecules, highly efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under unfiltered sunlight can be achieved, with yields of up to 88.4%. Moreover, the Z,Z&#8208;isomers have high thermal stability with half&#8208;lives from days to years at room temperature. The introduction of ortho&#8208;amino substitutions and meta&#8208;bisazo units leads to a reversal of the n&#8211;&#960;* and &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* transitions on the energy scale. This change provides a new perspective for further tuning the visible absorption of azo&#8208;switches by utilizing the &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* band instead of the conventional n&#8211;&#960;* band. These results suggest that photoresponsive systems can be powered by sunlight instead of traditional artificial lights, thereby paving the way for sustainable smart materials and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering Geometric Reconstruction of Bismuth with Accelerated Dynamics for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth&#8208;based materials have emerged as promising catalysts in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate. However, the reasons for the reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based precursors to form bismuth nanosheets are still puzzling, especially the formation of defective bismuth sites. Herein, we prepare bismuth nanosheets with vacancy&#8208;rich defects (V&#8208;Bi NS) by rapidly reconstructing Bi19Cl3S27 under negative potential. Theoretical analysis reveals that the introduction of chlorine induces the generation of intrinsic electric field in the precursor, thereby increasing the electron transfer rate and further promoting the metallization of trivalent bismuth. Meanwhile, in situ Raman and ex situ XRD tests verify that Bi19Cl3S27 has a faster reconstruction rate than Bi2S3. The formed V&#8208;Bi NS exhibits up to 96% HCOO&#8208; Faraday efficiency and 400 mA cm&#8208;2 HCOO&#8208; partial current densities, and its ECSA normalized formate current density and yield are 2.2 times higher than those of intact bismuth nanosheets (I&#8208;Bi NS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that bismuth vacancies with electron&#8208;rich aggregation reduce the activation energy of CO2 to *CO2&#8208; radicals and stabilize the adsorption of the key intermediate *OCHO, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics of formate production.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium Catalyzed Asymmetric Reformatsky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study describes an unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Reformatsky reaction, enabling the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds from &#945;&#8208;chlorinated or &#945;&#8208;brominated esters and amides. By employing a chiral chromium/diarylamine bis(oxazoline) catalyst, we achieved relatively broad functional group tolerance. Distinct from known reports, the protocol operates under both classical and photoredox conditions, facilitated by the in&#8208;situ formation of a nucleophilic chiral chromium intermediate through a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism. Preliminary mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, identify the nucleophilic aldehyde addition as the key stereo&#8208;determining step. This approach not only overcomes the limitations of existing Reformatsky reactions but also provides a versatile strategy for accessing complex chiral molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal and Mechanistic Diversity&#160; in Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerizations of Allene&#8208;Tethered Pyrroles and Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrroles and indoles bearing N&#8208;allenyl tethers participate in a variety of iridium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization processes initiated by a C&#8208;H activation step, to deliver a diversity of synthetically relevant azaheterocyclic products. By appropriate selection of the ancillary ligand and the substitution pattern of the allene, the reactions can diverge from simple intramolecular hydrocarbonations to tandem processes involving intriguing mechanistic issues. Accordingly, a wide range of heterocyclic structures ranging from dihydro&#8208;indolizines and pyridoindoles to tetrahydroindolizines, as well as cyclopropane&#8208;fused tetrahydroindolizines can be obtained. Moreover, by using chiral ligands, these cascade processes can be carried out in an enantioselective manner. DFT studies provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and justify the observed chemo&#8208; regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling of Aryl Chlorides with Lithium Nucleophiles Enabled by Molecularly Defined Alkynyllithium Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings of aryl chlorides usually call for bulky, electron&#8208;rich ligands such as phosphines or heterocyclic carbenes. We have now found that similarly powerful cross&#8208;coupling catalysts are obtained by the reaction of palladium salts with alkynyllithium reagents. The species initially formed in this process was characterized as a dilithium tetraalkinyl palladate complex. It catalyzes the coupling of aryl chlorides with the lithium salts of various terminal alkynes to give alkynyl arenes. The isolated Li&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;Pd complex also efficiently promotes the reaction of aryl, and allyl chlorides with (hetero)aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208;, and allyllithium compounds as well as lithium amines. None of these reactions proceeded in the presence of palladium salts alone. The preparative utility of this approach was demonstrated by the synthesis of 49 molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing and Switching the Handedness of Polyacetylenes with Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane Pendants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore the chirality induction and switching of topological chirality, poly[2]catenanes composed of helical poly(phenylacetylenes) (PPAs) main chain and topologically chiral [2]catenane pendants are described for the first time. These poly[2]catenanes with optically active [2]catenanes on side chains were synthesized by polymerization of enantiomerically pure topologically chiral [2]catenanes with ethynyl polymerization site and/or point chiral moiety. The chirality information of [2]catenane pendants was successfully transferred to the main chain of polyene backbones, leading to preferred&#8208;handed helical conformations, while the introduction of point chiral units has negligible effect on the overall helices. More interestingly, attributed to unique dynamic feature of the [2]catenane pendants, these polymers revealed dynamic response behaviors to solvents, temperature, and sodium ions, resulting in the fully reversible switching on/off of the chirality induction. This work provides not only new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible aqueous Cr&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors with remarkable electrochemical properties in all climates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of hostless battery&#8208;like metal anodes for hybrid supercapacitors is a realistic design method for energy storage devices with promising future applications. With significant Cr element deposits on Earth, exceptionally high theoretical capacity (1546 mAh g&#8208;1), and accessible redox potential (&#8208;0.74 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) of Cr metals, the design of Cr anodes has rightly come into our focus. This work presents a breakthrough design of a flexible Cr&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (CHSC) based on a porous graphitized carbon fabric (PGCF) substrate prepared by K2FeO4 activation. In the CHSC device, PGCF acts as both a current collector and cathode material due to its high specific surface area and superior conductivity. The use of a highly concentrated LiCl&#8208;CrCl3 electrolyte with high Cr plating/stripping efficiency and excellent antifreeze properties enables the entire PGCF&#8208;based CHSC to achieve well&#8208;balanced performance in terms of energy density (up to 1.47 mWh cm&#8208;2), power characteristics (reaching 9.95 mW cm&#8208;2) and durability (95.4% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles), while realizing it to work well under harsh conditions of &#8208;40 &#176;C. This work introduces a new concept for low&#8208;temperature energy storage technology and confirms the potential application of Cr anodes in hybrid supercapacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Molecular Sieving of High&#8208;Humidity C2H4/C2H6 Mixture by a Hydrophobic Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular sieving is an ideal separation mechanism, but controlling pore size, restricting framework flexibility, and avoiding strong adsorption are all very challenging. Here, we report a flexible adsorbent showing molecular sieving at ambient temperature and high pressure, even under high humidity. While typical guest&#8208;induced transformations are observed, a high transition pressure of 16.6 atm is observed for C2H4 at 298 K because of very weak C2H4 adsorption (~16 kJ mol&#8211;1). Also, C2H6 is completely excluded below the pore&#8208;opening pressure of 7.7 atm, giving single&#8208;component selectivity of ca. 300. Quantitative high&#8208;pressure column breakthrough experiments using 1:1 C2H4/C2H6 mixture at 10 atm as input confirms molecular sieving with C2H4 adsorption of 0.73 mmol g&#8211;1 or 32 cm3(STP) cm&#8211;3 and negligible C2H6 adsorption of 0.001(2) mmol g&#8211;1, and the adsorbent can be completely regenerated by inert gas purging. Furthermore, it is highly hydrophobic with negligible water adsorption, and the C2H4/C2H6 separation performance is unaffected at high humidity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Radical Activation Strategy for Versatile and Stereoselective N&#8208;Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Previous N&#8208;glycosylation approaches have predominately involved acidic conditions, facing challenges of low stereoselectivity and limited scope. Herein, we introduce a radical activation strategy that enables versatile and stereoselective N&#8208;glycosylation using readily accessible glycosyl sulfinate as a donor under basic conditions and exhibits exceptional tolerance towards various N&#8208;aglycones containing alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl and nucleobase functionalities. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a pivotal role of iodide, which orchestrates the formation of a glycosyl radical from the glycosyl sulfinate and subsequent generation of the key intermediate, a configurationally well&#8208;defined glycosyl iodide, which is subsequently attacked by an N&#8208;aglycone in a stereospecific SN2 manner to give the desired N&#8208;glycosides. An alternative route involving the coupling of a glycosyl radical and a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical is also proposed, affording the exclusive 1,2&#8208;trans product. This novel approach promises to broaden the synthetic landscape of N&#8208;glycosides, offering a powerful tool for the construction of complex glycosidic structures under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ir(triNHC)&#8208;Catalyzed Upcycling of Waste PET for Lactic Acid Production with Sustainable Isolation via Bipolar Membrane Electrodialysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the upcycling of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET), encompassing both colored and fabric PET materials, we investigated the Ir(triNHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of PET and methanol, leading to the production of sodium lactate with good yields. We proposed a sustainable method for isolating lactic acid from the catalytic reaction mixture of sodium lactate and regenerating the base using bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED). This isolation method demonstrated high effectiveness, achieving isolation of lactic acid while maintaining economic feasibility at $0.10 per kg of lactic acid, and enabling sustainable NaOH regeneration with complete resource circulation. We assessed the recyclability of the catalyst and elucidated the mechanism involving base&#8208;mediated depolymerization and catalyst&#8208;promoted dehydrogenation, highlighting the importance of triNHC ligands in enhancing catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing a &#960;&#8208;Skeleton Perpendicular to the Central Methylene Carbon in Alkanediamides: Design of Supramolecular Polymers with an Offset &#960;&#8208;Stacking Arrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly behavior of a heptanediamide derivative that contains a four&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton on its central methylene carbon atom has been examined. This molecule, which also contains two octyl chains, gelated the nonpolar solvent methylcyclohexane through the formation of fibrous nanostructures with hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks through a cooperative nucleation&#8211;elongation process.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The self-assembly behavior of a heptanediamide derivative that contains a four-ring fused &#960;-skeleton on its central methylene carbon atom has been examined. This molecule, which also contains two octyl chains, gelated the nonpolar solvent methylcyclohexane through the formation of fibrous nanostructures with hydrogen-bonding networks through a cooperative nucleation&#8211;elongation process.

         <title>De Novo Discovery of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Prenylated Macrocyclic Peptide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prenylation of peptides is widely observed in the secondary metabolites of diverse organisms, granting peptides unique chemical properties distinct from proteinogenic amino acids. Discovery of prenylated peptide agents has largely relied on isolation or genome mining of naturally occurring molecules. To devise a platform technology for de novo discovery of artificial prenylated peptides targeting a protein of choice, here we have integrated the thioether&#8208;macrocyclic peptide (teMP) library construction/selection technology, so&#8208;called RaPID (Random nonstandard Peptides Integrated Discovery) system, with a Trp&#8208;C3&#8208;prenyltransferase KgpF involved in the biosynthesis of a prenylated natural product. This unique enzyme exhibited remarkably broad substrate tolerance, capable of modifying various Trp&#8208;containing teMPs to install a prenylated residue with tricyclic constrained structure. We constructed a vast library of prenylated teMPs and subjected it to in vitro selection against a phosphoglycerate mutase. This selection platform has led to the identification of a pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated teMP inhibiting the target enzyme with an IC50 of 30 nM. Importantly, the prenylation was essential for the inhibitory activity, enhanced serum stability, and cellular uptake of the peptide, highlighting the benefits of peptide prenylation. This work showcases the de novo discovery platform for pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated peptides, which is readily applicable to other drug targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery, Total Synthesis, and Anti&#8208;inflammatory Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Naphthopyrone&#8208;Macrolide Hybrids as Potent NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous clinical disorders have been linked to the etiology of dysregulated NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain&#8208;containing protein 3) inflammasome activation. Despite its potential as a pharmacological target, modulation of NLRP3 activity remains challenging. Only a sparse number of compounds have been reported that can modulate NLRP3 and none of them have been developed into a commercially available drug. In this research, we identified three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, gymnoasins A&#8722;C (1&#8722;3), with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, from an Antarctic fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. HDN17&#8208;895, which represent the first naturally occurring naphthopyrone&#8208;macrolide hybrids. Additionally, biomimetic synthesis of gymnoasin A (1) was also achieved validating the chemical structure and affording ample amounts of material for exhaustive bioactivity assessments. Biological assays indicated that 1 could significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, representing a valuable new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics with the potential to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Intramolecular meta&#8208;Thermocycloadditions of Benzene Rings via Wheland Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative cycloadditions are powerful synthetic transformations utilizing aromatic compounds for cycloaddition reactions. They have been extensively applied to the synthesis of biologically relevant compounds not only because of the complexity generated from simplicity but also the atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. For the most studied yet challenging benzene ring systems, ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;cycloadditions have been realized both photochemically and thermally, while the meta&#8208;cycloadditions are still limited to the photochemical processes tracing back to the 1960s. Herein, we for the first time realized the thermal cycloadditions of benzene rings with alkenes in a meta fashion via Wheland intermediates. A broad spectrum of readily available C(sp2)&#8208;rich aniline&#8208;tethered enynes were transformed into C(sp3)&#8208;rich 3D complex polycyclic architectures simply by stirring in TFA. Moreover, the reaction could be performed in gram&#8208;scales and the products could be diversely elaborated.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Release of Diborane from Alkali Metal Borohydride using Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal borohydrides present a rich source of energy dense materials of boron and hydrogen, however their potential in propellants has been hitherto untapped. Potassium borohydride is a promising fuel with high gravimetric energy density and relatively low sensitivity to air and moisture. Problems arise due to the dehydrogenation of the borohydride on heating with minimal energy release. Common methods to extract both boron and hydrogen by means of borane species involve direct reaction of boron trifluoride species with alkali borohydrides. However, these methods face storage and safety issues due to rapid release of diborane on mixing the reactants. We propose a method of diborane release through controlled release of boron trifluoride by means of a tetrafluoroborate based ionic liquid. The trifluoride is released from the ionic liquid at elevated temperatures and enables safe mixture of the reactants at room temperature. It was found that the reaction between borohydride and boron trifluoride proceeds well above room temperature with potassium borohydride releasing diborane and potassium fluoride. The reaction pathway shows a primary reaction releasing diborane and potassium fluoride and a second less energy efficient step leading to the formation of potassium tetrafluoroborate. A 3d printed propellant formulation was also tested.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycationic Open&#8208;Shell Cyclophanes: Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Rich Chiral Macrocycles, and Redox&#8208;Dependent Electronic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;conjugated new chiral macrocycles 1 and 2 have been accessed using the redox&#8208;active main&#8208;group carbazole and &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicene moieties. Chemical and electrochemical oxidations of these electron&#8208;rich Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight macrocycles readily enabled the conversion to chiral polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes with tunable electronic states that are rarely accessible from the all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based analogues.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral nanorings with intriguing electronic structures and chiroptical properties have attracted considerable interests in synthetic chemistry and materials science. We present the design principles to access new chiral macrocycles (1 and 2) that are essentially built on the key components of main&#8208;group electron&#8208;donating carbazolyl moieties or the &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicenes. Both macrocycles show the unique molecular conformations with a (quasi) figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight topology as a result of the conjugation patterns of 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorenyl in 1 and triarylamine&#8208;coupled aza[7]helicene&#8208;based building blocks in 2. This electronic nature of redox&#8208;active, carbazole&#8208;rich backbones enabled these macrocycles to be readily oxidized chemically and electrochemically, leading to the sequential production of a series of positively charged polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes. Their redox&#8208;dependent electronic states of the resulting multispin polyradicals have been characterized by VT&#8208;ESR, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR absorption and spectroelectrochemical measurements. The singlet (&#916;ES&#8208;T=&#8722;1.29&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and a nearly degenerate singlet&#8208;triplet ground state (&#916;ES&#8722;T(calcd)=&#8722;0.15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;ES&#8722;T(exp)=0.01&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) were proved for diradical dications 12+2&#8901; and 22+2&#8901;, respectively. Our work provides an experimental proof for the construction of electron&#8208;donating new chiral nanorings, and more importantly for highly charged polyradicals with potential applications in chirospintronics and organic conductors.

         <title>Domain Swapping in Abiotic Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abiotic foldamers have been shown to reproduce some of the patterns of protein folding in organic solvents, including cooperative folding transition and the accommodation of conformational strain within tertiary folds. Here, we show that a foldamer initially designed to form a quaternary structure in fact leads to a domain&#8208;swapped dimer, another pattern well&#8208;known in proteins.







Abstract
Foldamer sequences that adopt tertiary helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix folds mediated by helix&#8208;helix hydrogen bonding in organic solvents have been previously reported. In an attempt to create genuine abiotic quaternary structures, i.e. assemblies of tertiary structures, new sequences were prepared that possess additional hydrogen bond donors at positions that may promote an association between the tertiary folds. However, a solid state structure and extensive solution state investigations by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Circular Dichroism (CD) show that, instead of forming a quaternary structure, the tertiary folds assemble into stable domain&#8208;swapped dimer motifs. Domain swapping entails a complete reorganization of the arrays of hydrogen bonds and changes in relative helix orientation and handedness that can all be rationalized.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Catalytic Enantioselective Coupling to Chiral Trifluoromethylated Alkynes via Dual Nickel and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol generating chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes with high yields and selectivities has been established. It uses a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, and expands the nickel&#8208;catalysed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;coupling of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.







Abstract
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol to generate chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes has been established by a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, providing a straightforward and modular route to access this type of product in good yields and enantioselectivities. The halogen&#8208;atom transfer process is essential for the reaction and this novel strategy offers another promising way to utilize alkyl halides with highly negative reduction potentials. It firstly expands nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;couplings of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Including the Ensemble of Unstructured Conformations in the Analysis of Protein's Native State by High&#8208;Pressure NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The separation between general and structural related effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein chemical shifts is an issue which has so far been assessed by the impact hydrostatic pressure has on random coil peptides. Here, a new approach based on the response of the corresponding unfolded polypeptide chain under study to increasing hydrostatic pressure has been developed and is compared with existing approaches.







Abstract
The analysis of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift of proteins allows statements on structural fluctuations proteins exhibit at ambient pressure. The inherent issue of separating general pressure effects from structural related effects on the pressure dependence of chemical shifts has so far been addressed by considering the characteristics of random coil peptides on increasing pressure. In this work, chemically and pressure denatured states of the cold shock protein B from Bacillus subtilis (BsCspB) have been assigned in 2D 1H&#8208;15N HSQC NMR spectra and their dependence on increasing hydrostatic pressure has been evaluated. The pressure denatured polypeptide chain has been used to separate general from structural related effects on 1H and 15N chemical shifts of native BsCspB and the implications on the interpretation of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift regarding the structure of BsCspB are discussed. It has been found that the ensemble of unstructured conformations of BsCspB shows different responses to increasing pressure than random coil peptides do. Thus, the approach used for considering the general effects that arise when hydrostatic pressure increases changes the structural conclusions that are drawn from high pressure NMR spectroscopic experiments that rely on the analysis of chemical shifts.

         <title>Microwave Assisted Fast Synthesis of a Donor&#8208;Acceptor COF Towards Photooxidative Amidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a microwave&#8208;assisted rapid synthesis (in time scale, t=10&#8197;seconds to 10&#8197;minutes) of a D&#8722;A based covalent organic framework, TzPm&#8208;COF towards photooxidative amidation reaction from aldehyde and amine. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield.







Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at bulk scale require robust, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective techniques. However, the traditional solvothermal synthetic methods of COFs suffer low scalability as well as requirement of sensitive reaction environment and multiday reaction time (2&#8211;10&#8197;days) which greatly restricts their practical application. Here, we report microwave assisted rapid and optimized synthesis of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) based highly crystalline COF, TzPm&#8208;COF in second (10&#8197;sec) to minute (10&#8197;min) time scale. With increasing the reaction time from seconds to minutes crystallinity, porosity and morphological changes are observed for TzPm&#8208;COF. Owing to visible range light absorption, suitable band alignment, and low exciton binding energy (Eb=64.6&#8197;meV), TzPm&#8208;COF can efficaciously produce superoxide radical anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;) after activating molecular oxygen (O2) which eventually drives aerobic photooxidative amidation reaction with high recyclability. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield. Furthermore, catalytic mechanism was established by monitoring the real&#8208;time reaction progress through in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopic (DRIFTS) study.

         <title>Guiding Transient Peptide Assemblies with Structural Elements Embedded in Abiotic Phosphate Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We focus on fuel modifications to impact non&#8208;equilibrium systems, demonstrating how amino acid side chains within abiotic phosphates direct assembly and reactivity changes during structure formation. Through covalent binding to substrates, fuels drive the yield, the lifetime and the structural organization of transient species. Activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for fabricating structured fuels.







Abstract
Despite great progress in the construction of non&#8208;equilibrium systems, most approaches do not consider the structure of the fuel as a critical element to control the processes. Herein, we show that the amino acid side chains (A, F, Nal) in the structure of abiotic phosphates can direct assembly and reactivity during transient structure formation. The fuels bind covalently to substrates and subsequently influence the structures in the assembly process. We focus on the ways in which the phosphate esters guide structure formation and how structures and reactivity cross regulate when constructing assemblies. Through the chemical functionalization of energy&#8208;rich aminoacyl phosphate esters, we are able to control the yield of esters and thioesters upon adding dipeptides containing tyrosine or cysteine residues. The structural elements around the phosphate esters guide the lifetime of the structures formed and their supramolecular assemblies. These properties can be further influenced by the peptide sequence of substrates, incorporating anionic, aliphatic and aromatic residues. Furthermore, we illustrate that oligomerization of esters can be initiated from a single aminoacyl phosphate ester incorporating a tyrosine residue (Y). These findings suggest that activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for designing and fabricating structured fuels.

         <title>Bithiophene&#8208;Functionalized Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Metal Complexes as Single&#8208;Molecule Platforms for Synergistic Photodynamic, Photothermal, and Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based integrated diagnosis and treatment platform for infrared two&#8208;photon excitable synergistic photodynamic, photothermal, and chemotherapy has been constructed. The most potent Ru7 enters cells via macropinocytosis and regulates DNA&#8208;related chemotherapeutic mechanisms intranuclearly and their synergistic effects with photoactivated apoptosis, ferroptosis and DNA cleavage. Ru7 exhibits high efficacy and safety in vivo for melanoma and cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer.







Abstract
A planar conjugated ligand functionalized with bithiophene and its Ru(II), Os(II), and Ir(III) complexes have been constructed as single&#8208;molecule platform for synergistic photodynamic, photothermal, and chemotherapy. The complexes have significant two&#8208;photon absorption at 808&#8197;nm and remarkable singlet oxygen and superoxide anion production in aqueous solution and cells when exposed to 808&#8197;nm infrared irradiation. The most potent Ru(II) complex Ru7 enters tumor cells via the rare macropinocytosis, locates in both nuclei and mitochondria, and regulates DNA&#8208;related chemotherapeutic mechanisms intranuclearly including DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibition and their synergistic effects with photoactivated apoptosis, ferroptosis and DNA cleavage. Ru7 exhibits high efficacy in vivo for malignant melanoma and cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer tumors, with a 100&#8201;% survival rate of mice, low toxicity to normal cells and low residual rate. Such an infrared two&#8208;photon activatable metal complex may contribute to a new generation of single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based integrated diagnosis and treatment platform to address drug resistance in clinical practice and phototherapy for large, deeply located solid tumors.

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Nondirected Late&#8208;Stage C(sp2)&#8722;H Deuteration of Heteroarenes Enabled Through a Multi&#8208;Substrate Screening Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a method for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of heteroarenes. Reaction optimization was performed using a multi&#8208;substrate screening approach, which enabled the identification of optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. These conditions allowed us to deuterate various heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The importance of deuterium labelling in a variety of applications, ranging from mechanistic studies to drug&#8208;discovery, has spurred immense interest in the development of new methods for its efficient incorporation in organic, and especially in bioactive molecules. The five&#8208;membered heteroarenes at the center of this work are ubiquitous motifs in bioactive molecules and efficient methods for the deuterium labelling of these compounds are therefore highly desirable. However, the profound differences in chemical properties encountered between different heteroarenes hamper the development of a single set of broadly applicable reaction conditions, often necessitating a separate optimization campaign for a given type of heteroarene. In this study we describe the use of a multi&#8208;substrate screening approach to identify optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. Using this approach, four sets of complementary reaction conditions derived from our dual ligand&#8208;based palladium catalysts for nondirected C(sp2)&#8722;H activation were identified, that together enable the deuteration of structurally diverse heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.

         <title>Shell Modulation of Hollow Metal Sulfide Nanocomposite for Stable Potassium Storage at Room and High Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hollow ZnS@C architecture with a precise shell modulation is reported to be very effective at stabling the high&#8208;capacity electrodes for high&#8208;performance KIBs anode at room and high temperature. An interesting structure&#8208;function correlation was revealed: with an increase in the shell thickness, the cyclability increases while the capacity decreases.







Abstract
The large size of K&#8208;ion makes the pursuit of stable high&#8208;capacity anodes for K&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) a formidable challenge, particularly for high temperature KIBs as the electrode instability becomes more aggravated with temperature climbing. Herein, we demonstrate that a hollow ZnS@C nanocomposite (h&#8208;ZnS@C) with a precise shell modulation can resist electrode disintegration to enable stable high&#8208;capacity potassium storage at room and high temperature. Based on a model electrode, we identify an interesting structure&#8208;function correlation of the h&#8208;ZnS@C: with an increase in the shell thickness, the cyclability increases while the rate and capacity decrease, shedding light on the design of high&#8208;performance h&#8208;ZnS@C anodes via engineering the shell thickness. Typically, the h&#8208;ZnS@C anode with a shell thickness of 60&#8197;nm can deliver an impressive comprehensive performance at room temperature; the h&#8208;ZnS@C with shell thickness increasing to 75&#8197;nm can achieve an extraordinary stability (88.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 450 cycles) with a high capacity (450&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a superb rate even at an extreme temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is much superior than those reported anodes. This contribution envisions new perspectives on rational design of functional metal sulfides composite toward high&#8208;performance KIBs with insights into the significant structure&#8208;function correlation.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Photochromic Silver(I) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Alternative Topology, Dynamic Photoluminescence and Efficient Photothermal Conversion Modulated by Anionic Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photogenerated radicals in silver(I) metal&#8211;organic frameworks with alternative topology devote to achieving wide CIE color space tunability and the switching of admirable NIR photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Photogenerated radicals are an indispensable member of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photochromic material family, as they can effectively modulate the photoluminescence and photothermal conversion performance of radical&#8208;induced photochromic complexes. Herein, two novel radical&#8208;induced photochromic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Ag(TEPE)](AC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7/4H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5/4EtOH (1) and [Ag(TEPE)](NC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;EtOH (2), are reported. Distinctly different topological networks can be obtained by judiciously introducing alternative &#960;&#8208;conjugated anionic guests, including a new topological structure (named as sfm) first reported in this work, describing as 4,4,4,4&#8208;c net. EPR data and UV&#8211;Vis spectra prove the radical&#8208;induced photochromic mechanism. Dynamic photochromism exhibits tunability in a wide CIE color space, with a linear segment from yellow to red for 1, while a curved coordinate line for 2, resulting in colorful emission from blue to orange. Moreover, photogenerated TEPE* radicals effectively activate the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion effect of MOFs. Under 1&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation, the surface temperatures of photoproducts 1* and 2* can reach ~160&#8201;&#176;C and ~120&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, with competitive NIR photothermal conversion efficiencies &#951;=51.8&#8201;% (1*) and 36.2&#8201;% (2*). This work develops a feasible electrostatic compensation strategy to accurately introduce photoactive anionic guests into MOFs to construct multifunctional radical&#8208;induced photothermal conversion materials with tunable photoluminescence behavior.

         <title>On the Dendrite&#8208;Suppressing Effect of Laser&#8208;Processed Polylactic Acid&#8208;Derived Carbon Coated Zinc Anode in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare Zn metal when used as anode in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), is prone to dendrite formation and parasitic side reactions due to uneven Zn deposition on its surface. A porous carbon layer derived from the laser&#8208;assisted carbonization of bio&#8208;derived polylactic acid (PLA) on Zn metal effectively mitigates the formation of dendrites and parasitic side reactions on the Zn anode, thereby enhancing the stability and lifespan of the battery.







Abstract
A major bottleneck limiting the commercialization of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is dendrite formation on the zinc (Zn) anode during the plating/stripping process, which leads to rapid deterioration in performance and, consequently to the device failure. In this regard, researchers are trying to design more stable anodes toward suppressing dendrite formation.

&lt;p&gt;Bare Zn metal when used as anode in aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs), is prone to dendrite formation and parasitic side reactions due to uneven Zn deposition on its surface. A porous carbon layer derived from the laser-assisted carbonization of bio-derived polylactic acid (PLA) on Zn metal effectively mitigates the formation of dendrites and parasitic side reactions on the Zn anode, thereby enhancing the stability and lifespan of the battery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major bottleneck limiting the commercialization of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is dendrite formation on the zinc (Zn) anode during the plating/stripping process, which leads to rapid deterioration in performance and, consequently to the device failure. In this regard, researchers are trying to design more stable anodes toward suppressing dendrite formation. One possible solution to tackle this problem and to extend the cycling life of AZIBs is to modify the zinc anode surface by coating carbonaceous materials, enabling more controlled charge flux and uniform ion distribution. This work reports sustainable and bio-derived polylactic acid (PLA) as a coating layer on the zinc anode. Carbonizing this polymer under ambient conditions using a high-power nanosecond laser forms a carbon-coated zinc foil, which was directly utilized as the anode in aqueous zinc ion batteries.

         <title>An Unprecedented [BO2]&#8208;Based Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Crystal by Superhalogen Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first [BO2]&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV transparent NLO oxide K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)(BO2) has been synthesized by an ambient aqueous evaporation method. It possesses a strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG, a short UV absorption edge, and a significantly enlarged birefringence by a superhalogen substitution strategy.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state structures with the superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; have thus far only been observed with a few compounds whose syntheses require high reaction temperatures and complicated procedures, while their optical properties remain almost completely unexplored. Herein, we report a facile, energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of the first [BO2]&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) transparent oxide K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)(BO2)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O (KBCOB). Detailed structural characterization and analysis confirm that KBCOB possesses a rare four&#8208;in&#8208;one three&#8208;dimensional quasi&#8208;honeycomb framework, with three &#960;&#8208;conjugated anions ([BO2]&#8722;, [BO3]3&#8722;, and [CO3]2&#8722;) and one non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated anion ([BO4]5&#8722;) in the one crystal. The evolution from the traditional halogenated nonlinear optical (NLO) analogues to KBCOB by superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; substitution confers deep&#8208;UV transparency (&lt;190&#8197;nm), a large second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.0&#215;KH2PO4 @&#8197;1064&#8197;nm), and a 15&#8208;fold increase in birefringence. This study affords a new route to the facile synthesis of functional [BO2]&#8208;based oxides, paving the way for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performing deep&#8208;UV NLO materials.

         <title>An MBene Modulating the Buried SnO2/Perovskite Interface in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D material MBene is introduced into the buried interface of perovskite solar cells, it can strongly interact with both SnO2 and perovskite layer at the same time, forming a bridge at the buried interface, improving the charge transfer, and regulating the energy level structure, resulting in an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 24.32&#8201;% and better stability.







Abstract
The interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) plays an important role in transferring and collecting charges. Interface defects are important factors affecting the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Here, the buried interface between SnO2 and the perovskite layer is bridged by two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MBene, which improves charge transfer. MBene can deposit additional electrons on the surface of SnO2, passivate its surface defects and facilitate the charge collection. Moreover, the dipole moment formed at the interface increases the electron transfer ability in the PSCs. MBene also regulates the growth of perovskite crystals, improves the quality of perovskite films, and reduces its grain boundary defects. As a result, PSCs based on FA0.2MA0.8PbI3 and (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 get the enhanced efficiencies of 22.34&#8201;% and 24.32&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis. Furthermore, the optimized device exhibits better stability. This work opens up the application of MBene materials in PSCs, reveals a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind using 2D materials as an interface modification layer, and shows opportunities for using MBene as potential material in photoelectric devices.

         <title>Solvation Properties of Neutral Gold Species in Supercritical Water Studied By THz Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold clusters in aqueous supercritial solution are found to interact very strongly with the solvent, forming well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;water solvation complexes. Their THz spectrum is distinctly different from that of supercritical water, which can be exploited to probe such neutral metal species in hydrothermal fluids.







Abstract
Supercritical water provides distinctly different solvation properties compared to what is known from liquid water. Despite its prevalence deep in the Earth's crust and its role in chemosynthetic ecosystems in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents, molecular insights into its solvation mechanisms are still very scarce compared to what is known for liquid water. Recently, neutral metal particles have been detected in hydrothermal fluids and proposed to explain the transport of gold species to ore deposits on Earth. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we elucidate the solvation properties of small gold species at supercritical conditions. The neutral metal clusters themselves contribute enormous THz intensity not because of their intramolecular vibrations, but due to their pronounced electronic polarization coupling to the dynamical supercritical solvent, leading to a continuum absorption up to about 1000&#8197;cm&#8722;1. On top, long&#8208;lived interactions between the gold clusters and solvation water leads at these supercritical conditions to a sharp THz resonance that happens to be close to the one due to H&#8208;bonding in liquid water at ambient conditions. The resulting distinct resonances can be used to analyse the solvation properties of neutral metal particles in supercritical aqueous solutions.

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of Combining Best Properties of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis in Hybrid Pd/NHC Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores the formation of hybrid nanoscale metal species from molecular precatalysts, which exhibit the unique attributes of molecular complexes and nanoparticles. This study addresses their detection difficulties and introduces solid&#8208;state NMR to demonstrate the generation of catalytically active Pd nanoparticles from Pd/NHC complexes. The findings underscore the critical role of NHC ligands in catalytic nanoparticle system stability and activity.







Abstract
The formation of transient hybrid nanoscale metal species from homogeneous molecular precatalysts has been demonstrated by in situ NMR studies of catalytic reactions involving transition metals with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (M/NHC). These hybrid structures provide benefits of both molecular complexes and nanoparticles, enhancing the activity, selectivity, flexibility, and regulation of active species. However, they are challenging to identify experimentally due to the unsuitability of standard methods used for homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis. Utilizing a sophisticated solid&#8208;state NMR technique, we provide evidence for the formation of NHC&#8208;ligated catalytically active Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) from Pd/NHC complexes during catalysis. The coordination of NHCs via C(NHC)&#8722;Pd bonding to the metal surface was first confirmed by observing the Knight shift in the 13C NMR spectrum of the frozen reaction mixture. Computational modeling revealed that as little as few NHC ligands are sufficient for complete ligation of the surface of the formed PdNPs. Catalytic experiments combined with in situ NMR studies confirmed the significant effect of surface covalently bound NHC ligands on the catalytic properties of the PdNPs formed by decomposition of the Pd/NHC complexes. This observation shows the crucial influence of NHC ligands on the activity and stability of nanoparticulate catalytic systems.

Catalytic experiments combined with in situ NMR studies confirmed the significant effect of surface covalently bound NHC ligands on the catalytic properties of the PdNPs formed by decomposition of the Pd/NHC complexes. This observation shows the crucial influence of NHC ligands on the activity and stability of nanoparticulate catalytic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silylenes with a Small Chalcogenide Substituent: Tuning Frontier Orbital Energies from O to Te</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyclic dicoordinated silylenes with small chalcogenide substituents were prepared and characterised, enabled by a bulky carbazolyl scaffold. The electronic properties change dramatically from O to Te, with decreasing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and increasing chemical shift of the 29Si NMR resonances.







Abstract
The general synthesis of heteroleptic acyclic silylenes with a bulky carbazolyl substituent (dtbpCbz) is detailed and a series of compounds with a chalcogenide substituent of the type [(dtbpCbz)SiE16R] (E16R=OtBu, SEt, SePh, TePh) is reported. With the bulky carbazolyl substituent present, the chalcogenide moiety can be very small, as is shown by incorporating groups as small as ethyl, phenyl or tert&#8208;butyl. For the first time, the electronic properties of the silylene can be tuned along a complete series of chalcogenide substituents. The effects are clearly visible in the NMR and UV/Vis spectra, and were rationalised by DFT computations. The reactivity of the heaviest chalcogenide&#8208;substituted silylenes was probed by reactions with trimethylphosphine selenide and the terphenyl azide TerN3 (Ter=2,6&#8208;dimesitylphenyl).

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Regulating D&#8208;Orbital Spin&#8208;Electron Filling in Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst, we implemented an asymmetric coordination within the first coordination shell of Fe site. The creation of the Fe&#8722;N3O configuration, characterized by asymmetrical oxygen coordination and adjacent defect, caused electrons in d orbitals from low&#8208;spin state to a medium&#8208;spin state. This optimization effectively weakened the adsorption of oxygen species and altered the potential&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst has shown great promise for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the intrinsic activity is not satisfactory. There is a pressing need to gain a deeper understanding of the charge configuration of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst and to develop rational modulation strategies. Herein, we have prepared a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst with the co&#8208;coordination of N and O (denoted as Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C) and adjacent defect, proposing a strategy to optimize the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron filling of Fe sites by fine&#8208;tuning the first coordination shell. The Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C exhibits significantly better ORR activity compared to its Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C counterpart and commercial Pt/C, with a much more positive half&#8208;wave potential (0.927&#8197;V) and higher kinetic current density. Moreover, using the Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C catalyst, the Zn&#8208;air battery and proton exchange membrane fuel cell achieve peak power densities of up to 490 and 1179&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Theoretical studies and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C undergoes charge redistribution and negative shifting of the d&#8208;band center compared to Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, thus optimizing the adsorption free energy of ORR intermediates. This work demonstrates the feasibility of introducing an asymmetric first coordination shell for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides a new optimization direction for their practical application.

         <title>Crown Ether Electrolyte Induced Li2O2 Amorphization for Low Polarization and Long Lifespan Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coronal 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 ether shows strong affinity towards Li+, which stabilizes not only the intermediate LiO2 but also the resulting product. This transforms the typical crystalline Li2O2 into an amorphous state, thereby significantly reduces the product decomposition barriers. Thus, Li&#8208;O2 batteries shows lower charge overpotential and longer lifespan.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries possess an extremely high theoretical energy density, rendering them a prime candidate for next&#8208;generation secondary batteries. However, they still face multiple problems such as huge charge polarization and poor life, which lay a significant gap between laboratory research and commercial applications. In this work, we adopt 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 ether (C15) as solvent to regulate the generation of discharge products in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. The coronal structure endows C15 with strong affinity to Li+, firmly stabilizes the intermediate LiO2 and discharge product Li2O2. Thus, the crystalline Li2O2 is amorphized into easily decomposable amorphous products. The lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries assembled with 0.5&#8197;M C15 electrolyte show an increased discharge capacity from 4.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 5.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low charge overpotential of 0.88&#8197;V during the whole lifespan at 0.05&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The batteries with 1&#8197;M C15 electrolyte can cycle stably for 140&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, the amorphous characteristic of Li2O2 product is preserved when matched with redox mediators such as LiI, with the charge polarization further decreasing to 0.74&#8197;V over a cycle life of 190&#8197;cycles. This provides new possibilities for electrolyte design to promote Li2O2 amorphization and reduce charge overpotential in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.

         <title>Water and Air Stable Copper(I) Complexes of Tetracationic Catenane Ligands for Oxidative C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I) molecular catalysts that are water soluble and stable against oxidative degradation are obtained by the strategic use of multiply charged catenane ligands. By using the new catalysts, oxidative C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling is realized in water using H2O2 as a green and convenient oxidant, highlighting the potential of ligand interlocking in leveraging transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.







Abstract
Aqueous soluble and stable Cu(I) molecular catalysts featuring a catenane ligand composed of two dicationic, mutually repelling but mechanically interlocked macrocycles are reported. The ligand interlocking not only fine&#8208;tunes the coordination sphere and kinetically stabilizes the Cu(I) against air oxidation and disproportionation, but also buries the hydrophobic portions of the ligands and prevents their dissociation which are necessary for their good water solubility and a sustained activity. These catenane Cu(I) complexes can catalyze the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of indoles and tetrahydroisoquinolines in water, using H2O2 as a green oxidant with a good substrate scope. The successful use of catenane ligands in exploiting aqueous Cu(I) catalysis thus highlights the many unexplored potential of mechanical bond as a design element for exploring transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.

         <dc:description>
A dual bio&#8208;/photocatalytic system has been developed for achieving previously elusive diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective radical lactonizations. By integrating directed evolution and photoinduced single&#8208;electron oxidation, we repurposed engineered ene&#8208;reductases to steer non&#8208;natural radical C&#8722;O formations giving a diverse array of enantioenhanced 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered lactones with vicinal stereocenters, part of which bears a quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
Repurposing enzymes to catalyze non&#8208;natural asymmetric transformations that are difficult to achieve using traditional chemical methods is of significant importance. Although radical C&#8722;O bond formation has emerged as a powerful approach for constructing oxygen&#8208;containing compounds, controlling the stereochemistry poses a great challenge. Here we present the development of a dual bio&#8208;/photo&#8208;catalytic system comprising an ene&#8208;reductase and an organic dye for achieving stereoselective lactonizations. By integrating directed evolution and photoinduced single electron oxidation, we repurposed engineered ene&#8208;reductases to steer non&#8208;natural radical C&#8722;O formations (one C&#8722;O bond for hydrolactonizations and lactonization&#8208;alkylations while two C&#8722;O bonds for lactonization&#8208;oxygenations). This dual catalysis gave a new approach to a diverse array of enantioenhanced 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered lactones with vicinal stereocenters, part of which bears a quaternary stereocenter (up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess, up to 12.9&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio). Detailed mechanistic studies, including computational simulations, uncovered the synergistic effect of the enzyme and the externally added organophotoredox catalyst Rh6G.

&lt;p&gt;A dual bio-/photocatalytic system has been developed for achieving previously elusive diastereo- and enantioselective radical lactonizations. By integrating directed evolution and photoinduced single-electron oxidation, we repurposed engineered ene-reductases to steer non-natural radical C&#8722;O formations giving a diverse array of enantioenhanced 5- and 6-membered lactones with vicinal stereocenters, part of which bears a quaternary stereocenter.

         <title>Hyperbranched Vitrimer for Ultrahigh Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers have been utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effectively dissipate energy as heat during service. Our work firstly presents hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks, which exhibit ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency range of nearly 10 orders of magnitude. This innovative design concept will provide opportunities for the further development of damping materials with multiple synergistic effects.







Abstract
Polymers are ideally utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effective suppression of vibrations and noises in various fields. Current strategies rely on broadening the glass transition region or introducing additional relaxation components to enhance the energy dissipation capacity of polymeric damping materials. However, it remains a significant challenge to achieve high damping efficiency through structural control while maintaining dynamic characteristics. In this work, we propose a new strategy to develop hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks. A novel yet weak dynamic transesterification between the carboxyl and boronic acid ester was confirmed and used to prepare HBVs based on poly (hexyl methacrylate&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;ethenylphenyl)&#8208;5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborinane) P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) copolymers. The

&#8208;type of macromonomers, the crosslinking points formed by the dynamic covalent connection via the associative exchange, and the weak yet dynamic exchange reaction are the three keys to developing high&#8208;performance HBV damping materials. We found that P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) 20k&#8208;40&#8208;60&#8197;HBV exhibited ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency and temperature range, attributed to the synergistic effect of dense pendant chains and weak dynamic covalent crosslinks. This unique design concept will provide a general approach to developing advanced damping materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Potential Methanol Oxidation on Single&#8208;Ir&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the coupling of thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis, methanol was first thermally catalyzed to decompose to CO and H2 under the voltage promotion, then the generated CO and H2 was electrochemically oxidized to CO2 and proton at ultra&#8208;low onset potential (&lt;0.1&#8197;V) over the the electron&#8208;deficient IrC4 sites, which strongly adsorb the methanol to break H&#8722;O/H&#8722;C.







Abstract
Methanol oxidation plays a central role to implement sustainable energy economy, which is restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics due to the multi&#8208;electron transfer process accompanied by numerous sequential intermediate. In this study, an efficient cascade methanol oxidation reaction is catalyzed by single&#8208;Ir&#8208;atom catalyst at ultra&#8208;low potential (&lt;0.1&#8197;V) with the promotion of the thermal and electrochemical integration in a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. At the elevated temperature, the electron deficient Ir site with higher methanol affinity could spontaneous catalyze the CH3OH dehydrogenation to CO under the voltage, then the generated CO and H2 was electrochemically oxidized to CO2 and proton. However, the methanol cannot thermally decompose with the voltage absence, which confirm the indispensable of the coupling of thermal and electrochemical integration for the methanol oxidation. By assembling the methanol oxidation reaction with hydrogen evolution reaction with single&#8208;Ir&#8208;atom catalysts in the anode chamber, a max hydrogen production rate reaches 18&#8197;mol&#8201;gIr&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is much greater than that of Ir nanoparticles and commercial Pt/C. This study also demonstrated the electrochemical methanol oxidation activity of the single atom catalysts, which broadens the renewable energy devices and the catalyst design by an integration concept.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Catalyzed C1 Copolymerization of Arsonium and Sulfoxonium Ylides toward Unrepresented Structures and Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two novel arsonium ylides is achieved and used in the C1 copolymerization with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide. A third unexpected C1 unit resulting from a double bond rearrangement is confirmed by NMR. In addition, an unexpected red shift in the fluorescence spectrum is observed which is attributed to a phenomenon similar to through&#8208;space conjugation.







Abstract
The first synthesis of well&#8208;defined poly(methylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylpropenenylene) (C1&#8208;co&#8208;C1&#8217;), equivalent to poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;diphenylbutadiene) copolymers was accomplished by C1 copolymerization of novel diphenylpropenyl triphenyl arsonium ylides (Ph2AY) and dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (Me2SY) using B&#8208;thexylborepane as initiator. All polymerization conditions, including feed ratio, temperature, and reaction time, were optimized. A series of photoluminescent poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;diphenylbutadiene)s were synthesized at different feed ratios, opening a new synthetic horizon for poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;disubstitutedbutadiene) copolymers. Notably, a new C1 segment, arising from a double bond rearrangement, was confirmed by NMR, resulting in an unprecedented two&#8208;monomer three&#8208;structure random terpolymer. An unexpected red&#8208;shift phenomenon in the fluorescence spectra was observed with increasing the ratio of Ph2AY in the copolymer. This shift is attributed to the aggregation of diphenylbutadiene segment, similar to through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC), likely induced by a decrease in the crystallinity of copolymers. Furthermore, another disubstituted allylic triphenyl arsonium ylides, (E)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbutenyl triphenyl arsonium ylide (MePhAY) was also synthesized and investigated. These additional compounds expand the knowledge and the potential applications of such copolymerization techniques in advanced materials.

         <title>Quantitative Factors Introduced in the Feasibility Analysis of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Sensitive Triggers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Success of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) triggered prodrug activation relies on two key functions: (1) sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and the intended site of delivery, (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of payload release. Herein, we examine ROS concentrations under various pathophysiological conditions and critically analyze ROS&#8208;triggered prodrug.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for cellular signaling. Various pathophysiological conditions are also associated with elevated levels of ROS. Hence, ROS&#8208;sensitive triggers have been extensively used for selective payload delivery. Such applications are predicated on two key functions: (1) a sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and intended sites and (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of selectivity for payload release. Further, ROS refers to a group of species with varying reactivity, which should not be viewed as a uniform group. In this review, we critically analyze data on the concentrations of different ROS species under various pathophysiological conditions and examine how reaction kinetics affect the success of ROS&#8208;sensitive linker chemistry. Further, we discuss different ROS linker chemistry in the context of their applications in drug delivery and imaging. This review brings new insights into research in ROS&#8208;triggered delivery, highlights factors to consider in maximizing the chance for success and discusses pitfalls to avoid.

In this review, we critically analyze data on the concentrations of different ROS species under various pathophysiological conditions and examine how reaction kinetics affect the success of ROS-sensitive linker chemistry. Further, we discuss different ROS linker chemistry in the context of their applications in drug delivery and imaging. This review brings new insights into research in ROS-triggered delivery, highlights factors to consider in maximizing the chance for success and discusses pitfalls to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Template&#8208;Guided Silicon Micromotor Assembly for Enhanced Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optomagnetic hybrid micromotor was developed using an optimized silicon&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell. The micromotor displays diverse motion modes influenced by fracture surfaces and interactions with the environment. Additionally, an innovative hole&#8208;assisted assembly strategy is introduced, facilitating assembly into functional microrobots and enabling precise cell manipulation.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven micro/nanorobots (LMNRs) are tiny, untethered machines with great potential in fields like precision medicine, nano manufacturing, and various other domains. However, their practicality hinges on developing light&#8208;manipulation strategies that combine versatile functionalities, flexible design options, and precise controllability. Our study introduces an innovative approach to construct micro/nanorobots (MNRs) by utilizing micro/nanomotors as fundamental building blocks. Inspired by silicon Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell principles, we design a new type of optomagnetic hybrid micromotors (OHMs). These OHMs have been skillfully optimized with integrated magnetic constituent, resulting in efficient light propulsion, precise magnetic navigation, and the potential for controlled assembly. One of the key features of the OHMs is their ability to exhibit diverse motion modes influenced by fracture surfaces and interactions with the environment, streamlining cargo conveyance along &#8220;micro expressway&#8221;&#8212;the predesigned microchannels. Further enhancing their versatility, a template&#8208;guided assembly strategy facilitates the assembly of these micromotors into functional microrobots, encompassing various configurations such as &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221;, &#8220;N&#8208;shaped&#8221;, and 3D structured microrobots. The heightened capabilities of these microrobots, underscore the innovative potential inherent in hybrid micromotor design and assembly, which provides a foundational platform for the realization of multi&#8208;component microrobots. Our work moves a step toward forthcoming microrobotic entities boasting advanced functionalities.

         <title>Formation of Supernarrow Borophene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of supernarrow borophene nanoribbons has been experimentally realized. The ribbons have a uniform width of &#8764;10&#8197;&#197; and can be as long as 200&#8197;&#197;. They are embedded in the outermost layer of Au(111) and shielded on top by evacuated Au atoms. Distinct edge states are revealed from the ribbons, which are primarily attributed to the localized spin at their zigzag edges.







Abstract
Borophenes have sparked considerable interest owing to their fascinating physical characteristics and diverse polymorphism. However, borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) with widths less than 2&#8197;nm have not been achieved. Herein, we report the experimental realization of supernarrow BNRs. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy imaging with density functional theory modeling and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, under the applied growth conditions, boron atoms can penetrate the outermost layer of Au(111) and form BNRs composed of a pair of zigzag (2,2) boron rows. The BNRs have a width self&#8208;contained to &#8764;1&#8197;nm and dipoles at the edges to keep them separated. They are embedded in the outermost Au layer and shielded on top by the evacuated Au atoms, free of the need for post&#8208;passivation. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals distinct edge states, primarily attributed to the localized spin at the BNRs&#8217; zigzag edges. This work adds a new member to the boron material family and introduces a new physical feature to borophenes.

         <title>Triaryl Carbenium Ion Pair Mediated Electrocatalytic Benzylic C&#8722;H Oxygenation in Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;&#8208;mediated electrocatalytic benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation is described. In the absence of expensive oxidants and external supporting electrolyte, the selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in air was achieved.







Abstract
The selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds is a pivotal transformation in organic synthesis. Undoubtedly, achieving efficient and highly selective aerobic oxidation of methylarenes to benzaldehydes has been highly challenging due to the propensity of benzaldehyde to undergo overoxidation under typical aerobic conditions. Herein, we propose an innovative approach to address this issue by leveraging electrocatalytic processes, facilitated by ion&#8208;pair mediators [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;. By harnessing the power of electrochemistry, we successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy, which enables the selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in benzylic molecules and toluene derivatives. Notably, our approach exhibited high efficiency, excellent selectivity, and compatibility with various functional groups, underscoring the broad applicability of our methodology.

         <title>New Alkalescent Electrolyte Chemistry for Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery assembled with an alkalescent (pH=12) Zn&#8208;EDTA anolyte and Fe(CN)63&#8722;/Fe(CN)64&#8722; catholyte is constructed and has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries are efficiency and economical as energy storage solutions. However, they suffer from low energy density and short calendar life. The strongly alkaline conditions (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 OH&#8722;) reduce the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide (normally only 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and induce the formation of zinc dendrites at the anode. Here, we report a new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on a mild alkalescent (pH&#8197;12) electrolyte. Using a chelating agent to rearrange ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide ion&#8208;solvent interactions and improve salt dissociation, we increased the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide to 1.7&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 and prevented zinc dendrites. Our battery has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1catholyte at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. An alkalescent zinc&#8208;ferricyanide cell stack built using this alkalescent electrolyte stably delivers 608&#8197;W of power for ~40&#8197;days.

         <title>Single&#8208;cluster Functionalized TiO2 Nanotube Array for Boosting Water Oxidation and CO2 Photoreduction to CH3OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile electrosynthesis strategy was developed to achieve single dispersion of various POMs on TiO2 nanotube array. The POMs can serve as electronic sponge to store multi&#8208;electrons thus greatly improving the surface hole concentration to promote water oxidation. The left electron on P2Mo18@TiO2 can effeiciently drive CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion with much enhanced performance compared to that of pristine TiO2 nanoarray.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and water oxidation to liquid fuels represents a promising solution to alleviate energy crisis and climate issue, but it remains a great challenge for generating CH3OH and CH3CH2OH dominated by multi&#8208;electron transfer. Single&#8208;cluster catalysts with super electron acceptance, accurate molecular structure, customizable electronic structure and multiple adsorption sites, have led to greater potential in catalyzing various challenging reactions. However, accurately controlling the number and arrangement of clusters on functional supports still faces great challenge. Herein, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to uniformly disperse Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208; and Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates on TiO2 nanotube arrays, resulting in a series of single&#8208;cluster functionalized catalysts P2M18O62@TiO2 and PM12O40@TiO2 (M=Mo or W). The single polyoxometalate cluster can be distinctly identified and serves as electronic sponge to accept electrons from excited TiO2 for enhancing surface&#8208;hole concentration and promote water oxidation. Among these samples, P2Mo18O62@TiO2&#8208;1 exhibits the highest electron consumption rate of 1260&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion with H2O as the electron source, which is 11&#8197;times higher than that of isolated TiO2 nanotube arrays. This work supplied a simple synthesis method to realize the single&#8208;dispersion of molecular cluster to enrich surface&#8208;reaching holes on TiO2, thereby facilitating water oxidation and CO2 reduction.

         <title>Dilute RuCo Alloy Synergizing Single Ru and Co Atoms as Efficient and CO&#8208;Resistant Anode Catalyst for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, stable, and CO resistant alkaline HOR electrocatalysts are crucial for achieving the application of AEMFCs. (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT with and dilute RuCo alloy nanoparticles and highly dispersed Ru and Co single atoms can achieve efficient alkaline HOR, with superior stability and outstanding CO resistance. When used (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT to AEMFC anode catalyst, AEMFCs can achieve high peak power density with low noble metal loading (1.98&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a load of 0.1&#8197;mgRu&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered a promising candidate catalyst for alkaline hydroxide oxidation reaction (HOR) due to its hydrogen binding energy (HBE) like that of platinum (Pt) and its much higher oxygenophilicity than that of Pt. However, Ru still suffers from insufficient intrinsic activity and CO resistance, which hinders its widespread use in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we report a hybrid catalyst (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT consisting of dilute RuCo alloy nanoparticles and atomically single Ru and Co atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes The catalyst exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity with a high mass activity of 7.35&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1. More importantly, when (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT is used as an anode catalyst for AEMFCs, its peak power density reaches 1.98&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is one of the best AEMFCs properties of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts at present. Moreover, (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT has superior long&#8208;time stability and CO resistance. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the dilute alloying and monodecentralization of the exotic element Co greatly modulates the electronic structure of the host element Ru, thus optimizing the adsorption of H and OH and promoting the oxidation of CO on the catalyst surface, and then stimulates alkaline HOR activity and CO tolerance of the catalyst.

         <title>Synthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled Aryl Trifluoromethyl Sulfones, &#8208;Sulfoxides, and &#8208;Sulfides for Positron Emission Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mild and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled aryl trifluoromethyl sulfones, &#8208;sulfoxides, and &#8208;sulfides using [18F]Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent is described. The application to the radiolabeling of different bioactive compounds using &gt;1&#8197;GBq of 18F&#8208;labeling reagent is demonstrated. This work expands the radiochemical space of [18F]CF3&#8208;containing structural motifs for the use in positron emission tomography.







Abstract
Positron emission tomography (PET) is becoming increasingly important in nuclear medicine and drug discovery. To date, the development of many potential PET tracers is hampered by the lack of suitable synthetic pathways for their preparation. This is particularly true for the highly desired radiolabeling of compounds bearing [18F]CF3&#8208;groups. For instance, S(O)nCF3&#8208;groups (n=0, 1, 2) serve as structural motif in a range of biologically active compounds, but their radiosynthesis remains largely unprecedented (for n=1, 2). Herein, we describe general methods for the radiosynthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled aryl trifluoromethyl sulfones, &#8208;sulfoxides, and &#8208;sulfides. All three methods are operationally straightforward, start from widely available precursors, i.e., sulfonyl fluorides and thiophenols, and make use of the recently established [18F]Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent. Further, the syntheses display good functional group tolerance as demonstrated by the 18F&#8208;labeling of more than 40&#8197;compounds. The applicability of the new method is demonstrated by the radiolabeling of three bioactive molecules, optionally to be used as PET tracers. In a broader context, this work presents a substantial expansion of the chemical space of radiofluorinated structural motifs to be used for the development of new PET tracers.

         <title>Facile Generation of Heterotelechelic Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline)s Towards Accelerated Exploration of Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline)&#8208;Based Nanomedicine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POx) are promising materials for nanomedicine, yet straightforward end&#8208;group diversification strategies are necessary to promote rapid exploration of this structurally diverse polymer class. Van Guyse and Kataoka et&#8197;al. demonstrate the rapid generation of heterotelechelic POx libraries, and their subsequent use in the synthesis of block&#8208;copolymers, liposomes, and a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;based SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 vaccine.







Abstract
Controlling the end&#8208;groups of biocompatible polymers is crucial for enabling polymer&#8208;based therapeutics and nanomedicine. Typically, end&#8208;group diversification is a challenging and time&#8208;consuming endeavor, especially for polymers prepared via ionic polymerization mechanisms with limited functional group tolerance. In this study, we present a facile end&#8208;group diversification approach for poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POx), enabling quick and reliable production of heterotelechelic polymers to facilitate POxylation. The approach relies on the careful tuning of reaction parameters to establish differential reactivity of a pentafluorobenzyl initiator fragment and the living oxazolinium chain&#8208;end, allowing the selective introduction of N&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;nucleophiles via the termination of the polymerization, and a consecutive nucleophilic para&#8208;fluoro substitution. The value of this approach for the accelerated development of nanomedicine is demonstrated through the synthesis of well&#8208;defined lipid&#8208;polymer conjugates and POx&#8208;polypeptide block&#8208;copolymers, which are well&#8208;suited for drug and gene delivery. Furthermore, we investigated the application of a lipid&#8208;POx conjugate for the formulation and delivery of mRNA&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles for immunization against the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 virus, underscoring the value of POx as a biocompatible polymer platform.

         <title>Discovery of Alloy Catalysts Beyond Pd for Selective Hydrogenation of Reformate via First&#8208;Principle Screening with Consideration of H&#8208;Coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the consideration of H coverage effect, the activity of reformate hydrogenation was evaluated according to descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energy of atomic hydrogen, and the selectivity was determined based on adsorption energy of benzene. 172 stable alloys were scanned, and Zn3Ir1 alloy was found to present high performance, which was verified by experiments.







Abstract
The highly selective hydrogenation to remove olefins is a significant refining approach for the reformate. Herein, a library of transition metal for reformate hydrogenation is tested experimentally to validate the predictive level of catalytic activity from our theoretical framework, which combines ab initio calculations and microkinetic modeling, with consideration of surface H&#8208;coverage effect on hydrogenation kinetics. The favorable H coverage of specific alloy surface under relevant hydrogenation condition, is found to be determined by its corresponding alloy composition. Besides, olefin hydrogenation rate is determined as a function of two descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energies of atomic hydrogen, paving the way to computationally screen on metal component in the periodic table. Evaluation of 172 bimetallic alloys based on the activity volcano map, as well as benzene hydrogenation rate, identifies prospective superior candidates and experimentally confirms that Zn3Ir1 outperforms pure Pd catalysts for the selective hydrogenation refining of reformate. The insights into H&#8208;coverage&#8208;related microkinetic modelling have enabled us to both theoretically understand experimental findings and identify novel catalysts, thus, bridging the gap between first&#8208;principle simulations and industrial applications. This work provides useful guidance for experimental catalyst design, which can be easily extended to other hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Reactivity&#8208;Controlled Stereoconvergent Synthesis and Immunological Activity of a Unique Pentasaccharide from the Cell Wall Polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7 has been achieved via an acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation strategy. Immunological activity tests indicate that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.







Abstract
Bacterial cell&#8208;surface polysaccharides are involved in various biological processes and have attracted widespread attention as potential targets for developing carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs. However, the accessibility to structurally well&#8208;defined polysaccharide or related active oligosaccharide domains remains challenging. Herein, we describe an efficiently stereocontrolled approach for the first total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit containing four difficult&#8208;to&#8208;construct 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7. The features of our approach include: 1)&#8197;acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled glycosylation to stereoselectively construct two challenging rare 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ManA2,3(NAc)2 (&#946;&#8208;2,3&#8208;diacetamido&#8208;2,3&#8208;dideoxymannuronic acid) linkages, 2)&#8197;combination use of 6&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylsilyl (6&#8208;O&#8208;TBDPS)&#8208;mediated steric shielding effect and ether solvent effect to stereoselectively install a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosidic linkage, 3)&#8197;bulky 4,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene (DTBS)&#8208;directed glycosylation to stereospecifically construct a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;galactosidic linkage, 4)&#8197;stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation to rapidly assemble the target pentasaccharide. Immunological activity tests suggest that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.
