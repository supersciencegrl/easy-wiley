         <title>Stereodivergent Access to C&#8208;N Atropisomers via Phosphonium Salt&#8208;Enabled Desymmetrizing Remote Cyclization/Aromatization Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and highly practical enantiodivergent approach has been developed for synthesizing axially chiral phthalimide derivatives in either enantiomeric form. This enantioselective divergence is induced by chiral phosphonium salt catalysts bearing identical stereogenic elements. The protocol's scalability and practicality were demonstrated through gram&#8208;scale synthesis and product derivatization, highlighting its significant application potential, particularly in the field of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) for small organic molecules.








Abstract
In this study, we describe a highly efficient organocatalytic enantiodivergent method for synthesizing C&#8208;N axially chiral compounds via remote asymmetric cycloaddition/aromatization cascade. By leveraging formally remote stereocontrol from two classes of chiral phosphonium salts sharing identical stereogenic elements, prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides undergo asymmetric formal [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition/aromatization in an atropodivergent manner, affording structurally diverse C&#8208;N axially chiral products. This approach features broad substrate scope and enables practical, atom&#8208;economical synthesis of both enantiomeric configurations of C&#8208;N atropisomers under mild conditions, with high efficiency and excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, an unexpected synergistic desymmetrization/dynamic kinetic resolution process was observed in this transformation. Mechanistic studies elucidated the origin of stereochemical induction. Furthermore, the utility of enantioenriched products is demonstrated through downstream transformations and, specifically, in constructing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active C&#8208;N axially chiral organic small molecules, which may hold significant potential for chiral optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Strong, Yet Split Hydrogen Bonding with Ice Rules in Delafossite (H/D)RhO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong, yet split! The delafossites HRhO2 and DRhO2 feature linear O&#8211;(H/D)&#8211;O moieties with split hydrogen bonds arranged on a triangular sublattice. Structure, spectroscopy, and electronic structure calculations help resolve conflicting reports of the nature of hydrogen bonding in delafossites and related compounds. In analogy with Ising spins on a triangular lattice, there is no evidence of ordering of the short and long O&#8211;(H/D) distances.








Abstract
Despite remaining enigmatic, strong hydrogen bonding provides an advanced design handle for tailoring the properties of functional materials. Here, 3R&#8211;(H/D)RhO2 delafossites (prepared by ion exchange of Na+ from NaRhO2) contain H/D in linear coordination with O, linking RhIIIO2 layers. Bragg and real&#8208;space X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering analysis, vibrational and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT)&#8211;based electronic structure calculations have been employed to understand the nature of the hydrogen bonding. Despite short distances between H/D and the two O to which they are bonded, a clear double&#8208;minimum corresponding to a shorter and longer (H/D)&#8211;O distance is established. The triangular lattices formed by H/D appear to display ice&#8208;like disorder, corroborated by low&#8208;temperature heat capacity measurements.

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Assemblies via Metal&#8211;Metal Interactions for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Square&#8208;planar d8 metal complexes tend to aggregate, forming long&#8208;range ordered nanostructures in aqueous solutions. These structures exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption or excitation bands in the red or NIR regions, making them highly valuable for bioimaging and phototherapy. This review summarizes recent advancements in the design, performance, and optimization of supramolecular assemblies using metal&#8211;metal interactions for biomedical applications. It also addresses current challenges and proposes potential future directions to expedite the clinical translation of these findings. 








Abstract
Over the past decades, self&#8208;assembly has become a pivotal strategy for the construction of tunable supramolecular nanoarchitectures. In particular, supramolecular assemblies from d8 transition metal complexes have garnered widespread attention as bioimaging and therapeutic agents owing to their rich physicochemical properties resulting from metallophilic interactions. These supramolecular assemblies exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission, which are critical for imaging and phototherapy because low&#8208;energy light can penetrate deeper into tissue and poses less cytotoxic risk compared to ultraviolet light. In cell cultures, these self&#8208;assembled nanoaggregates enhance cellular uptake via endocytic pathways. In certain cases, they induce irreversible organelle swelling and membrane permeabilization, leading to organelle dysfunction and cell death, thereby overcoming chemotherapy resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, metallophilic interactions remain stable during in vivo blood circulation, facilitating the formation of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures with strong tumor&#8208;targeting capabilities. Therefore, supramolecular assemblies offer an innovative and straightforward method for enhancing tumor treatment efficacy. This review highlights recent advances in the development of supramolecular assemblies via metal&#8211;metal interactions for use in bioimaging and therapy; summarizes the design strategies, self&#8208;assembly processes, photochemical and photophysical properties, bioimaging performance, and therapeutic efficacy of representative supramolecular assemblies; and discusses challenges and opportunities for these assemblies in biological applications.

         <title>Functionalization of Polyolefins via Catalytic Nitrene Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce the strategy of metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer for the formation of carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds onto polybutadienes as polyolefin models. This post&#8208;functionalization methodology is not only efficient but also provides the control of the degree of functionalization. The latter nicely correlates with polymer properties such as the Tg. The process occurs without affecting the polymer structure, with no chain scission nor cross&#8208;linking side reactions.








Abstract
The post&#8208;polymerization functionalization of polyolefins has emerged as a key tool for obtaining new materials with enhanced properties. With an array of approaches being already reported, the incorporation of N&#8208;containing fragments en route to the generation of amino groups in yet scarce and not disclosed for the metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer strategy. Here we introduce such tactics employing silver&#8208;based catalysts for the incorporation of nitrene NTs (Ts&#160;=&#160;p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl) groups to commercially available polybutadienes. The process occurs at room temperature without appreciable chain scission or cross&#8208;linking processes and enables precise control of the degree of functionalization. Thermal analyses demonstrate a correlation between such degree and the Tg values of the functionalized polymers.

         <title>Suppression of Excimer Formation via Conjugation&#8208;Driven Interactions in Crosslinked Hole Transport Layer for Efficient Blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugate&#8208;interaction&#8208;driven strategy employing asymmetric/branched molecules is proposed to inhibit parallel stacking of CBP&#8208;V, thereby suppressing excimer formation within HTL and achieving a tenfold enhancement in mobility, further enabling target blue QLEDs to achieve a max EQE of 24.12%.








Abstract
Blue quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), underperforming relative to red and green counterparts, shoulder the critical responsibility for full&#8208;color displays. Crosslinked 9,9&#8242;&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;ethenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole) (CBP&#8208;V), owning a deep HOMO level (&#8764;&#8722;5.9&#160;eV), is a promising hole transport layer (HTL) candidate for blue QLEDs. However, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and molecular rotatability in CBP&#8208;V promote parallel stacking and electron cloud overlap. This gives rise to excimer formation, which exacerbates the energy&#8208;level disorder in crosslinked CBP&#8208;V and thus degrades its hole mobility. Herein, 2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)pyridine (26DCzPPy) and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine (TCTA), featuring analogous phenylcarbazole structural fragments, are incorporated into CBP&#8208;V to suppress excimer formation via a conjugate&#8208;interaction&#8208;driven strategy.

&lt;p&gt;A conjugate-interaction-driven strategy employing asymmetric/branched molecules is proposed to inhibit parallel stacking of CBP-V, thereby suppressing excimer formation within HTL and achieving a tenfold enhancement in mobility, further enabling target blue QLEDs to achieve a max EQE of 24.12%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs), underperforming relative to red and green counterparts, shoulder the critical responsibility for full-color displays. Crosslinked 9,9&#8242;-([1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4,4&#8242;-diyl)bis(3-ethenyl-9H-carbazole) (CBP-V), owning a deep HOMO level (&#8764;&#8722;5.9&#160;eV), is a promising hole transport layer (HTL) candidate for blue QLEDs. However, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and molecular rotatability in CBP-V promote parallel stacking and electron cloud overlap. This gives rise to excimer formation, which exacerbates the energy-level disorder in crosslinked CBP-V and thus degrades its hole mobility. Herein, 2,6-bis(3-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)pyridine (26DCzPPy) and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;-tris(carbazol-9-yl)-triphenylamine (TCTA), featuring analogous phenylcarbazole structural fragments, are incorporated into CBP-V to suppress excimer formation via a conjugate-interaction-driven strategy. The asymmetric configuration of 26DCzPPy and the branched architecture of TCTA enable modulation of molecular stacking behavior and suppress parallel stacking of CBP-V during the crosslinking process. This realizes spatial segregation of CBP-V and thus eliminates the prerequisite for excimer formation. Resultantly, suppression of excimer allows HTL to achieve a tenfold enhancement of hole mobility from 5.37&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 5.97&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Target QLEDs gain prominent enhancements in external quantum efficiencies for deep-blue emission (456&#160;nm) from 11.48% to 22.92% and pure-blue emission (470&#160;nm) from 13.39% to 24.12%, with maximum brightness values of 29735 and 91268&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Reactions in Cellular Microenvironments Directed by Conjugated Polymers Toward Biomedical Advances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on chemical reactions in cellular microenvironments directed by conjugated polymers (CPs) for biomedical advances. CPs enable in situ biophotocatalytic reactions, precise phototherapies, and dynamic supramolecular regulation of cell signaling. These strategies facilitate targeted cancer therapy, inflammation resolution, and precision cell modulation, offering innovative platforms for next&#8208;generation personalized medicine.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers exhibit unique structural and optoelectronic properties, enabling precise modulation of chemical reactions within cellular microenvironments. This review highlights recent advances in CP&#8208;directed biomedical strategies, focusing on their roles in light&#8208;driven biophotocatalysis, photodynamic and photothermal therapies, and precision cellular regulation. By facilitating targeted redox transformations, gas generation, and supramolecular interactions, CPs provide spatiotemporal control over complex biological processes. The integration of CPs into dynamic assemblies and biointerfaces enables responsive, minimally invasive interventions for cancer, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions. Furthermore, emerging approaches that combine artificial intelligence with molecular design are accelerating the development of CP&#8208;based platforms for personalized medicine. These interdisciplinary innovations underscore the transformative potential of CPs in therapeutic modulation, diagnostic enhancement, and the development of next&#8208;generation biomedical devices.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on TiO2&#8208;Supported Metal Catalysts for Fine&#8208;Tuning Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers an in&#8208;depth overview and guide to the origin, modulation, and dynamics of strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) in TiO2&#8208;based catalysts for optimizing catalysis. It explores the functions of oxygen vacancies, surface/alloy formation energies, and TiO2 structural/thermal aspects. The benefits of pre&#8208;SMSI conditions, the changing dynamics of SMSI in catalysis, challenges, and future directions are highlighted.








Abstract
The concept of strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI), a topic of investigation for over four decades, remains an important area of research in heterogeneous catalysis. While substantial progress has been made in understanding SMSI across various metal/support systems, its complexity continues to evolve. TiO2, recognized as the first support material to exhibit SMSI, has been instrumental in advancing this understanding. However, the lack of a comprehensive guide on how various factors influence SMSI on TiO2 has limited the ability to systematically control these interactions. This review seeks to provide a consolidated view of the current understanding of SMSI in TiO2&#8208;supported metal catalysts. It highlights the sensitivity of SMSI on TiO2 to a range of parameters, including pretreatment conditions and reaction environments. The dynamic nature of SMSI under reaction conditions is also explored, underscoring its complexity and potential for fine&#8208;tuning catalyst performance. Additionally, practical insights into innovative chemical methods for controlling SMSI on TiO2 are discussed, offering strategies for modulating SMSI to meet specific catalytic requirements. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to offer a valuable guide for the rational design of metal/TiO2 catalysts, ultimately contributing to a more refined and controllable approach to SMSI on TiO2.

         <title>Structural Effects in Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Supramolecular Assemblies for Enhanced Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular proton conductor (BPN) is constructed via charge&#8208;assisted dynamic hydrogen bonding between POMs and [Bi6O5(OH)3] clusters, enabling ultrahigh proton conductivity (0.12&#160;S cm&#8722;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C, 97% RH). 1H MAS NMR demonstrates that protons at Bi&#8211;O sites exhibit twofold shorter spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (T1) than those at W&#8208;O sites, confirming heterogeneous mobility. BPN&#8208;Nafion hybrid membranes boost DMFC performance (86&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 59.3% higher than pristine Nafion) with a high OCV (0.82 V).








Abstract
Proton conductors with engineered charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks are pivotal for advancing proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, a novel proton&#8208;conducting supramolecular clusters, ([Bi6O5 (OH)3]2.24[PW12O40]1[NO3]2.4[H3O]5.8, BPN) has been synthesized and characterized. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that charge&#8208;assisted dynamic O&#9472;H&#8943;O hydrogen bonds mediate the supramolecular assembly, while water molecules facilitate proton transport pathways. The material exhibits a maximum proton conductivity of 0.12&#160;S cm&#8722;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C and 97% (RH) relative humidity, which is comparable to that of Nafion. The spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time (T1) of the Bi&#8211;O adsorbed protons is significantly shorter than that of the W&#8208;O adsorbed protons, indicating that the protons at the Bi&#8211;O sites have a higher migration rate. 1H magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR (1H MAS NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal [Bi6O8] enhances proton mobility, while [PW12O40] stabilizes transition states, lowering the activation barrier to 0.14&#160;eV. The BPN&#8208;Nafion hybrid membrane enhances direct methanol fuel cell performance with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.82&#160;V and power density of 86&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This integrative design strategy&#8212;synergizing inorganic cluster units with dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks&#8212;establishes a scalable platform for developing PEMFC materials with programmable proton transport pathways and improved operational stability.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficient Raman Enhancement on Organic Semiconductor&#8208;Stabilized Perovskite Heterostructures for Guiding Early Theranostics of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created an organic semiconductor modified perovskite heterostructure, which exhibited high stability without compromising the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance of perovskites with a significant EF &gt;&#160;107. This system was developed as an integrated theranostic SERS platform for miR&#8208;146a monitoring with a detection limit down to 0.2&#160;fM, guiding early theranostics to enhance the therapeutic efficiency for Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
Perovskites have recently emerged as attractive optoelectronic semiconductors due to tunable bandgap, large absorption coefficient, and long carrier lifetime, making it ideal as a kind of chemical&#8208;mechanism based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. However, perovskites generally demonstrate poor stability at ambient conditions, limiting their applications for SERS bioanalysis. Herein, we created a perovskite&#8208;based heterostructure through effectively passivating defects at the interface with hydrophobic organic semiconductors, which simultaneously enhanced the stability and efficiency of perovskite SERS substrate. The significant enhancement factor of 107 was mainly stemmed from the resonance Raman effect and the highly&#8208;efficient charge transfer process driven by a novel light&#8208;induced hot electron transfer mechanism in plasmon&#8208;free substrates previously never reported. This system was subsequently developed as an integrated theranostic SERS platform for miR&#8208;146a monitoring with a detection limit down to 0.2&#160;fM, successfully guiding the early theranostics to enhance the therapeutic efficiency for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work brings new light into the design of efficient and stable semiconductor SERS substrate and opens novel diagnosis and treatment options for AD.

&lt;p&gt;We created an organic semiconductor modified perovskite heterostructure, which exhibited high stability without compromising the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance of perovskites with a significant EF &amp;gt;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. This system was developed as an integrated theranostic SERS platform for miR-146a monitoring with a detection limit down to 0.2&#160;fM, guiding early theranostics to enhance the therapeutic efficiency for Alzheimer's disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskites have recently emerged as attractive optoelectronic semiconductors due to tunable bandgap, large absorption coefficient, and long carrier lifetime, making it ideal as a kind of chemical-mechanism based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. However, perovskites generally demonstrate poor stability at ambient conditions, limiting their applications for SERS bioanalysis. Herein, we created a perovskite-based heterostructure through effectively passivating defects at the interface with hydrophobic organic semiconductors, which simultaneously enhanced the stability and efficiency of perovskite SERS substrate. The significant enhancement factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; was mainly stemmed from the resonance Raman effect and the highly-efficient charge transfer process driven by a novel light-induced hot electron transfer mechanism in plasmon-free substrates previously never reported. This system was subsequently developed as an integrated theranostic SERS platform for miR-146a monitoring with a detection limit down to 0.2&#160;fM, successfully guiding the early theranostics to enhance the therapeutic efficiency for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work brings new light into the design of efficient and stable semiconductor SERS substrate and opens novel diagnosis and treatment options for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystal Facet Engineering of BiOCl Fillers in Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BiOCl nanosheets with exposed {001} and {010} facets (BOC&#8208;001 and BOC&#8208;010) demonstrate pronounced crystal facet effect when employed as fillers in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). BOC&#8208;010 demonstrates a superior ability to promote the dissociation of LiTFSI and facilitates more efficient Li+ migration at its surface, in comparison with BOC&#8208;001. Consequently, the CSPE with BOC&#8208;010 delivers significantly enhanced Li+ conductivity and a higher Li+ transference number. This study first unveils the crystal facet effect of filler in SPEs and offers a promising strategy to enhance SPEs performance.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted much attention due to their high flexibility and good interfacial contact with electrodes. Incorporating appropriate inorganic fillers into the polymer matrix is a normal and effective method to improve its performance. Despite extensive research on novel fillers, the role of filler crystal facets in SPEs remains unexplored. In this work, BiOCl nanosheets with exposed {001} and {010} facets (BOC&#8208;001 and BOC&#8208;010) are selectively applied as fillers to form composite solid polymer electrolytes (CSPE&#8208;BOC). Both calculations and experimental measurements reveal that filler of BOC&#8208;010 promote the dissociation of LiTFSI more effectively and facilitate faster Li+ migration on its surface, compared to BOC&#8208;001. As a result, CSPE&#8208;10BOC&#8208;010 exhibits an enhanced Li+ ionic conductivity (0.83&#160;mS cm&#8722;1 at 60 &#176;C) and Li+ transference number (0.38). The Li symmetric cells with the CSPE&#8208;BOC&#8208;010 exhibit an ultra&#8208;long lifespan, with more than 2,000 hours of stable cycling at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The Li/CSPE&#8208;10BOC&#8208;010/LFP battery also has an excellent cycling performance at 60&#160;&#176;C, retaining140&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;C after 390 cycles. This work deepens the understanding of the crystal plane characteristics of fillers in SPEs and offers a novel, promising strategy to enhance SPE performance.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Self&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct, one&#8208;pot nickel&#8208;mediated Friedl&#228;nder annulation strategy was used to construct Ni&#8208;chelated fused&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;linked COFs. The resulting frameworks combine structural robustness, accessible single&#8208;site Ni centers, and self&#8208;photosensitizing capability, providing a powerful platform for photocatalysis.








Abstract
Conjugated and chemically robust covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating metal ions hold great promise in diverse applications due to their finely tuned optoelectronic properties. However, their synthesis typically relies on post&#8208;synthetic modifications to stabilize linkages and introduce chelation sites, and metal incorporation is almost exclusively achieved through post&#8208;synthetic chelation of pre&#8208;formed COFs. Such approaches often result in compromised crystallinity, incomplete conversion and limited control over modification sites. Here, we report a direct, one&#8208;pot nickel&#8208;mediated Friedl&#228;nder annulation strategy to construct Ni&#8208;chelated fused heterocycle&#8208;linked COFs (NNiN, NNiO, and NNiS). The fused heterocycle linkages act as an additional structural regulation factor, enabling precise tuning of framework packing and metal&#8208;chelation environment, thereby enhancing crystallinity and optoelectronic properties simultaneously. The resulting COFs exhibit extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, efficient Ni chelation and strong charge&#8208;transfer absorption in the visible&#8208;light region. Combining conjugated robust linkages, accessible single&#8208;site Ni centers, and self&#8208;photosensitizing capability, these frameworks provide a powerful platform for photocatalysis. They achieved up to 98% conversion in carbon&#8208;chalcogen coupling reactions, while retaining crystallinity and catalytic activity over multiple cycles. This work thus offers a general strategy for designing stable, &#960;&#8208;conjugated, and metal&#8208;functionalized COFs, broadening opportunities for heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.

         <title>Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy for Photoinduced Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Using Cu(I)&#8208;Phenothiazine Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu(I)&#8208;anchored photoactive two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) serve as both catalysts and radical producers to boost fast polymerization rates and ensure complete catalyst recycling in photoinduced ATRP, which is an almost impossible mission in conventional ATRP processing.








Abstract
The concurrent development of innovative photocatalysts (PCs) that achieve fast reaction rates while ensuring efficient catalyst recycling remains a significant challenge for large&#8208;scale polymer production. Herein, we present a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; strategy that combines a photoactive component with a cyclic trinuclear Cu(I)&#8208;incorporated triangular complex as the intrinsic copper source within three imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As&#8208;synthesized photoactive Cu(I)&#8208;containing COFs demonstrated exceptional performance in aqueous photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization (photo&#8208;ATRP), achieving a record&#8208;breaking turnover number (TON) of 1640 and turnover frequency (TOF) of 82 min&#8722;1, while maintaining narrow polymer dispersity of 1.20. Such performance surpasses previously reported heterogeneous PCs designed for photo&#8208;ATRP. Notably, the COF&#8208;encapsulated &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; catalytic design endows the system with remarkable operational stability and near&#8208;quantitative catalyst recovery. More importantly, such new COFs demonstrate outstanding process compatibility, enabling scalable production of well&#8208;defined block copolymers in a single microreactor, without intermediate purification.

         <title>Nucleophilic Oxygen&#8208;Engineering Dual&#8208;Gradient Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiBOB nucleophilically attacks LiPF6, resulting in the formation of LiPO2F2. Compared to LiBOB, LiPO2F2 exhibits lower charge density and nucleophilicity, leading to a lower HOMO level and a slower oxidation&#8208;decomposition sequence than LiBOB. This sequential decomposition behavior facilitates the formation of a CEI with a dual&#8208;gradient component distribution, which stabilizes the interphase of the LRMO cathode under high cutoff voltage, suppresses electrolyte decomposition, maintains the lattice structure, and inhibits transition metal dissolution.








Abstract
The high&#8208;voltage stability of lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxide (LRMO), particularly at voltages approaching 4.8&#160;V, is governed by the structure of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), the oxidative stability of the electrolyte, and lattice degradation caused by transition metals dissolution. In this work, a molecular engineering strategy is employed to design nucleophilic oxygen&#8208;functionalized additives that construct a dual&#8208;gradient inorganic CEI, effectively modulate interfacial redox reactions, and stabilize the lattice Mn dissolution of the LRMO cathode. Driven by the strong electron&#8208;donating characteristics of the nucleophilic species, the engineered CEI exhibits a robust and zipper&#8208;like architecture composed of an inner lithium borates&#8208;rich layer and an outer lithium phosphates&#8208;dominated layer, promoting fast Li+ transport and enhancing interfacial kinetics. The nucleophilic oxygen&#8208;driven electrolyte mitigates oxidative degradation and suppresses Mn dissolution, enabling LRMO cathodes to exhibit a reversible capacity retention of 80% after 580 cycles at a high&#8208;voltage of 4.8&#160;V&#8208;class. This work provides the efficiency of nucleophilic oxygen&#8208;mediated interfacial engineering in enabling durable high&#8208;voltage operation of LRMO cathodes.

         <title>Engineering Nanoscale Interfacial Solvation Inner&#8208;Outer Configuration via Multi&#8208;Group Synergy for Practical Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study clearly elucidates the interfacial solvation inner&#8208;outer configuration of aqueous electrolyte for the first time. Trace multifunctional group biomolecular additive (DP) contributes to formation of the positively charged Zn2+ solvation shell in outer Helmholtz layer and additive&#8208;involved and H2O/anion&#8208;less shell in inner Helmholtz layer, which affords long&#8208;lifespan practical aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Rational design of interfacial solvation structures in electric double layer (EDL) remains a critical challenge for aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Herein, an efficient multi&#8208;group synergy strategy has been proposed to precisely regulate the interfacial solvation structure at nanoscale, which affords long&#8208;lifespan AZMBs under high depth of discharge (DOD) and low temperature. Through combined in situ experiments and theoretical simulations, we demonstrate trace multifunctional group biomolecular additive cannot alter electrolyte solvation structure, but contributes to formation of the positively charged Zn2+ solvation shell in outer Helmholtz layer (OHL) and additive&#8208;involved and H2O/anion&#8208;less solvation shell in inner Helmholtz layer (IHL). This synergistic configuration enables an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid interface that simultaneously suppresses hydrogen evolution, accelerates desolvation, offers pH buffering capacity, and regulates Zn2&#8314; deposition orientation. Zn anodes deliver high coulombic efficiency of 99.65%, long&#8208;lifespan over 6500 h, and stable operation under low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and high DOD of 85.4%. Furthermore, under practical condition of high mass loading (27&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) and limited N/P ratio of 3.5, Zn||VO2 battery delivers a superhigh surface capacity of 8.1&#160;mAh&#183;cm&#8722;2 and remains stable over 800 cycles, and pouch batteries can stably operate for almost 500 cycles.

         <title>Ultrabright Gold Nanoclusters with Intra&#8208;Cluster Hydrogen Bonding Enable Near&#8208;Zero&#8208;Thickness Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Subcellular Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endowing Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging technologies with in situ near&#8208;zero&#8208;thickness ECL layer to image single cells and fine subcellular structures at high spatial resolution was achieved by synthesizing ultrabright CR4/ATT&#8208;AuNCs with ECL quantum efficiency (ECLQE) up to 13%, approximately 4.2 times higher than of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, and constraining them in proximity to the electrode.








Abstract
Endowing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging technologies with the capability to resolve fine subcellular structures at high spatial resolution remains a challenging yet critical objective. Achieving this requires ultrasmall ECL emitters coupled with in situ confinement strategies to form near&#8208;zero&#8208;thickness ECL layer. Among available candidates, luminescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have emerged as promising options, but their ECL emission remains too weak for effective microscopic imaging. To overcome this limitation, we report ultrabright AuNCs protected by Cys&#8208;Arg&#8208;Arg&#8208;Arg&#8208;Arg peptides and 6&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;thiothymine (CR4/ATT&#8208;AuNCs) as next&#8208;generation ECL emitters. Intra&#8208;cluster hydrogen bonding between neighboring ligands rigidifies their conformation and promotes ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, significantly enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield (&#8764;60&#8208;fold) and electron transfer efficiency (&#8764;4.8&#8208;fold). This synergistic enhancement activates a previously unreported reduction&#8208;oxidation ECL pathway of AuNCs, resulting in over 250&#8208;fold improvement in ECL intensity. Upon immobilization on electrodes with cells, CR4/ATT&#8208;AuNCs generate a robust, near&#8208;zero&#8208;thickness ECL layer visible to the naked eye, directly enabling high&#8208;resolution ECL microscopy that clearly resolves fine subcellular structures down to &#8764;170&#160;nm. This work presents a powerful strategy for designing ultrasmall high&#8208;performance ECL emitters and demonstrates their potential in advancing the spatial resolution limits of ECL bioimaging.

In their Research Article (e202515805), Ye Wang et&#160;al. report the controllable synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (PdxPy, &lt; 2 nm) via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO2&#8208;supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy enhances the atom utilization of Pd and modulates its geometric structure. The sub&#8208;2 nm PdxPy exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&#8722;1 for selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.

         <title>High Performance Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Battery Electrolytes Regulation Mechanism: A Review</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulatory mechanism of sulfur&#8208;based solid electrolytes was reviewed in detail. Based on the problems of thermodynamic and kinetic instability and failure that exist, the mechanism of the regulation strategy was explored from aspects such as the soft&#8211;hard&#8208;acid&#8211;base theory and the glass structure theory. It provides an important reference for the future development of sulfur&#8208;based SEs with both air stability, high ionic conductivity, and good contact performance.








Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) exhibit excellent ionic conductivity and good mechanical properties, but their poor air stability and solid&#8211;solid contact performance seriously hinder the wide application of sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Herein, this paper reviews the history and the major breakthroughs in the development of sulfide SEs. The theories of hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base theory and glass structure theory, as well as several strategies to improve the chemical stability of sulfide SEs, are discussed emphatically. In addition, this paper also explores its thermal runaway mechanism and reaction mechanism from the aspects of thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, providing a reference for the research on improving stability and electrical conductivity. Finally, we summarized the challenges that still need to be addressed at present, as well as the research directions and prospects of sulfide SEs for ASSBs in the future.

This review systematically compares structural and electronic properties of three iron porphyrin carbene isomers&#8212;terminal, bridged, and N&#8208;alkyl derivatives&#8212;across enzymatic and synthetic systems. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals protein&#8208;induced adaptations and isomer&#8208;specific distortions, while M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopic studies elucidate ground&#8208;state electronic configurations and spin transitions. Critical connections between synthetic models and engineered proteins are established, advancing mechanistic understanding of carbene transfer catalysis. 








Abstract
Iron porphyrin carbenes (IPCs), pivotal intermediates in enzymatic carbene transfer reactions, adopt diverse bonding modes and electronic configurations that govern their catalytic functions. This review systematically compares three IPC isomers&#8212;terminal carbenes, bridged carbenes, and N&#8208;alkyl derivatives&#8212;isolated from enzymatic systems with synthetic analogues. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, which reveals protein&#8208;induced structural adaptations and isomer&#8208;specific distortions, also facilitates M&#246;ssbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic studies. Besides ground state assignments on the bridged carbene [Fe(TPP){C&#9552;C(p&#8208;ClPh)2}C1] ((dxy)2(dxz,dyz)2(dz2)1) and the N&#8208;alkyl Mb(N&#8208;CH2COBzyl)(His) ((dxy)2(dxz)1(dyz)1(dz2)1(dx2&#8722;y2)1), M&#246;ssbauer studies also reveal that alongside carbene fragment migration, the bridged carbene, which show shorter Fe&#9472;C(R) distance than the &#963; type Fe&#9472;C(sp2/sp3) bond, retains strong &#960; acceptor capability, in contrast to the stronger &#963; donor and &#960; acceptor capability of the terminal carbene and the N&#8208;alky derivative which nearly loses the bonding to iron. Accordingly, very large tetragonalities (|&#916;/&#955;|&#160;&gt;&#160;16) are observed for the bridged carbene Mb(CHCO2Et)(NMH) ((dxy)2(dxz,dyz)3) which exhibited rhombic EPR pattern under the near parallel ligand orientation. This work establishes critical connections between synthetic porphyrin and enzymatic systems, highlighting the adjustable scaffolds of engineered proteins in stabilizing various intermediates and advancing the mechanistic understanding of carbene transfer reactions.

         <title>Development and Application of Radical&#8208;Mediated Stereochemical Epimerization in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;mediated stereochemical epimerization enables direct stereochemical editing at inert C&#9472;H sites and late&#8208;stage modifications of complex molecules. By controlling hydrogen atom transfer through abstraction and donation, and bond cleavage and reformation, researchers have achieved site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective isomerization at challenging positions, including unactivated tertiary carbons and sterically hindered quaternary carbon stereocenters. This strategy facilitates the total synthesis of natural products.









Abstract
Precise control over stereochemistry (enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity) is essential in the long&#8208;step synthetic protocol of complex molecules bearing multiple stereocenters, such as natural products and pharmaceuticals. Stereospecificity is the ideal goal for the formation of the first and subsequent chiral centers in the specific chemical environment through either an exo&#8208; or endo&#8208;genous molecule&#8211;molecule interaction. In this context, epimerization and isomerization offer valuable supplemental strategies for modifying preexisting stereocenters, thereby enhancing synthetic efficiency, enabling molecular diversification, and facilitating late&#8208;stage modification. Recent advances in radical&#8208;mediated epimerization have further enabled site&#8208;specific inversion of stereocenters, allowing late&#8208;stage access to diverse stereoisomers from a common intermediate. This minireview highlights emerging approaches in radical&#8208;based stereochemical epimerization and discusses their potential applications in the synthesis of complex molecules, emphasizing their role as a complementary strategy to previously established epimerization tactics. Also covered are recent developments in the epimerization of quaternary carbon stereocenters, an underexplored yet promising area that offers new opportunities for innovation in synthetic design.

         <title>Fully&#8208;Functionalized Natural Product Probes to Expand the Chemical Tractability of the Human Proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we exploit the inherent structural complexity of natural products (NPs) to access a unique library of photoaffinity (PA) probes, which we term fully functionalized natural products (FFNPs). Using mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemical proteomics, we uncover hundreds of topology, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective interactions with functionally diverse proteins that currently lack reported chemical probes in live cells. This work supports the potential of FFNPs to expand the boundaries of the ligandable proteome.








Abstract
Photoaffinity (PA)&#8208;based chemoproteomic methods have emerged as a powerful means for proteome&#8208;wide mapping of ligandable proteins directly in cells, as well as the concatenated discovery of small molecule chemical probes. However, due to the relatively low throughput of screening small molecule libraries by proteomics and the synthetic burden incurred in installing the requisite photoactivatable functionality on each member, great priority must be placed on library design to maximize efficient exploration of biologically relevant chemical space and to ensure the identification of authentic binding interactions. To address this challenge, here we leverage the inherent complexity of natural products (NPs) to access a structurally unique series of diastereo/regioisomeric PA probes for ligand discovery in cells. Through semi&#8208;synthesis, we exploit sp3&#8208;rich NP scaffolds and employ mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemoproteomics to identify and quantify their interactions in human cells, uncovering topology, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective ligands for functionally diverse proteins that currently lack reported chemical probes. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of NP&#8208;inspired chemoproteomic libraries to expand the boundaries of the ligandable proteome.

         <title>Cupin&#8208;Type Dimethylsulfoniopropionate Lyase from Pelagibacter ubique (DddKPu) Catalyzes Aza&#8208;Michael Addition of Primary and Secondary Amines to Acrylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase (DddK) was identified as an efficient aza&#8208;Michaelase for the addition of amines to acrylate. Screening 74 amines with wild&#8208;type DddK and its W26G variant yielded N&#8208;substituted and N,N&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;amino acids in 30%&#8211;93% isolated yield. This versatile method enables access to novel &#946;&#8208;amino acids, which serve as valuable building blocks for pharmaceutical synthesis.








Abstract
The formation of carbon&#9472;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis, underpinning the production of amines, imines, and nitriles found in numerous active ingredients. Among the methods for C&#9472;N bond formation, the aza&#8208;Michael addition stands out as a powerful and versatile approach. Herein, we present a biocatalytic strategy for the efficient aza&#8208;Michael addition of primary and secondary amines to acrylic acid, i.e., aza&#8208;Michaelase activity, leveraging the promiscuity of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) lyase from Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062 (DddKPu). In vivo DddKPu catalyzes the &#946;&#8208;elimination of DMSP to sodium acrylate and dimethylsulfide (i.e., a retro sulfa&#8208;Michael reaction). Here, we screened DddKPu against a diverse library of 30 primary and 44 secondary amines. The wild&#8208;type enzyme achieved 90%&#8211;100% conversion and 40%&#8211;86% isolated yields of N,N&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids with secondary amines. For primary amines, the W26G variant proved optimal, furnishing 50%&#8211;100% conversion and 43%&#8211;81% isolated yields of N&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. Notably, the enzyme exhibited remarkable chemoselectivity: for pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanamine, the reaction occurred exclusively at the secondary amine, while for piperidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanamine, it reacted selectively at the primary amine. These findings highlight DddKPu as a versatile biocatalyst for the selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids, expanding the toolbox for C&#9472;N bond formation.

Screening 74 amines with wild-type DddK and its W26G variant yielded &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted &#946;-amino acids in 30%&#8211;93% isolated yield. This versatile method enables access to novel &#946;-amino acids, which serve as valuable building blocks for pharmaceutical synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of carbon&#9472;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis, underpinning the production of amines, imines, and nitriles found in numerous active ingredients. Among the methods for C&#9472;N bond formation, the aza-Michael addition stands out as a powerful and versatile approach. Herein, we present a biocatalytic strategy for the efficient aza-Michael addition of primary and secondary amines to acrylic acid, i.e., aza-Michaelase activity, leveraging the promiscuity of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) lyase from &lt;i&gt;Pelagibacter ubique&lt;/i&gt; HTCC1062 (DddK&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;Pu&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;). In vivo DddK&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;Pu&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; catalyzes the &#946;-elimination of DMSP to sodium acrylate and dimethylsulfide (i.e., a retro sulfa-Michael reaction). Here, we screened DddK&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;Pu&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; against a diverse library of 30 primary and 44 secondary amines. The wild-type enzyme achieved 90%&#8211;100% conversion and 40%&#8211;86% isolated yields of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted-&#946;-amino acids with secondary amines. For primary amines, the W26G variant proved optimal, furnishing 50%&#8211;100% conversion and 43%&#8211;81% isolated yields of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted-&#946;-amino acids. Notably, the enzyme exhibited remarkable chemoselectivity: for pyrrolidin-2-ylmethanamine, the reaction occurred exclusively at the secondary amine, while for piperidin-2-ylmethanamine, it reacted selectively at the primary amine. These findings highlight DddK&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;Pu&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; as a versatile biocatalyst for the selective synthesis of &#946;-amino acids, expanding the toolbox for C&#9472;N bond formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Reaction of Non&#8208;Activated Oximes Catalyzed by Aldoxime Dehydratases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic mode of aldoxime dehydratases for the abiotic radical ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketoximes is reported. Aldoxime dehydratase from Nocardioides simplex was found to efficiently generate iminyl radicals from challenging &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; cycloketone oximes and to promote radical ring&#8208;opening reactions to produce &#947;&#8208; and &#949;&#8208;sulfinylated nitriles under mild conditions. 








Abstract
The iminyl radical is a distinctive N&#8208;centered radical which serves as a versatile synthon in preparation of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. In principle, iminyl radicals can be directly generated by single electron reduction of oximes through elimination of OH group. However, due to the low reactivity of the oxime N&#9472;OH bonds, direct conversion of the oximes does not proceed efficiently, thereby enforcing chemical activation of the oxime OH group which results in the formation of stoichiometric by&#8208;products. To overcome this problem, we are developing a new biocatalytic system using aldoxime dehydratases. Through a series of enzyme screenings, we identified an aldoxime dehydratase from N. simplex (NsOxd) which is capable of catalyzing iminyl radical&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening reactions. Notably, NsOxd efficiently converts the &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; 2&#8208;phenylcyclobutanone oxime within 10&#160;min under ambient conditions and quantitatively produces the corresponding &#947;&#8208;sulfinylated nitrile in &gt;95% yield. This enzyme activity is even faster than that of previously&#8208;reported chemo&#8208;catalysts. Furthermore, evaluation of the scope of potential substrates indicates that NsOxd has a versatile N&#9472;O bond cleaving activity which efficiently generates iminyl radicals from various &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; oximes. These findings highlight the utility of aldoxime dehydratases for managing the reactivity of &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; oximes and for achieving challenging iminyl radical&#8208;mediated catalytic reactions.

         <title>Truxenone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework/Carbon Nanotube Composite for High&#8208;Performance Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>

A composite electrode containing truxenone&#8208;based COF and a small amount of CNTs is reported for low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The electrode exhibits excellent sodium storage performance at low temperature with high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries face great challenges due to the sluggish reaction kinetics. Redox covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with porous structures provide a viable solution to accelerate the ionic diffusion and reaction kinetics at low temperatures. However, the applications of COFs in low&#8208;temperature batteries are still at their infancy stage. Here, a composite electrode containing truxenone&#8208;based COF and a small amount of CNTs is reported for low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The truxenone&#8208;based COF possesses high ratio of active centers and enables high theoretical capacity; while the CNTs guarantee the accessibility of the active sites, the charge transfer efficiency, and the fast reaction kinetics. As a result, the composite electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 365 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 (295 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution). Notably, it offers excellent low&#8208;temperature performance that maintains a high discharge capacity of 263.8 mAh g&#8722;1 (203 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution) at 0 &#176;C, which represents 74% of the capacity at room temperature. Even under extreme weather of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, the capacity maintains 156.8 mAh g&#8722;1 (119 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution) after 100 cycles, with a capacity retention rate of 97%. This work illustrates the synergistic effect of the fast ionic diffusion of truxenone&#8208;based COF and the excellent charge transfer of the CNTs, offering a feasible way to realize low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

Tellurium (Te) and nitrogen (N) heteroatoms were introduced into graphitized mesoporous carbon (Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC) to support small Pt nanoparticles (average size of 3.2&#160;nm) with uniform high loading (40 wt%), yielding the Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC catalyst. Te&#8211;N co&#8208;mediated electron reverse transfer from the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support to Pt enhanced high&#8208;voltage stability and the catalytic activity of Pt, thereby improving the electrical efficiency of Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC.








Abstract
Enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of fuel cells necessitates optimization of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under high&#8208;voltage conditions through improved Pt catalysis. This study introduces an electrocatalyst that uniformly anchors a high loading (40 wt%) of small Pt nanoparticles (3.2&#160;nm) on a novel support: tellurium and nitrogen co&#8208;mediated graphitized mesoporous carbon (Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC). The strong metal&#8211;support interactions arise from Pt&#9472;Te and Pt&#9472;N bonds. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that Te&#8211;N co&#8208;mediation enhances the high&#8208;voltage oxidation resistance of Pt via electron reverse transfer from the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support to Pt. Consequently, the Pt valence state in Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC increases by only +0.085 from open&#8208;circuit potential to 1.5&#160;V, resulting in exceptional durability over 100&#160;000 high&#8208;voltage cycles (1&#8211;1.5&#160;V) with negligible morphological aggregation. Moreover, the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support effectively lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, enabling Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC to achieve outstanding activity (0.7&#160;V at 1.26 A cm&#8722;2 under H2&#8211;air conditions). This translates to an 18.6% increase in electrical efficiency compared with commercial Pt/C at the same output power density. These findings demonstrate the potential of Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC as a robust cocatalyst for high&#8208;voltage ORR and highlight a promising strategy for enhancing Pt catalysis for high&#8208;efficiency fuel cells.

         <title>Tunable Multistate Mechanoresistance in a Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Incorporating Energy&#8208;Dissipative Structures</title>

         <dc:description>
The embedded sacrificial unit exhibits enhanced mechanoresistive behavior. The sacrificial conformational transition can be achieved through the regulation of intramolecular dispersion forces, while realizing multiple stable electrical signals as the junction is compressed and stretched, laying the foundation for constructing multimodal mechanical molecular switches at the molecular level.








Abstract
Mechanoresponsive molecular devices are capable of exhibiting dynamic responses to external mechanical stimuli, enabling applications in smart materials, nano&#8208;devices, and flexible electronics. However, energy conversion induced by mechanical stimuli requires efficient energy dissipation mechanisms. Traditional methods often involve bond breaking or incomplete energy release, which can lead to device failure during continuous operations. Therefore, ensuring the mechanical stability of molecular devices under cyclic external forces remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a pillar[6]arene&#8208;like cyclophane (PLC) as an energy&#8208;dissipative structure to construct a programmable multistate mechanoswitching at the single&#8208;molecule level. We observed that, compared to rigid molecules with low energy dissipation, PLC&#8208;based macrocyclic molecular devices not only withstand mechanical stretching up to 6&#160;&#197; but also exhibit three stable states during the mechanical stretching/compressing processes. Combined with theoretical calculations, we confirm that these three distinct states are related to the charge transport pathways and the strength of the electrode&#8208;molecule interface coupling. This work establishes energy dissipation as a core design principle for multistate mechanoelectronic devices.

         <title>Control of Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Reactivity by Rotaxanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of tetrazine&#8208;mediated inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction has been achieved by rotaxanation. Tetrazine rotaxanes were synthesized in high yield and they displayed a much slower kinetics compared to the corresponding thread. Mechanical bond disassembly upon the right stimulus activates reactivity. Indeed, IEDDA could be selectively activated inside senescent surrogate cells by a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;responsive rotaxane.








Abstract
Rotaxanation is an efficient method to control the tetrazine&#8208;mediated inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. Tetrazine rotaxanes were synthesized in high yield by crown ether active template applied to the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines. Kinetics of the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazine rotaxanes were much slower than those with the corresponding threads. Interestingly, disassembly of the mechanical bond upon the application of the right stimulus activates IEDDA. Control of IEDDA in live cells was proved by means of a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase sensitive tetrazine rotaxane: Enzymatic digestion allowed the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, which resulted in a fluorescent compound.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Cost Lacunary Metal&#8208;Oxo Framework Enables Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>

A novel inorganic lacunary&#8208;structure metal&#8208;oxo framework, BSiW9, serves as ETL of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs, resulting in not only a remarkable PCE but also outstanding long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with p&#8208;i&#8208;n architecture usually exhibit decent efficiency due to the easily tunable energy levels of organic interfacial layers (ILs). However, their operational lifetime is limited by the morphological instability of organic ILs especially the electron&#8208;transporting layer (ETL) that shows strong self&#8208;aggregation tendency. Besides, organic ETLs are confronted with significant challenges including large batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations and high costs. Herein, we develop an inorganic lacunary&#8208;structure metal&#8208;oxo framework as ETL of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs. The resultant molecule, BSiW9, not only shows ultralow cost but also leads to significantly enhanced electron extraction in OSCs. Moreover, the redox activity of BSiW9 allows reinforced electrical conductivity by using a hydroquinone&#8208;derivative dopant, HQ. The doping strategy finally results in a remarkable PCE of 20.5% in p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSC, largely outperforming that using organic ETLs. Meanwhile, an outstanding long&#8208;term stability is obtained in this champion device, with 92% of original efficiency maintained after a maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking for 1250&#160;h, among the longest lifetimes of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing rationally tailored low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;oxo framework as ILs for more industrially compatible OSCs.

         <title>Regioselective Zr5 Nanocluster Photocatalyst for Precise Protein Editing Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel zirconium&#8208;oxo cluster serves as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for regioselective oxidative cleavage and side&#8208;chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme protein. Upon UV irradiation, it generates reactive oxygens species (ROS), with reaction selectivity guided by non&#8208;covalent interactions between the cluster's positively charged surface and electrostatically negatively charged regions on the protein near the cleavage sites.








Abstract
Understanding the impact of oxidative modifications on protein structure and function is of central importance in protein chemistry, necessitating precise and controlled methods for introducing such modifications. Herein, we report a strategy for regioselective chemical editing of a protein using a novel Zr5&#160;nanocluster&#160;as a visible&#8208;light photocatalyst. The&#160; [ZrIV5(&#956;&#9472;&#927;&#919;)2(&#956;&#9472;&#927;)2(&#956;3&#9472;&#927;)Cl2(H2O)6(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1,&#951;2,&#951;1&#8208;tBu&#8208;dihyde&#8208;O,O&#8242;,O&#8243;)5] (Zr5) cluster features a unique [Zr5O5] structural motif and&#160;its electronic structure and light absorption properties&#160;were fully analyzed and reproduced through Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory&#160;(DFT) calculations.&#160;Zr5&#160;exhibits exceptional photophysical properties, including the optical gap of 2.01&#160;eV, the lowest reported to date for a zirconium&#8208;oxo cluster. Under light irradiation at 370&#160;nm, Zr5&#160;mediates the&#160;regioselective cleavage and oxidative side&#8208;chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme, producing&#160;fragments which are ideal for middle&#8208;down proteomics applications. Combined DFT and experimental approaches indicate that Zr5&#160;efficiently produces reactive oxygen species that mediate protein oxidation and cleavage. Comprehensive characterization&#160;confirmed the cluster's stability under reaction conditions, with no detectable structural changes or dissolution, enabling its reuse for multiple times without loss of catalytic efficiency. The unique photocatalytic properties of Zr5&#160;offer new opportunities for precise protein functionalization and pave the way for extending them to other classes of molecular transformations.

We report that highly dispersed &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets (&#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick) could be synthesized via a one&#8208;pot reaction of ultradilute precursors (Co(NO3)2 + 2&#8208;methyimidazole (HmIm) + H2O system) at room temperature in just 1 h. By using thin coatings of the as&#8208;synthesized &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets as self&#8208;sacrificial templates, &#8764;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes could be fabricated in a facile way. The prepared ZIF&#8208;67 membranes demonstrated attractive H2 sieving performance at elevated temperatures (up to 250&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) is an important class of nanoporous materials for high&#8208;performance membranes for gas separation, offering uniform&#8208;sized gas&#8208;selective pores. However, the fabrication of high&#8208;quality sub&#8208;100&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes, critical for high&#8208;performance separation, has remained elusive. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate &#8764;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes. We identify a simple and rapid route to prepare &#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets as a precursor to ZIF&#8208;67. Highly dispersed &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets are synthesized via a one&#8208;pot reaction at room temperature in just 1 h using ultradilute cobalt and linker concentrations in water. The resulting high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets yield compact coating on porous polymeric supports. Well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;67 membranes are prepared by thermal treatment of nanosheets in the presence of a linker and exhibit attractive hydrogen sieving performance at elevated temperatures (up to 250&#160;&#176;C). This approach provides a scalable and versatile platform for hydrogen separation for applications such as precombustion carbon capture.

&lt;p&gt;We report that highly dispersed &#946;-Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets (&#8764;1-nm-thick) could be synthesized via a one-pot reaction of ultradilute precursors (Co(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2-methyimidazole (HmIm) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system) at room temperature in just 1 h. By using thin coatings of the as-synthesized &#946;-Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets as self-sacrificial templates, &#8764;20-nm-thick ZIF-67 membranes could be fabricated in a facile way. The prepared ZIF-67 membranes demonstrated attractive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sieving performance at elevated temperatures (up to 250&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Organocatalytic Microfluidic Double&#8208;Layer Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highest expectations from catalysis with external electric fields, from organic synthesis to sustainable industrial production and the origin of life, cannot be explored because of&#160;the incompatibility with scalable bulk conditions. This challenge is addressed with bioinspired organocatalytic electrical double&#8208;layer architectures as supramolecular electrodes in microfluidic capacitors. The result is an enabling method for scalable electric&#8208;field catalysis.








Abstract
Ideas to use external electric fields to enable, accelerate and direct the movement of electrons during chemical reactions are not new. Theory and experiments under special conditions predict that electric&#8208;field catalysis (EFC) from externally applied fields could change the way we make molecules. The challenge is the incompatibility with organic synthesis under scalable bulk conditions. Access to applied electric fields (AEFs) &gt; 1&#160;V nm&#8722;1, predicted as necessary for direct transition&#8208;state stabilization, is not possible even with electromicrofluidic systems, where the distance between the plate electrodes is minimized. Therefore, we decided to shift our attention from the applied fields to their consequences. We consider electrical double layers (EDLs) that form within a few nanometers from the plate electrodes as engineerable supramolecular electrodes. Applying lessons from cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), we report supramolecular electrodes with effective electric fields (EEFs) that exceed applied fields by more than five million. According to a proline&#8208;catalyzed aldol condensation installed as benchmark reaction, those engineered from polyarginine and pyrenebutyrate are most active for EFC, exactly as in cellular uptake. With the best supramolecular electrodes, EFC triples the yield of one of the most optimized reactions in organocatalysis. New methods to access scalable EFC open up broad perspectives in organic synthesis and beyond.

         <title>Interfacial Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MIL&#8208;125@ZIF&#8208;8 catalyst, featuring asymmetric Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interfacial sites, enables photocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and N2. At the Zn sites, CO2 is reduced to *CO species, while N2 is activated at the Ti sites to form *NH&#8211;NH intermediates. The asymmetric Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interfaces facilitate the coupling of *CO with *NH&#8211;NH to form *CONH2 intermediates, thereby enhancing the efficiency of urea photosynthesis.








Abstract
Urea photosynthesis from CO2 and N2 has profound environmental and energy implications. However, the simultaneous activation of CO2 and N2, along with the promotion of C&#9472;N bond formation, remains a major challenge. Herein, the asymmetric interfacial sites (Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti) were engineered by building oxygen atom bridges between ZIF&#8208;8 and MIL&#8208;125 to enable efficient photocatalytic urea synthesis. The optimized Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interface structure achieves a urea yield of 130&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water and an apparent quantum yield of 5.52% at 350&#160;nm, outperforming most materials reported for urea photosynthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Zn sites catalyze the conversion of CO2 to *CO species, while Ti sites adsorb and activate N2 to generate *NH&#8211;NH species. The asymmetric interfacial sites lower the energy barrier for the coupling of *CO and *NH&#8211;NH to form *CONH2 intermediates, thereby promoting urea photosynthesis. This work provides significant insights into designing interfacial asymmetric sites to facilitate photosynthetic organic chemicals for upgrading the nitrogen cycle.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Based Alternating Copolymers via Photoinduced Radical Copolymerization of Levoglucosenone and Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 17 sugar&#8208;based alternating copolymers was synthesized via photoinduced radical copolymerization of naturally occurring levoglucosenone (LGO) and commercially available vinyl ethers. The resulting polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability, high glass transition temperatures (up to 212&#160;&#176;C), and efficient degradability. In addition, the sugar&#8208;based materials display exceptional adhesion strength, surpassing that of widely used commercial adhesives. Postpolymerization modifications further enabled access to fluorescent materials and grafted semiconducting polymers.








Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a library of 17 sugar&#8208;based alternating copolymers via photoinduced radical copolymerization of naturally occurring levoglucosenone (LGO) and a broad range of commercially available vinyl ethers. This strategy leverages renewable feedstocks and enables precise control over copolymer sequence, affording materials with excellent thermal stability, tunable glass transition temperature (Tg), and on&#8208;demand degradability. The resulting sugar&#8208;based materials exhibit superior adhesive strength compared to commercial benchmarks such as commercial polyurethane adhesive and ethylene&#8208;vinyl acetate (EVA). Postpolymerization modifications further facilitate the preparation of fluorescent materials and graft semiconducting polymers, expanding the functional versatility of these sugar&#8208;based alternating copolymers.

         <title>Interactional Features of (RO)4Ti Species and Their Zr and Hf Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational and experimental studies reveal that Group 4 tetroxides form a new type of &#963;&#8208;hole interaction with N and O nucleophiles, which we propose to name &#8220;titan bonds&#8221; (TnBs). These insights into Ti, Zr, and Hf interactions may aid in the rational design of more selective catalysts for aldol and oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Tetroxides of Group 4 elements are benchmark catalysts for aldol reactions and oxidation processes, achieving high yields and regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Our computational analyses and experimental studies, performed in solution and solid, consistently reveal that these tetroxides form attractive interactions with lone pair compounds exhibiting distinctive &#963;&#8208;hole bond features. We propose naming these novel bondings as titan bonds (TnBs). These new insights into Ti/Zr/Hf tetroxide interactions may significantly aid in designing more effective catalysts with enhanced selectivities.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Calyciphylline F</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final challenge in the total synthesis of the caged polycyclic Daphniphyllum alkaloids was the Calyciphylline D&#8208;type alkaloid, featuring a strained 8&#8208;azatricyclo[4.2.1.04,8]nonane ring system. Presented herein is the total synthesis of calyciphylline F, a member of the calyciphylline D&#8208;type alkaloid family, by an intramolecular [4&#160;+&#160;3] cycloaddition reaction of pyrroles, an intramolecular aldol reaction, and three C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming radical reactions.








Abstract
Calyciphylline F represents the final challenge in the total synthesis of the caged polycyclic&#8208;type of Daphniphyllum alkaloids due to the strained 8&#8208;azatricyclo[4.2.1.04,8]nonane ring system. Here, we report the total synthesis of calyciphylline F. We construct the ring system by applying [4&#160;+&#160;3] cycloaddition reaction of pyrroles with 2&#8208;oxyallyl cations to an intramolecular reaction, followed by an intramolecular aldol reaction and capture of the resulting alkoxide as the xanthate. The bridgehead quaternary carbon center is constructed by the intramolecular addition reaction of the bridgehead radical to the alkoxy&#8208;acrylate, which is designed based on the proposed mechanism of by&#8208;product formation. Finally, another 6&#8208;exo&#8208;radical cyclization reaction constructs the last remaining ring and achieves the total synthesis of calyciphylline F.

         <title>Probing and Enhancing DNA Ligase Specificity via Se&#8208;Atom&#8208;Mutagenesis of ATP for Accurate Gene Synthesis and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The O&#8208;to&#8208;Se&#8208;atom substitution enables the probing and study of mismatch discrimination at the atomic level, and the Se atom in ATP&#945;Se has been used to probe the key interactions and enhance DNA ligation specificity (up to 1000&#8208;fold) within an expanded region (8&#160;nt), allowing the more efficient gene synthesis (200&#8208;fold enhancement) and the more accurate single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) detection.








Abstract
Discriminating against base&#8208;pair mismatches by nucleic acid&#8208;related enzymes is essential for DNA replication, RNA replication, nucleic acid repair, transcription, and translation. However, the discrimination mechanisms at the atomic level remain poorly understood, limited by the availability of atom&#8208;probing methods. Herein, we developed a single&#8208;Se&#8208;atom strategy (using ATP&#945;Se) to explore mismatch discrimination in the DNA ligase system. We found that the Se&#8208;atom (substituting O) in ATP&#945;Se played a key role in the mismatch discrimination of DNA ligase, and ATP&#945;Se significantly improved the ligation specificity, achieving up to 1000&#8208;fold enhancement and expanding the region of mismatch discrimination up to 8&#160;nt. Sequencing ligation products of various substrates generally confirmed the specificity enhancement using ATP&#945;Se. Our mechanistic studies indicated that the specificity increase was correlated with the kcat reduction in mismatch ligations and with the disruption of the key interactions, supported by the site&#8208;specific ligase mutations. Further, using ATP&#945;Se, we achieved over 200&#8208;fold increase in gene assembly efficiency and accomplished mismatch suppression in the single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) detection. In conclusion, our Se&#8208;atom&#8208;probing strategy enables the atomic&#8208;level studies on mismatch discrimination and offers a useful tool for accuracy enhancement, highlighting its broad potential for exploring molecular recognition and specificity.

         <title>A Photothermal Nano&#8208;Switch for Tumor&#8208;Selective Wnt Hyperactivation in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal nano&#8208;switch based on Wnt inhibitory factor&#8208;1 (Wif1) and Wnt&#8208;functionalized gold nanorods (Au&#8208;PEG/Wif1/Wnt) is presented for precise, spatiotemporal modulation of Wnt signaling. Upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the liberated Wnt ligands, combined with mild photothermal heating, hyperactivate the Wnt pathway specifically by inhibiting the phosphorylation of &#946;&#8208;catenin in tumor cells, thus inducing epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, &#946;&#8208;catenin nuclear translocation, and apoptosis.








Abstract
Wnt signaling plays a paradoxical role in cancer, functioning as both a promoter and suppressor depending on its activation level. This duality underscores the critical need for precise and selective modulation, while existing Wnt&#8208;targeting strategies fail to achieve it due to inadequate specificity and control. Here, we report a photothermal nano&#8208;switch based on Wnt inhibitory factor&#8208;1 (Wif1) and Wnt&#8208;functionalized gold nanorods (Au&#8208;PEG/Wif1/Wnt) that enables spatiotemporal and selective activation of the Wnt pathway. Upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, localized heating disrupts Wif1&#8208;Wnt interactions, triggering controlled Wnt protein release. The liberated Wnt ligands, combined with mild photothermal heating, hyperactivate the Wnt pathway specifically by inhibiting the phosphorylation of &#946;&#8208;catenin in tumor cells, thus inducing epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, &#946;&#8208;catenin nuclear translocation, and apoptosis. In contrast, normal cells remain unaffected due to their lower basal Wnt activity, as confirmed by negligible cytotoxicity and unaltered apoptotic markers. In vivo, this system achieves robust antitumor effects in a 4T1 breast cancer model while ensuring safety for healthy tissues. By leveraging the optical properties of gold nanorods for conditional and selective activation, this study establishes a transformative platform for the precise modulation of Wnt signaling, offering significant promise for treating Wnt&#8208;dysregulated diseases with minimal off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Coordination Reconstruction Enhanced Synergistic Nonradical Oxidation Pathways in Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Sustained Pollutant Destruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a coordination modification strategy, enabling O substitution of N in the first shell of cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts. The higher peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation of Co&#8208;N2O2 over Co&#8208;N3O1 stems from more efficient generation and utilization of nonradical reactive oxygen species (e&#8722;, 1O2, HVMO). We achieved nearly 100% sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal in 10&#160;h dynamic membrane reaction and effective landfill leachate degradation.








Abstract
Limited synthetic efficiency and high costs constrain industrial production of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) despite their superior catalytic performance. We report a scalable and economical solid&#8208;state pyrolysis strategy for cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts (Co&#8208;SACs) costing &#8764;$35&#160;kg&#8722;1. Hydrothermal O&#8208;substitution precisely engineers the coordination environment from Co&#8208;N3O1 to Co&#8208;N2O2. The upshifted d&#8208;band center and enhanced electron delocalization of Co&#8208;N2O2 decrease electron density at the Co site, strengthening peroxymonosulfate (PMS) adsorption. Electron paramagnetic resonance, probe experiments, and electrochemical tests synergistic confirmed that Co&#8208;N2O2 significantly promotes nonradical processes, including the generation of singlet oxygen, high&#8208;valent metal oxo species, and electron transfer processes. The resultant Co&#8208;N2O2 catalyst achieved over 98% degradation of high&#8208;concentration sulfamethoxazole (100&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1) within 10&#160;min. The kilogram&#8208;scale Co&#8208;N2O2 (kg&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2) demonstrated outstanding efficiency in treating landfill leachate (2548&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1 TOC removal) and preeminent stability in 14 cycles and 10&#160;h membrane dynamic experiments. This work provides both fundamental elucidation into coordination engineering and a practical solution for large&#8208;scale production of SACs in environmental remediation.

         <title>Hot Electron Photocatalysis Using Nontoxic Self&#8208;Doped Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast Auger processes efficiently generate hot electrons in quantum dots (QDs), enabling photoreduction of aryl halides (up to &#8722;2.90&#160;V versus SCE) and diverse cross&#8208;coupling reactions (C&#9472;C, C&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;S). Quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs demonstrate significantly higher reactivity than CuInS2 QDs, due to enhanced Auger&#8208;mediated hot electron generation. This study highlights the potential of using Auger&#8208;generated hot electrons from nontoxic QDs for challenging organic transformations under mild conditions.








Abstract
Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as versatile photocatalysts for organic transformations. However, a significant drawback is their reliance on toxic metals like lead and cadmium, which limits their widespread application in solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. Furthermore, current systems primarily utilize band&#8208;edge carriers for simpler photoredox reactions, while the potential for harvesting hot carriers in chemical transformations remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we developed nontoxic, cost&#8208;effective, and recyclable ternary CuInS2 and quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs as potent photocatalysts. Our findings demonstrate that hot electrons can be effectively generated through an ultrafast Auger process, enabling the photoreduction of aryl halides (with reduction potentials up to &#8722;2.90&#160;V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE)) and various cross&#8208;coupling (C&#9472;C, C&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;S) transformations. Notably, quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs exhibit significantly higher reactivity compared to CuInS2 QDs, which is attributed to enhanced Auger&#8208;mediated hot electron generation. This work underscores the potential of directly utilizing Auger&#8208;generated hot electrons for extreme&#8208;potential organic transformations under mild conditions using nontoxic QDs.

         <title>Supramolecular Interactions Modulate RNA:DNA Folding Observed via Nanopore Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state nanopores enable the detection of RNA species at the single&#8208;molecule level. To rapidly and accurately identify barcoded RNAs as they translocate the pore, it is imperative to reduce analyte folding. Here, we demonstrate that RNA's supramolecular interactions with urea inhibit folding, increasing the number of readable barcodes while decreasing the number of events required for RNA identification. 








Abstract
DNA and RNA nanotechnology enables the precise assembly of molecular architectures, with applications in bioengineering, supramolecular chemistry, and sensing. The material properties of these biopolymers can be adjusted covalently or, more simply, through non&#8208;covalent interactions with small molecules. Herein, we demonstrate the use of urea, an abundant and inexpensive small molecule, to modulate the stiffness of RNA:DNA hybrid nanostructures. Our results suggest that supramolecular interactions between urea and the A&#8208;form&#8208;like helix rigidify the hybrid polymers, as evidenced by both solid&#8208;state nanopore measurements and atomic force microscopy. Nanopore sensing reveals that preparing topologically&#8208;barcoded RNA:DNA hybrids in urea results in a 50% reduction in folded translocations. This decrease in folded events improves the proportion of useable data points, paving the way for the robust detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA analytes at the single&#8208;molecule level.

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation and Photodegradation in Difluoroboron&#8208;Based Organic Laser Gain Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) in difluoroboron&#8208;based gain molecules is shown to originate from aggregated singlet states (S1), contradicting its previously assumed phosphorescent origin. Additionally, the delayed emission arises from a triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) mechanism rather than a thermally activated (TADF) process, with rapid photodegradation further complicating the excited&#8208;state dynamics and emphasizing the need for improved molecular design.








Abstract
In this study, we investigate the triplet exciton dynamics of a series of difluoroboron&#8208;based organic gain molecules. We synthesized three previously reported molecules from the difluoroboron family and examined their photophysical properties using time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy and high&#8208;level theoretical calculations. Our results reveal that emission from these materials arises predominantly from the singlet manifold via prompt and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;driven delayed fluorescence, rather than from phosphorescence, challenging the earlier assumptions of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) originating from the triplet manifold. In highly concentrated solutions, the emission shows strong resemblance to that of the crystalline phase, confirming its origin from aggregate singlet states rather than monomeric pathways. Further, the materials are prone to photodegradation, which gives rise to new high&#8208;energy fluorescence and phosphorescence bands adding to the complexity of the photophysics of this family of materials.

         <title>Bandgap Engineering of Graphene Nanoribbon via High&#8208;Pressure Topochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Positioning sp3&#8208;CH and N atoms at specific sites can quasi&#8208;continuously tune the bandgap of [8]&#8208;AGNR. Employing our recent&#8208;developed high&#8208;pressure topochemical dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder polymerization, we synthesized site&#8208;specific sp3&#8208;CH and N co&#8208;substituted [8]&#8208;AGNRs and modified the bandgap precisely. Our work provides a general and controllable one&#8208;step synthesis method for producing various [8]&#8208;AGNRs with site&#8208;specific heteroatom substitution.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have attracted broad attention for their potential application in nanoelectronics. The electronic properties of the GNRs are closely related to their chemical structure like width, edge, terminating and hetero atoms, etc., and widely applied synthetic methods for the scalable synthesis of specific GNRs with atom&#8208;scale precision are urgently required. Here, we found that the stoichiometric and ordered positioning of N and sp3&#8208;CH in 8&#8208;armchair&#8208;GNR ([8]&#8208;AGNR) effectively modifies their bandgap in a large range of 0&#8211;2.85&#160;eV by theoretical calculations. Employing our recent&#8208;developed high&#8208;pressure topochemical dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder polymerization, three of these [8]&#8208;AGNRs were synthesized successfully in their bulk phase starting from crystalline dipyridinyl/dipyrimidinyl butadiynes, with the maximum nitrogen content of 27% in mass. The structures of these GNRs were demonstrated by spectroscopy, diffraction, transmission electron microscope, pair distribution function, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance methods. UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance spectra clearly evidenced the precise tuning of the electronic structures in these N and CH substituted [8]&#8208;AGNRs. Our work shows great versatility of this high&#8208;pressure topochemical synthetic strategy in synthesizing GNRs with site&#8208;specific N and sp3&#8208;CH substitutions. This strategy can also be applied to synthesizing more structure&#8208;specific carbon nano&#8208;materials.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of the Formation of Luminescent Lanthanide Complexes in Liposome&#8208;Based Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic ion transporters enable precise control over carboxylate transport across liposome membranes that are preloaded with Ln3+ ions. This process triggers the spatiotemporal formation of luminescent lanthanide complexes within liposome&#8208;based nanoreactors. Cryo&#8208;TEM and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveal that the complexation of lanthanides induces a structural transformation of liposomes from unilamellar to bilamellar vesicles. 








Abstract
The controlled mass transfer across compartmentalised environments in synthetic nanoreactors is essential for enhancing precise spatiotemporal manipulation of chemical transformations within confined spaces. In this study, we present a strategy that integrates a synthetic anion transporter in liposome&#8208;based nanoreactors, allowing for spatiotemporal control over the formation of metal&#8211;organic complexes in liposomes. This approach enables us to effectively modulate the assembly of luminescent lanthanide&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate nanostructures. Fluorescence studies demonstrate that the reaction rate can be customised by varying the anion transporter concentration, which dictates the rate of entry of the carboxylate ligand. Changes in the morphology of the liposome nanoreactors due to the assisted transmembrane transport of benzenedicarboxylate were investigated using cryo&#8208;TEM and time&#8208;resolved SAXS measurements, which revealed a structural transformation of the lipid bilayer during the complex formation. Our findings provide a novel platform for exploring coordination chemistry in nanoscale confinements, opening avenues for the design of biohybrid materials.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI, Electrophoresis&#8208;Correlative Data&#8208;Dependent Acquisition with AI&#8208;Based Data Processing Broadens Access to Single&#8208;Cell Mass Spectrometry Proteomics</title>

An affordable single&#8208;cell proteomics workflow combines capillary electrophoresis, real&#8208;time ion sorting, and AI&#8208;aided spectral deconvolution to profile early Xenopus embryonic cells. Despite using a legacy Orbitrap, this strategy matches or exceeds the sensitivity of modern instruments, uncovering proteome dynamics at sub&#8208;nanogram scale.








Abstract
Single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry (MS) offers unprecedented sensitivity for profiling cellular proteomes, yet widespread adoption is hindered by the cost of advanced instrumentation. Here, we broaden access to single&#8208;cell proteomics by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE), data&#8208;dependent acquisition (DDA) with electrophoresis&#8208;correlative (Eco) ion sorting, and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;assisted spectral deconvolution via CHIMERYS (Eco&#8211;AI). This &#8220;Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI&#8221; workflow was implemented on a custom&#8208;built CE platform coupled to a legacy hybrid quadrupole&#8208;orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus). Despite slower scan speed, lower resolution, and inferior ion transmission efficiency, real&#8208;time Eco&#8208;DDA sampling and CHIMERYS processing enabled identification of up to &#8764;15 peptides per spectrum&#8212;performance on par with modern Orbitrap Fusion Lumos tribrid systems. From 1&#160;ng of HeLa digest, 2142 proteins were identified, surpassing the 969 proteins detected on a contemporary nanoLC Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. Even from &#8764;250 pg (a single&#8208;cell equivalent), 1799 proteins were identified in &lt;15&#160;min of effective separation, raising a theoretical throughput of 48 samples per day. As proof of principle, Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI profiled 1524 proteins from single precursor cells (50&#8211;75&#160;&#181;m diameter) in Xenopus laevis blastulae, revealing proteome asymmetry during neural versus epidermal fate specification. These results establish Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI as a budget&#8208;conscious yet powerful strategy for single&#8208;cell proteomics using CE&#8211;MS.

         <title>Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Mo Site&#8208;Activated Nanozymes for Bienzymatic/Upconversion Synergistic Catalytic Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe&#8211;O&#8211;Mo dual&#8208;atom silicon&#8208;based semiconductor nanozyme (HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs) with hyaluronic acid (HA) modification is successfully constructed on up/downconversion (UC/DC) dual&#8208;emissive nanoparticles by a facile hydrothermal method. With the guidance of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), UC&#8208;induced electron&#160;&#8722;&#160;hole pairs synergize with bienzymatic activity to amplify ROS generation, enabling tumor&#8208;specific synergistic bienzymatic/upconversion catalytic therapy (ET/UCT).








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) hold promise for cancer therapy but suffer from low active site density and restricted intermediate adsorption/desorption capabilities. Herein, Fe/Mo dual&#8208;atom silicon&#8208;based semiconductor nanozymes (FeMoDA), encapsulated in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LPs) and surface&#8208;modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) (denoted as HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs), were developed for synergistic bienzymatic/upconversion&#8208;triggered catalytic therapy (ET/UCT) under second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guidance. Density functional theory calculations revealed that Fe/Mo dual&#8208;atom sites were bridged by Fe&#160;&#8722;&#160;O&#160;&#8722;&#160;Mo coordination, optimizing oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate adsorption/desorption, and improving dual&#8208;enzymatic activities. The peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic performance of HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs showed a Km of 11.54&#160;mM and a Vmax of 1.14&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;M&#183;s&#8722;1, outperforming Fe&#8208; or Mo&#8208;single&#8208;atom coated LPs. HA modification promoted endocytosis (&#8764;5.67&#8208;fold) and microenvironmental acidification (pH from 7.21 to 6.74), further improving ET. Under 980&#160;nm irradiation, upconversion&#8208;triggered electrons synergized with oxidase&#8208;like activity to convert O2 into superoxide (&#8226;O2&#8722;), while holes enabled &#8226;O2&#8722; to singlet oxygen (1O2) conversion, which combined with POD&#8208;like&#8208;produced hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) to achieve synergistic ET/UCT. Tumor H+ and glutathione co&#8208;induced the specific degradation of nanozymes, resulting in tumor self&#8208;enhanced downconversion NIR&#8208;II and MR imaging. Compared with conventional SAzymes, HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs exhibit superior catalytic performance and dual&#8208;modal imaging, offering a synergistic and tumor&#8208;responsive platform for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Assisted Fast Reverse Intersystem Crossing for Efficient TADF Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on symmetry breaking strategy, two tailored TADF materials with ultrafast reverse intersystem crossing and high photoluminescence quantum yields are developed, which can function efficiently as emitters in nondoped OLEDs and sensitizers in hyperfluorescence OLEDs, and provide outstanding external quantum efficiencies of up to 31.2% and 40.2%, respectively.








Abstract
Reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process is critical for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials to realize spin&#8211;flip of triplet excitons in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but the RISC processes of most TADF materials are not fast enough, undermining electroluminescence (EL) efficiency stability and operational lifetime. Herein, a symmetry breaking strategy to accelerate RISC processes is proposed. By designing asymmetric electron&#8208;withdrawing backbone consisting of benzonitrile and xanthone/thioxanthone groups, two new asymmetric TADF molecules, 4tCzCN&#8208;pXT and 4tCzCN&#8208;pTXT, with multiple 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcarbazole donors are successfully developed. They own increased molecular vibrations, which promote intrinsic RISC process and enable multi&#8208;channel transitions via vibronic coupling of high&#8208;lying triplet states. Consequently, they exhibit fast RISC rates of up to 1.24&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1, being one order of magnitude higher than that of the symmetric control molecule. They can perform as luminescent materials in OLEDs, providing outstanding external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 31.2% and 35.8% in non&#8208;doped and doped devices, respectively, with very small roll&#8208;offs. The OLEDs using them as sensitizers for multi&#8208;resonance emitters achieve remarkable EQEs over 40%, and extraordinary operational stability with LT90 of 24974&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, demonstrating their great potentials in OLEDs.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal meta&#8208;Allenylation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective formal meta&#8208;allenylation of pyridines is developed through their redox&#8208;neutral temporary dearomatization to oxazinopyridines under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite, olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This is the first enantioselective functionalization of oxazinopyridines, which results in meta&#8208;allenylic pyridines with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.5:0.5 e.r.).








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective functionalization of pyridines is an important yet challenging transformation. Temporary dearomatization of pyridines through redox&#8208;neutral cycloaddition has recently emerged as a reliable and attractive strategy for meta&#8208;functionalization of pyridines. Despite the amenability of the resulting bench&#8208;stable cycloadduct, oxazinopyridine, to a variety of electrophilic and radical&#8208;based reagents, its enantioselective functionalization remains unexplored. Herein, we present the first enantioselective meta&#8208;functionalization of pyridines through the intermediacy of oxazinopyridines. This highly enantioselective formal meta&#8208;allenylation of pyridines is achieved by treating the easily accessible oxazinopyridines with racemic allenylic alcohol under the combination of a catalytic amount of an Ir(I)/(P, olefin) complex and Lewis acidic Sc(OTf)3 followed by acid&#8208;mediated rearomatization. With oxazinopyridines derived from unsubstituted or suitably substituted pyridines, iterative 3,5&#8208;difunctionalization is possible, which also allows for the stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;allenylic pyridines.

         <title>Protein Cage Inspired Bridge&#8208;Island Effect Enables Low&#8208;Temperature Targeted Self&#8208;Assembly of Hierarchical Hollow Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We propose a protein cage inspired ionic weaving strategy that enables the bottom&#8208;up construction of micro/nano hierarchical hollow Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) under mild conditions. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of soft templates is elucidated, wherein the VO2+&#8208;mediated bridge&#8208;island effect facilitates both the formation of microscale hollow frameworks and the localized nucleation of nanocrystals. The resulting NVOPF&#8208;based cathodes exhibit outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability and ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Achieving targeted morphological control over polyanionic cathodes under mild conditions remains a critical challenge. Drawing inspiration from the self&#8208;assembly of protein cages, we propose an ionic weaving strategy for the low&#8208;temperature fabrication of hierarchical hollow Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes. By introducing low&#8208;cost monosodium glutamate as a template precursor, the derived glutamate species self&#8208;assemble into hollow micellar soft templates under the coordination bridging of VO2+ ions. Subsequently, PO43&#8211;, Na+, and F&#8211; ions are electrostatically attracted to VO2+&#8208;anchored microdomains, triggering island&#8208;like nucleation. The VO2+&#8208;mediated bridge&#8208;island effect facilitates both the construction of microscale hollow soft templates and the localized nucleation of nanocrystals, thereby enabling micro/nano hierarchical hollow morphology control of NVOPF under mild conditions. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism underlying hollow soft template formation is systematically elucidated for the first time through a combination of soft matter probing techniques, including fluorescence microscopy and negative staining, supported by density functional theory calculations and all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting NVOPF&#8208;based cathode exhibits ultra&#8208;stable high&#8208;rate cycling and excellent low&#8208;temperature durability. This work establishes a new paradigm that integrates supramolecular self&#8208;assembly with metal&#8208;ion coordination chemistry for the rational design of fast&#8208;charging polyanionic cathode materials.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Molecular Stabilization of Spacer Cation&#8208;Mediated Aging Dynamics in Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Precursors Enables Efficient Solar Cells</title>

Unraveling spacer cation&#8208;mediated degradation in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors, this work introduces 4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid (CFB) as a dual&#8208;functional stabilizer. CFB stabilizer suppresses spacer cation degradation and coordinates multi&#8208;stage crystallization. The corresponding precursor delivers extended shelf life and devices achieve a record&#8208;low energy loss of 0.38&#160;eV.








Abstract
The aging dynamics of perovskite precursor solutions critically govern the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. However, the underlying degradation mechanisms in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors remain elusive, particularly regarding the pivotal role of spacer cations in modulating decomposition pathways. This study elucidates the intrinsic aging mechanisms in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors, revealing that spacer cation integration fundamentally governs decomposition kinetics. A dual&#8208;functional solution stabilizer, 4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid (CFB), is strategically designed to concurrently mitigate precursor degradation and regulate crystallization dynamics. The carboxyl moiety undergoes spontaneous deprotonation to establish robust hydrogen bonds with guanidinium (GA+), effectively suppressing methylamine (MA0)&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attacks and preventing irreversible addition&#8208;elimination reactions between GA+ and MA0. Simultaneously, CFB orchestrates multi&#8208;stage crystallization control through coordination modulation, yielding highly oriented perovskite crystals with passivated grain boundaries. The optimized devices demonstrate exceptional photovoltaic performance with a remarkably low energy loss of 0.38&#160;eV. Notably, devices fabricated from aged precursors maintain 90% of initial efficiency over 42 days of ambient storage. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices deliver optimized humidity stability and thermal stability.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Homing Liposomal Nanobot for Active Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In view of the optimal activity of glucose oxidase (GOD) at pH 5.5 and lower pH values in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a self&#8208;homing GOD&#8208;powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) was designed. This nanorobotic system can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) through &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#8208;mediated transcytosis and pH&#8208;guided chemotactic motion, achieving a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in delivery efficiency for enhanced glioblastoma (GBM) chemotherapy. 








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a substantial obstacle in therapy since the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and tumor microenvironment (TME) severely prevent the access of most exogenous therapeutic agents to the central nervous system. Overcoming this dual defense established by BBB&#8208;TME is a critical challenge in GBM therapy. Here, we present a glucose oxidase (GOD)&#8208;powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) to breach the BBB&#8208;TME through self&#8208;homing navigation guided by the acid and glucose in TME&#8212;a mechanism rooted in the regulation of GOD activity, with optimal performance in acidic environments to actively deliver drugs for GBM chemotherapy. The lipoNbot features an asymmetric structure composed of GOD&#8208;modified cancer cell membranes and &#947;&#8208;glutamylated lipids, which synergistically enhance BBB&#8208;TME penetration through chemotactic diffusiophoresis and &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#8208;mediated transcytosis. The proton sponge effect facilitates lysosomal escape for BBB traversal. In vivo investigation indicates that lipoNbots achieve a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in delivery efficiency. Such a lipoNbot poses the specific biochemical cues of GBM for self&#8208;homing navigation, establishing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept framework utilizing the pathological features for active therapy of central nervous system diseases.

         <title>Stereodivergent Assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reaction via Photoinduced Pd and Pd/Ir Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excited Pd&#8208;catalyzed in situ assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction is designed by using readily available alkenes, esters, and nucleophiles as substrates. Both (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;allyl skeletons are achievable and stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers [(E,R), (E,S), (Z,R), and (Z,S)] is realized.








Abstract
Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction typically relies on the use of alkenes containing an &#945;&#8208;leaving group as the substrates. In comparison, an in situ assembling model from feedstock chemicals represents a distinctive and practically valuable route, yet remains undeveloped. Here we report an unprecedented excited Pd&#8208;catalyzed in situ assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction by using readily available alkenes, esters, and nucleophiles as substrates. With the development of a HAT/Heck/allylation cascade protocol, various (E)&#8208;allyl compounds are prepared in good yields and stereoselectivities. Meanwhile, a novel photoinduced Pd/Ir relay catalysis is designed to enable stereoselective preparation of challenging (Z)&#8208;allyl compounds. Stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers [(E,R), (E,S), (Z,R), and (Z,S)] is also realized via this excited&#8208;state Pd chemistry, different from typical ground&#8208;state catalytic models. A broad range of N&#8208;, C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;derived nucleophiles and different alkenes and esters show high compatibility with the transformation. The protocol is further applied to the concise synthesis of seven bioactive molecules from bulk materials, highlighting the reliability, generality, and practical value of the design. Mechanistic studies support the present design.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Membrane&#8208;Bound Compartment for Precise Regulation of Enzyme Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature, we report a visible light&#8208;driven membrane&#8208;bound compartment composed of photoisomerizable phenylazothiazole lipids and phospholipids, which enables reversible and graded regulation of enzyme activity. This biomimetic strategy operates without enzyme modification and mutagenesis, offering a versatile and biocompatible platform applicable to a broad range of enzymes.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive systems provide a powerful tool to reversibly regulate enzyme activity. However, inhibitor&#8208;based strategies, though widely used, are often restricted to specific enzymes. Noninhibitor strategies, such as enzyme surface modification or genetic mutation, often compromise structural integrity or residual activity. Inspired by the gating mechanisms of biological membranes, we reported a visible light&#8208;driven membrane&#8208;bound compartment system constructed from phenylazothiazole gated lipids and phospholipids. In this design, phenylazothiazole lipids undergo reversible isomerization between trans and cis configurations under alternating purple and green light, generating continuous nanomechanical motions that transiently enhance membrane permeability. This dynamic gating behavior enables substrate diffusion across the membrane under light exposure and allows the activity of encapsulated enzymes to be switched on and off in a noninvasive, temporally defined manner. This system requires no chemical modification or mutagenesis, thus preserving the native structure and activity of encapsulated enzymes. Beyond binary regulation, precise modulation of the irradiation pattern permits graded control over enzyme activity, offering an advanced level of functional tunability. Using carbonic anhydrase, catalase, and glucose oxidase as models, we demonstrate that enzyme activity can be reversibly and quantitatively regulated via programmable light inputs. This strategy offers a broadly applicable and biocompatible platform for spatiotemporal enzyme regulation.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries through Halogen Bonding Inversion and Non&#8208;Identical&#8208;Frequency Molecular Vibrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge preanisotropy of ClAN forms &#963;&#8208;holes specific adsorption, which assures electron&#8208;scale manageable coordination to high valence iodine species (I+). The non&#8208;identical&#8208;frequency vibrations response of ClAN with water molecules leads to rapid migration in protic solvents. The combination of the two drives the targeted coordination of the electrolyte additives to I+, breaking the reliance on the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte in conventional multi&#8208;electron transfer zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
The activation of four&#8208;electron transfer behavior through I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion reactions is crucial for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) but is hindered by the rapid hydrolysis of I+ in protic solvents. Theoretically, the directionality and modifiability of halogen bonds (XBs) can be used to regulate the hydrolytic disproportionation of I+. Given that the conventional coordination configuration is not applicable because of the locking of the XB donor (I+), the inversion of the coordination configuration to establish a charge distribution preanisotropy (&#963;&#8208;holes) and thus realize XB&#8208;stabilizing electron&#8208;scale coordination is vital for breaking down the barriers existing in protic solvents. To counteract external environmental disturbances, the cohesive energy differentiation based on the Hansen parameter creates the non&#8208;identical&#8208;frequency molecular vibrations of additives with water. Herein, an electrolyte additive (chloroacetonitrile, ClAN) with these advantages enabled the redox coupling of I&#8722;/I0/I+ at a very low salt concentration (4 molar kg&#8722;1). The corresponding ZIB exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 175.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 and showed an extremely high specific capacity at high rates (133.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1). This work establishes a generalized framework and new horizons for halogen batteries with multiple electron transfers.

         <title>Development of Indolo&#8208;Bicyclo[3.1.1]Heptane as a Carbazole Isostere Through Radical Indolization of Bicyclo[1.1.0]Butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of two functional groups&#8212;isonitrile and alkene&#8212;into the Fukuyama radical indolization reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been successfully developed. This reaction offers a direct and efficient synthesis of indolo&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a promising carbazole isostere, with high bond&#8208;forming efficiency and a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicate that triplet energy transfer plays a pivotal role as a key step.








Abstract
Semisaturated ring systems with a balanced fraction of C(sp3) have garnered increasing attention in drug development. In this study, we propose indolo&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane as a potential carbazole isostere and present a novel strategy for synthesizing this new semisaturated polycyclic scaffold. The synthesis involves using bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as radical precursors/terminators in the Fukuyama radical indolization reaction with 2&#8208;alkenylarylisocyanides, providing a highly efficient approach to construct a tricyclic system in a single step. These reactions represent a rare example of two functional groups (isonitrile and alkene) being sequentially involved in the cyclization process within BCB chemistry.

         <title>Mechanofluorochromic Elastomers Based on Reversible Helical Transition of Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymeric mechanofluorochromic (MFC) mechanism is introduced, which utilizes force&#8208;induced conformational transition of the helical main chain in poly(phenylacetylene) from cis&#8208;cisoid to cis&#8208;transoid. This mechanism enables reversible fluorescence behavior, making it applicable to advanced MFC elastomers with high MFC sensitivity and superior reversibility.








Abstract
Mechanofluorochromic (MFC) materials possessing both high sensitivity and excellent reversibility are crucial for achieving real&#8208;time mechanical sensing and biomedical probing. Nonetheless, it currently faces the challenge of possessing both critical properties at excellent levels. Herein, we have proposed a reversible polymer mechanochromic mechanophore utilizing a novel mechanism that enables &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; fluorescence, triggered by a force&#8208;induced helical conformational transition in poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) from the fluorescent compact cis&#8208;cisoid (cc) to the non&#8208;fluorescent loose cis&#8208;transoid (ct) conformation. Upon release, the restoring force, coupled with the reformation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, drives the helical backbone to revert to cc conformation, thus enabling reversible mechanofluorochromism. A series of helical PPAs featuring vinyl groups underwent covalent crosslinking with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), yielding a range of MFC elastomers. We developed an in situ stretching&#8208;fluorescence testing device to achieve real&#8208;time monitoring of force&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra. By adjusting the crosslinking density, Vi&#8208;CP&#8208;0.01@PDMS&#8208;0.003 exhibited the highest MFC sensitivity. Significantly, the novel MFC elastomer showcases outstanding reversibility, maintaining its performance across 10 cycles. This study demonstrates a novel MFC mechanism that produces elastomers with high sensitivity and excellent reversibility, paving the way for further MFC materials development based on innovative mechanism.

         <title>Breaking the Performance Limit of Pure Metals for N2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional NRR electrocatalysts suffer from low N2 concentration and competitive H2O/*H adsorption. This study proposes three&#8208;phase&#8208;optimized hollow fiber electrodes to boost NRR by elevating local N2 concentration, thereby modulating *N2 and *H coverage. The strategy demonstrates broad applicability across various metal catalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) offers a sustainable pathway for ambient&#8208;condition ammonia synthesis, yet its efficiency is fundamentally limited by the low N2 concentration in aqueous systems and the competing strong adsorption of H2O/H intermediates on conventional bulk metal catalysts. Herein, we propose a universal micro/nanoengineering strategy to address these challenges by constructing three&#8208;phase&#8208;interface&#8208;optimized hollow fiber (HF) electrodes. This design simultaneously enhances local N2 enrichment and modulates the surface coverage of critical intermediates (*N2 versus *H), thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium toward NRR. As a proof of concept, Fe&#8208;based HF electrodes achieve a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 27.1&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 3.5% under ambient conditions&#8212;values dramatically enhanced by &#8764;60&#8208;fold and &#8764;35&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to planar Fe electrodes. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hierarchical porous architecture of HF electrodes promotes N2 diffusion and alters the adsorption hierarchy of intermediates, effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution while activating N&#8801;N bond cleavage. Crucially, this strategy demonstrates broad applicability, as evidenced by significantly improved NRR performance across diverse metals (e.g., Cu, Ni), highlighting its potential as a general platform for advancing sustainable ammonia electrosynthesis.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Promoted Reductive Regeneration on Cobalt Catalysts Enables Efficient Dual&#8208;Pathway Hydrazine Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;pathway mechanism is unveiled for hydrazine oxidation on cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and a mediated pathway involving Co(II)/Co(0) cycling. Defect engineering accelerates the chemical reduction of Co(II) by hydrazine, enabling rapid regeneration of Co(0) active site, boosting both activity and durability, and leading to efficient low&#8208;voltage hydrazine&#8208;assisted water splitting.








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) represents a promising low&#8208;energy pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, yet mechanistic ambiguities and catalyst instability hinder its practical implementation. Herein, we elucidate the dual&#8208;pathway nature of HzOR on cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and mediated oxidation via the redox cycle between metallic Co and cobalt hydroxide species. This mechanistic insight moves beyond the traditional focus on solely enhancing the intrinsic activity in the direct pathway. Instead, it highlights the chemical redox reaction between hydrazine and Co(II) as a central process that not only regenerates metallic Co sites for direct pathway but also drives the mediated oxidation route. Guided by this understanding, we designed a defect&#8208;rich cobalt catalyst through a one&#8208;step electrodeposition method, enabling fast chemical reduction of oxidized Co species by hydrazine. As a result, the catalyst delivers superior HzOR performance, reaching a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at only &#8722;79&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, along with outstanding long&#8208;term stability. Combined electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) analyses reveal that defect engineering significantly promotes the dual&#8208;pathway HzOR on Co&#8208;based catalysts. This work provides mechanistic understanding of HzOR electrocatalysis and highlights a general strategy for designing efficient, durable non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts.

         <title>Partitioning COF Membrane Channels into Ultramicroporous and &#960;&#8208;Electron&#8208;Rich Compartments for Multicomponent Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Channel partition has been achieved in two novel alkynyl COF membranes by using click chemistry, which results in an ultramicroporous configuration as well as concentrated charge distribution. The resultant COF membranes are capable of efficiently separating multi&#8208;cation mixtures and multi&#8208;anion mixtures.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) build a versatile platform for constructing separation membranes, affording them disruptive candidates for nanoscale molecule/ion sieving. However, the reported aperture of COFs mainly concentrates on 0.8&#8211;10.0&#160;nm, leaving a daunting challenge in fabrication of ultramicroporous (&lt;0.7&#160;nm) COF membranes. Herein, the channel partition of COF membranes is elaborately implemented by taking advantage of the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) based on click chemistry. Two kinds of novel alkynyl COF membranes bearing symmetric alkynyl monomers are predesigned and synthesized. The alkynyl groups can react with dual&#8208;azide molecules to form triazole ring bridge, which allows the partition of hexagonal or tetragonal channels. Moreover, the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich structures of triazole ring offer cation&#8208;philic or anion&#8208;repulsive region, showing great potentials in precise ion separations. Consequently, the superior performance is obtained in separating ternary/binary ion mixtures: Li+/Mg2+/(K+) and F&#8722;/SO42&#8722;/(Cl&#8722;). Example of dealing with a K+/Li+/Mg2+ ternary mixture, the optimum p&#8208;TpPa&#8208;C&#8801;CH membrane exhibits an actual selectivity of 101.2 for K+/Mg2+ and 30.9 for Li+/Mg2+. The strong adaptability and wide range of application scenarios of our COF membranes exceed the ever&#8208;reported membranes. This work provides a fundamental to comprehending the channel manipulation mechanisms and advances the development of high&#8208;performance ion separation membranes.

         <title>Quinuclidinium&#8208;Based Microporous Anion Exchange Membranes for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microporous AEMs with extreme alkaline stability and confinement&#8208;induced high conductivity have been developed for water electrolysis. The presented membrane, poly (terphenyl&#8208;triptycene&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PTPQ&#8208;Trip), exhibited high OH&#8722; conductivity and record&#8208;setting alkaline stability. The water electrolyzers configured with PTPQ&#8208;Trip can tolerate varied temperatures, current densities, alkaline concentrations, and operation interruptions, and operate continuously under high alkaline concentrations. This work promises the integration of renewable electricity for water electrolysis.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is a promising green hydrogen production method; however, it is constrained by the moderate OH&#8722; conductivity and inadequate alkaline stability of anion exchange membranes (AEMs). Here we report a series of quinuclidinium&#8208;based AEMs with branched and microporous structures, achieving 99.95% OH&#8722; conductivity retention after 3100&#160;h in 10&#160;M NaOH at 80 &#176;C. By tuning the rigidity of the branching units to limit chain packing, micropores were created to enhance OH&#8722; transport, which improved the diffusion coefficient of OH&#8722; by 1.6 times within the poly (terphenyl&#8208;triptycene&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PTPQ&#8208;Trip) membrane having the most rigid structure. An AEMWE configured with a PTPQ&#8208;Trip membrane and nickel&#8208;alloy catalysts can tolerate varied alkaline concentrations and deliver a hydrogen production current density of 2.8 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V in 5&#160;M KOH, which can be continuously operated at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 and 30 &#176;C for over 1200 h, with intentionally included stop/start interruptions. The assembled AEMWE demonstrated stable operation for 1400 h under alternating operational current densities and varying electrolyte temperatures. This work underscores the critical role of alkaline&#8208;resistant microporous AEMs and highlights the adaptability of AEMWE for hydrogen production using renewable electricity.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Silver Leaching from Manganese&#8211;Silver Ore Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network Formation</title>

A simple&#8208;structured, cyanide&#8208;free leaching system exemplifies H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed metallurgy by dissociating lattice&#8208;confined Ag in manganese&#8211;silver ore via two&#8208;stage kinetics and forming helical AgCl chains stabilized by CH&#8230;Cl&#8722; hydrogen bonds to enable&#160;&gt;&#160;90% Ag recovery.








Abstract
Silver is an increasingly scarce resource, necessitating green leaching methods for low&#8208;grade ores. Conventional cyanidation, however, suffers from extreme toxicity and environmental hazards that make it unsustainable. We report a nontoxic synergistic leaching system based on oxalic acid and cyano&#8208;functionalized branched quaternary ammonium salts. Under mild conditions, this one&#8208;step method enables efficient and selective leaching of lattice&#8208;confined silver from polymetallic manganese&#8211;silver ore, with recoveries exceeding 90%. Kinetic studies reveal a two&#8209;stage process, with an initial rapid dissolution of exposed manganese oxides releasing silver followed by a slower breakdown of the iron matrix to liberate encapsulated minerals. The core breakthrough is the discovery that AgCl combines with chloride anions from the quaternary ammonium salt to form a unique inorganic helical chain structure. The stability of this helical assembly is attributed to an ordered CH&#8230;Cl&#8722; H&#8208;bonded network. Spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that this network undergoes an energetically favorable reconstruction that overcomes the high lattice energy of AgCl. This finding demonstrates that the cooperative effect of weak H&#8208;bonds can dissociate covalently stabilized solids. Our study thus provides an innovative strategy for sustainable silver metallurgy and introduces a new paradigm of H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed metallurgical design.

         <title>Formal C&#9472;H Functionalization of Quinolines at the C7 Position Through a Traceless Directing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed formal C&#9472;H arylation and alkenylation of quinolines at the remote C7 position with diverse iodonium triflates has been achieved by using a traceless N&#8208;acyl directing group, providing an efficient and practical strategy for the synthesis of a new family of C7&#8208;functionalized quinolines with high regioselectivity.








Abstract
The precise C&#9472;H functionalization of quinolines is of high interest in organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, although many strategies have been developed for the regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization of the quinoline scaffold, the facile and selective remote C&#9472;H bond functionalization of quinolines at the geometrically and electronically disfavored C7&#8208;position has remained underdeveloped. Here, we disclose a Cu&#8208;catalyzed formal C&#9472;H arylation and alkenylation of quinolines at the C7 position with diverse iodonium triflates. The reaction features exclusive C7&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, short reaction time, and simple operation. This practical protocol has also been applied in the analogous C7&#8208;H functionalization of tetrahydroquinolines and the further C7&#8208;elaboration of quinolines. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the key to the success of this transformation is the unique ring&#8208;size&#8208;induced in situ removal of the N&#8208;acyl directing group, constituting a traceless directing strategy for the rapid access to a variety of C7&#8208;substituted neutral quinolines.

         <title>Spillover Hydrogen Boosts Nitroarene Hydrogenation to Industrial Activity with Ppm&#8208;Level Platinum Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spillover hydrogen significantly enhances the turnover frequency of platinum single atoms, thereby enabling a nitroarene hydrogenation performance comparable to that of industrial catalyst at a low concentration of 300&#160;ppm. The Pt1/Ni@C catalyst provides new insights into the efficient screening of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts.








Abstract
The application of noble single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) at trace loadings is constrained by a low space&#8208;time yield, presenting a formidable challenge in elevating the activity of SACs to be comparable to industrial catalysts in nitroarene hydrogenation. In this study, the spillover hydrogen from a carbon&#8208;coated nickel support (Ni@C) coupled with 300&#160;ppm platinum results in a 25.7&#8208;fold enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF, 44.1&#160;s&#8722;1), thereby achieving a space&#8208;time yield equivalent to 1&#160;wt.% Pd/C industrial hydrogenation catalyst. Remarkably, the Pt1/Ni@C catalyst preserves excellent stability under rigorous conditions, including acidic, basic, and oxidative environments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that spillover hydrogen effectively reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier, with the energy barrier height inversely correlated to the density of adsorbed spillover hydrogen on Pt single atom. Extrapolating the enhanced hydrogenation effect to other SACs and nitroarene substrates shows that spillover hydrogen can either promote or inhibit hydrogenation processes. The density of adsorbed spillover hydrogen serves as a predictive descriptor for discerning the direction of the synergistic effect in single&#8208;atom catalyzed hydrogenation. This study provides insightful guidance for the rational design of more efficient and industrially viable SACs exploiting hydrogen spillover.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule F4TCNQ is introduced to bridge MeO&#8208;2PACz and perovskite layer. F4TCNQ homogenizes the buried interface via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and charge&#8208;transfer complexes, passivates the defects, and promotes perovskite crystallization. Meanwhile, p&#8208;type doping by F4TCNQ elevates the SAMs work function and enhances charge transfer driving force. Optimized devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.91% with a high VOC of 1.202 V and robust stability.








Abstract
To improve the interfacial match between the hole transport layer (HTL) and perovskite active layer (PAL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) is introduced to bridge the self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) [2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz) and PAL. F4TCNQ eliminates molecular voids in the SAMs via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, forming charge&#8208;transfer complexes that homogenize interfacial potential and promote perovskite crystallization, increasing grain size from 0.53 to 0.88&#160;&#181;m. The cyano groups and fluorine atoms on F4TCNQ passivate Pb2&#8314; and I&#8722; defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding, suppressing ion migration and carrier nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, p&#8208;type doping by F4TCNQ elevates the SAMs work function, reducing the hole extraction barrier by 0.12&#160;eV and enhancing charge transfer driving force. Optimized devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.91% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.202&#160;V, while retaining 91% efficiency after 1000&#160;h of maximum power point tracking, attributed to stabilized ion dynamics and robust interfacial adhesion. This work demonstrates molecular bridging as a scalable strategy for high&#8208;performance photovoltaics.

         <title>Solvent Chain&#8208;Length Engineering Enables All&#8208;Climate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A hybrid&#8208;solvent electrolyte is designed by combining short&#8208;chain ethers for fast ion transport with long&#8208;chain glycol ethers to improve thermal and voltage stability, together with DOL and FEC additives. This strategy balances ionic conductivity, interfacial stability, thermal robustness, voltage tolerance, and low&#8208;temperature adaptability, enabling sodium&#8208;ion batteries with fast charging, long cycle life, and wide&#8208;temperature operation.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;rate capability, long&#8208;term cycling stability, high&#8208;voltage tolerance, and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) remains a challenge due to intrinsic solvent trade&#8208;offs. Here, we propose a molecular&#8208;scale electrolyte design strategy addressing this multi&#8208;objective optimization through solvent chain&#8208;length engineering. By coupling short&#8208;chain ethers (low&#8208;temperature kinetics) and long&#8208;chain glycol ethers (high&#8208;voltage/thermal stability) with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), we construct a hybrid&#8208;solvent electrolyte that redefines Na&#8314; solvation chemistry. Systematic solvent&#8211;solvent interaction modulation weakens Na&#8314;&#8208;solvent binding to accelerate ion transport, while FEC&#8208;induced anion&#8208;rich coordination shells enhance interfacial stability. The hybrid electrolyte enables Na3V2(PO4)3||Na cells to deliver an 82.75 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity after 9500 cycles at 10 C, sustain 600&#8208;day operation at 1 C, and function across &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C. Symmetric Na||Na cells demonstrate stable cycling for over one year. Moreover, the electrolyte exhibits good compatibility with various commercial cathode materials within a wide voltage window of 2.0&#8211;4.5&#160;V and demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in full&#8208;cell systems. This work demonstrates solvent chain&#8208;length&#8208;driven solvation engineering as a viable strategy to concurrently address kinetic, thermodynamic, and interfacial challenges, offering a practical pathway toward all&#8208;climate SIBs with balanced multi&#8208;performance metrics.

         <title>Circumventing Radical Generation on Fe&#8211;V Atomic Pair Catalyst for Robust Oxygen Reduction and Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed Fe&#8211;V atomic pair catalyst (Fe1V1&#8208;NC) proceeds via direct O&#9552;O breaking pathway and thus circumvents the ROS radical generations, fundamentally enhancing ORR stability for perdurable zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Iron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C) catalysts are considered the most active platinum&#8208;free alternative for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) from general mechanistic pathway rapidly impair the ORR activity and stability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. Herein, we establish and report an ORR pathway&#8208;switching strategy to circumvent ROS generation and fundamentally improve the activity and stability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C via DFT guided catalyst design. The constructed Fe&#8211;V atomic pair catalyst (Fe1V1&#8208;NC) with N2Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;VN2 configuration enables side&#8208;on adsorption of O2 and subsequent direct&#8208;breaking of the O&#9552;O bond to form O*, thereby avoiding the formation of ROS radicals. Importantly, there is intersite electron interaction between FeN4 and VN4, which further boosts the ORR activity. Consequently, Fe1V1&#8208;NC exhibits outstanding ORR activity with onset and half&#8208;wave (E1/2) potentials at 1.02 and 0.89&#160;V versus RHE, respectively, in 0.1&#160;M KOH. Record&#8208;high stability is achieved on Fe1V1&#8208;NC with a minimal decay in E1/2 by 16&#160;mV over 50000 cycles, surpassing Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C counterpart and most of the catalysts reported to date. The Fe1V1&#8208;NC&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air battery reported here demonstrates exceptional durability up to 400&#160;h at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. This work identifies the intrinsic correlation between ORR pathway, activity, and stability, advancing development of stable catalytic systems.

         <title>Polyanion Electrointercalation Enables Termination&#8208;Tailored Oligolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene Synthesis in Alkali Chloroaluminate Melt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile non&#8208;destructive polyanion (AlnCl3n+1&#8722;) electrointercalation strategy was developed to synthesize facilely delaminated, termination&#8208;tailored Ti3C2Tx (T&#160;=&#160;&#8722;Cl, &#8722;NH, &#8722;Br). The as&#8208;delaminated oligolayer Ti3C2Clx sheets retained their pristine features of oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination, along with long cycling performance of 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 when serving as a coating material for Zn anode.








Abstract
Tailoring surface chemistry and achieving non&#8208;destructive interlayer exfoliation are crucial for controlling MXene properties. Conventional synthesis strategies typically involve damaging intercalation processes and yield MXenes with mixed surface terminations, compromising their functionality. Herein, we propose an anodic etching strategy to produce facilely delaminated, termination&#8208;tailored Ti3C2Tx from Ti3AlC2 in low&#8208;temperature alkali&#8208;chloroaluminate (AlCl3&#8208;NaCl&#8208;KCl) melts at 170&#160;&#176;C through the in situ electrochemical intercalation of polyanions (AlnCl3n+1&#8722;, n&#160;&#8805;&#160;1). Oligolayer Ti3C2Clx (MSE&#8208;Ti3C2Clx) was readily achieved via further gently exfoliating the etching product, preserving the original surface chemistry featuring oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination. As functional coatings, MSE&#8208;Ti3C2Clx significantly extended the cycling lifespan of Zn anodes to 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, attributed to the tailored surface chemistry and oligolayer&#8208;induced ordered alignment that enabled efficient Zn2+ capture and uniform deposition. The strategy's versatility was also demonstrated by tailoring terminations (e.g., &#8722;Br, &#8722;NH) via molten salt composition engineering, providing a non&#8208;destructive pathway for MXene surface engineering and interlayer delamination, thereby unlocking their full potential for advanced energy applications.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; from Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in low-temperature alkali-chloroaluminate (AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NaCl-KCl) melts at 170&#160;&#176;C through the in situ electrochemical intercalation of polyanions (Al&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8805;&#160;1). Oligolayer Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (MSE-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) was readily achieved via further gently exfoliating the etching product, preserving the original surface chemistry featuring oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination. As functional coatings, MSE-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; significantly extended the cycling lifespan of Zn anodes to 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, attributed to the tailored surface chemistry and oligolayer-induced ordered alignment that enabled efficient Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; capture and uniform deposition. The strategy's versatility was also demonstrated by tailoring terminations (e.g., &#8722;Br, &#8722;NH) via molten salt composition engineering, providing a non-destructive pathway for MXene surface engineering and interlayer delamination, thereby unlocking their full potential for advanced energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Study of Ignored Pericyclic Reactions: Rearrangements of 1,2&#8208;Bis(Diazo)Alkanes to 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrazines and Subsequent Fragmentations</title>

DFT calculations of the 8&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of 1,2&#8208;bis(diazo)alkanes and of other bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dipoles reveal that this process can establish a so far ignored route to heterocycles such as 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines. Alternative reaction channels via carbenes or nitrenes leading to fragmentation products are discussed. The computations identified substitution patterns that could allow the characterization or isolation of the elusive 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines. The C2&#8208;symmetric geometries of the transition states point to a conrotatory electrocyclic process. 








Abstract
An electrocyclic ring closure of bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dipoles can afford six&#8208;membered heterocycles. This 8&#960;&#8208;electron process was systematically analyzed by DFT calculations with 1,2&#8208;bis(diazo)alkane derivatives as possible precursor compounds and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines as products. The C2&#8208;symmetry of the transition state of the parent system points to a conrotatory ring closing event. The subsequent (6&#8211;2&#8211;2) cycloreversions of these elusive nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles to alkynes or nitriles and dinitrogen were also computationally investigated. The results show that the reactions are strongly dependent on the substitution pattern, but all are kinetically easily feasible delivering products of differing stability. The calculations can therefore provide important information for experimental endeavors to generate or even isolate so far unknown 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines. The feasibility of carbene or 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;substituted nitrene intermediates for the formation of alkynes is also discussed. The experimental evidence for the proposed processes is enclosed presenting literature known examples of the fragmentation reactions which can most convincingly be explained by the intermediacy of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazine derivatives. Furthermore, the electrocyclic ring closure reactions of five other types of bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dipoles are calculated, demonstrating that this so far ignored 8&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization&#160;process can establish a new route to interestingly composed heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Atomic Structure Design for Enhancing Metal&#8208;Support Frontier Orbital Interaction to Achieve Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on atomic structure design, this study developed AuNPsNi1CN photocatalyst, a novel structure with defect engineering, single&#8208;atom anchoring, and metal nanoparticle loading strategies. N vacancies enhance the metal&#8208;support frontier orbital interaction between Ni single atoms and the g&#8208;C3N4, improving H+ supply capacity through 4e&#8722; WOR. Au nanoparticles serve as 2e&#8722; ORR sites, achieving an H2O2 yield of 437.53&#160;&#181;M&#183;h&#8722;1 in pure water.








Abstract
Modified g&#8208;C3N4 has been widely applied in various photocatalytic reactions. However, designing efficient atomic structures, breaking through the activity bottleneck and elucidating the precise reaction mechanisms remain the critical challenges in photocatalyst development. This work developed one innovative photocatalyst atomic structure design (AuNPsNi1CN) with Ni single atoms, N vacancies and Au nanoparticles (NPs) at g&#8208;C3N4. N vacancies enhancing metal&#8208;support frontier orbital interaction between the Ni electron orbitals and the g&#8208;C3N4&#8217;s frontier orbitals, forming a highly active site for four&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (4e&#8722; WOR), which significantly enhanced the proton (H&#8314;) supply capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the introduced Au NPs produce H2O2 via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), achieving a yield of 437.53&#160;&#181;M&#183;h&#8722;1 in pure water. Theoretical calculations indicate that the Ni single atoms cause a regulation in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), enhancing the oxidation capability of holes, while the Au NPs optimize O2 adsorption energy and lower the reaction barrier for 2e&#8722; ORR. This atomic&#8208;scale structure design strategy combining defect engineering, single&#8208;atom anchoring, and metal NPs loading, provides a novel approach for developing efficient photocatalytic materials.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Activatable, Sequence&#8208;Specific Metal&#8208;Nucleic Acid Scaffolds for Responsive Uncaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that long&#8208;range nucleic acid&#8208;mediated electron transfer can drive Pt(IV) photoreduction, establishing a new class of metal&#8208;nucleic acid scaffolds capable of &#8220;responsive uncaging,&#8221; where hybridization with target DNA or miRNA directly triggers payload release under NIR irradiation.








Abstract
Precise molecular activation with both analyte specificity and spatiotemporal control remains a major challenge in responsive diagnostics, targeted therapies, and the study of complex biological systems. Traditional photo&#8208;uncaging strategies offer excellent temporal resolution but suffer from limited tissue penetration and poor biological specificity, while analyte&#8208;responsive platforms provide molecular selectivity without external control. Here, we introduce sequence&#8208;responsive diagnostic uncaging&#8212;a unique approach that integrates nucleic acid recognition with near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered molecular activation within a metal&#8208;nucleic acid scaffold. This platform is built upon a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind Pt(IV)&#8208;DNA molecular scaffold, modularly assembled via click chemistry, and integrates a Pt(IV)&#8208;caged reporter, a nucleic acid recognition domain, and an NIR antenna (e.g., IR800). Notably, DNA&#8208;mediated electron transfer (DNA&#8208;MET) provides a long&#8208;range ET pathway to direct photoreduction of the Pt(IV) centers, enabling &#8220;responsive uncaging&#8221; that occurs only upon hybridization with a fully complementary DNA or miRNA strand. Upon NIR irradiation, the duplexed nucleic acid system facilitates electron transfer from the excited antenna to Pt(IV), triggering the release of fluorescent reporters. Using two Pt(IV)&#8208;caged fluorophores (MCA and BDP), we demonstrate efficient uncaging and high sequence specificity in both solution and live cells. This platform offers a powerful and versatile photochemical tool that seamlessly bridges diagnostics and molecular activation, with broad implications for precision medicine, targeted drug delivery, and next&#8208;generation biosensing technologies.

The double&#8208;cable polymer extends the charge&#8208;transfer state lifetime to over 3&#160;ns, boosting the efficiency of ternary organic solar cells to 20.12%. It also serves as an interfacial lock at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface, significantly enhancing device stability.








Abstract
The donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) critically govern exciton dissociation and molecular diffusion, determining both efficiency and stability. Herein, we design a double&#8208;cable conjugated polymer, SC&#8208;1F, to insert into a physically&#8208;blended D/A system to optimize the interface. We have found that SC&#8208;1F spontaneously segregates to the interface through favorable miscibility and heterogeneous nucleation with the acceptor. Its long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state with a lifetime of &gt;3&#160;ns enhances charge generation efficiency in the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.00% to 20.12%. More importantly, the double&#8208;cable nature of SC&#8208;1F enables it to be simultaneously miscible with donor and acceptor so as to act as the interfacial lock to prevent their self&#8208;aggregation under thermal treatment. Therefore, the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:SC&#8208;1F&#8208;based solar cells provided a high T80 of 2175 h compared to a T80 of 530 h based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 under 65 &#176;C treatment. Notably, SC&#8208;1F&#8208;based device demonstrates exceptional storage and thermal stability, with a T80 lifetime exceeding 10&#160;000 h. These results demonstrate the superior advantage of double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers as the third component to achieve efficient and stable OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) critically govern exciton dissociation and molecular diffusion, determining both efficiency and stability. Herein, we design a double-cable conjugated polymer, SC-1F, to insert into a physically-blended D/A system to optimize the interface. We have found that SC-1F spontaneously segregates to the interface through favorable miscibility and heterogeneous nucleation with the acceptor. Its long-lived charge-transfer (CT) state with a lifetime of &amp;gt;3&#160;ns enhances charge generation efficiency in the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend, boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.00% to 20.12%.

The Mn&#948;+&#8208;OV&#8208;conjugated configurations and electron&#8208;rich Mn2&#8314; on surface trench&#8208;like structures of high lattice distortion MnOx, by inducing *OH generation/enrichment and electron transfer respectively, drive furoic acid (FA) dehydrogenation to carbon&#8208;centered FA radical (FA*), then reduce FA* to FA carbanion (FA&#8722;), completing Csp2&#9472;H bond activation. Under supercritical conditions (390&#160;K, 8&#160;MPa), solvent&#8208;polarized CO2 accelerates carboxylation of FA&#8722; to FDCA&#8722;, achieving 95.8% FDCA selectivity.








Abstract
Developing the efficient C&#9472;H bond activation carboxylation processes for furoic acid (FA) represents a critical technological challenge in achieving atom&#8208;economical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Despite notable advancements in this field, the inherent contradiction between the high reactivity of furan rings and the chemical inertness of C&#9472;H bonds poses substantial technical bottleneck for achieving controllable C&#9472;H carboxylation under mild conditions. Herein, we report a high lattice&#8208;distorted MnOx catalyst with surface trench&#8208;like structures, wherein the Mn&#948;+&#8208;OV&#8208;conjugated configurations and electron&#8208;rich Mn2+ cooperatively drive FA dehydrogenation and carbon radical reduction, inducing the free radical evolution process (FA&#8594;carbon&#8208;centered FA radical&#8594;FA carbanion), then coupled with solvent&#8208;polarized CO2 to accelerate the carboxylation process. This approach achieved an FDCA selectivity of 95.82% under mild reaction conditions (&#8804;390&#160;K), providing novel insights into mild activation and conversion of biomass&#8208;derived inert chemical bonds.

We report light&#8208;responsive &#8220;RNA photofluids&#8221; created by the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of azobenzene&#8208;functionalized RNA nanomachines. These functional liquids can harness the molecular motion of nanomachines into macroscopic, cell&#8208;like behaviors under both ultraviolet and visible light.








Abstract
Incorporating artificial molecular machines into soft matter offers a compelling strategy for engineering active materials with life&#8208;like behavior. Here, we report ultraviolet and visible light&#8208;responsive RNA photofluids formed via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of azobenzene&#8208;functionalized RNA nanomachines. These RNA photofluids can harness the molecular motions of RNA nanomachines to produce macroscopic cell&#8208;like behaviors under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. We show that the number of azobenzene moieties in the RNA nanomachines controls the deformation kinetics and critical transition temperatures between structural deformation and dissociation. The ultraviolet&#8211;visible RNA photofluids not only enable direct solar energy harvesting for light&#8208;powered soft robotics, but also expand the toolkit for developing advanced multi&#8208;responsive biomaterials and programmable artificial cells.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interaction Optimized Film&#8208;Forming Processes Lead to Efficient Organic Solar Cells and Modules Fabricated with Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvents</title>

Benefitting from the extended nucleation and crystal growth time by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, the PM6&#8208;ClTz20&#8208;based organic solar cells (0.0476&#160;cm2) and modules (19.44&#160;cm2) processed from m&#8208;xylene achieve high efficiencies of 19.04% and 16.71%, respectively.








Abstract
While the transition from halogenated to eco&#8208;friendly processing solvents is vital for the industrialization of organic solar cells (OSCs), obtaining ideal morphology of active layer during green fabrication of the device remains a challenge. To address this issue, the famous polymer donor of PM6 is chemically modified through the introduction of 20% chlorinated dithiazole (Tz2Cl) segment into the mainchain. It is found that, the obtained terpolymer, PM6&#8208;ClTz20, shows the improved solubility in the non&#8208;halogenated solvent of m&#8208;xylene. More importantly, Tz2Cl units induce the enlarged electrostatic potential difference between PM6&#8208;ClTz20 and the acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9, giving donor&#8211;acceptor electrostatic attraction. This prolongs the nucleation and crystal growth time of donor and acceptor in m&#8208;xylene solution, endowing the blend film with fine phase&#8208;separated domains and bigger crystal size. Consequently, the PM6&#8208;ClTz20:BTP&#8208;eC9 binary system yields outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.04% and 16.71% for the small&#8208;area device (0.0476&#160;cm2) and mini&#8208;module (19.44&#160;cm2), respectively. This work clarifies the key role of donor&#8211;acceptor interaction in regulating the film&#8208;forming process and optimizing blend morphology, providing a feasible route to sustainable and scalable OSCs.

         <title>Electronic Structure&#8208;Engineered Proton Depletion Interfaces on Ternary RuO2 for Ultra&#8208;Stable Kilowatt Electrocatalysis</title>

Achieving kilowatt&#8208;level PEM water electrolysis for hydrogen production by self&#8208;accelerating interfacial proton consumption through the creation of local operando alkaline microenvironments.








Abstract
Advancing high&#8208;current PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) is crucial for terawatt&#8208;scale green hydrogen economies, but anode catalyst stability under industrial conditions remains a key barrier to system efficiency and longevity. Here, we present a ternary RuO2&#8208;based catalyst (Cr0.1Sn0.1Ru0.8O2) that addresses these limitations through proton depletion interface engineering, with electronic structure modulation inherently integrated into the catalyst design. The resulting catalyst reaches a current density of 3.0 amperes per square centimeter at only 1.77 volts and a low degradation for oxygen evolution over 1000&#160;h in PEMWE. A scaled&#8208;up system incorporating this anode catalyst further attains a hundred&#8208;ampere level water electrolysis, with kilowatt scale which propels the large&#8208;scale deployment of hydrogen production utilizing renewable energy sources.

&lt;p&gt;Achieving kilowatt-level PEM water electrolysis for hydrogen production by self-accelerating interfacial proton consumption through the creation of local operando alkaline microenvironments.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancing high-current PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) is crucial for terawatt-scale green hydrogen economies, but anode catalyst stability under industrial conditions remains a key barrier to system efficiency and longevity. Here, we present a ternary RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based catalyst (Cr&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that addresses these limitations through proton depletion interface engineering, with electronic structure modulation inherently integrated into the catalyst design. The resulting catalyst reaches a current density of 3.0 amperes per square centimeter at only 1.77 volts and a low degradation for oxygen evolution over 1000&#160;h in PEMWE. A scaled-up system incorporating this anode catalyst further attains a hundred-ampere level water electrolysis, with kilowatt scale which propels the large-scale deployment of hydrogen production utilizing renewable energy sources. Our techno-economic analysis predicts that leveraging this anode architecture can reduce hydrogen production costs below $1 per kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; while maintaining a substantially lower environmental footprint relative to conventional electrolyzer technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Optical Waveguides Based on One&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Copper&#8211;Silver Bromide Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral hybrid copper&#8211;silver halide, (S/R&#8208;C5H14N2)CuAgBr4, is reported as the first single&#8208;crystalline circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) optical waveguide. Combining intrinsic CPL activity and low&#8208;loss light guiding, these microrods exhibit glum values of &#177;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and optical loss coefficients as low as 9.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;dB &#181;m&#8722;1, offering a new platform for spin&#8208;photonic integration.








Abstract
Chiroptical waveguides, capable of generating and propagating circularly polarized light (CPL), hold significant promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices. However, developing novel, efficient chiroptical waveguides remains challenging, due to the difficulty of integrating strong intrinsic chiroptical activity with efficient directional light transport within a single crystalline material. Here, we report a new enantiomeric pair of chiral hybrid metal halides, (S/R&#8208;C5H14N2)CuAgBr4 (S/R&#8208;CuAg), featuring a one&#8208;dimensional inorganic structure. Ag incorporation enhances photoluminescence quantum yield from 0.6% to 18.6%, while enabling bright CPL emissions with dissymmetry factors (glum) of &#177;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The tightly packed inorganic lattice and highly anisotropic microstructure of S/R&#8208;CuAg exhibit a low optical loss coefficient of 9.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;dB &#181;m&#8722;1. Crucially, microrod crystals of S/R&#8208;CuAg function as efficient chiroptical waveguides, simultaneously emitting and propagating CPL under unpolarized light excitation. This work establishes chiral hybrid metal halides as a viable platform for circularly polarized waveguide applications.

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Bridged Compact Interfacial Shielding for Practical Seawater Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte is designed using natural seawater solvent and a host&#8211;guest complex additive. The MBT guest shows sustained&#8208;release behavior from the CD host dominated by aqueous solubility. Cl&#8722; facilitates a compact MBT shield on the Zn anode surface via bridging effect, creating a Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;poor microenvironment that suppresses corrosion.








Abstract
Substituting natural seawater (NS) for deionized water significantly reduces the electrolyte manufacturing cost of aqueous zinc (Zn) ion batteries, but it also poses severe corrosion challenges to the Zn metal anode, given the presence of the Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;rich Zn&#8208;electrolyte interface. Here, a NS electrolyte featuring NS solvent and the host&#8211;guest complex additive is designed. The 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) guest shows sustained&#8208;release behavior from the cyclodextrin host dominated by its aqueous solubility in the NS electrolyte. Crucially, Cl&#8722; ions facilitate a compact MBT shield at the interface via bridging effects, creating a Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;poor microenvironment that suppresses corrosion and extends Zn anode cycle life. Thus, the Zn anode achieves an extended cycling life of 400&#160;h in the Zn||Zn symmetric cell even under a practical depth of discharge of 42.7%. The Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cell with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.92 exhibits 99% capacity retention at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles, and the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with an initial discharge capacity of 1.21 Ah maintains stable cycling for 50 cycles.

Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature energy storage systems confront severe operational constraints due to sluggish ion kinetics and electrolyte solidification. While potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) offer potential for low&#8208;cost energy storage, the absence of viable cathode materials with adequate stability at ultra&#8208;low temperatures remains a critical barrier. Herein, we demonstrate an organic small molecule, 1,4&#8208;dihydrobenzo[g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,5,10&#8208;tetraone (BQXTO), in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HB) and robust &#960;&#9472;&#960; interactions synergistically enhance charge transfer and impart insolubility, thereby facilitating reaction kinetics and improving cycling stability even under low&#8208;temperature conditions. The assembled BQXTO||HC potassium&#8208;ion full cell achieves remarkable energy density at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (188&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and exceptional cyclability (88.2% capacity retention over 2000 cycles). This study presents valuable insights into the structure design of organic small molecule cathodes for advanced low&#8208;temperature PIBs.

         <title>Allosteric Activation of Cas12a via PAM Topological Engineering for Direct and Rapid Detection of Nucleases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An allosteric Y&#8208;shaped DNA structure for Cas12a activation via PAM topological engineering (Y&#8208;COPE) that enables direct, rapid detection of nuclease activity without multistep conversion was developed. Upon nuclease recognition, the Y&#8208;COPE is transformed into a dsDNA activator via split PAM reconfiguration to activate Cas12a, which provides an effective pathway for straightforward and sensitive detection of nonnucleic acid targets via CRISPR&#8208;based platforms.








Abstract
A contemporary question in the intensely active field of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based molecular diagnostics is how to simplify the multistep conversion process for detecting nonnucleic acid targets. Herein we describe an allosteric Y&#8208;shaped DNA structure for Cas12a activation via protospacer&#8208;adjacent motif (PAM) topological engineering (Y&#8208;COPE) to achieve straightforward and diverse nuclease monitoring. The newly designed topological structure of the Y&#8208;COPE is characterized by a split PAM embedded at the three&#8208;way junction and protospacers flanking both sides. This unique spatial configuration of the PAM effectively prevents Cas12a activation. Upon target cleavage, the released truncated fragments can dynamically correct the PAM, which promptly restores the dsDNA conformation for Cas12a activation and accomplishes signal output. Theoretical calculation results revealed that, compared with the canonical dsDNA activator, in the Y&#8208;COPE, there was a 1.8&#160;&#197; increase in the center distance between Lys595 of Cas12a and the PAM, which led to a 24.2&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1 increase in binding free energy. This clearly revealed the underlying inhibition mechanism of the topological configuration of the PAM for Cas12a activation.

     alt="Allosteric Activation of Cas12a via PAM Topological Engineering for Direct and Rapid Detection of Nucleases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An allosteric Y-shaped DNA structure for Cas12a activation via PAM topological engineering (Y-COPE) that enables direct, rapid detection of nuclease activity without multistep conversion was developed. Upon nuclease recognition, the Y-COPE is transformed into a dsDNA activator via split PAM reconfiguration to activate Cas12a, which provides an effective pathway for straightforward and sensitive detection of nonnucleic acid targets via CRISPR-based platforms.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contemporary question in the intensely active field of CRISPR-Cas12a-based molecular diagnostics is how to simplify the multistep conversion process for detecting nonnucleic acid targets. Herein we describe an allosteric &lt;b&gt;Y&lt;/b&gt;-shaped DNA structure for &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;as12a activati&lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;n via &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;rotospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) topological &lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;ngineering (Y-COPE) to achieve straightforward and diverse nuclease monitoring. The newly designed topological structure of the Y-COPE is characterized by a split PAM embedded at the three-way junction and protospacers flanking both sides. This unique spatial configuration of the PAM effectively prevents Cas12a activation. Upon target cleavage, the released truncated fragments can dynamically correct the PAM, which promptly restores the dsDNA conformation for Cas12a activation and accomplishes signal output. Theoretical calculation results revealed that, compared with the canonical dsDNA activator, in the Y-COPE, there was a 1.8&#160;&#197; increase in the center distance between Lys595 of Cas12a and the PAM, which led to a 24.2&#160;kcal&#160;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; increase in binding free energy. This clearly revealed the underlying inhibition mechanism of the topological configuration of the PAM for Cas12a activation. This study advances the understanding of the dynamic response of Cas12a to topological PAM conformations and introduces the universal concept of CRISPR-based nonnucleic acid detection to benefit the next-generation molecular diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sterically Congested LLX&#8208;Type PNSi Tridentate Ligands for Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New ligands for non&#8208;directed C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation were developed. Iridium catalysts bearing LLX&#8208;type PNSi tridentate ligands (Ir/PNSi catalysts) efficiently promoted the reaction in sharp contrast to an Ir/PN catalyst. The sterically congested Ir/PNSi catalysts realized steric&#8208;controlled C&#8211;H borylation. Notably, C(sp3)&#8211;H&#8208;selective borylation of para&#8208;substituted alkylbenzenes was successfully achieved in the presence of C(sp2)&#8211;H.








Abstract
Iridium catalysts bearing LLX&#8208;type PNSi tridentate ligands (Ir/PNSi catalysts) were developed as new effective catalysts for the C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation of alkanes and alkyl groups that do not have directing groups. The Ir/PNSi catalysts were prepared in situ from [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 and 8&#8208;diarylphosphino&#8208;2&#8208;[(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydrosilyl)methyl]quinolines, which are readily synthesized from commercially available 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;methylquinoline. The Ir/PNSi catalyst exhibited higher chemoselectivity than a standard Ir/Me4phen and our previously reported Ir/NNSi catalysts. Thus, the Ir/PNSi catalysts promoted selective borylation of the sterically less crowded C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds in 2&#8208;methylheptane and dibutyldimethylsilane. The C(sp3)&#8211;H&#8208;selective borylation in the presence of C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds was also achieved with the Ir/PNSi catalysts in the reaction of 4&#8208;substituted alkylbenzenes. Such notable chemoselectivity may be due to the congested environment around the iridium center formed by the mer&#8208;tridentate coordination of the PNSi ligands.

         <title>Continuous Flow Photocatalysis Boosting C&#9472;N Coupling for Sustainable High&#8208;Efficiency Formamide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow photocatalytic platform for formamide synthesis via photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of methanol and ammonia over the Pd clusters decorated TiO2 catalyst has been developed. The system has achieved a record formamide productivity of 256.80&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 with 50 h stability in a Taylor flow reactor, which is significantly superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalytic systems for the synthesis of C&#9472;N compounds from C1 small molecules.








Abstract
The construction of C&#9472;N bonds from simple precursors under ambient conditions is a fundamental challenge in green chemistry, especially when it comes to avoiding energy&#8208;intensive protocols. Here, we present a continuous flow photocatalytic platform that enables the efficient coupling of C&#9472;N bonds between methanol and ammonia at ambient temperature and pressure. By synergistically engineering a Pd clusters&#8208;decorated TiO2 photocatalyst (1Pd/TiO2) and a mass transfer&#8208;enhanced gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid Taylor flow reactor, the system achieves a remarkable formamide productivity of 256.80&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (6.83&#8208;fold enhancement compared to batch reactors) with less than 10% decay in production rate over 50 h of continuous operation, which is remarkably superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalytic systems for the synthesis of C&#9472;N compounds from C1 small molecules. Distinguishing from the conventional simultaneous bimolecular one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway, a mechanistic study has shown that the precisely tailored Pd clusters on TiO2 induce charge polarization to drive methanol dehydrogenation toward critical *CH2O intermediates, enabling direct nucleophilic NH3 attack for C&#9472;N bond formation, thereby circumventing thermodynamic/kinetic barriers inherent to asynchronous radical generation in prior systems. This work establishes a paradigm for the sustainable, efficient synthesis of formamide via photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling by bridging nanoscale photocatalyst engineering with macroscopic reactor design.

         <title>Sub&#8208;2 Nm Palladium Phosphide: A Highly Active and Selective Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of Furfural to Furfuryl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine palladium phosphide (PdxPy) with sub&#8208;2&#160;nm dimension is synthesized controllably via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO2&#8208;supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy not only enhances the Pd atom utilization but also improves its catalytic performance. The sub&#8208;2&#160;nm PdxPy exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&#8722;1 for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol








Abstract
Phosphidation offers a promising approach to tailor noble metal properties for high catalytic selectivity, yet achieving highly dispersed noble metal phosphides with efficient atom utilization remains challenging. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (PdxPy) with sub&#8208;2&#160;nm dimensions via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defect&#8208;rich TiO2&#8208;supported Pd (Pd/d&#8208;TiO2) as the phosphidation precursor. The strong anchoring effect of d&#8208;TiO2 defects effectively mitigates the aggregation of PdxPy during phosphidation, yielding uniformly dispersed PdxPy nanoparticles with an average size of 1.68&#160;nm. The resulting PdxPy/d&#8208;TiO2 exhibits exceptional performance for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, achieving 97.5% selectivity and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 833.8 h&#8722;1. This significantly outperforms the unphosphated Pd/d&#8208;TiO2 (54.7% selectivity and TOF of 220.6 h&#8722;1) and large&#8208;sized PdxPy (5.18&#160;nm) on pristine TiO2 (95.3% selectivity and TOF of 347.4 h&#8722;1). The enhanced performance of PdxPy/d&#8208;TiO2 is attributed to the high Pd atom utilization and phosphidation&#8208;induced generation of isolated Pd sites that minimize the side reactions by modulating furfural adsorption and spillover H2 formation. Our findings provide a novel and effective approach for the controllable synthesis of ultrafine noble metal phosphides by leveraging the defect&#8208;anchoring effect, advancing both atomic economy and selective hydrogenation catalysis.

A bifunctional, multi&#8208;site ambiphilic silylene&#8211;aminoborane enables cooperative multicomponent activations of alkynes and phosphaalkynes, providing direct access to novel boron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;silicon (B&#9472;N&#9472;Si) semibullvalene (SBV) and boron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;silicon&#8211;phosphorus (B&#9472;N&#9472;Si&#9472;P) barrelene (BR) analogues via unprecedented [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1] cycloaddition and SNAr&#8208;type rearrangement processes.








Abstract
We report the synthesis and cooperative reactivity of a bifunctional silylene&#8211;aminoborane compound, 1&#8208;Ph&#8208;2&#8208;tBu&#8208;1H&#8208;2,1&#8208;benzazaborolyl&#8208;(amidinato)silylene (1), designed to preserve the ambiphilicity of both functional units while preventing intramolecular deactivation. 1 engages in unprecedented multicomponent activations of unsaturated bonds, including alkynes and phosphaalkynes, to construct novel main&#8208;group element embedded polycyclic frameworks. Reaction with alkynes led to rare main&#8208;group elements enriched semibullvalenes via highly regioselective [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1] cycloaddition. Notably, reaction with a phosphaalkyne induced a distinct SNAr&#8208;like B&#9472;C bond cleavage and formation of a B&#9472;N&#9472;Si&#9472;P&#8208;embedded barrelene analogue. Structural and computational analyses revealed the synergistic multi&#8208;site activation modes and reaction pathways.

         <title>In Situ Orthogonal Chemistry for Facile Preparation of Uniform COF&#8208;Based Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step in situ preparation of COF&#8208;based CPEs is achieved via a BF3&#8208;mediated concurrent Schiff base condensation and cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization directly from the monomer mixture of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde (TFTA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF). This orthogonal reaction protocol enables uniform dispersion of COF within the polymer, establishes long&#8208;range ordered Li+ transport pathways, and weakens the Li+&#8208;ether oxygen coordination.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) represent a promising platform for advanced lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density. However, conventional physical fabrication methods may suffer from cumbersome processing, filler agglomeration, and high interfacial resistance. Here we report the in&#8208;situ preparation of COF&#8208;based CPEs via a BF3&#8208;mediated concurrent Schiff base condensation and cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) directly from the monomer mixture of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde (TFTA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) within LMBs. Notably, the H2O generated from the polycondensation reaction effectively serves as the chain transfer agent for THF ROP, reducing the molecular weight of polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) to facilitate Li+ transference, instead of corroding the lithium anode. This orthogonal reaction protocol enables uniform dispersion of COF fillers within the polymer matrix, establishes long&#8208;range ordered Li+ transport pathways, and weakens the Li+&#8208;ether oxygen coordination. Consequently, the ionic conductivity increases 80&#8208;fold (2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) with a Li+ transference number of 0.81 at room temperature. Coupled with a fluorine&#8208; and boron&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) derived from BF3, the CPEs endow Li/LiFePO4 half batteries with excellent cycling stability. This work provides a paradigm for designing interface&#8208;compatible electrolytes through spatially controlled orthogonal synthesis.

         <title>Polymer Ligands with Quaternary Ammonium Binding Motifs on Metal Nanoparticles Enable Selective Ion Transport for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic polymer ligands with positively charged head groups show a profound impact on the transport of ions and water at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface. Under negative bias, bicarbonates as counterions are preconcentrated, while extended hydrophobic polymers modulate the hydrogen bonding network among water. 








Abstract
We report a new class of hydrophobic polymer ligands with quaternary ammonium head groups for surface modification of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). Quaternary ammonium ligands bind NPs through non&#8208;covalent electrostatic interactions, producing polymer&#8208;grafted NPs with high colloidal and chemical stability. These polymers having charged head groups offer powerful strategies to tailor the structure and function of metal&#8208;electrolyte interfaces in electrocatalytic systems. The ammonium head groups serve as ionic reservoirs that preconcentrate bicarbonate counterions at the surface of nanocatalysts, while the hydrophobic polymer backbones restructure local hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, modulating water and ion transport dynamics. These interfacial effects promote CO2 electroreduction, particularly under diffusion&#8208;limited conditions, resulting in a CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 90%.

         <title>Gradient Polarization Induces Three&#8208;Dimensional Asymmetric Electron Distribution in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Enhanced Photocatalytic Overall Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient polarization induces a 3D asymmetric charge distribution and built&#8208;in electric field, thereby achieving efficient in&#8208;plane/interlayer charge transfer and N2 fixation. Moreover&#65292;the generated polarized confined microenvironment stabilizes intermediates, achieving high NH4+ and NO3&#8722; yields.








Abstract
Constructing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is an effective approach to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, yet the spatial conformation imposes inherent trade&#8208;offs between in&#8208;plane and interplane carrier transport. Here, we present a spatial gradient polarization strategy that combines distinct electronegativities of (NH)2&#9472;C&#9552;S and C&#9552;O groups in COFs to establish a 3D asymmetric electron distribution and the gradient polarization. Mechanistic studies have shown that the gradient polarization triggers the interlayer dipole rearrangement in a nonpolar orientation, thereby constructing a cooperative in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization field. This polarization field decouples the constraints on carrier transport and drives rapid charge transfer in an anisotropic manner, breaking the traditional perception of D&#8208;A intramolecular polarization within the plane. Moreover, the resulting polarized microenvironment activates N&#8801;N bonds, optimizes hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, and stabilizes reaction intermediates, enabling the sequential conversion pathway of nitrogen. Ultimately, the covalent organic framework containing (NH)2&#9472;C&#9552;S and C&#9552;O groups (SBO) exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance with yields of NH4+ and NO3&#8722; of 11.59 and 7.18&#160;mg g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing all reported systems. Additionally, under natural sunlight, SBO also achieves unprecedented NH4+ (87.17&#160;mg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and NO3&#8722; (73.63&#160;mg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) yields. Our research not only offers a strategic blueprint for modulating the 3D polarization in COFs but also bridges the gap in the relationship between the molecular structure of materials and the spatial carrier migration.

         <title>Alloying Small&#8208;Cation into Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Motif Gives Multiaxial Ferroelectrics with Enhanced Photo&#8208;Pyroelectricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report strong photo&#8208;pyroelectricity in a series of multiaxial bismuth&#8208;based halide ferroelectrics with organic mixed&#8208;cations, of which the most active candidate enables the photocurrent enhancement ratio reaches up to 4800%, far beyond those known ferroelectrics. This work affords a new avenue for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photoactive ferroelectrics have shown huge potentials for assembling high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Bismuth&#8208;based halides are emerging as a vigor ferroelectric subclass due to unique structural diversity and flexibility, while studies on their photo&#8208;ferroelectricity coupling remain extremely scarce. Here, we have alloyed organic mixed&#8208;cations into Bismuth&#8208;based prototype to design a series of new multiaxial ferroelectrics with strong photo&#8208;pyroelectricity, as notably exemplified by (BZA)2(DMA)BiBr6 (1, where BZA is benzylammonium; DMA is dimethylammonium). The dynamic motions of small DMA+ cation afford the driving force to trigger symmetry breaking of 3&#175;mFm$\bar 3m{\rm F}m $, thus giving its multiaxial ferroelectricity with 6 equivalent polarization directions. Strikingly, 1 exhibits photo&#8208;pyroelectricity in a broad ultraviolet&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral range (266&#8211;980&#160;nm), which couples with ferroelectric bulk photovoltaics to create giant photocurrent enhancement ratio of &#8764;4800%. This merit far surpasses those of known ferroelectric materials. These results shed light on the design of new photoactive ferroelectric candidates for smart photoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Reduction of Rare&#8208;Earth Stannole Sandwich Complexes to Tin&#8208;Based Radical Ligands and Tin&#8211;Tin Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;electron reduction of dimetallic rare&#8208;earth stannole complexes with KC8 produces a di&#8208;tin radical ligand that shows strong coupling between tin and yttrium, gadolinium or dysprosium. Two&#8208;electron reduction of the stannole complexes further populates a delocalized {M2Sn2} molecular orbital, enhancing the tin&#8211;tin bonding and simultaneously dearomatizing the stannole rings.








Abstract
f&#8208;Element organometallic chemistry is dominated by cyclopentadienyl ligands. In contrast, isoelectronic metallole ligands with the general formula [EC4R4]2&#8722;, where E is a heavier group 14 element, are rare in the f&#8208;block, particularly stannole ligands. Here, we describe the synthesis of the dimetallic stannole complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (1M&#160;; M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy; CpSn = [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8211;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;, Cpttt = [1,2,4&#8208;C5tBu3H2]&#8722;), which form by virtue of Sn&#8594;M dative bonds. One&#8208;electron reduction of 1M with KC8/2.2.2&#8208;cryptand produces the mono&#8208;anionic complexes [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; (2M), and two&#8208;electron reduction gives di&#8208;anionic [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722; (3M) as [K(2.2.2&#8208;crypt)]+ salts. Studies of the stannole complexes using crystallography, UV/vis and EPR spectroscopy, magnetometry and computational methods reveal that the reduction steps generate tin&#8211;tin bonds through population of a delocalized molecular orbital that spans the {M2Sn2} rings, with attendant dearomatization of the stannole rings. Complexes 2M are the first tin&#8208;radical ligands bound to rare earth elements. Spin density calculations of 2Y and 2Gd reveal significant build&#8208;up of unpaired spin on the tin atoms, with magnetic measurements on 2Gd yielding an unprecedentedly large tin&#8211;gadolinium exchange coupling constant of &#8722;112&#160;cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2J formalism).

         <title>K+ Vacancies and Fluorine Substitution Synergistically Regulate KTiOPO4 Anode for All&#8208;Climate and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ti&#8208;based polyanion anode structure with synergistically regulated K+ vacancies and O/F disorder has been achieved through F substitution. Practical full&#8208;cell testing confirms that this material exhibits excellent cycling stability, enhanced rate performance, and all&#8208;climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Although Ti&#8208;based polyanion anode materials with robust structures exhibit advantages such as high reversibility and high Coulombic efficiency for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage; however, their practical application is restricted by drawbacks including limited storage sites, low capacity, and intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a strategy of fluorine substitution combined with carbon coating of KTiOPO4 (KTPF/C), along with the introduction of K+ vacancies to activate additional potassium storage sites. The resulting KTPF/C material demonstrates a high capacity of 204.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1, corresponding to the reversible storage of 1.27&#160;K+ ions. The synergistic effect of K+ vacancies and fluorine substitution not only lowers the operating voltage but also results in a more disordered structure, thereby reducing the volume change during potassiation/depotassiation to 7.3%. This enables an ultralong cycle life exceeding 20,000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.011&#8240; per cycle. Moreover, the cooperation of K+ vacancies and carbon coating facilitates the transport of K+ and electrons, allowing the material to maintain excellent rate performance of 125.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A g&#8722;1. Practical full&#8208;cell testing further confirms the material's outstanding cycling stability, high power density, and all&#8208;climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Synthesis, Isolation, and Reactivity of a Phosphinidene Telluride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the synthesis and isolation of a phosphinidene telluride. This species acts as a versatile phosphinidene transfer reagent accompanied by the extrusion of elemental tellurium.








Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of a phosphorus(III) telluride is reported. The compound was accessed by means of a double bond metathesis reaction between an amido&#8208;functionalized phosphinidene oxide, BnArNP&#9552;O (Ar&#160;=&#160;bulky aryl substituent), with a silylene telluride, L(NMe2)Si&#9552;Te (L&#160;=&#160;PhC(NtBu)2). The resulting phosphinidene telluride, BnArNP&#9552;Te, exhibits a short P&#9552;Te bond (2.297(1) &#197;), resulting from a significant p&#960;&#8211;p&#960; orbital interaction between the phosphorus(III) and tellurium(&#8722;II) atoms. Key to the stabilization of this compound is the amido substituent associated with the phosphorus atom, which provides kinetic stabilization due to its steric bulk but also significant thermodynamic stabilization through negative hyperconjugation of the nitrogen atom lone pair into antibonding orbital interactions between phosphorus and tellurium. The title compound acts as a versatile phosphinidene transfer platform, accompanied by the extrusion of elemental tellurium to afford other phosphorus(III) compounds via transient phosphorus(V) intermediates.

     alt="Synthesis, Isolation, and Reactivity of a Phosphinidene Telluride"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the synthesis and isolation of a phosphinidene telluride. This species acts as a versatile phosphinidene transfer reagent accompanied by the extrusion of elemental tellurium.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and isolation of a phosphorus(III) telluride is reported. The compound was accessed by means of a double bond metathesis reaction between an amido-functionalized phosphinidene oxide, BnArNP&#9552;O (Ar&#160;=&#160;bulky aryl substituent), with a silylene telluride, L(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Si&#9552;Te (L&#160;=&#160;PhC(N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The resulting phosphinidene telluride, BnArNP&#9552;Te, exhibits a short P&#9552;Te bond (2.297(1) &#197;), resulting from a significant p&lt;sub&gt;&#960;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;p&lt;sub&gt;&#960;&lt;/sub&gt; orbital interaction between the phosphorus(III) and tellurium(&#8722;II) atoms. Key to the stabilization of this compound is the amido substituent associated with the phosphorus atom, which provides kinetic stabilization due to its steric bulk but also significant thermodynamic stabilization through negative hyperconjugation of the nitrogen atom lone pair into antibonding orbital interactions between phosphorus and tellurium. The title compound acts as a versatile phosphinidene transfer platform, accompanied by the extrusion of elemental tellurium to afford other phosphorus(III) compounds via transient phosphorus(V) intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Driven Conformational Switching of Binaphthalene&#8208;Based Tetraimidazolium Macrocycles to Enhance Sequence&#8208;Selective Recognition of Dinucleotides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequence&#8208;selective recognition of dinucleotides in aqueous media using binaphthalene&#8208;based tetraimidazolium macrocycle as artificial host is reported. The macrocycle undergoes reversible conformational switching with temperature, transitioning from cis&#8208; to trans&#8208;conformation. This temperature&#8208;driven switching enhances binding with d(TpA) and achieves high sequence selectivity (Krel &#8764;118.8 at 323&#160;K, increased from &#8764;1.1 at 288&#160;K) in water, demonstrating its potential for developing temperature&#8208;sensing optical devices for detecting DNA or RNA fragments with specific nucleotide sequences.








Abstract
Developing artificial hosts with temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching behaviors facilitates our understanding of the temperature&#8208;dependent allostery and adaptation mechanisms in natural recognition systems. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of three pairs of water&#8208;soluble, enantiomeric binaphthalene&#8208;based tetraimidazolium macrocycles (SS/RR&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; &#8211; SS/RR&#8208;3&#8226;4Cl&#713;) as artificial hosts for exploring sequence&#8208;selective recognition of dinucleotides in aqueous media. Owing to the reversible rotational conformation of axially chiral binaphthyl units, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; demonstrates the conformational switching, converting from cis&#8208;conformation (SS&#8208;1cis) to trans&#8208;conformation (SS&#8208;1trans) by increasing temperature, thereby causing the recognition cavity to transition from a closed to an open state. Given its ability for temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; exhibits temperature&#8208;cooperative enhanced binding behavior with d(TpA), with association constants (Ka) increasing to &#8764;106&#160;M&#8722;1 at 323&#160;K, up from &#8764;104&#160;M&#8722;1 at 288&#160;K. In contrast, its affinity for other dinucleotides, including d(ApT), d(GpC), and d(CpG), decreases to varying extents with increasing temperature. As a result, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713;, with an ability of temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching, achieves an unexpected sequence&#8208;selective recognition for the sequence&#8208;complementary dinucleotide pair d(TpA) and d(ApT), with high sequence selectivity factors (Krel&#160;=&#160;Ka[d(TpA)]/Ka[d(ApT)]) reaching up to &#8764;118.8 at 323&#160;K, increased from &#8764;1.1 at 288&#160;K, in water.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Anisotropic Grain Growth in Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic grain growth during sintering is characterized by an initial preference for the [104] and [110] directions, followed by accelerated growth along the [003] orientation. Low&#8208;valence dopants (Mg2+/Al3+) facilitate grain boundary migration (n&#160;about 2), while high&#8208;valence ions (Mo6+) suppress the behavior via segregation (n&#160; about 4.5), enhancing cycling stability.








Abstract
The particle morphology governed by anisotropic grain growth of Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes plays a crucial role in electrochemical stability and can be tuned via element doping during the high&#8208;temperature lithiation process. However, the fundamental impact of dopants on the anisotropic grain growth kinetics remains unclear. Herein, this work systematically investigates how dopants with different valences (Mg2+, Al3+, Zr4+, Ta5+, and Mo6+) affect the anisotropic grain growth during the high&#8208;temperature lithiation process. The findings demonstrate that the grain growth rate along the [104] and [110] directions is initially faster, followed by a higher growth rate along the [003] direction. The coarsening exponents n for the grain growth (along the [003], [104], and [110] directions) with low&#8208;valence ions (Mg2+, Al3+) dopants are approximately equal to 2, indicating that the grain growth depends solely on short&#8208;range diffusion at the grain boundary. Interestingly, the n value along the [003] direction enlarges with an increase in valence. Notably, the higher valence of Mo6+ results in a significant elevation of the exponent n along the [003] direction to 4.5, indicating a strong pinning effect due to Mo6+ segregation at the grain boundary. This pinning impedes grain boundary migration, inhibits grain coarsening, and effectively enhances cycle stability.

         <title>A Heterodimetallic Monomeric Complex with a Uranium&#8211;Cobalt Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a crystallographically confirmed heterodimetallic monomeric complex (TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Co) featuring a U&#8801;Co triple bond (2.189&#160;&#197;). Remarkably, this complex could act as a catalyst for the hydroboration and dimerization of terminal alkyne.








Abstract
The crystal structure of heterodimetallic monomeric complexes featuring a U&#8211;M triple bond has been rarely reported. Here, we present an example of a heterodimetallic monomeric complex [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Co)] (4) containing a U&#8211;Co triple bond, which was synthesized by the reaction of [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Cl)] (2) or [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U] (3) with CoCl2 in the presence of KC8. The crystal structure of 4 reveals a highly&#160;symmetrical&#160;geometry with a linear Co&#8211;U&#8211;Namine axis line, and the U&#8211;Co bond length 2.1890(11) &#197; is slightly longer than the sum of the covalent triple&#8208;bond radii of uranium and cobalt (2.14&#160;&#197;). The U&#8211;Namine bond length (2.439(6) &#197;) is significantly shortened compared to that of precursors 2 and 3. The significant contraction of the U&#8211;Namine bond demonstrates electronic reinforcement via the inverse trans&#8208;influence (ITI). Detailed computational investigations further support the existence of a U&#8801;Co triple bond in 4, and the formal oxidation states of uranium and cobalt appear to be U(IV) and Co(&#8208;I). The low&#8208;temperature magnetic moments of 4 are approaching 2.1 &#956;B, which is attributed to its near&#8208;doubly degenerate spin&#8208;orbit ground states in the pseudo&#8208;C3v symmetry. Remarkably, 4 served as the catalyst for the hydroboration and dimerization of terminal alkynes under mild conditions.

         <title>Strengthening Intermediate Adsorption on a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Assembly by Polymeric Modification for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction into Methanol</title>

Poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) modification of cobalt phthalocyanine nanotubes boosts electrochemical CO2 reduction to methanol by 14&#8208;fold enhancement of turnover frequency. The pyridyl groups axially coordinate to cobalt centers, which strengthened the chemisorption and activation of *CO intermediate to decreased the reaction barrier.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) to generate value added methanol (MeOH) in water has been considered as a potential strategy to realize efficient carbon cycle and reutilization. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) represents as a classical molecular catalyst carrying precisely tunable active sites, which has been widely explored for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;MeOH conversion, but optimization of performance is suffering from relatively easiness in desorption of *CO intermediate. To this end, we developed a novel molecular assembly of CoPc nanotubes (CoT) driven by van der Waals force with surface being modified by poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine). The as&#8208;derived catalyst exhibited an exceptional performance of MeOH production for the turnover frequency enhanced by more than 14&#8208;fold compared to the pristine CoT, and the Faradaic efficiency is up to 40% at a moderate potential. It revealed that the pyridyl groups of P4VP axially coordinated with the Co catalytic centers shifted the d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level, which strengthened the chemisorption and activation of *CO intermediates, thereby decreasing the whole barrier to produce MeOH. This work demonstrates a novel insight into intermediate manipulation of CO2R and highlights the potential of molecular electrocatalysis for carbon valorization.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;photon Absorption Switch via Cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;Salt&#8208;to&#8208;Cocrystal Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Based on the reversible cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal transformation, we construct for the first time an acid&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) switch between upconversion and Stokes emission. This single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) interconvert for 20 cycles, demonstrating an unprecedented performance for stimuli&#8208;responsive organic materials, which holds promising applications in display devices and rewritable information storage.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive organic cocrystals are typically governed by single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation, remaining a long&#8208;standing challenge due to disruption of long&#8208;range order structure throughout the whole solid&#8208;state process. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an acid&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) switch based on reversible cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal SCSC transformation. While both para&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene and meta&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene coassemble with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) into cocrystals via donor&#8211;acceptor interactions and hydrogen bonds, only the former cocrystal exhibits broad&#8208;window TPA activity alongside enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Theoretical calculations confirm that positional isomerism of electron donors modulates molecular coplanarity and donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in cocrystals, directly controlling TPA cross&#8208;sections. Remarkably, para&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene undergoes diprotonation by exposure to trifluoroacetic acid, enabling the conversion of the cocrystal to a salt form, which can be reverted upon triethylamine treatment. This cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal transformation switches the TPA characteristics with reversible color changes between upconversion orange emission and Stokes yellow luminescence for 20 cycles, to the best of our knowledge, which is an unprecedented performance for stimuli&#8208;responsive organic materials. Based on the unique acid&#8208;responsive emission, we also apply the SCSC transformation in display devices and information storage. This study elucidates structure&#8208;property relationships governing TPA in cocrystals and establishes a new paradigm for stimuli&#8208;responsive optical switches.

         <title>Programmable Bio&#8208;Derived Noncovalent Glass via Reconfigurable H&#8208;Bonding Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a programmable glass via reconfigurable H&#8208;bonding networks between natural biomolecules and organic acids, redefining glass as an active material medium with encoded structural logic. The strategy expands the frontiers of glass chemistry toward sustainable electronics, transient architectures, and environmentally adaptive materials.








Abstract
Glass has served as a cornerstone of modern civilization due to its exceptional optical transparency and structural integrity. Yet, its static covalent/ionic network fundamentally restricts environmental adaptability, presenting a critical challenge for next&#8208;generation sustainable technologies. Here, we report a programmable, bio&#8208;derived noncovalent glass (BNG) engineered through multivalent, reconfigurable H&#8208;bonding networks composed of natural building blocks (e.g., amino acids, peptides, biomacromolecules) and organic acids with multiple H&#8208;bond donors and acceptors. Molecular programming of these networks enables unprecedented four&#8208;dimensional control: hydration&#8208;tunable mechanical stiffness, amino acid&#8208;guided refractive index modulation, humidity/temperature&#8208;activated self&#8208;healing, and closed&#8208;loop aqueous recyclability. This molecularly encoded programmability distinguishes BNG from conventional smart materials, which typically rely on single stimulus&#8211;response modes. Critically, the configurability of H&#8208;bonding network further endows BNG with versatile processability (e.g., 3D printing, thermal pressing, and mold&#8208;casting) for functional architectures. Moreover, the programmable disassembly allows seamless integration into transient electronics as an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to energy&#8208;intensive glass recycling. By leveraging naturally abundant, metabolically benign building blocks, BNG establishes a sustainable paradigm for adaptive soft electronics and circular packaging&#8212;transforming glass from a passive structural medium to a dynamically programmable material.

         <title>Synthesis of Hydroxy&#8208;Functionalized Polyethylene via Radical Copolymerization of Ethylene with Alkenyl Boronate and Post&#8208;Polymerization Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized novel hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polyethylene via radical copolymerization of ethylene with isopropenylboronic acid pinacol ester, followed by oxidation of the boron pendant. Kinetic studies and product analyses suggested that the hydroxy group could be uniformly introduced into a moderately branched PE backbone (i.e., medium density) to achieve unique poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl vinyl alcohol) exhibiting 41% crystallinity. 








Abstract
Radical copolymerization of ethylene was performed with alkenyl boronate, and post&#8208;polymerization oxidation was conducted to synthesize hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polyethylene (PE). The copolymerization behavior was dependent on the molecular structure of the boron monomer: the copolymerization with &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted monomer carrying boronic acid pinacol ester [isopropenylboronic acid pinacol ester (IPBpin)] afforded copolymers with higher molar masses than the vinyl&#8208;type monomer [i.e., vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin)]. The content of the boron&#8208;pendant units was up to 7 mol%, and kinetic studies suggested the incorporation of boron&#8208;pendant units in a discrete manner. The post&#8208;polymerization oxidation of the boron pendants on the copolymer proceeded quantitatively, affording a hydroxy&#8208;containing polyethylene. The introduction of a hydroxy group had a significant impact on the crystallization behaviors.

Optical microscopy is commonly used to observe simple turn&#8208;on/off phenomena in chemical reactions. A method is presented for the real&#8208;time monitoring of diverse reaction pathways at the single&#8208;molecule level using optical microscopy. This technique enables detailed kinetic and dynamic studies to be performed, providing new insights into catalyst design and the elucidation of reaction mechanisms.








Abstract
Investigation of the fundamental microscopic processes occurring in organic reactions is essential for optimising both organocatalysts and synthetic strategies. In this study, single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy was employed to study the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction catalysed by a first&#8208;generation MacMillan catalyst, providing direct insights into its kinetic dynamics. This reaction proceeds via a series of reversible processes under equilibrium conditions (S &#8644; IM1 &#8644; IM2 &#8594; P, IM1 and IM2: N,O&#8208;acetal and iminium ion intermediates, respectively). The individual reaction trajectories of single molecules were directly observed in real&#8208;time, and the kinetic transitions between the different states were quantitatively analysed using a hidden Markov model, thereby enabling precise determination of the kinetic rate constants and transition probabilities at the single&#8208;molecule level. In particular, the unique structural features of the MacMillan catalyst were probed to reveal how specific interactions stabilise the reaction intermediates and influence their kinetic behaviours. These findings highlight the importance of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of organic reactions and guiding the rational design of more effective catalysts.

         <title>Evolution of Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters with Intrinsic Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rich excited&#8208;state dynamics of intrinsically chiral silver nanoclusters tethering cationic species on the surface demonstrates the excited&#8208;state dependent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), suggesting the temporal evolution of exciton distribution.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is a powerful tool to probe the chiroptical properties of molecular systems in the excited state. Here, we demonstrate the evolution of excited&#8208;state chiroptical property in silver nanoclusters (NCs) by CPL measurements. The use of bidentate thiolate ligand, 1,3&#8208;benzenedithiol (BDT), with the aid of triphenylphosphine (PPh3), affords racemic [Ag29(BDT)12(PPh3)4]3&#8722; NCs (Ag29 NCs) with intrinsic chirality in the exterior cage composed of a silver(I)&#8208;dithiolate coordination framework, that are separable by chiral column chromatography. We have recently reported that the post&#8208;synthetic modification of negatively charged Ag29 NCs with a cationic silver(I) complex on the exterior cage stabilizes a specific excited state with a triplet character, enhancing photoluminescence (PL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. While the same modification on the separated enantiomeric NCs does not change the circular dichroism (CD) profile so much, the CPL activity is dramatically enhanced with an increase in the anisotropy factor (|glum| value) from &lt;1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 to 6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, demonstrating the excited&#8208;state dependent CPL property of Ag29 NCs. In combination with the picosecond PL decay study, the low&#8208;temperature CPL measurement indicates the time development of excited&#8208;state property, suggesting the possible evolution of CPL activity.

         <title>3D Gas Diffusion Layer with Dual&#8208;Metal Sites for Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized a 3D&#8208;CuAg&#8208;GDE, achieving a remarkable FEC2+ of 82.04% at &#8722;0.88&#160;V versus RHE with a partial current density of 565.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The chitosan&#8208;induced 3D structure enhances CO2 accessibility, while DFT simulation reveal the tandem synergistic interaction of the Cu&#8208;Ag dual sites&#8212;Cu activates CO2 into CO* and Ag promotes CHO* formation, enabling asymmetric coupling for C2+ products.








Abstract
Achieving satisfactory C2+ products selectivity and current density in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) remains a challenge for the practical applications. Here, we design a 3D&#8208;CuAg&#8208;GDE for eCO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ products, which shows a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.04% at &#8722;0.88&#160;V versus RHE and a partial current density of 565.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the chitosan with multiple functional groups induces the formation of 3D architecture, which enhances the accessibility of reactive sites and mitigates the limitations associated with CO2 diffusion. The abundant hydrogen bonds between chitosan and CO2 promote the adsorption and enrichment of reactant. Furthermore, the Cu site exhibits stronger activation capacity for CO2 and facilitates the subsequent electron transfer process for the formation of intermediate *CO. The DFT simulation also reveals the thermodynamic favorable for *CO migrating from Cu site to Ag site. Moreover, the Ag site exhibits a more negative Gibbs free energy for the protonation of *CO to *CHO, which facilitates the asymmetric coupling of *CO (Cu site) and *CHO (Ag site), ultimately enhancing the generation of C2+ products. Consequently, the unique 3D structure and tandem synergistic interaction of the Cu&#9472;Ag dual sites achieves high activity for eCO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ products.

         <title>Probing the Structural Dynamics of In2O3 Using in Situ Raman Spectroscopy: Bridging Material Dynamics and Sensor Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;engineered In2O3 (cubic/rhombohedral) homojunctions are designed for room&#8208;temperature NO2 sensing, achieving an ultrahigh response (1208 to 5&#160;ppm). In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals reversible phase transitions, identifying rhombohedral In2O3 as the dominant active phase for NO2 interaction. This real&#8208;time structural analysis directly correlates phase dynamics with sensor response, resolving a key uncertainty in MOS sensing mechanisms. 








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors still face the critical challenge of high operating temperatures. While material engineering strategies have enabled room&#8208;temperature operation, the dynamic evolution of active phases during sensing&#8212;a key factor governing structure&#8208;activity relationships&#8212;remains poorly understood due to the lack of real&#8208;time characterization techniques. Here, we design phase&#8208;engineered In2O3 homojunctions (cubic/rhombohedral) via graphene&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis and demonstrate their exceptional NO2 sensing performance at room temperature. The optimized In2O3/graphene (In2O3/G) hybrid exhibits a 20&#8208;fold enhancement in response (1208 versus 58 for pure In2O3 at 5&#160;ppm NO2), achieving ultrahigh sensitivity with minimal power consumption. By employing in situ Raman spectroscopy to probe structural dynamics during gas exposure, we identify a reversible phase transition between cubic and rhombohedral In2O3, with the rhombohedral phase acting as the dominant active site for NO2 adsorption/desorption. This real&#8208;time observation of phase&#8208;dependent reactivity establishes a direct correlation between transient structural changes and sensor response, resolving a long&#8208;standing ambiguity in MOS&#8208;based sensing mechanisms. Our findings not only pinpoint the active phase but also provide a generalizable methodology to bridge nanoscale material dynamics with macroscopic device functionality, paving the way for rational design of high&#8208;performance sensors.

         <title>Steering Amide Synthesis from Acetonitrile by Electrochemically Derived Active Superoxide</title>

The selectively formed in situ superoxide radicals, &#8226;&#9472;O2&#8722; via oxygen electroreduction are highly active for amide bond formation to synthesize acetamide from acetonitrile with 94% selectivity under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Amides with unique carbonyl&#8208;nitrogen linkage are fundamental functional groups that are active and essential for a wide range of natural and synthetic products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and key intermediates. Amide bond formation is one of the most fundamental reactions in chemistry. Conventional amide synthesis faces challenges of poor atom economy and reliance on hazardous reagents. Herein, we present a tandem electro&#8208;thermal catalytic pathway for the synthesis of acetamide from acetonitrile, leveraging electrochemically generated superoxide radicals to steer oxygen insertion under ambient conditions. The superoxide radicals were formed via controlled electroreduction of molecular oxygen. In 1&#160;M K2CO3 electrolyte containing methanol, we achieved over 94% selectivity toward acetamide at a total current density up to 104&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a productivity of 878&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Mechanistic studies reveal that the superoxide radicals stabilized by a buffered alkaline environment facilitated the nucleophilic C&#9472;O coupling at the nitrile group, while the presence of methanol quenched the hydroxyl radicals and effectively suppressed the over&#8208;oxidation of acetamide to acetate. This coupled electro&#8208;thermal catalysis enables the synthesis of a large variety of amides and may inspire more complex organic synthesis through active oxygen species&#8208;mediated process.

         <title>From Solvent to Catalyst: In Situ Amino Acid&#8208;Like Species Enable PET Upcycling Without Added Catalysts</title>

Amino acid logic meets solvent design: A bioinspired strategy leveraging the acid&#8208;base synergistic catalysis of in situ&#8208;generated amino acid&#8211;like species from N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) enables external catalyst&#8208;free depolymerization of waste polyesters into valuable carboxylates and ethylene carbonate.








Abstract
Chemical recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a promising route to value&#8208;added chemical production, yet conventional methods typically demand harsh conditions and dedicated catalysts. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy that exploits the intramolecular acid&#8208;base synergy of amino acids for efficient PET depolymerization. Alanine functions as a bifunctional organocatalyst, enabling complete PET esterolysis by dimethyl carbonate within 3&#160;h at 180 &#176;C to afford dimethyl terephthalate (98%) and ethylene carbonate (80%). Extending this concept, trace water in N&#8208;methyl &#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone induces in situ generation of 4&#8208;(methylamino)butyric acid, which emulates amino acid bifunctionality and enables catalyst&#8208;free depolymerization under identical conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal an intramolecular dual&#8208;site acid&#8208;base mechanism, where &#8211;COO&#8722; and &#8211;NH2&#8314;&#160;groups cooperatively activate methanol and PET carbonyls through hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic transition states, lowering the barrier by &#8764;29&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1. The method extends broadly to polyesters and polycarbonate, while establishing a transferable design paradigm that translates catalytic principles from nature into organocatalyst and solvent design, underscoring solvent molecular design as a general lever for sustainable catalysis and plastic upcycling.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Heterovalent Alloying Hybrid Double Perovskite Solid Solution for Elevating Ferroelastic Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we constructed a novel family of intrinsic hybrid double perovskite solid solutions, which greatly enhances and expands the photoelectric response across the entire visible light range.








Abstract
Hybrid double perovskites (HDPs), as the main candidates for lead&#8208;free materials, have attracted great attention in the construction of ferroelectrics, ferroelastics, and high&#8208;efficiency photodetectors. However, the photoelectronic performance of HDPs, including bandgap and carrier transport efficiency, is still far behind compared to lead&#8208;based analogues. Excavate effective strategies to bridge this gap has always been an ongoing challenge. Herein, for the first time, we present a family of intrinsic solid solution based on heterovalent metal ions of HDPs, (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)X8 (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I). Such solid solution effectively improves the structural stacking mode, and thereby not only inducing 4/mmmF2/m type ferroelastic phase transition but also making a narrower optical bandgap (&#8764;1.74&#160;eV) of (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)I8 lower than that of HDP counterparts. Benefiting from the collaborative overlap of wide absorption range and promoting effect ferroelastic domains on carrier transport, (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)I8 exhibits a photocurrent switching ratio (Ion/Ioff) greater than 100 and photoelectric response across the entire UV&#8211;vis range. In short, this work provides a new perspective for improving the physical performance of HDPs.

         <title>Integrated Conversion of Polyesters, CO2, and Glycerol via Ethylene Oxide&#8208;Mediated Tandem Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;pot cycloaddition&#8211;transesterification&#8211;glycolysis (CTG) tandem process achieved the efficient co&#8208;conversion of PET, CO2, and glycerol into bis&#8208;hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) and glycerol carbonate&#8212;produced in yields of 92% and 99%, respectively, under mild temperatures (60&#8211;110&#160;&#176;C) without additional solvents or acidic/alkaline conditions.








Abstract
The co&#8208;conversion of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), CO2, and renewable carbon resources offers a sustainable strategy for reducing plastic waste and carbon emissions, but remains challenging. Here, we develop a one&#8208;pot cycloaddition&#8211;transesterification&#8211;glycolysis (CTG) tandem process to efficiently convert PET, CO2, and glycerol into bis&#8208;hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) and glycerol carbonate, achieving yields of 92% and 99%, respectively. The process begins with the cycloaddition of ethylene oxide and CO2 in an ionic liquid, followed by transesterification with glycerol to produce glycerol carbonate and ethylene glycol. The in situ&#8208;generated ethylene glycol participates in PET glycolysis to yield BHET catalyzed by zinc acetate. Kinetic studies, isotope labelling, and theoretical calculations reveal that ethylene oxide serves two functions: (i) swelling the PET matrix to enhance mass transfer and (ii) providing ethylene glycol. The synchronized kinetics of cycloaddition, transesterification, and glycolysis enable ethylene oxide to play both roles effectively, significantly accelerating PET depolymerization at mild temperatures.

         <title>CrystalGAT: An AI&#8208;Based Intelligent Flexible Crystal Materials Design Computing Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents CrystalGAT, an attention&#8208;based graph neural network, to predict the mechanical properties of molecular crystals. It visually identifies key structural segments affecting flexibility, enabling targeted modification to transform brittle into flexible crystals and improving drug tablet performance, offering a powerful tool for material and pharmaceutical development.








Abstract
Endowing functional crystals with flexibility significantly broadens their potential applications in the field of flexible smart devices. Despite tremendous efforts to understand the foundational structural principles of flexibility, most discoveries of crystals with mechanical flexibility remain accidental. Currently, machine learning has become a transformative research paradigm in materials science. Here, we propose an innovative approach and develop a platform for predicting the mechanical properties of molecular crystals named CrystalGAT. CrystalGAT is a graph neural network model based on attention mechanisms, which constructs a robust optimal model through data augmentation strategies and achieves markedly superior prediction performance compared to established models. A high prediction accuracy of 90% is demonstrated on the validation set, alongside a promising generalization capability that extends to multicomponent systems. Most importantly, we have identified key segments influencing the mechanical properties of molecular crystals using CrystalGAT, successfully achieving a breakthrough in transforming brittle crystals into flexible photoresponsive crystals. Furthermore, it is possible to quickly screen for plastic multicomponent drug crystals, enhancing tableting performance. CrystalGAT provides an efficient method for flexible molecular crystal design, demonstrating its potential applications in material discovery and drug molecular modification. For user convenience, a dedicated website has been established: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ZZZCCCYYY/CrystalGAT.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endowing functional crystals with flexibility significantly broadens their potential applications in the field of flexible smart devices. Despite tremendous efforts to understand the foundational structural principles of flexibility, most discoveries of crystals with mechanical flexibility remain accidental. Currently, machine learning has become a transformative research paradigm in materials science. Here, we propose an innovative approach and develop a platform for predicting the mechanical properties of molecular crystals named CrystalGAT. CrystalGAT is a graph neural network model based on attention mechanisms, which constructs a robust optimal model through data augmentation strategies and achieves markedly superior prediction performance compared to established models. A high prediction accuracy of 90% is demonstrated on the validation set, alongside a promising generalization capability that extends to multicomponent systems. Most importantly, we have identified key segments influencing the mechanical properties of molecular crystals using CrystalGAT, successfully achieving a breakthrough in transforming brittle crystals into flexible photoresponsive crystals. Furthermore, it is possible to quickly screen for plastic multicomponent drug crystals, enhancing tableting performance. CrystalGAT provides an efficient method for flexible molecular crystal design, demonstrating its potential applications in material discovery and drug molecular modification.

         <title>In situ Crystal Structure Growth and Control for Enhancing Comprehensive Performance in Ultra&#8208;High Nickel&#8208;Layered Lithium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special ultra&#8208;high nickel&#8208;layered cathode LiNi0.91Co0.045Mn0.045O2 with gapped internal structure as well as surface rock&#8208;salt phase is achieved based on an in situ growth method and a multistep sintering strategy, which exhibits enhanced lithium&#8208;ion transport dynamics and improved cycle stability.








Abstract
The ultra&#8208;high nickel&#8208;layered cathodes, LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (x&#160;&#8805;&#160;0.9), featuring high energy density and low cost, have been the exploration and application targets for the next&#8208;generation batteries. Current ultra&#8208;high nickel cathodes fail to meet the commercial demands, owing to the structure degradation during cycle. Additionally, the dense structure of traditional secondary particles restricts the migration of Li+ and further limits the capacity and rate performance. In this work, we focus on modulating intrinsic structure and morphology of cathodes originating from in situ growth method and have further controllably synthesized a special ultra&#8208;high nickel cathode with gapped structure and thin surface rock&#8208;salt phase (G&#8208;Ni91). Compared to the traditional dense&#8208;structure cathode (D&#8208;Ni91), G&#8208;Ni91 delivers better performance in all aspects, whether it is initial capacity, cycle stability, rate performance, high&#8208;voltage operation, and high&#8208;temperature condition. Multiscale characterizations manifests that smaller primary particle size, gapped interspace and less Li+/Ni2+ antisite in G&#8208;Ni91 supply enhanced Li+ transport dynamics. Moreover, the thin surface rock&#8208;salt phase and more uniform primary particles are regarded as contributions to the improved cycling stability. This work provides a feasible original intrinsic structural design and modification from precursor to cathodes, ultimately facilitating substantial improvements in electrochemical performance of ultra&#8208;high nickel&#8208;layered cathodes.

         <title>Visualization of Electrical Trees: Oxygen Metabolism Insights and Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorescence imaging of Lichtenberg figures (PI&#8208;LF), guided by a newly established dual&#8208;pathway oxygen metabolism mechanism in photoactivated phosphorescent materials, involves both energy&#8208; (1O2) and charge&#8208;transfer (O2&#8226;&#8722;) routes with molecule&#8208;dependent selectivity. These insights enable oxygen sensing and high&#8208;resolution visualization of dielectric degradation, uncovering the hierarchical progression of electrical tree growth.








Abstract
Electrical treeing, manifesting as Lichtenberg figures (LFs) is a major cause of dielectric failure in power, communication, and aerospace systems. Visualization of LF evolution has been hindered by passive imaging limits. Here, we introduce phosphorescence imaging of Lichtenberg figures (PI&#8208;LF), which maps both structural damage and localized oxygen depletion via high&#8208;contrast luminescent signals. Guided by a mechanistic understanding of oxygen metabolism in photoactivated phosphorescent systems, indole&#8208;core dopants with tunable chromaticity reveal dual oxygen pathways: energy transfer to singlet oxygen and electron transfer to superoxide radicals. Polymer systems doped with these luminophores resolve fine structural progression of electrical trees, enabling bioimaging&#8208;style analysis that uncovers a previously hidden spherical&#8208;layered growth mode. PI&#8208;LF bridges molecular photophysics and high&#8208;voltage engineering, establishing a paradigm for luminescence&#8208;based visualization of dielectric breakdown.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced Amplification of Birefringence and Nonlinear Optical Response in a Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a coordination&#8208;driven strategy to enhance birefringence and nonlinear optical response in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). By transforming a loosely packed molecular crystal into a 2D CMOF, significant birefringence amplification (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.226) is achieved. First&#8208;principles calculations and measurable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response confirm substantial anisotropy and noncentrosymmetric behavior. These results establish a new approach for designing birefringent and nonlinear optical crystals, with potential applications in ultraviolet photonics and polarization optics.








Abstract
Crystalline materials exhibiting programmable optical anisotropy are of great interest for advanced photonic applications but remain challenging. In this study, we introduce a coordination&#8208;driven approach that significantly enhances optical anisotropy by transforming a loosely packed molecular crystal (crystal&#8208;1) into a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (crystal&#8208;2). This structural transformation leads to a more than 20&#8208;fold increase in birefringence (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.226 at 546&#160;nm) and activates a measurable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) activity. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the observed optical enhancement is driven by three main factors: coordination&#8208;driven enhancement of asymmetry, alignment of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, and anisotropic electron distribution. These findings highlight the potential of coordination polymerization as a versatile approach for designing hybrid optical materials with tailored anisotropy, providing a foundation for the development of MOF&#8208;based photonic devices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;nido&#8208;carborane&#8208;protected copper nanoclusters, an octahedral Cu6 and a superatomic icosahedral Cu13 have been fabricated for the first time. Cu6 undergoes a spontaneous transformation into Cu13 in acetone solution. Moreover, Cu13 exhibits near&#8208;infrared luminescence in both solution and solid states and demonstrates exceptional performance in vitro for bioimaging.








Abstract
Peripheral ligands of metal nanoclusters play a crucial role in determining their structures and modulating their physicochemical properties. Therefore, expanding the diversity of ligands is of paramount importance for advancing metal cluster science. In this work, we report for the first time the synthesis and characterization of two all&#8208;nido&#8208;carborane&#8208;protected copper nanoclusters: an octahedral [Cu6(C2B9H11)4](Et4N)2 (Cu6) and an icosahedral [Cu13(C2B9H11)6](Et4N)3 (Cu13) (Et4N&#160;=&#160;tetraethylammonium). As confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS and time&#8208;dependent UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy, Cu6 undergoes spontaneous transformation into Cu13 in acetone solution. Theoretical computations reveal that the superatomic cluster Cu13 possesses an open&#8208;shell electronic structure of 1S21P2. Moreover, Cu13 solution exhibits prominent near&#8208;infrared luminescence at 880&#160;nm and demonstrates superior performance in bioimaging with 4T1 cells, showcasing significant potential for biomedical applications. This study not only enriches the ligand library for metal clusters but also provides new impetus for the exploration of carborane chemistry.

         <title>Unlocking the Critical Role of Noncovalent Interactions Between Alkali Metal Cations and Nitrate in Promoting the Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>

Alkali cations&#8217; effect on Cu&#8208;catalyzed NO3&#8722;RR shows activity trend: Li+&#160;&lt; Cs+&#160;&lt;&#160;Na+&#160;&lt;&#160;K+. AIMD simulations reveal Na+/K+/Cs+ with soft solvation shells enhance NO3&#8722; &#8594; NO2&#8722; RDS via partial desolvation and electrostatic coordination, with K+ exhibiting optimal interaction strength.








Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) is widely investigated for sustainable ammonia (NH3) production from NO3&#8722; pollutants. Alkali metal cations (AM+) in the electrolyte often greatly impact electrocatalytic performance; however, the role of AM+ in the NO3&#8722;RR remains unclear. Here, we first investigate the influence of AM+ on the Cu&#8208;catalyzed NO3&#8722;RR, revealing an activity increase trend of Li+&#160;&lt;&#160;Cs+&#160;&lt;&#160;Na+&#160;&lt;&#160;K+, which is inconsistent with the local electric field and proton transfer rate increase trend of Li+&#160;&lt;&#160;Na+&#160;&lt;&#160;K+&#160;&lt; Cs+, hinting that the presence of other important factors governs the NO3&#8722;RR activity. Intriguingly, Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations uncover that Na+, K+, and Cs+ with relatively soft solvation shells could be partially desolvated and then coordinate with NO3&#8722; via a short&#8208;range electrostatic interaction, thereby boosting the rate determining step (RDS), that is the conversion of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;. Notably, K+ with suitable NO3&#8722; interaction strength has higher ability to boost the RDS than Na+ and Cs+ with too weak and strong strength, respectively. Our results highlight that the short&#8208;range electrostatic interaction strength of AM+/NO3&#8722; is a crucial factor to determine the NO3&#8722;RR activity.

         <title>Mirror&#8208;Symmetric Nanoarray Networks of Atomic Ni&#8208;Incorporated Tungsten Oxynitride for Efficient and Robust Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heteroatom&#8208;induced oriented&#8208;growth strategy is developed to construct the mirror&#8208;symmetric nanoarray networks of atomic Ni&#8208;incorporated tungsten oxynitride (Ni&#8208;WNO) for efficient and robust alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In alkaline HER, Ni&#8208;WNO follows a concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer pathway with accelerated H&#8722;H coupling on atomic W&#8722;Ni units, which offers new perspectives on the surface&#8208;mediated H2 generation.








Abstract
The development of alkali&#8208;efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts is essential for future deployment of anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis technology. Herein, we report a novel heteroatom&#8208;induced strategy to construct the mirror&#8208;symmetric nanoarray networks of Ni&#8208;doped WO3 on carbon cloth and design a corresponding new type of atomic Ni&#8208;incorporated tungsten oxynitride (Ni&#8208;WNO) electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. Impressively, the Ni&#8208;WNO shows high activity (&#8722;35&#160;mV at&#160;&#8722;10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), small Tafel slope (32&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and excellent stability (&gt;1200&#160;h at &#8722;1.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2), representing the best&#8208;performing W&#8208;based electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. Multiple spectroscopy characterizations reveal that Ni&#8208;WNO is highly active for adsorbing aggressive OH&#8722;/H2O groups, resulting in the in situ formation of lattice hydroxyl (i.e., W&#8722;OH) species with Br&#248;nsted acidity, which, we disclose for the first time, can serve as a mediator to alter the generation of metal&#8722;H intermediates from a conventional sequential to a concerted proton&#8722;electron transfer (CPET) pathway, thus breaking the pH&#8208;dependent limitations in proton&#8208;deficient alkalies. Further isotope experiments demonstrate that the surface&#8208;mediated H&#8722;H coupling can be feasibly accelerated on atomic W&#8722;Ni units, thereby enabling Ni&#8208;WNO catalyzing alkaline HER via a new kinetically fast CPET&#8211;Tafel pathway.

         <title>&#8220;Living Nanosheets&#8221; of Covalent Organic Frameworks Aligned into Laminar Membranes for Sharp and Durable Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;living nanosheets&#8221; strategy is proposed to prepare a robust and laminar COF membrane with a large area of up to 600 cm2. The resultant COF membrane exhibits fast methanol permeation and sharp molecular weight cutoff, enabling energy&#8208;efficient molecular separations in pharmaceutical and chemical industries.








Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) requires membranes to have exquisite pore structures and excellent solvent resistance to alter energy&#8208;intensive separation processes. Here, we report a scalable &#8220;living nanosheet&#8221; strategy for synthesizing covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with robust laminar structures. COF nanosheets and residual monomers are collectively cast onto smooth substrates, followed by heating in an enclosed environment. The slow shear&#8208;flows make COF nanosheets accurately aligned into laminar structures while avoiding possible distortion. The COF nanosheets are still &#8220;living&#8221;, so that they can continue to react with remaining monomers upon heating, further healing the intercrystalline defects and stabilizing the laminar membranes. This strategy allows upscalable preparation of membranes with a large area of up to 600 cm2. The resulting COF membranes exhibit ultrahigh permeability (1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1 nm for methanol) and a sharp molecular weight cutoff (360&#160;Da), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSN membranes. Notably, it achieves a sharp and durable separation process of photosensitizers (e.g., 98.3% rejection of TMPyP4 tosylate) and&#160;&gt;92% solvent recovery. This work establishes a versatile approach for scalable synthesis of COF membranes, enabling energy&#8208;efficient molecular separations in pharmaceutical and chemical industries.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transition Intervention Engineered Amorphous Vanadium Oxide for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous vanadium oxide (AVO) was prepared via a phase&#8208;transition intervention strategy. It involves intercalating polyaniline (PANI) into layered V2O5&#183;1.6H2O, followed by an annealing transformation to construct an AVO/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (AVO@NC) composite. The PANI&#8208;derived nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers enhance AVO's thermodynamic stability, provide efficient electron transfer, and mitigate AVO dissolution through a confinement effect.








Abstract
Amorphous vanadium oxide (AVO) has emerged as a promising cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), combining the high theoretical capacity and low cost of crystalline vanadium oxides with improved kinetics and structural tolerance. However, AVO still faces critical challenges, including thermodynamic instability, poor electrical conductivity, and severe dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, which limit its practical application. Herein, we propose a novel &#8220;phase&#8208;transition intervention&#8221; strategy for the synthesis of AVO. In this approach, polyaniline molecules are first intercalated into layered V2O5&#183;1.6H2O, followed by high&#8208;temperature treatment. During the thermally induced phase transition of V2O5&#183;1.6H2O, the intercalated polyaniline molecules undergo in situ carbonization and form nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers, which simultaneously disrupt long&#8208;range crystallinity and promote the formation of AVO confined in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers. The carbon layers provide the AVO with suppressed dissolution, enhanced electrical conductivity, and improved thermodynamic stability. The resulting composite exhibits excellent AZIB performance, delivering high capacities of 390.5 and 329.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 20.0 A g&#8722;1, respectively, and outstanding cycling stability. This work offers a versatile strategy for designing amorphous electrode materials and opens new directions for high&#8208;energy aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Amorphous vanadium oxide (AVO) has emerged as a promising cathode material for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs), combining the high theoretical capacity and low cost of crystalline vanadium oxides with improved kinetics and structural tolerance. However, AVO still faces critical challenges, including thermodynamic instability, poor electrical conductivity, and severe dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, which limit its practical application. Herein, we propose a novel &#8220;phase-transition intervention&#8221; strategy for the synthesis of AVO. In this approach, polyaniline molecules are first intercalated into layered V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;1.6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, followed by high-temperature treatment. During the thermally induced phase transition of V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;1.6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, the intercalated polyaniline molecules undergo in situ carbonization and form nitrogen-doped carbon layers, which simultaneously disrupt long-range crystallinity and promote the formation of AVO confined in nitrogen-doped carbon layers. The carbon layers provide the AVO with suppressed dissolution, enhanced electrical conductivity, and improved thermodynamic stability. The resulting composite exhibits excellent AZIB performance, delivering high capacities of 390.5 and 329.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 and 20.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and outstanding cycling stability. This work offers a versatile strategy for designing amorphous electrode materials and opens new directions for high-energy aqueous zinc-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Deoxyarylation of Non&#8208;Activated Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient direct deoxygenation coupling strategy for the deoxygenation cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl alcohols with various aryl electrophiles has been developed. The substrate alcohols require no preliminary activation, and the reaction occurs in a single step, representing the first direct deoxygenation arylation of non&#8208;activated alkyl alcohols. The reaction is catalyzed under mild conditions, and all reagents utilized are commercially available, inexpensive, and readily accessible. 








Abstract
The formation of carbon&#8211;carbon bonds constitutes the most critical fundamental reaction in organic synthesis. Although synthetic chemists have achieved significant advancements in the cross&#8208;coupling of stable C(sp3) substrates, such as aliphatic carboxylic acids and alkyl halides, cost&#8208;effective, accessible, and versatile sources of alkyl groups, specifically alcohols, remain underutilized. The direct deoxygenation of alcohols under mild circumstances presents a significant challenge in organic synthesis, primarily due to the absence of an efficient mechanism for the direct activation of C&#9472;O bonds. Consequently, there is an imperative necessity for chemists to devise a multifaceted approach for the cross&#8208;coupling of alcohols. This study aims to utilize neutral diphenylboron radicals as hydroxyl activation agents to directly activate the carbon&#8211;oxygen bonds of prevalent alcohols, thereby generating alkyl radicals, which are subsequently involved in nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylation processes. Both free alcohols and aryl bromides, which are easily accessible compounds, can serve as coupling partners directly without requiring pre&#8208;functionalization. The direct arylation process of alcohols exhibits a broad substrate scope, as demonstrated by the subsequent arylation of several structurally intricate natural compounds and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced CO2 Methanation over Au@Ru/TiO2 via Nanoscale Control of Ru Shell Thickness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au@Ru core&#8211;shell nanoparticles on TiO2 integrate active Ru sites with Au plasmonic excitation. At 190&#160;&#176;C, 545&#160;nm light boosts CO2 methanation rates by 335% while preserving &gt;99% CH4 selectivity. The catalyst outperforms Ru/C and remains stable for 85&#160;h, underscoring nanoscale shell engineering for efficient light&#8208;assisted thermocatalysis.








Abstract
Plasmonic&#8208;catalytic nanostructures enable coupling light harvesting with chemical transformations, yet their performance critically depends on nanoscale architecture and metal&#8208;support interactions. Here, we synthesize Au@Ru core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with tunable Ru coverage and immobilize them on TiO2 to create hybrid catalysts for CO2 methanation. By controlling Ru shell thickness, we identifyAu60Ru40/TiO2, featuring a thin, discontinuous shell (&#8764;2&#160;nm Ru nanocrystallites), as the most active composition. This catalyst combines abundant Ru active sites with preservation of the Au core's localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Under 545&#160;nm illumination, it shows a 335% rate enhancement over dark conditions at 190&#160;&#176;C, outperforming commercial Ru/C and remaining stable for 85&#160;h. Optical, structural, and&#160;kinetic analysis indicate that illumination accelerates the methanation without changing the rate&#8208;determining step, consistent with a dominant photothermal contribution. Density functional theory reveals that TiO2 induces strong metal&#8208;support interactions, upshifts the Ru d&#8208;band center, strengthens CO2 adsorption, and lowers the barrier for the first hydrogenation step, shifting the rate&#8208;limiting step to CH4 desorption. These results establish Au@Ru/TiO2 as an efficient platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;assisted thermocatalysis and demonstrates that nanoscale shell engineering as a generalizable strategy to optimize&#160;plasmonic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation and beyond.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Field Coupling Driven in Situ Interfacial Growth of COF&#8208;functionalized Membranes for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;field coupling&#8208;driven in situ interface synthesis is employed to grow stable COF functional materials within commercial membranes, aiming to enhance the performance of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Meanwhile, this initiative fosters a novel perspective on the universal application of in situ preparation of functionalized separators. 








Abstract
Conventional modification methods for the separator of high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries often struggle to realize the functional materials well adhering on and across the substrate. Herein, we employ a scalable top&#8208;down strategy in an oil&#8211;water&#8211;oil system to interfacially polymerize COF nanoparticles across a polyolefin substrate as a self&#8208;standing separator for Li&#9472;S batteries. By providing a suitable environment for the membrane to remain flat during polymerization, COF particles can penetrate from the surface into internal pores, forming a uniform and robust architecture. The resulting COF&#8208;functionalized membrane incorporates abundant &#8208;OH groups that effectively promote Li+ transport and restrict polysulfide shuttling. Benefiting from this synergy, the modified separator achieves high ionic conductivity (0.92 mS cm&#8722;1), an elevated polysulfide diffusion barrier (0.390&#160;versus 0.283&#160;eV), and excellent electrochemical performance, including 678 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 1.0 C. This in situ interface polymerization strategy offers a new path for more comprehensively functionalizing COF&#8208;based membrane to achieve high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Complementary Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Design for Blue OLEDs Beyond the Concentration Limit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complementary multi&#8208;resonance (MR)&#8208;TADF emitters enable a confinement&#8208;assisted guided energy transfer (CAGE) process, where resonant singlet confinement directs exciton flow while suppressing triplet diffusion. This dual&#8208;MR system effectively mitigates concentration quenching, achieving enhanced efficiency and operational stability in deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Advances in boron&#8208;based organic compounds exhibiting multi&#8208;resonance (MR)&#8208;type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been primarily driven by their potential as narrowband blue emitters for wide&#8208;gamut display applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsically planar architecture of MR&#8208;type TADF molecules often leads to pronounced concentration quenching at elevated doping levels, posing a significant impediment to realizing highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Notably, the exciton quenching effect observed here fundamentally follows the same energy transfer mechanism that underlies exciton migration. Based on this insight, we developed a system comprising two MR&#8208;TADF molecules with analogous electronic structures that enable mutual exciton energy transfer. The resultant complementary MR&#8208;TADF emitter system exhibits substantially improved resistance to concentration quenching relative to single MR&#8208;TADF emitters, effectively suppressing efficiency drop and conferring enhanced control over exciton density. We envisage that this strategy represents a pivotal step toward overcoming the longstanding challenge of concentration quenching in MR&#8208;TADF materials, thereby enabling the development of high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.

         <title>Elucidating Highly Activated Transition Metal Redox Chemistry in Low&#8208;Nickel O3&#8208;Type Layered Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

An electronic structure tuning strategy based on multi&#8208;cationic compositional regulation was employed to deeply activate transition metal redox couples, enabling the development of a high&#8208;capacity, low&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathode. This approach enhances reversible capacity and optimizes the interlayer structure, effectively suppressing structural distortion and multiphase transitions during cycling, while also mitigating crack formation over long&#8208;term operation. As anticipated, the designed NMFMC||HC Ah&#8208;level pouch cell demonstrates excellent rate performance and cycling stability.








Abstract
Low&#8208;nickel O3&#8208;type layered oxides have emerged as cost&#8208;effective cathode candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical viability is challenged by rapid capacity decay and insufficient redox activity within safe voltage windows. Here, we report a multi&#8208;cationic compositional regulation strategy for Na0.96Ni0.2Mn0.32Fe0.4Mg0.04Cu0.04O2 (NMFMC), which tunes the energy levels of transition metal (TM) 3d orbitals to enhance two&#8208;electron Ni2+/Ni4+ redox activity and facilitate cooperative Fe3+ oxidation. This approach unlocks a 17% capacity enhancement (2.0&#8211;4.0&#160;V) over conventional low&#8208;Ni cathodes while maintaining structural integrity. Operando measurements and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the reinforced TM&#9472;O bonding upon Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping mitigates structural distortion and suppresses multiphase transitions, thereby enabling superior cycling stability. A 2.65 Ah NMFMC||hard carbon pouch cell maintains 80% capacity after 1600 cycles at 1C and preserves 94% capacity when cycled from 0.5C to 4C, demonstrating practical potential for grid&#8208;scale storage. By elucidating the interplay between orbital hybridization, redox chemistry, and structural evolution, this work establishes fundamental design principles for high&#8208;energy, durable SIB's cathodes while advancing sustainable large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions.

         <title>Cyclometalated Gold(III)&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Arylation: A Bioorthogonal Platform for Covalent Targeting of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclometalated Au(III) complexes have been designed to rapidly and selectively arylate cysteine residues within intrinsically disordered protein regions, enabling covalent labeling of previously &#8220;undruggable&#8221; cysteines. This gold&#8208;based platform expands the accessible cysteinome for proteome&#8208;wide profiling and offers new opportunities for targeting disordered proteins.








Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) remain largely inaccessible to covalent chemical tools due to their structural plasticity and lack of defined pockets. We introduce a bioorthogonal cyclometalated gold(III) platform of monodentate phosphine&#8208;supported AuP1&#8208;8 complexes that selectively and irreversibly arylate cysteine residues via enhanced Lewis acidity. This platform enables targeting of low&#8208;reactivity, buried, or dynamically disordered cysteines across the human proteome. Chemoproteomic, structural, and computational analyses establish an expanded ligandable cysteinome, including transiently helical LLCLL motifs in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Our findings establish a new class of metal&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reagents for proteome&#8208;wide cysteine labeling, functional interrogation of disordered proteins, and future therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

         <title>Cationic Covalent Organic Framework for Photocatalytic Defluorinative Amination of Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipyridine&#8208;based Tp&#8208;Bpy COF was transformed into a highly electron&#8208;deficient, cationic Tp&#8208;Bpy&#8208;Me COF backbone via one&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification, preserving crystallinity while modulating its electronic structure. The modified COF enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven activation of inert C&#9472;F bonds for efficient C&#9472;N bond formation across diverse substrates&#8212;even under natural sunlight&#8212;highlighting its promise for green heterogeneous photocatalysis.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;a unique class of crystalline, porous materials&#8212;are distinguished for their structural tunability, large surface area, high chemical stability, and tunable functionalities, which can be modified through pre&#8208; or post&#8208;synthetic modifications. These features make COFs highly attractive platforms for heterogeneous photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Building on these inherent advantages, we strategically modulated the electronic structure of a bipyridine&#8208;based COF (Tp&#8208;Bpy) via simple one&#8208;step methylation to yield a dicationic, highly electron&#8208;deficient framework (Tp&#8208;Bpy&#8208;Me). This post&#8208;synthetic modification preserved the structural integrity of COF and introduced profound changes to its electronic environment, including a notable upward (positive) shift in the valence band position. Consequently, the cationic Tp&#8208;Bpy&#8208;Me COF exhibited an exceptional ability to activate one of the most inert bonds in organic chemistry, the C&#9472;F bond, under visible light irradiation. This study establishes Tp&#8208;Bpy&#8208;Me as a robust and efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for defluorinative C&#9472;N bond formation across a broad range of substrates, including various fluoroarenes and nucleophiles. Remarkably, the photocatalytic transformation proceeds even under natural sunlight, highlighting its potential for sustainable, energy&#8208;efficient applications. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first successful demonstration of C&#9472;F bond activation toward C&#9472;N bond formation using a COF&#8208;based photocatalyst.

         <title>Effective Coordination Promoted Carbene N&#9472;H Bond Insertion on Heterogeneous Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we develop a heterogeneous copper catalyst for carbene N&#9472;H insertion reactions between diazo esters and challenging aliphatic amines including monoethanolamine. Mechanistic studies reveal that effective coordination of the amine to a Cu site adjacent to the carbene&#8208;binding metal center enhances the reactivity of carbene N&#9472;H insertion while avoiding catalyst deactivation by amine poisoning.








Abstract
In this study, we present a rationally designed Cu nanowire (NW) catalyst for carbene N&#9472;H bond insertion, addressing the challenges associated with highly coordinative aliphatic amines. The heterogeneous Cu NW catalyst with well&#8208;defined structures efficiently catalyzed carbene insertion reactions between various &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoesters and aliphatic amines including monoethanolamine (MEA), achieving moderate to high yields. Infrared spectroscopy analysis and theoretical studies confirm the strong coordination of MEA on the surface of the Cu NW. Comprehensive kinetic studies reveal that both the two substrates and Cu NW were involved in the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). Notably, the observed second&#8208;order dependence on Cu NW suggests that two identical Cu atoms participated in the RDS, one coordinating with the carbene carbon and the other binding with the amine nitrogen. A Hammett&#8208;plot study with 4&#8208;substituted benzylamines reveal that amines bearing electron&#8208;donating groups reacted significantly more slowly than those bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, supporting a concerted N&#9472;H carbene insertion mechanism. Collectively, these findings elucidate the exceptional catalytic performance of Cu NW in carbene N&#9472;H bond insertion reactions, further underscoring the significance of heterogeneous catalysts in organic transformations.

         <title>Ultrasmall Nickel Nanoclusters Accelerating Protonation for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction towards CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directional N removal strategy through H2 pyrolysis yields Ni3&#9472;N&#9472;C sub&#8208;nanoclusters from Ni&#9472;N&#9472;C precursors with enhanced CO2RR performance.








Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), particularly the protonation step is widely recognized as the kinetic bottleneck in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Modulating catalyst microstructures to accelerate protonation has thus emerged as a promising strategy to boost from CO2 to CO selectivity. Here, we report ultrasmall Ni nanocluster catalysts (denoted as Ni3&#9472;N&#9472;C) prepared via one&#8208;step pyrolysis of Ni&#8208;containing precursors under H2 atmosphere. Compared to conventional Ni&#9472;N&#9472;C with symmetric Ni&#9472;N4 motifs, Ni3&#9472;N&#9472;C displays similar physicochemical characteristics&#8212;Ni loading, defect density, surface area&#8212;yet exhibits distinct local Ni coordination environments. These sub&#8208;nanoclusters markedly enhance CO2RR performance, delivering&#160;&gt;&#160;90% CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) across &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE, with a peak FECO of &#8764;95% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Ni3&#9472;N&#9472;C substantially lowers the energy barrier for *COOH formation owing to altered adsorption configurations, thereby facilitating the rate&#8208;limiting protonation step. In situ FTIR measurements further confirm the accelerated *COOH formation on Ni3&#9472;N&#9472;C surfaces. This work highlights the critical role of Ni sub&#8208;nanoclusters in PCET modulation and establishes a rational design principle for nanocluster&#8208;based catalysts in CO2RR.

These sub-nanoclusters markedly enhance CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance, delivering&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;90% CO Faradaic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) across &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE, with a peak FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; of &#8764;95% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;N&#9472;C substantially lowers the energy barrier for *COOH formation owing to altered adsorption configurations, thereby facilitating the rate-limiting protonation step. In situ FTIR measurements further confirm the accelerated *COOH formation on Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;N&#9472;C surfaces. This work highlights the critical role of Ni sub-nanoclusters in PCET modulation and establishes a rational design principle for nanocluster-based catalysts in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Metastable LixCoO2 Cathode Enabled by Coherent Intergrowth of T#2 and O2 Phases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining multiscale structural characterization techniques, the structure of O2&#8208;type LCO is revealed to comprise a complex configuration in which T#2 and O2 domains coexist coherently in both interlayer and intralayer arrangements. This structural compatibility not only facilitates Li+ transport but also enables the incorporation of a sufficiently high Li content. Compared with O3&#8208;type LCO, the T#2/O2 composite delivers higher reversible capacity and superior rate capability, rather than being restricted to approximately 220 mAh g&#8722;1.








Abstract
O2&#8208;type LixCoO2 (O2&#8208;LCO) has recently attracted significant attention as a promising cathode material with superior electrochemical performance compared to its conventional O3&#8208;type counterpart. Due to its metastable nature, O2&#8208;LCO is typically synthesized via ion exchange under relatively mild thermal conditions; however, the structural evolution and resultant phase composition during this process, which critically affect the material's performance, remain insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically elucidate the interplay between composition, structure, and electrochemical performance in metastable LiCoO2 synthesized via molten&#8208;salt ion exchange. We show that the Na content in the precursor not only dictates the final Li content in the product but also thermodynamically governs the phase transition pathway. Comprehensive long&#8208;range and local structural characterizations reveal the composite nature of ion&#8208;exchanged LCO, comprising T#2, O2, and O3 phases, with their relative fractions determined by the initial Na content. Electrochemical measurements, supported by theoretical calculations, indicate that the optimal phase composite maximizes both Li content and T#2 fraction while suppressing O3 formation, thereby enhancing Li+ diffusion kinetics and structural compatibility. These insights provide a fundamental basis for phase engineering in metastable cathode materials and practical guidelines for designing high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Tuning Asymmetric Isomers in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks to Enhance Oxygen Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the electronic state of metal&#8208;free COF catalysts through asymmetric geometric isomers, the 2&#8208;substituted asymmetric thiophene COF&#8208;&#945; better optimizes local electron distribution, promotes the formation of OOH* intermediates in oxygen reduction reactions, and thus improves the selectivity of the 2e&#8722; electron pathway in hydrogen peroxide production.








Abstract
Embedding isomers into crystalline skeletons with well&#8208;defined spatial structures represents a feasible way to improve the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, most research has been focused on the design of symmetric molecules, while studying asymmetric effects based on isomeric systems remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduced isomeric thiophene to regulate the ORR of one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and further adjusted the molecular geometry configuration through asymmetric design, obtaining isomeric COF&#8208;&#945; with 2&#8208;substituents and COF&#8208;&#946; with 3&#8208;substituents. The intermediate adsorption ability and electronic states are precisely adjusted through asymmetric isomers, resulting in controllable chemical activity and excellent catalytic performance. Notably, the introduction of asymmetric thiophene units with 2&#8208;substituents into a pure carbon&#8208;based model provides a more favorable pathway for the hydrogen peroxide production process, resulting in a remarkable productivity of 11.20&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with a Faradaic efficiency of 90.16%. Moreover, theoretical calculations and in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR experiments show that asymmetric thiophene skeletons can induce the activation of adjacent phenyl units, and precisely identify the benzene ring carbon atom (site&#8208;8) connected to the thiophene unit as a potential active site. This study offers an approach to designing efficient electrocatalysts by adjusting asymmetric geometric isomers.

         <title>Competitive Coordination Constructed Heteronuclear Pt1&#8208;Fe1 Dual Single&#8208;Atom Sites for Selective Oxidation of Allylic Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricate heteronuclear Pt1&#8208;Fe1 dual single&#8208;atom on hydroxyapatite via competitive coordination strtegy. Through exploiting periodic Ca2+ vacancies of HAP, high charge&#8208;density Pt4+ ions preferentially occupy these sites, creating charge imbalance that drives adjacent Fe2+ anchoring for compensation. Unexpectedly, Pt1&#8208;Fe1 orbital hybridization induces a spin&#8208;state transition, facilitating O2 activation and following cascade oxidation of allylic alcohol. This yields&#160;ultrahigh aldehyde selectivity (92%) and a high turnover frequency (12&#160;090.8&#160;h&#8722;1), 20&#8208;fold higher than Pt1/HAP single&#8208;atom catalyst. 








Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their exceptional atom efficiency and synergistic catalytic effects. Nevertheless, establishing precise synthetic methodologies for DSACs and exploring its application in complex reaction systems still present significant challenges. Here, we have fabricated a hydroxyapatite (HAP)&#8208;supported heteronuclear Pt1&#8208;Fe1 dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pt1&#8208;Fe1/HAP) via a competitive coordination strategy for selective oxidation of allylic alcohols. Through a thermodynamically driven competitive coordination process, heteronuclear Pt1&#8208;Fe1 with distinct charge densities is co&#8208;anchored within adjacent periodic Ca2+ vacancies of HAP lattice via PO43&#8722; bridges, achieving a controlled atomic separation of &#8764;2.7&#160;&#197; for electronic synergy. Unexpectedly, orbital hybridization between heteronuclear Pt1&#8208;Fe1 induces a spin&#8208;state transition of Fe from low&#8208;spin to medium&#8208;spin, facilitating activation of O2 and following cascade oxidation of allylic alcohol. Benefiting from the modification of spin state, Pt1&#8208;Fe1/HAP exhibits ultrahigh aldehyde selectivity (92%) and a high turnover frequency (12&#160;090.8&#160;h&#8722;1) in oxidation of various allylic alcohol substrates, 20&#8208;fold higher than that of Pt1/HAP single&#8208;atom catalyst (543.8&#160;h&#8722;1). This work establishes the thermodynamically driven competitive coordination strategy as a universal approach for constructing high&#8208;performance heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts with precisely engineered electronic synergy in demanding industrial processes.

         <title>Transient&#8208;Promoter&#8208;Stabilized NiFe Oxyhydroxide Enables Durable kW&#8208;Scale Water Splitting Under Fluctuating Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient&#8208;promoter strategy facilitates the formation, stabilization, and porosity of NiFe oxyhydroxide from its precursor Ni3Fe1.2Cr0.8Ox for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Direct integration with fluctuating power in a kilowatt&#8208;scale 512 cm2 anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) achieves 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.78&#160;V per cell at 60 &#176;C, highlighting a scalable non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal pathway to durable green hydrogen production.








Abstract
Renewable&#8208;powered water electrolysis provides a carbon&#8208;neutral route to hydrogen, yet large&#8208;scale deployment is constrained by reliance on stable but carbon&#8208;intensive grid electricity. Direct integration with fluctuating renewable power requires catalysts and devices that can endure dynamic operating conditions. Here we present a transient&#8208;promoter strategy for NiFe oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, realized from Ni3Fe1.2Cr0.8Ox precursor, for kilowatt&#8208;scale anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Ex situ and operando spectroscopy establish that Cr (i) modulates Ni/Fe oxidation states to enrich positive charge and facilitate oxyhydroxide formation, (ii) induces porosity that enhances electrolyte penetration and OH&#8722; adsorption, and (iii) leaches sacrificially to protect Ni/Fe active sites. Lab&#8208;scale AEMWE device achieves an industrially relevant current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.68&#160;V and sustains continuous operation for over 30 days under both constant and fluctuating loads. Scaling from 1 cm2 AEMWE to an 8&#8208;cell, 512 cm2 stack, the system can handle an electrical power of 2.5&#160;kW at peak, and delivers 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.78&#160;V per cell at 60 &#176;C. The stack remains resilient over 13 simulated solar cycles (&gt;50&#160;h), underscoring the feasibility of integrating renewable electricity with durable, NiFe oxyhydroxide OER catalyst based AEMWEs.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.78&#160;V per cell at 60 &#176;C, highlighting a scalable non-precious-metal pathway to durable green hydrogen production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewable-powered water electrolysis provides a carbon-neutral route to hydrogen, yet large-scale deployment is constrained by reliance on stable but carbon-intensive grid electricity. Direct integration with fluctuating renewable power requires catalysts and devices that can endure dynamic operating conditions. Here we present a transient-promoter strategy for NiFe oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, realized from Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; precursor, for kilowatt-scale anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Ex situ and &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; spectroscopy establish that Cr (i) modulates Ni/Fe oxidation states to enrich positive charge and facilitate oxyhydroxide formation, (ii) induces porosity that enhances electrolyte penetration and OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption, and (iii) leaches sacrificially to protect Ni/Fe active sites. Lab-scale AEMWE device achieves an industrially relevant current density of 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a cell voltage of 1.68&#160;V and sustains continuous operation for over 30 days under both constant and fluctuating loads. Scaling from 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; AEMWE to an 8-cell, 512 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; stack, the system can handle an electrical power of 2.5&#160;kW at peak, and delivers 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.78&#160;V per cell at 60 &#176;C. The stack remains resilient over 13 simulated solar cycles (&amp;gt;50&#160;h), underscoring the feasibility of integrating renewable electricity with durable, NiFe oxyhydroxide OER catalyst based AEMWEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;Aryl Glycosides by a One&#8208;Pot Strategy Involving C&#9472;O Coupling and Catecholborane Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides was realized in high yields and with exclusive &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. The protocol involved the Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling reaction of 1&#8208;iodoglycals and various phenols, followed by in situ reduction of the obtained ketene acetals with catecholborane. Its efficacy was proved by the late&#8208;stage modification of several natural products and drugs.








Abstract
Naturally occurring 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides are an important class of anticancer and antibacterial compounds. The direct glycosylation of phenols inevitably produces 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides, decreasing the efficiency of the synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides. Herein we report a novel one&#8208;pot approach for the synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides by the Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling reaction of 1&#8208;iodoglycals and phenols, followed by in situ reduction of the obtained ketene acetals with catecholborane. Starting from readily available materials, this protocol is applicable to a wide range of substrates, affording the corresponding 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides in high yields and with exclusive &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. This strategy was further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of various bioactive natural products or drugs. The remarkable stereoselectivity was rationalized by the experimental and theoretical studies.

         <title>Reactivity of Low Valent Magnesium(I) Complexes with Epoxides and Episulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8211;H functionalisation and ether cleavage are typically performed by aggressive organolithium reagents. Unveiling the untapped Br&#248;nsted basicity of magnesium&#8208;oxo species, the reaction of Mg(I) precursors with epoxides initially proceeds via deoxygenation, followed by deprotonation and rearrangement of a second epoxide. Episulfides form a bridged chalcogen species initially, but ultimately show divergent reactivity to the disulfide&#8208;bridged product.








Abstract
Chemical C&#8211;H functionalisation is traditionally the domain of potent organolithium bases that require cryogenic conditions, whereas biologically inspired C&#8211;H functionalisation can be executed by transition metal&#8208;oxo species. Blending these chemical and biological approaches, this work exploits magnesium&#8208;oxo complexes for selective C&#8211;H deprotonation at ambient temperature. Overall, three low valent magnesium(I) dimers, [DippNacnacMg]2 1, [DepNacnacMg]2 2 and [MesNacnacMg]2 3, react with two equivalents of propylene oxide to generate dinuclear Mg complexes of general formula [NacnacMg(OH)(OCH2CHCH2)MgNacnac] (Nacnac&#160;=&#160;HC(C(CH3)NAr)2). Isolation of oxo&#8208;bridged [DippNacnacMg&#8208;O&#8208;MgDippNacnac] coupled with deuterium labeling studies shows that the reaction proceeds via epoxide deoxygenation, followed by deprotonation and rearrangement of a second equivalent of the epoxide to generate the alkoxide. A range of terminal and internal epoxides was investigated (propylene oxide, butylene oxide, isobutylene oxide, and cyclohexene oxide). The &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;H position was selectively deprotonated in each case, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Exchanging epoxides for episulfides instead generated disulfide&#8208;bridged species, showcasing the difference in Br&#248;nsted basicity between Mg&#8208;O and Mg&#8208;S functional groups. Overall, this work demonstrates the unharnessed potential of main group metal&#8208;oxo complexes for selective C&#8211;H deprotonation.

         <title>A Zinc Solvation&#8208;Tailored Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;free deep eutectic electrolyte (DES) featuring a unique Zn2+ solvation structure effectively suppresses parasitic reactions and dendrites, enabling high&#8208;efficiency zinc plating/stripping and remarkable full&#8208;cell cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are gaining attention as safe and cost&#8208;effective alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries; however, their performance is fundamentally limited by parasitic reactions such as hydrogen evolution (HER), dendrite growth, and surface passivation, which result from the high reactivity of water. In this study, we report a novel nonhydrated deep eutectic electrolyte (DES), termed OUD&#8208;122, formulated from Zn(OTf)2, urea, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a 1:2:2 molar ratio. In this ternary system, DMSO acts as a coordinating ligand to Zn2+, resulting in a well&#8208;defined solvation structure and an extended hydrogen&#8208;bond network among Zn(OTf)2, urea, and DMSO. This coordination environment effectively suppresses parasitic reactions, prevents byproduct accumulation and electrode corrosion, and significantly expands the electrochemical stability window. As a result, Zn||Zn symmetric cell exhibits exceptional lifespan exceeding 3000&#160;h without short&#8208;circuiting, while Zn||Cu asymmetric cells maintain an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.4% over 400 cycles. Furthermore, Zn||Prussian Blue full cells deliver a discharge capacity of 82.5&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 over 5000 cycles at room temperature and maintain 89.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles at 50&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating robust electrochemical performance and thermal resilience.

         <title>An Organic Sacrificial Salt with Low Decomposition Potential Driven by Substituent Effect Enables High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium N,N&#8208;dimethylglycinate (Li&#8208;DMG) was reported as a sacrificial salt to compensate for the capacity loss in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Through molecular engineering, Li&#8208;DMG achieved a low decomposition potential (3.54&#160;V versus Li+/Li), attributed to the elevated highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (&#8722;7.78&#160;eV). The Li&#8208;DMG&#8208;incorporated LiFePO4||graphite LIB exhibited promoted electrochemical performance than the LIB without Li&#8208;DMG.








Abstract
The irreversible Li+ loss during solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation significantly critically constrains the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). To address this issue, we rationally design lithium N,N&#8208;dimethylglycinate (Li&#8208;DMG) as an organic sacrificial salt (OSS) via substituent effect engineering, achieving a low decomposition potential (3.58&#160;V versus Li&#8314;/Li). Li&#8208;DMG delivers a near&#8208;theoretical capacity (238.2 mAh g&#8722;1, 96% efficiency) during initial charging. Incorporated into LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes, Li&#8208;DMG/LFP||graphite full cells exhibit 17.3% higher initial discharge capacity (114.4&#160;versus 97.5 mAh g&#8722;1) and 43.1% enhanced capacity retention after 200 cycles (67.1&#160;versus 46.9 mAh g&#8722;1) compared to LFP||graphite full cells. Besides, Li&#8208;DMG promotes the formation of SEI layer rich in more inorganic component, e.g., LiF, suppressing the degradation of electrolyte solvents and electrode structures. Furthermore, pouch&#8208;type LIBs containing Li&#8208;DMG demonstrate a prominent enhancement in the specific capacity (114.4&#160;versus 87.1mAh g&#8722;1) and cycle stability (62.0 mAh g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles versus 45.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles). This study provides a promising strategy for improving the energy density and cycle stability of LIBs through the use of OSSs with low decomposition potentials.

&lt;p&gt;Lithium &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylglycinate (Li-DMG) was reported as a sacrificial salt to compensate for the capacity loss in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Through molecular engineering, Li-DMG achieved a low decomposition potential (3.54&#160;V versus Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li), attributed to the elevated highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (&#8722;7.78&#160;eV). The Li-DMG-incorporated LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||graphite LIB exhibited promoted electrochemical performance than the LIB without Li-DMG.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irreversible Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; loss during solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation significantly critically constrains the energy density of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). To address this issue, we rationally design lithium &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylglycinate (Li-DMG) as an organic sacrificial salt (OSS) via substituent effect engineering, achieving a low decomposition potential (3.58&#160;V versus Li&#8314;/Li). Li-DMG delivers a near-theoretical capacity (238.2 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 96% efficiency) during initial charging. Incorporated into LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LFP) cathodes, Li-DMG/LFP||graphite full cells exhibit 17.3% higher initial discharge capacity (114.4&#160;versus 97.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 43.1% enhanced capacity retention after 200 cycles (67.1&#160;versus 46.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to LFP||graphite full cells. Besides, Li-DMG promotes the formation of SEI layer rich in more inorganic component, e.g., LiF, suppressing the degradation of electrolyte solvents and electrode structures. Furthermore, pouch-type LIBs containing Li-DMG demonstrate a prominent enhancement in the specific capacity (114.4&#160;versus 87.1mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and cycle stability (62.0 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 4000 cycles versus 45.4 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 500 cycles). This study provides a promising strategy for improving the energy density and cycle stability of LIBs through the use of OSSs with low decomposition potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Synergistic S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Targeting Dibenzylamine via Cascade Photoredox Catalysis of Benzylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconductor cluster&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction T4&#8208;CdCu/ZIS achieves a record dibenzylamine (DBA) production rate in photocatalytic benzylamine (BA) cascade conversion and enables efficient synthesis of asymmetric secondary amines. This stems from its unique dual tandem mechanism, external BA oxidation and N&#8208;benzylidene benzylamine (BBAD) reduction, promoted by internal efficient charge transfer and favorable redox potentials, along with tight interface and exposed cluster surfaces.








Abstract
Photocatalysis integrates oxidation and reduction processes, offering significant potential for driving synthetic transformations under mild conditions. However, the development of light&#8208;driven redox cascade reactions&#8212;essential for expanding reaction diversity&#8212;remains challenging and unexplored. In this study, a semiconductor cluster&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction, T4&#8208;CdCu/ZIS, is designed for the photocatalytic redox cascade conversion of benzylamine (BA) to dibenzylamine (DBA) under a CO2 atmosphere. The heterojunction operates via a dual internal&#8208;external synergy. Internally, Fermi level&#8208;engineered synergy enhances charge transfer kinetics, enabling rapid carrier separation and suppressed recombination while preserving favorable redox potentials. Externally, this internal synergy drives the tandem oxidation of BA to N&#8208;benzylbenzaldimine (BBAD) and its subsequent reduction to DBA, facilitated by a tight interface and highly exposed clusters. Consequently, exceptional photocatalytic BA conversion is achieved, yielding a record production rate of 8.31&#160;mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with complete DBA selectivity. Mechanistic investigations suggest that BA undergoes dehydrocoupling on oxidative ZIS to form the BBAD intermediate, which then migrates to T4&#8208;CdCu for reduction to DBA via adsorbed H species. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a drug, Cinacalcet, exemplifies the synthesis potential of secondary amines. This work provides a sustainable route for synthesizing secondary amines and inspires the design of advanced heterojunction catalysts for efficient redox cascade reactions.

         <title>Successive Sulfur Oxidation Directs Topological Transformation From 41 Knot to 632$6_3^2$ Link</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, employing S&#8208;center as the molecular trigger, we successfully achieved the transformation from octanuclear&#160;41&#8197;metallic knot to dodecanuclear 632$6_3^2$ metallic links via the stepwise oxidation strategy, which represents an important example of realizing topological structural complexity and also provides the new insights for the design of responsive materials.








Abstract
Achieving transformation between different types of topologies remains a challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, sulfur oxidation was utilized as the stimuli to trigger topological transformations from knots to links. The process began with a thioether&#8208;type precursor, M (41 metallic knot), which was synthesized by self&#8208;assembling the sulfur&#8208;bridged ligand L with building block B in high yield. Following oxidation reactions, we successfully transformed the octanuclear 41 metallic knot (M) with four crossing points into a sulfoxide&#8208;type dodecanuclear 632$6_3^2$ metallic link (M&#8208;O) with six crossing points as an intermediate product, and then to a sulfone&#8208;type dodecanuclear 632$6_3^2$ metallic link (M&#8208;2O) with six crossing points, which achieves a dual leap in both metal nuclearity and crossing complexity. Remarkably, the key to the transformation lies in using the embedded S&#8208;centres of M as molecular triggers and stepwise oxidation (&#8208;S&#8208;&#8594;&#8208;S(O)&#8208;&#8594;&#8208;S(O)2&#8208;) enabled precise modulation of the geometric configuration of the sp3 S&#8208;centres, drastically altering the range of accessible coordination vectors and inducing conformational self&#8208;adaptation among components. This strategy establishes a novel oxidation&#8208;mediated interconversion paradigm among complex topologies, offering new insights for designing dynamic molecular triggers in intelligent material systems.

         <title>Electroactive Chelating Groups Enable High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing electroactive chelating groups can not only increase the proportion of active sites within the electrode, enhancing capacity, but also facilitate the formation of stable zinc&#8208;supramolecular networks, which mitigate the dissolution of electrode materials and suppress the OER, leading to improved cycling stability.








Abstract
P&#8208;type organic electrode materials, characterized by fast kinetics and high redox potential, hold great promise for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but suffer from low capacity and limited cycling stability in practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of electroactive chelating groups can significantly improve both the capacity and cycling stability of p&#8208;type triphenylamine derivative&#8208;based electrodes. The electroactive chelating groups promote a higher proportion of electroactive sites within the cathode material. The combined in/ex situ spectroscopic analysis and theoretical investigations show that electroactive chelating groups facilitate the formation of stable zinc&#8208;supramolecular network, which effectively mitigates the dissolution of electrode materials and the decomposition of the aqueous electrolyte during cycling. The as&#8208;synthesized poly(1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tri(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene) exhibits a high reversible capacity of 311 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and superior rate performance (199 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1) in aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, it demonstrates excellent stability, retaining 83% to 96% of its capacity over 5000 cycles in various aqueous electrolytes, representing a new record for p&#8208;type and bipolar&#8208;type organic electrode materials. This work provides valuable insights into the design of organic electrode materials for high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>How Does the Precursor Influence the Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work points out the irrationality in the current selection of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathode precursor routes in academic research and conducts a comprehensive evaluation of cathodes derived from both carbonate and hydroxide precursors. The results reveal that each route offers distinct advantages and drawbacks, with primary&#8208;particle stacking density (PSD) identified as a key factor influencing structural degradation. Meanwhile, modification strategies are proposed and experimentally validated, providing valuable insights and guidance for future advancements in LRLO cathode development.








Abstract
As a fundamental determinant of Li&#8208;ion battery (LIB) cathode performance and production scalability/feasibility, selection and optimization of precursors represent an essential challenge for the commercialization of layered oxide cathodes. However, for lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathodes, the overwhelming majority of laboratory research has rigidly continued to employ carbonate precursors for further modifications while ignoring the potential of hydroxide precursors, which have been undisputedly utilized as commercial precursors for large&#8208;scale production of nickel&#8211;cobalt&#8211;manganese oxide (NCM) cathodes. This bias toward precursor selection seriously impedes the practical application of the LRLO cathode and largely wastes the resources of lab&#8208;scale scientific research. Herein, through comparative analysis, the structure&#8208;property relationship between carbonate precursor&#8208;derived (CO3&#8208;) and hydroxide precursor&#8208;derived (OH&#8208;) LRLO cathodes was established, elucidating the significance of particle architectural features, especially primary&#8208;particle stacking density (PSD). Specifically, the lower PSD of the CO3&#8208;LRLO cathode facilitates Li&#8314; diffusion by enriching the electrolyte&#8208;infiltrated ionic transport pathway but introduces cracks that reduce the volumetric energy density and interfacial/thermal stability. In contrast, the higher PSD of the OH&#8208;LRLO cathode improves structural integrity by enhancing the covalent environment, layered structure, and particle architecture. Moreover, multiple optimization approaches have been proposed and implemented (e.g., electrolyte engineering, lattice doping, and blending strategies) to mitigate inherent drawbacks derived from various precursors.

However, for lithium-rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathodes, the overwhelming majority of laboratory research has rigidly continued to employ carbonate precursors for further modifications while ignoring the potential of hydroxide precursors, which have been undisputedly utilized as commercial precursors for large-scale production of nickel&#8211;cobalt&#8211;manganese oxide (NCM) cathodes. This bias toward precursor selection seriously impedes the practical application of the LRLO cathode and largely wastes the resources of lab-scale scientific research. Herein, through comparative analysis, the structure-property relationship between carbonate precursor-derived (CO3-) and hydroxide precursor-derived (OH-) LRLO cathodes was established, elucidating the significance of particle architectural features, especially primary-particle stacking density (PSD). Specifically, the lower PSD of the CO3-LRLO cathode facilitates Li&#8314; diffusion by enriching the electrolyte-infiltrated ionic transport pathway but introduces cracks that reduce the volumetric energy density and interfacial/thermal stability. In contrast, the higher PSD of the OH-LRLO cathode improves structural integrity by enhancing the covalent environment, layered structure, and particle architecture. Moreover, multiple optimization approaches have been proposed and implemented (e.g., electrolyte engineering, lattice doping, and blending strategies) to mitigate inherent drawbacks derived from various precursors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Unactivated Alkyl Halides, 1,3&#8208;Enynes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni0&#8208;triggered cascade process from simple alkyl halides and 1,3&#8208;enynes, via radical generation, addition, radical&#8211;NiI recombination and isomerization, yields nucleophilic allenylnickel(I) intermediates after in situ reduction with Mn, which can attack aldehydes to afford chiral homopropargylic alcohols in good yields with high stereoselectivity in the presence of PhCO2H.








Abstract
The &#960;&#8208;propargylnickel(II) complexes, or their resonances, the &#951;1&#8208;allenylnickel(II) ones, are typically generated from propargylic derivatives under Ni0 catalysis, and act as versatile electrophilic partners in diverse transformations. Here, we demonstrate that &#951;1&#8208;propargylnickel(II) species can alternatively be generated from unactivated alkyl halides and 1,3&#8208;enynes via a Ni0&#8208;mediated radical alkylation of the alkene. Subsequent isomerization to &#951;1&#8208;allenylnickel(II), followed by reduction, affords &#951;1&#8208;allenylnickel(I) intermediates, which serve as reliable nucleophilic species for the stereoselective addition to aldehydes in the presence of benzoic acid. This protocol features broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and nickel plays multiple roles in accomplishing a complicated Ni0/NiI/NiII/NiI/Ni0 catalytic cycle. A wide range of chiral homopropargylic alcohols, even the ones having a medium&#8208;sized ring, are modularly furnished in fair to good yields with moderate to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. A series of control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to illuminate the catalytic pathways and the origin of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Binary&#8208;Doped Narrowband Blue OLEDs Enabled by a Single&#8208;Component Host Matrix with a Spatial Bipolarity Configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of constructing the spatial bipolarity hosts is proposed by connecting boron&#8211;oxygen and carbazole&#8208;derived groups with a silyl linker. The binary&#8208;doped narrowband blue devices feature an emission peak at 472&#160;nm, maximum external quantum efficiency of 42.3% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off, and an operational half&#8208;lifetime of 3076&#160;h.








Abstract
Highly efficient and stable narrowband blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are vital for high&#8208;definition displays, yet the achievement of such devices via a concise binary&#8208;doped fabrication architecture remains challenging. Herein, an effective and robust single&#8208;component host matrix with a spatial bipolarity configuration is developed for high&#8208;performance OLEDs. Two elaborately designed molecules are constructed on a non&#8208;conjugated silyl linker connecting boron&#8211;oxygen and carbazole&#8208;derived groups. The boron&#8211;oxygen electron&#8208;accepting and carbazole&#8208;based electron&#8208;donating moieties exhibit synergistic and complementary group functions, achieving wide bandgaps of excited energy states, along with thermally activated delayed fluorescence and bipolar carrier transport features. Following the incorporation of a blue multiresonant guest emitter, the doped emissive film showcases enhanced horizontal orientation and photoluminescent efficiency. The binary&#8208;doped narrowband blue OLEDs achieve the record maximum external quantum efficiency of 42.3% with low roll&#8208;off (efficiency of 38.3% at 1,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2), and the improved operational stability with a half&#8208;lifetime of 3076&#160;h at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2. This study reveals that the utilization of a spatial bipolarity host matrix is a promising approach to realize narrowband blue OLEDs with concise architecture and high performance.

         <title>Iridium Porphyrin&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Rearrangement of Oxindoles with Aryl Diazoesters: Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Tertiary 2&#8208;Indolyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored &#946;&#8208;aryl axially chiral iridium porphyrin catalyzes the site&#8208;selective asymmetric rearrangement of oxindoles with aryl diazoesters, bypassing the inherent C3 nucleophilicity of oxindoles. Through enantioselective carbonyl ylide formation, epoxidation, and rearrangement, this approach delivers diverse chiral tertiary 2&#8208;indolyl alcohols in up to 99% yield and 93% ee.








Abstract
The asymmetric functionalization of indoles at the C2 position to afford chiral tertiary alcohols poses a formidable challenge in organic synthesis, primarily due to the inherent preference for C3 reactivity. Herein, we report the asymmetric generation and transformation of carbonyl ylides from oxindoles using a &#946;&#8208;aryl axially chiral iridium porphyrin complex. This system enables a highly site&#8208;selective and enantioselective reaction between oxindoles and aryl diazoesters, involving enantioselective carbonyl ylide formation, tandem epoxidation, and rearrangement. The process efficiently provides a series of chiral tertiary 2&#8208;indolyl alcohols that are difficult to access via direct Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indoles.

         <title>Activate 1&#8208;TM Channel of Disordered Rock Salts via Electrostatic Repulsion Regulation for Enhanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although cation&#8208;disordered rock&#8208;salt (DRX) cathodes show great potential for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, their practical application has been hindered by sluggish Li+ transport kinetics, as Li+ migration is typically confined to 0&#8208;transition&#8208;metal (0&#8208;TM) channels. In this work, we propose a dual&#8208;functional electrostatic repulsion regulation strategy to activate 1&#8208;TM Li+ transport channels, thereby constructing kinetically favorable long&#8208;range Li&#8314; diffusion pathways.








Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered rock&#8208;salt (DRX) has emerged as a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, its practical deployment is hindered by intrinsic Li+ diffusion mechanism, where only 0&#8208;transition metal (0&#8208;TM) channels permit feasible Li&#8314; migration while 1&#8208;TM and 2/3/4&#8208;TM channels exhibit prohibitively high Li+ diffusion energy barriers. Here, we leverage electrostatic repulsion regulation to activate the 1&#8208;TM channel, which holds the highest potential for activation while constrained by restrictive tetrahedral site geometries, thereby introducing more Li+ diffusion pathways and establishing a well&#8208;connected percolating 3D Li+ diffusion network within the DRX lattice to fundamentally addressing the kinetic limitations of DRX. Systematic investigations reveal that in the optimized sample, the tetrahedral height of 1&#8208;TM channels increased significantly from 2.525 to 2.613 &#197;, concomitant with a volumetric expansion from 3.254 to 4.010 &#197;3, along with the Li+ migration energy barrier significantly reduced from 1.48 to 0.26 eV. The enhanced Li+ transport kinetics yield enhanced capacity (306 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 mA g&#8722;1), alongside superior rate capability (&#8764;200 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 mA g&#8722;1). This work establishes a material design paradigm overcome transport bottlenecks in disordered cathode architectures.

         <title>DNA Glass: Encasing Diffraction&#8208;Quality, Mesoporous DNA Crystals in Architected Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling DNA crystals are used as a substrate to form ultrathin mesoporous silica composites using sol&#8211;gel chemistry; and X&#8208;ray crystallography allows for the recovery of the molecular structure of the underlying DNA lattice. These hybrid crystals are shown to be robust to a variety of physical and chemical stressors, amenable to dye soaking, and capable of templating the site&#8208;specific nucleation of silver nanoclusters. 








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling DNA crystals have emerged over the last two decades as an efficient and effective means of organizing matter at the nanoscale, but functionalization of these lattices has proved challenging as physiological buffer conditions are required to maintain structural integrity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the silicification of mesoporous DNA crystals using sol&#8211;gel chemistry. We identify reaction conditions that produce the minimum coating thickness to confer environmental protection, and we subsequently measure this protective ability to various stressors, including heat, low ionic strength solution, organic solvents, and unprotected freezing. By soaking metal ions and dyes into the lattice after silica coating, we demonstrate that the crystals maintain their pores and that the major groove of the DNA can still be used as a sequence&#8208;specific template for chemical reactions. We image a library of different crystal motifs by electron microscopy, and we perform X&#8208;ray diffraction on these crystals, both with and without cryoprotection, to determine the structure of the DNA frame, underscoring the conserved molecular order after coating. We anticipate these mesoporous silica composites will find use in applications involving extreme, nonphysiological conditions and in experiments which utilize the DNA glass described here as a template for chemical reactions on the internal surface of architected materials.

         <title>Topochemical Alkyne Nitrile Oxide Cycloaddition for Polymer Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding the toolkit for solid&#8208;state polymer synthesis, we report the first example of a topochemical alkyne nitrile oxide cycloaddition (TANOC), a spontaneous and regiospecific [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition that directly converts a monomer, containing alkyne and nitrile&#8208;oxide at its termini, to an isoxazole&#8208;linked polymer in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion at room temperature.








Abstract
Topochemical reactions, characterized by their solvent&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free, and lattice&#8208;controlled nature, offer an attractive method for crystalline polymers. The limited number of reactions amenable to solid&#8208;state execution necessitates a continued pursuit of novel topochemical transformations. Here, we report the first example of a topochemical alkyne nitrile oxide cycloaddition (TANOC) reaction, a spontaneous and regiospecific [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition that directly converts a monomer to an isoxazole&#8208;linked polymer in a SCSC fashion at room temperature. We overcome the inherent reactivity of nitrile oxides through strategic steric protection, enabling the design of a stable monomer amenable to crystallization. Detailed structural analysis of both monomer and polymer by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, coupled with comprehensive spectroscopic and kinetic studies, confirms the formation of an isoxazole&#8208;backbone polymer. Notably, despite an initially unfavorable monomer packing, significant voids within the crystal lattice facilitate a &#8764;118&#176; rotation of the propargyl unit, achieving the precise geometry for spontaneous reaction. This unprecedented thermal topochemical transformation expands the toolkit for solid&#8208;state polymer synthesis, offering a versatile platform for constructing functional materials where the isoxazole linkages can be readily transformed into diverse functionalities.

         <title>Precise Regulation of Zn, S Dual Vacancies in Zn3In2S6 Inducing Local Orientated Electrical Field for Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatial confinement strategy combining cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) embedding and H2 annealing was presented to precisely regulate Zn and S vacancies in Zn3In2S6 for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The optimal VZn:VS ratio of 1.0:1.9 can generate a robust local orientated electrical field (LOEF). It achieves a remarkable H2O2 production rate of 11580.74&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 through oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) pathways.








Abstract
Photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis attracts interest for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion but suffers from low carrier utilization and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we present a confinement strategy to precisely regulate Zn and S vacancies (VZn, VS) in Zn3In2S6 for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. ZnSO4, InCl3, thioacetamide, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were utilized to synthesize Zn3In2S6 via a hydrothermal process, in which CTAB inserts into anionic layers and forms covalent bonds with Zn2+ ions, then pyrolyzes and removes Zn2+ ions during the annealing process, inducing VZn formation. H2&#8208;mediated desulfurization generates VS. The contents of VZn and VS in Zn3In2S6 of 1.9:1.0, 1.1:1.0, 1.0:1.9, and 1.0:3.3 were obtained by adjusting the temperature. VS&amp;VZn&#8208;Zn3In2S6 (1.0:1.9) exhibits a fantastic photocatalytic generation rate of 11580.74&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for H2O2 which increased 2.4 times compared with VS&#8208;Zn3In2S6, attributing to that dual vacancies promote the local orientated electrical field (LOEF) formation and increase photogenerated&#8208;electron transfer from VS to VZn. Electrons delocalize onto adjacent Zn sites, promoting the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. Simultaneously, VZn facilitates the migration of h&#8314; to the catalyst surface, thereby increasing h&#8314; utilization efficiency and accelerating the water oxidation reaction (WOR) process toward H2O2 production. VS&amp;VCu&#8208;CuIn2S4 and VS&amp;VNi&#8208;NiIn2S4 were successfully synthesized, highlighting its broad applicability as a general approach.

         <title>Chiral Boron&#8211;Formazanates as a Multifunctional NIR Chiroptical Platform: Modular Synthesis, Photothermal Conversion, and Reversible Acid&#8211;Base Chiroptical Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular synthesis of two classes of chiral boron&#8211;formazanates affords enantiopure NIR chiroptical platforms without chiral resolution. Selected members display aggregation&#8208;induced emission, high photothermal conversion enabling red&#8208;light polymerization, and fully reversible acid&#8211;base CD switching, offering a versatile framework for next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;responsive chiral materials.








Abstract
Chiral organic materials with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) optical activity are highly sought after for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications but remain rare. Here, we report two complementary types of chiral boron&#8211;formazanates: 1) mono&#8208;formazanates bearing 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;derived chiral ligands at boron, and 2) bis&#8208;formazanates with embedded chiral backbones, both prepared in enantiopure form (ee&#160;&gt;&#160;95%) via modular synthetic routes without chiral resolution. To our knowledge, these represent the first reported examples of optically pure formazanates. This enables direct evaluation of their intrinsic optical and chiroptical properties, which include broadband NIR circular dichroism (CD) activity and, in selected cases, NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), NIR circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity beyond 800&#160;nm, and fully reversible acid&#8211;base chiroptical switching. Mono&#8208;formazanates show high light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion and serve as efficient photothermal catalysts for red&#8208;light&#8208;mediated polymerization, while bis&#8208;formazanates exhibit amplified chiroptical responses via exciton&#8208;like coupling. TD&#8208;DFT calculations unveiled the mechanistic aspects of broadband Cotton effects in mono&#8208;formazanates, exciton&#8208;like coupling in bis&#8208;formazanates, and protonation&#8208;induced inversion of chiroptical signals. This work establishes chiral formazanates as a versatile molecular platform for next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;active chiroptical materials with potential utility in bioimaging, sensing, photothermal therapy, and responsive chiroptical devices.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Spin&#8208;Orbit Modulated Carbon&#8208;Encapsulated FeP/Fe3O4 Heterojunctions for Ultrafast and Stable Conversion of Low&#8208;Concentration Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;encapsulated FeP/Fe3O4 heterojunction utilizes interface&#8208;driven spin&#8208;orbit orientation to induce the transition from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin, elevate Fe 3d energy level, and promote electron migration from FeP to Fe3O4. The reconfigured state optimizes the N&#8208;O intermediate binding and H* overflow, enabling ultrafast NH3 synthesis from dilute NO3&#8722;. The carbon shell alleviates phosphate poisoning, ensuring robustness in complex wastewater.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction offers an effective route for ammonia synthesis and actual wastewater treatment. Despite some important achievements, the progress is still low than expected, especially in low&#8208;concentration nitrate, mostly because of slow hydrogenation kinetics and interfering substances. In this work, we presented that, by engineering spin orbital orientation, a carbon&#8208;encapsulated FeP/Fe3O4 heterojunctions (FeP/Fe3O4@C) enabled ultrafast and stable NH3 electrosynthesis from low&#8208;concentration nitrate. In&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculation confirmed that FeP/Fe3O4 heterojunctions induced spin orbit splitting of Fe, resulting in electron transition from low spin to high spin. The resulted non&#8208;degenerate orbitals caused the energy levels shift up and guided the electron migration from FeP to Fe3O4, which thus activated additional 3d orbital electron states. This spin orbital orientation further optimized the chemisorption properties of nitrogen&#8208;oxygen intermediates and H* spillover, thus accelerating hydrogenation kinetics for ultrafast NH3 electrosynthesis. Meanwhile, FeP/Fe3O4@C electrocatalyst alleviated the phosphate poisoning of active metal sites during industrial wastewater treatment, demonstrating excellent anti&#8208;interference capability and environmental sustainability for real application. This work by modulating the &#8220;charge&#8208;spin&#8208;orbit&#8221; structure of active sites provided a new strategy for rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for various electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Electron Carbon&#8211;Halide Bond Activation at a Phosphorus Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenaphosphanorcaradiene complex enables phosphorus&#8208;centered C&#9472;X bond activation through four distinct pathways: SN2 and SNAr substitutions, E2 elimination, and radical C&#9472;C coupling. By mimicking transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like one&#8208;electron (1e) and two&#8208;electron (2e) processes, this platform provides both mechanistic insight into phosphorus redox chemistry and a modular route to trisubstituted phosphines.








Abstract
The activation of small molecules by main&#8208;group elements has garnered significant attention as a potential alternative to transition metal catalysis. While transition metals excel in switching between single&#8208;electron (1e) and two&#8208;electron (2e) pathways due to their accessible d&#8208;orbitals, such switchability remains uncommon for main&#8208;group elements. In this work, we report the phosphorus&#8208;centered selective activation of various organohalides by phosphorus&#8208;atom transfer reaction of metallophosphanorcaradiene complex, which presents four distinct modes, SN2 or SNAr&#8208;type substitution, E2 elimination, or reductive radical coupling via halogen&#8208;atom transfer. These reactivities selectively show 1e or 2e pathways depending on the substrate, mimicking oxidative addition and radical activation steps traditionally reserved for transition metals. These divergent modes of reactivity are enabled by the substantial orbital interactions between the single phosphorus atom center and [Cp*(Idipp)(CO)Ru] fragment, which can be viewed as a metalloligand, allowing for switchable reactivities between 2e and 1e pathways. Furthermore, this platform enables the modular synthesis of phosphines bearing three different substituents through a &#8220;P&#160;+&#160;2E&#160;+&#160;Nu&#8221; strategy, establishing a new phosphorus&#8208;atom transfer route to organophosphorus molecules (E&#160;=&#160;electrophile; Nu&#160;=&#160;nucleophile).

         <title>Chlorinated&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Safe and Stable Lithium Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a chlorinated&#8208;solvent&#8208;base electrolyte (CSE) composed of a chlorinated ether and a chlorinated carbonate to develope the efficiently fire&#8208;retardant electrolyte even with lithiated anodes. The LiCl and LiF enriched SEI helpt the graphite|CSE|LFP full cells exhibit an extended cyclability over 1000 cycles, and decreased the byproducts formation and gas evolution compared with cells using traditional carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte.








Abstract
The current lithium battery technology is greatly limited by safety concerns. Fluorinated and organophosphorus solvents can reduce the electrolyte flammability. However, these solvents are not fire&#8208;retardant efficiently for lithiated anodes. Here, for the first time, we report an all&#8208;chlorinated&#8208;solvent design strategy to enable electrolytes with durability, non&#8208;flammability and fire&#8208;proof. We demonstrate that the premature battery failure in chlorinated ether electrolytes is mainly caused by the low anode compatibility and aluminum current collector corrosion originating from the dissolution of LiCl&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, which can be efficiently overcome by interphase regulation via film&#8208;forming chlorinated carbonate and promoted anion reduction. These insights were applied to graphite||LiFePO4 full cells, which presented high capacity retention together with promising safety assurance under thermal, electrical and mechanical abuse conditions, outperforming traditional electrolytes. We also applied the as&#8208;developed fire&#8208;proof electrolytes to 4.4&#160;V high&#8208;loading Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells and attained durable cycling features without current collector corrosion. This work provides the design criteria for developing fire&#8208;retardant electrolytes for highly safe lithium batteries.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Orientation of Multi&#8208;Site Ligand Enables Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells with Voltage Exceeding 2&#160;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We concurrently suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination and enhance electron transfer at the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite/C60 interface via a planar triple&#8208;site molecule, 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;chlorobenzenesulfonic acid. It preferentially adopts a parallel adsorption orientation, thus reducing the resistance barrier and enhancing electron transfer. Consequently, the perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell achieved an open&#8208;circuit voltage exceeding 2&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency of 31.42%.








Abstract
Rational molecular design at the perovskite/charge transport layer interface offers an effective approach for suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSC). However, the design involves a tradeoff between defect passivation and charge transport, as multi&#8208;site passivation molecules always introduce a resistive barrier. Herein, we employ a triple&#8208;site planar molecule, 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;chlorobenzenesulfonic acid (3A4Cl&#8208;BZS), as a multifunctional modifier that can concurrently suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination and enhance electron transfer. Specifically, functionalizing the benzene ring with sulfonic acid (&#8208;SO3H) and amino (&#8208;NH2) groups enhances the passivation of undercoordinated Pb2+ and I&#8722; defects via coordination and hydrogen bonding, respectively, and incorporating a chlorine group promotes the parallel adsorption on the perovskite surface. The parallel configuration, rather than vertical orientation, minimizes the distance between the active site and the perovskite defects, significantly boosting passivation efficacy and mitigating the resistive barrier. Consequently, 1.67&#160;eV bandgap perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.55%. Furthermore, integrating this cell into perovskite/silicon TSC yields a high voltage of over 2 volts and a PCE of 31.42% adopting a planar silicon sub&#8208;cell. Remarkably, encapsulated tandem devices retain over 80% of their initial PCE after 1960 h of maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 25 &#176;C.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Mg&#8211;Pt Intermetallic Hydrogenation Catalysts for CO Poisoning Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy to mitigate CO poisoning by designing electron&#8208;rich single Pt sites through phase control of Mg&#8211;Pt intermetallics. By adjusting the crystallinity of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on Mg, we synthesized both Mg29Pt4 and Mg3Pt. The obtained Mg29Pt4 exhibits superior performance in quinoline hydrogenation with high CO tolerance, attributed to its electron&#8208;rich Pt sites and lower d&#8208;band center.








Abstract
Platinum group metals (PGMs) are efficient catalysts for industrial hydrogenation reactions but are extremely sensitive to CO (ppm levels), making the direct utilization of industrial crude hydrogen containing CO infeasible. Herein, we report the phase engineering of Mg&#8211;Pt intermetallic catalysts achieved through the precise control of reactive metal&#8211;support interactions (RMSIs) between Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Mg supports. By manipulating Pt crystallinity, we synthesized two distinct phases, Mg29Pt4 and Mg3Pt. In the presence of CO, Mg29Pt4 demonstrates remarkable activity for selective hydrogenation reactions, contrasting sharply with the almost complete deactivation of metallic Pt. Notably, Mg29Pt4 retains &#8764;88% of its original activity when exposed to 0.2 vol% CO, a typical industrial crude hydrogen concentration, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;Pt catalysts. This superior CO tolerance arises from its electron&#8208;rich Pt sites and low d&#8208;band center, which suppress electron donation from CO 5&#963; orbitals to Pt 5d orbitals while hindering electron back&#8208;donation from Pt d orbitals to CO 2&#960;* antibonding orbitals. Moreover, Mg29Pt4 also facilitates the hydrogenation of diverse functional groups, including alkynes, aldehydes, and nitroarenes, while maintaining excellent CO tolerance. This work demonstrates that manipulating the electronic properties of Pt single&#8208;atom sites can alter CO adsorption behavior, enabling the design of efficient Pt catalysts for anti&#8208;CO poisoning.

         <title>A Universal Principle of Lithium Bond Characteristics in Lithium Battery Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination number of four serves as a universal boundary between lithium bonds and ionic bonds. The electrolyte components determine the proportion and duration of lithium bonds, and 7Li NMR response by affecting the environment around lithium.








Abstract
Understanding the interactions between lithium (Li) and coordinated compounds is fundamental to elucidating the working mechanisms of Li batteries and informing the design principles of emerging battery materials. Li bonds, analogous to hydrogen bonds, play a central role in these interactions. However, the characteristics of Li bonds in working Li batteries are not fully explored due to the complexity of battery systems, hindering the advancement of Li bond theory in working batteries. In this work, a universal principle of Li bonds is established by combining theoretical calculations and machine learning techniques. Using organic electrolytes as modeling systems, the universal existence of Li bonds was first verified, particularly under high&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration conditions. A distinct characteristic of a coordination number of four was also demonstrated, distinguishing Li bonds from ionic bonds, consistent with electron localization region deviations around Li&#8208;ions. The influence of electrolyte components on Li bond characteristics was further revealed by 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, and an ensemble machine learning model was constructed that quantitatively predicts 7Li NMR chemical shifts with high accuracy. This work establishes a universal principle of Li bond characteristics in batteries, advancing fundamental Li chemistry, and guiding rational design for next&#8208;generation Li batteries.
