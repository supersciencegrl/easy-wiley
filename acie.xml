         <title>meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyridine moiety is an important core structure for a variety of drugs, agrochemicals, catalysts, and functional materials. Direct functionalization of C&#8211;H bonds in pyridines is a straightforward approach to access valuable substituted pyridines. Compared to the direct ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization, meta&#8208;selective pyridine C&#8211;H functionalization is far more challenging due to the inherent electronic properties of the pyridine entity. This review summarizes currently available methods for pyridine meta&#8208;C&#8211;H functionalization using a directing group, non&#8208;directed metalation, and temporary dearomatization strategies. Recent advances in ligand control and temporary dearomatization are highlighted. We analyze the advantages as well as limitations of current techniques and hope to inspire further developments in this important area.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strong&#8208;Acid&#8208;Resistant [Th6] Cluster&#8208;Based Framework for Effectively and Size&#8208;Selectively Catalyzing Reductive Amination of Aldehydes with N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide (DMF) as amine source and reductant for synthesizing tertiary amines is a promising way to replace the substrates of formaldehyde and dimethylamine, and it is desirable to seek porous acid&#8208;resistant catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis of this reaction. Herein, a robust metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) {[Th6O4(OH)4(H2O)6(BCP)3]&#183;10DMF} n  (1) containing stacked nanocages with a diameter of 1.55 nm was constructed. Compound 1 can maintain single&#8208;crystal structure even kept in air at 400 &#176;C for 3 h, in DMF or water at 200 &#176;C for 7 days, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the high interaction energy between the [Th6O4(OH)4(H2O)6]12+ clusters and ligands was responsible for the excellent stability of 1. Catalytic investigations revealed that 1 can effectively and size&#8208;selectively catalyze the reductive amination of aldehydes with DMF, and it can be reused at least five times without obvious loss in catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Co0&#8208;Co&#948;+ Interface Double&#8208;Site&#8208;Mediated C&#8211;C Coupling for the Photothermal Conversion of CO2 into Light Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2 hydrogenation into multi&#8208;carbon products is a highly desirable, but challenging reaction. The bottleneck of this reaction lies in the C&#8211;C coupling of C1 intermediates. Herein, we construct the C&#8211;C coupling centre for C1 intermediates via the in situ formation of Co0&#8208;Co&#948;+ interface double sites on MgAl2O4 (Co&#8208;CoOx/MAO). Our experimental and theoretical prediction results confirmed the effective adsorption and activation of CO2 by the Co0 site to produce C1 intermediates, while the introduction of the electron&#8208;deficient state of Co&#948;+ can effectively reduce the energy barrier of the key CHCH* intermediates. Consequently, Co&#8208;CoOx/MAO exhibited a high C2&#8211;4 hydrocarbons production rate of 1303 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1; the total organic carbon selectivity of C2&#8211;4 hydrocarbons is 62.5% under light irradiation with a high ratio (~11) of olefin to paraffin. This study provides a new approach toward the design of photocatalysts used for CO2 conversion into C2+ products.</dc:description>

         <title>Glass Formation in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline materials have governed the development of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), giving rise to a variety of fascinating applications such as solar cells and optoelectronic devices. With increasing interest in non&#8208;crystalline systems, the glassy state of HOIPs has recently been identified. Here, the basic building blocks of crystalline HOIPs appear to be retained, though their glasses lack long&#8208;range periodic order. The emerging family of glasses formed from HOIPs exhibits diverse properties, complementary to their crystalline state. This mini review describes the chemical diversity of both three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional crystalline HOIPs and demonstrates how glasses are produced from these materials. Specifically, current achievements in melt&#8208;quenched glasses formed from HOIPs are highlighted. We conclude with our perspective on the future of this new family of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of the Hydrophobic Behaviour of Hydrophilic CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nature of the hydrophobicity found in rare&#8208;earth oxides is intriguing. The CeO2(100) surface, despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. In order to understand this puzzling and counter&#8208;intuitive effect we performed a detailed analysis of the water structure and dynamics. We report here an ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulation (AIMD) study which demonstrates that the first water layer, in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO2 surface, is responsible for the effect behaving as a hydrophobic interface with respect to the rest of the liquid water.
The hydrophobicity is manifested in several ways:a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water at the same thermodynamic condition, a weak adhesion energy and few H&#8208;bonds above the hydrophobic water layer, which may also sustain a water droplet. These findings introduce a new concept in water/rare&#8208;earth oxide interfaces: hydrophobicity mediated by specific water patterns on a hydrophilic surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstruction of Solid Electrolyte Interphase with SrI2 &#160;Reactivates Dead Li for Durable Anode&#8208;Free Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Without excess Li, anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal batteries (AFLMBs) have been proposed as the most likely solution to realizing highly&#8208;safe and cost&#8208;effective&#160;Li&#8208;metal batteries. Nevertheless, short cyclic life&#160;puzzles conventional AFLMBs&#160;due to&#160;anodic&#160;dead Li accumulation with a local current concentration induced by&#160;irreversible electrolyte depletion, insufficient active Li reservoir and slow Li+&#160;transfer at the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, SrI2&#160;is introduced&#160;into carbon paper (CP) current collector to effectively suppress dead Li&#160;through synergistic mechanisms including reversible I&#8208;/I3&#8208;&#160;redox reaction to reactivate dead Li, dielectric&#160;SEI surface&#160;with SrF2&#160;and LiF to&#160;prevent electrolyte decomposition and highly&#160;ionic conductive&#160;(3.488 mS cm&#8208;1) inner layer of SEI with abundant&#160;LiI to enable efficient Li+&#160;transfer inside.&#160;With the SrI2&#8208;modified current collector, the NCM532/CP cell delivers unprecedented cyclic performances with a capacity of 129.2 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;after 200 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Dicarboxylation of Unactivated Skipped Dienes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylation of easily available alkenes with CO2 is highly important to afford value&#8208;added carboxylic acids. Although dicarboxylation of activated alkenes, especially 1,3&#8208;dienes, has been widely investigated, the challenging dicarboxylation of unactivated 1,n&#8208;dienes (n&gt;3) with CO2 remains unexplored. Herein, we report the first dicarboxylation of unactivated skipped dienes with CO2 via electrochemistry, affording valuable dicarboxylic acids. Control experiments and DFT calculations support the single electron transfer (SET) reduction of CO2 to its radical anion, which is followed by sluggish radical addition to unactivated alkenes, SET reduction of unstabilized alkyl radicals to carbanions and nucleophilic attack on CO2 to give desired products. This reaction features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, facile derivations of products and promising application in polymer chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Current Capable and Non&#8208;Flammable Protic Organic Electrolyte for Rechargeable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable Zinc batteries (RZBs) are considered a potent competitor for next&#8208;generation electrochemical devices, due to their multiple advantages. Nevertheless, traditional aqueous electrolytes may cause serious hazards to long&#8208;term battery cycling through fast capacity fading and poor Coulombic efficiency (CE), which happens due to complex reaction kinetics in aqueous systems. Herein, we proposed the novel adoption of the protic amide solvent, N&#8208;methyl formamide (NMF) as a Zinc battery electrolyte, which possesses a high dielectric constant and high flash point to promote fast kinetics and battery safety simultaneously. Dendrite&#8208;free and granular Zn deposition in Zn&#8208;NMF electrolyte assures ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 2000 h at 2.0 mA cm&#8208;2/2.0 mAh cm&#8208;2, high CE of 99.57 %, wide electrochemical window (~3.43 V vs. Zn2+/Zn), and outstanding durability up to 10.0 mAh cm&#8208;2. This work sheds light on the efficient performance of the protic non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte, which will open new opportunities to promote safe and energy&#8208;dense RZBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of ion&#8208;selective membranes is the key towards efficient reverse electrodialysis&#8208;based osmotic power conversion. The tradeoff between ion selectivity (output voltage) and ion permeability (output current) in existing porous membranes, however, limits the upgradation of power generation efficiency for practical applications. Thus, we provide the simple guidelines based on fundamentals of ion transport in nanofluidics for promoting osmotic power conversion. In addition, we discuss strategies for optimizing membrane performance through analysis of various material parameters in membrane design, such as pore size, surface charge, pore density, membrane thickness, ion pathway, pore order, and ionic diode effect. Lastly, a perspective on the future directions of membrane design to further maximize the efficiency of osmotic power conversion is outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Sonodynamic Activity of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Nanodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two inactive monomers incapable of generating singlet oxygen under ultrasound (US) irradiation were utilized for the reticular synthesis of a backbone&#8208;active covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer (TPE&#8208;NN) with intrinsic sonodynamic activity. With Cu ions coordination, the fabricated TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu is demonstrated to exhibit a bilaterally enhanced nanodynamic feature of Cu ion&#8208;augmented sonodynamic activity and US&#8208;amplified chemodynamic catalytic efficacy.







Abstract
The development of covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizers with intrinsic sonodynamic effects is highly desirable. However, such COFs are generally constructed using small&#8208;molecule photosensitizers. Herein, we report that the reticular chemistry&#8208;based synthesis of COFs from two inert monomers yields a COF&#8208;based sonosensitizer (TPE&#8208;NN) with inherent sonodynamic activity. Subsequently, a nanoscale COF TPE&#8208;NN is fabricated and embedded with copper (Cu)&#8208;coordinated sites to obtain TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Results show that Cu coordination can enhance the sonodynamic effect of TPE&#8208;NN, whereas ultrasound (US) irradiation for sonodynamic therapy can augment the chemodynamic efficacy of TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Consequently, TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu upon US irradiation shows high&#8208;performance anticancer effects based on mutually reinforced sono&#8208;/chemo&#8208;nanodynamic therapy. This study reveals the backbone&#8208;originated sonodynamic activity of COFs and proposes a paradigm of intrinsic COF sonosensitizers for nanodynamic therapy.

         <title>Low Bandgap 2D Perovskite Single Crystal with Anomalous&#8208;large Charges/ions Collection Ratio for Ultra&#8208;sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention due to their improved moisture stability, reduced defects, and suppressed ions migration in many optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, X&#8208;ray detectors, and so on. However, they are still limited by their large bandgap and short charge carriers&#8217; diffusion length. Here, we demonstrate that the introduction of metal ions into organic interlayers of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite by cross&#8208;linking the copper paddle&#8208;wheel cluster&#8208;based lead bromide ([Cu(O2C&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;NH3)2]PbBr4) perovskite single crystals with coordination bonds can not only significantly reduce the perovskite bandgap to 0.96 eV to boost the X&#8208;ray induced charge carriers, but can also selectively improve the charge carriers&#8217; transport along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction by shortening its interlayer spacing of 8.1% and blocking the ions motion paths. The [Cu(O2C&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;NH3)2]PbBr4&#160;single&#8208;crystal device can reach a record charges/ions collection ratio of 1.76 &#215; 1018&#160;&#956;Gyair&#8208;1&#160;s, and exhibit a large sensitivity of 1.18 &#215; 105&#160;&#956;C Gy&#8208;1air&#160;cm&#8208;2&#160;with the lowest detectable dose rate of 56 nGyair&#160;s&#8208;1&#160;under 120 keV X&#8208;rays irradiation. In addition, [Cu(O2C&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;NH3)2]PbBr4&#160;single&#8208;crystal detector exposed to the air without any encapsulation shows excellent X&#8208;ray imaging capability with long&#8208;term operational stability without any attenuation of 120 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Transmission Channels Promoting Charge Separation of Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Controllable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers (CPs) represents a promising platform for photocatalytic CO2 fixation owing to their suitable band structures that meet the requirements of the reduction potential of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels. However, the photocatalytic performance of CPs is rather restrained by the low charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we rationally designed three CPs with a more delocalized electronic transmission channel and planar molecular structure, which are regarded to evidently reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) and accelerate the internal charge transfer process. Besides, the assembly of suitable electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; and cocatalysts on the surface of CPs could effectively facilitate interfacial electron delivery. Accordingly, the optimal P&#8208;2CN exhibits an apparent quantum yield of 4.6% at 420 nm for photocatalytic CO2 to CO. Further adjusting the amounts of cyano groups and cocatalysts, the CO selectivity could be obtained in the range of 0&#8208;80.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong, Supertough and Self&#8208;Healing Biomimetic Layered Nanocomposites Enabled by Reversible&#160;Interfacial Polymer Chain Sliding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable progress in ultrastrong mechanical laminate materials, the simultaneous achievement of toughness, stretchability and self&#8208;healing properties in biomimetic layered nanocomposites remains a great challenge due to the intrinsic limitations of their hard essences and lack of effective stress transfer at the organic&#8208;inorganic fragile boundary. Here, an ultratough nanocomposite laminate is prepared by constructing chain&#8208;sliding cross&#8208;linking at the interface between sulfonated graphene nanosheets and polyurethane layers based on the ring molecules sliding on the linear polymer chains to release stresses. Unlike traditional supramolecular bonding toughening with limited sliding spacing, our strategy enables interfacial molecular chains reversible slippage when the inorganic nanosheets bear stretching force, providing sufficient interlayer spatial distance for relative sliding to dissipate more energy. The resulting laminates exhibit strong strength (22.33 MPa), supertoughness (219.08 MJ m&#8211;3), ultrahigh stretchability (&gt;1900%) and self&#8208;healing ability (99.7%), which far surpass most of reported synthetic and natural laminate materials. Moreover, the fabricated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electronic skin shows excellent flexibility, sensitivity and healability for human physiological signals monitoring. This strategy breaks through the challenge that traditional layered nanocomposites are intrinsically stiff and opens up the functional application of layered nanocomposites in flexible devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Salt Metathesis: Tetrafluoroborate Anion Rapidly Fluoridates Organoboronic Acids to give Organotrifluoroborates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrafluoroborate anion, considered to be weakly coordinating and relatively inert for organic chemistry applications, readily undergoes salt metasthesis with organoboronic acids to afford the corresponding organotrifluoroborates. Its spontaneous solvolysis in methanol to HF/MeOBF3&#8722; and pH&#8208;dependent aqueous solvolysis as a more general feature, highlight its non&#8208;inertness and reactivity potential for use in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) has long been used as a spectator counter anion. Herein, we report an unprecedented salt metathesis between a variety of BF4&#8722; salts and a series of organoboronic acids yielding the corresponding organotrifluoroborates. We identified conditions for fast and efficient fluoridation (&lt;1&#8197;h) with minimal workup. Fundamentally, this work discloses the proclivity of BF4&#8722; to exchange fluoride atoms with organoboronates, highlighting the lability of BF4&#8722;.

         <title>Fundamental Understanding of Electronic Structure in FeN4 Site on Electrocatalytic Activity via dz2&#8208;Orbital&#8208;Driven Charge Tuning for Acidic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a fundamental perspective on the electron structure of the FeN4 site on the acidic oxygen reduction reaction activity of a COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs catalyst integrated into a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Via 
&#8208;orbital&#8208;driven charge tuning, the performance of the fuel cell is improved by an order of magnitude compared with that of an untuned FeN4 catalyst.







Abstract
The structural diversity of active sites resulting from traditional pyrolysis hinder our understanding of the local coordination environment (LCE) around the active site, and its effects on performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We created a series of FeN4 active&#8208;site configurations via a pyrolysis&#8208;free approach where LCEs are defined by covalent organic polymers (COPs). Our results suggest a more positive charge on iron atoms in the vicinity of an electron&#8208;withdrawing side&#8208;chain; that is, a high&#8208;valence configuration (FeH+N4) that is achieved with a COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs catalyst subject to 
&#8208;orbital tuning. A new descriptor &#958;, defined as the band center of iron atoms projected on the 
&#8208;orbital, was introduced to quantitively explain a volcano&#8208;like regulation mechanism. When &#958; is distributed between &#8722;1.887 and &#8722;1.862&#8197;eV, the catalytic performance of the COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs electrocatalyst is optimized.

         <title>A Simple, Transition Metal Catalyst&#8208;Free Method for the Design of Complex Organic Building Blocks Used to Construct Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology for the synthesis of ligands for large pore metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), based on cyclic diamine building blocks, has been developed. Twenty&#8208;one new carboxylate ligands having 6 different geometries, as well as 16 new MOFs were synthesized.







Abstract
The design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) having large pore sizes and volumes often requires the use of complex organic ligands, currently synthesized using costly and time&#8208;consuming palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling chemistry. Thus, in the present work, a new strategy for ligand design is reported, where piperazine and dihydrophenazine units are used as substitutes for benzene rings, which are the basic building block of most MOF ligands. This chemistry, which is based on simple, nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions, is used for the transition metal catalyst&#8208;free construction of 21 new, carboxylate&#8208;based ligands with varying sizes, shapes, and denticity and 15 linear di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;nitriles. Moreover, to demonstrate the utility of the ligands as building blocks, 16 new structurally diverse MOFs having surface areas up to 3100&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 were also synthesized.

         <title>Exceptionally Stable Dimers and Trimers of Au25 Clusters Linked with a Bidentate Dithiol: Synthesis, Structure and Chirality Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chiral dithiol is used to bridge Au25 nanoclusters together. Due to its bidentate nature, the dimers and trimers can be isolated before further reaction occurs. The structure of the oligomers is analysed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The changes in optical properties are followed by UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism.







Abstract
A bidentate chiral dithiol (diBINAS) is utilised to bridge Au25 nanoclusters to form oligomers. Separation by size allows the isolation of fractions that are stable thanks to the bidentate nature of the linker. The structure of the products is elucidated by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and calculated using density functional theory. Additional structural details are studied by diffusion&#8208;ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Significant changes in the optical properties are analysed by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, with the latter demonstrating a strong emission enhancement. Furthermore, the emergent chiral characteristics are studied by circular dichroism. Due to the geometry constraints of the nanocluster assemblies, diBINAS can be regarded as a templating molecule, taking a step towards the directed self&#8208;assembly of metal clusters.

         <title>Transforming Inert Cycloalkanes into &#945;,&#969;&#8208;Diamines by Designed Enzymatic Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot in vivo biocatalytic cascade for the production of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines as important nylon monomers was developed, starting from cheap and readily available cycloalkanes. The desired &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines were successfully produced with the highest biosynthesis productivity to date, thus providing an ecologically viable alternative to the current industrial process for manufacturing &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines.







Abstract
Aliphatic &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines (DAs) are important monomer precursors that are industrially produced by energy&#8208;intensive, multistage chemical reactions that are harmful to the environment. Therefore, the development of sustainable green DA synthetic routes is highly desired. Herein, we report an efficient one&#8208;pot in vivo biocatalytic cascade for the transformation of cycloalkanes into DAs with the aid of advanced techniques, including the RetroBioCat tool for biocatalytic route design, enzyme mining for finding appropriate enzymes and microbial consortia construction for efficient pathway assembly. As a result, DAs were successfully produced by the designed microbial consortia&#8208;based biocatalytic system. In particular, the highest biosynthesis productivity record of 1,6&#8208;hexanediamine was achieved when using either cyclohexanol or cyclohexane as a substrate. Thus, the developed biocatalytic process provides a promising alternative to the dominant industrial process for manufacturing DAs.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Late&#8208;Stage Modifications Enable Downstream Click&#8208;Mediated Fluorescent Tagging of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promiscuity of N1&#8208;tryptophan prenyltransferase AcyF was screened with 22 unnatural pyrophosphates, which exhibited reactive groups suitable for copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, metathesis, and inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reactions. A 10&#8208;mer tryptophan&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide was tailored by AcyF, and the resulting modified peptide was successfully labelled with a tetrazine&#8211;fluorescein conjugate by IEDDA.







Abstract
Aromatic prenyltransferases from cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways catalyse the chemoselective and regioselective intramolecular transfer of prenyl/geranyl groups from isoprene donors to an electron&#8208;rich position in these macrocyclic and linear peptides. These enzymes often demonstrate relaxed substrate specificity and are considered useful biocatalysts for structural diversification of peptides. Herein, we assess the isoprene donor specificity of the N1&#8208;tryptophan prenyltransferase AcyF from the anacyclamide A8P pathway using a library of 22 synthetic alkyl pyrophosphate analogues, of which many display reactive groups that are amenable to additional functionalization. We further used AcyF to introduce a reactive moiety into a tryptophan&#8208;containing cyclic peptide and subsequently used click chemistry to fluorescently label the enzymatically modified peptide. This chemoenzymatic strategy allows late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and is useful for many applications.

         <title>Alternative Fast and Slow Primary Charge&#8208;Separation Pathways in Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two primary charge separation pathways are identified in the reaction center of Photosystem II, corresponding to different time scales and kinetic phases.







Abstract
Photosystem&#8208;II (PSII) is a multi&#8208;subunit protein complex that harvests sunlight to perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Initial light&#8208;activated charge separation takes place at a reaction centre consisting of four chlorophylls and two pheophytins. Understanding the processes following light excitation remains elusive due to spectral congestion, the ultrafast nature, and multi&#8208;component behaviour of the charge&#8208;separation process. Here, using advanced computational multiscale approaches which take into account the large&#8208;scale configurational flexibility of the system, we identify two possible primary pathways to radical&#8208;pair formation that differ by three orders of magnitude in their kinetics. The fast (short&#8208;range) pathway is dominant, but the existence of an alternative slow (long&#8208;range) charge&#8208;separation pathway hints at the evolution of redundancy that may serve other purposes, adaptive or protective, related to formation of the unique oxidative species that drives water oxidation in PSII.

         <title>Lead(II) Formate in Rembrandt's Night Watch: Detection and Distribution from the Macro&#8208; to the Micro&#8208;scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray powder diffraction mapping at multiple length scales revealed the unusual presence of lead(II) formate, Pb(HCOO)2, in several areas of The Night Watch, Rembrandt's most famous painting. A possible chemical pathway resulting in the formation of this compound in historical oil paint was explored via micro&#8208;analysis, notably using synchrotron radiation. New clues on the reactivity of metallic driers in oil systems were thus gathered.







Abstract
The Night Watch, painted in 1642 and on view in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, is considered Rembrandt's most famous work. X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (XRPD) mapping at multiple length scales revealed the unusual presence of lead(II) formate, Pb(HCOO)2, in several areas of the painting. Until now, this compound was never reported in historical oil paints. In order to get insights into this phenomenon, one possible chemical pathway was explored thanks to the preparation and micro&#8208;analysis of model oil paint media prepared by heating linseed oil and lead(II) oxide (PbO) drier as described in 17th century recipes. Synchrotron radiation based micro&#8208;XRPD (SR&#8208;&#956;&#8208;XRPD) and infrared microscopy were combined to identify and map at the micro&#8208;scale various neo&#8208;formed lead&#8208;based compounds in these model samples. Both lead(II) formate and lead(II) formate hydroxide Pb(HCOO)(OH) were detected and mapped, providing new clues regarding the reactivity of lead driers in oil matrices in historical paintings.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Distance and Reactivity of Coreactants Determine the Sensitivity of Bead&#8208;Based Immunoassays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) self&#8208;interference spectroscopy and microscopy imaging, the analytical sensitivity of bead&#8208;based ECL immunoassays was proposed to be determined by the light emission distance and reactivity of coreactant. Compared with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine, 2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotriethanol can balance the distance&#8208;reactivity trade&#8208;off and thus apparently promote the sensitivity of immunoassays.







Abstract
Herein we report the study of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) generation by tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium (Ru(bpy)32+) and five tertiary amine coreactants. The ECL distance and lifetime of coreactant radical cations were measured by ECL self&#8208;interference spectroscopy. And the reactivity of coreactants was quantitatively evaluated in terms of integrated ECL intensity. By statistical analysis of ECL images of single Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;labeled microbeads, we propose that ECL distance and reactivity of coreactant codetermine the emission intensity and thus the sensitivity of immunoassay. 2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotriethanol (BIS&#8208;TRIS) can well balance ECL distance&#8208;reactivity trade&#8208;off and enhance the sensitivity by 236&#8201;% compared with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) in the bead&#8208;based immunoassay of carcinoembryonic antigen. The study brings an insightful understanding of ECL generation in bead&#8208;based immunoassay and a way of maximizing the analytical sensitivity from the aspect of coreactant.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;Vinylazaarenes to Access P&#8208;Chiral 2&#8208;Azaaryl&#8208;Ethylphosphine Oxides</title>

A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalysed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;vinylazaarenes is developed. The method provides a modular and efficient access to P&#8208;chiral 2&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;ethylphosphine oxides while also realizing the precise kinetic resolution of secondary phosphine oxides. Given the verified promise of the chiral phosphines as the chiral ligands, this work considerably enriches the toolkit of asymmetric metal catalysis.







Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalysed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;vinylazaarenes by secondary phosphine oxides is described. A variety of P&#8208;chiral 2&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;ethylphosphine oxides are synthesized with high yields and ees, of which both the substituents of phosphines and azaarenes can be flexibly modulated, underscoring an exceptionally broad scope of substrates. These adducts are valuable to asymmetric metal catalysis since the resultant P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphines from the reduction of them are verified as a kind of effective C1&#8208;symmetric chiral 1,5&#8208;hybrid P,N&#8208;ligands. Importantly, this catalysis platform enables the generic and efficient kinetic resolution of P&#8208;chiral secondary phosphine oxides. It thus provides an expedient approach to access the enantiomers of the P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphine oxides derived from asymmetric hydrophosphinylation, further improving the utility of the method.

         <title>Diastereoselective Alkylation of Activated Nitrogen Heterocycles with Alkenyl Boronate Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylation of acylated quinolines and isoquinolines with alkenyl boron&#8208;&#8220;ate&#8221; complexes via 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement gives substituted, dearomatized nitrogen heterocycles with high diastereocontrol. The modularity of this multi&#8208;component coupling allows for facile access to a range of valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing scaffolds. This one&#8208;pot protocol installs a chiral boronic ester moiety which can be used in further stereospecific transformations.







Abstract
Alkenyl boronate complexes react with acylated quinolines and isoquinolines via 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement to give alkylated, dearomatized heterocycles in good yields, diastereoselectivities, and regioselectivities. This multi&#8208;component coupling is highly modular and can be used to access a wide scope of heterocyclic scaffolds. Chiral boronic esters made through this methodology possess high synthetic potential and can be transformed into various functional groups in one step without racemization.

         <title>Enhanced Carbon Monoxide Electroreduction to &gt;1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 C2+ Products Using Copper Catalysts Dispersed on MgAl Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheet House&#8208;of&#8208;Cards Scaffolds</title>

&#8216;House&#8208;of&#8208;cards&#8217; structures composed by MgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets help to disperse CuO&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu) catalysts. These porous structures enhanced CO gas infiltration through the catalyst layer. OD&#8208;Cu mixed with the LDH nanosheets catalysed CORR to C2+ products with a partial current density that is 14&#8208;fold higher than that exhibited by the unsupported OD&#8208;Cu.







Abstract
Cu catalysts are most apt for reducing CO(2) to multi&#8208;carbon products in aqueous electrolytes. To enhance the product yield, we can increase the overpotential and the catalyst mass loading. However, these approaches can cause inadequate mass transport of CO(2) to the catalytic sites, which will then lead to H2 evolution dominating the product selectivity. Herein, we use a MgAl LDH nanosheet &#8216;house&#8208;of&#8208;cards&#8217; scaffold to disperse CuO&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu). With this support&#8208;catalyst design, at &#8722;0.7&#8197;VRHE, CO could be reduced to C2+ products with a current density (jC2+) of &#8722;1251&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This is 14&#215; that of the jC2+ shown by unsupported OD&#8208;Cu. The current densities of C2+ alcohols and C2H4 were also high at &#8722;369 and &#8722;816&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 respectively. We propose that the porosity of the LDH nanosheet scaffold enhances CO diffusion through the Cu sites. The CO reduction rate can thus be increased, while minimizing H2 evolution, even when high catalyst loadings and large overpotentials are used.

         <title>A Target Recycling Amplification Process for the Digital Detection of Exosomal MicroRNAs through Photonic Resonator Absorption Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target recycling amplification process (TRAP) detection method was developed using photonic resonator absorption microscopy, which shows exciting potential for monitoring exosomal miRNAs with ultra&#8208;sensitivity and single&#8208;base mismatch selectivity. The approach is a single&#8208;step, wash&#8208;free, enzyme&#8208;free, isothermal, 20&#8208;minute, room temperature process that can be readily adapted toward any miRNA target through different DNA probe designs.







Abstract
Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have considerable potential as pivotal biomarkers to monitor cancer development, dis&#8208;ease progression, treatment effects and prognosis. Here, we report an efficient target recycling amplification process (TRAP) for the digital detection of miRNAs using photonic resonator absorption microscopy. We achieve multiplex digital detection with sub&#8208;attomolar sensitivity in 20&#8197;minutes, robust selectivity for single nucleotide variants, and a broad dynamic range from 1&#8197;aM to 1&#8197;pM. Compared with traditional qRT&#8208;PCR, TRAP showed similar accuracy in profiling exosomal miRNAs derived from cancer cells, but also exhibited at least 31&#8208;fold and 61&#8208;fold enhancement in the limits of miRNA&#8208;375 and miRNA&#8208;21 detection, respectively. The TRAP approach is ideal for exosomal or circulating miRNA biomarker quantification, where the miRNAs are present in low concentrations or sample volume, with potentials for frequent, low&#8208;cost, and minimally invasive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing.

         <title>Hydrated Eutectic Electrolytes Stabilizing Quasi&#8208;Underpotential Mg Plating/Stripping for High&#8208;Voltage Mg Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable quasi&#8208;underpotential Mg stripping/plating chemistry (UPMC) on Zn substrate is initially achieved in new adiponitrile&#8208;based hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEEs), realizing ultralow UPMC overpotentials and high energy/voltage plateau of aqueous rechargeable Mg batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Mg batteries (ARMBs) usually fail from severe anode passivation, alternatively, executing quasi&#8208;underpotential Mg plating/stripping chemistry (UPMC) on a proper heterogeneous metal substrate is a crucial remedy.

&lt;p&gt;A stable quasi-underpotential Mg stripping/plating chemistry (UPMC) on Zn substrate is initially achieved in new adiponitrile-based hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEEs), realizing ultralow UPMC overpotentials and high energy/voltage plateau of aqueous rechargeable Mg batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous rechargeable Mg batteries (ARMBs) usually fail from severe anode passivation, alternatively, executing quasi-underpotential Mg plating/stripping chemistry (UPMC) on a proper heterogeneous metal substrate is a crucial remedy. Herein, a stable UPMC on Zn substrate is initially achieved in new hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEEs), delivering an ultralow UPMC overpotential and high energy/voltage plateau of ARMBs. The unique eutectic property remarkably expands the lower limit of electrochemical stability window (ESW) of HEEs and undermines the competition between hydrogen evolution/corrosion reactions and UPMC, enabling a reversible UPMC. The UPMC is carefully revealed by multiple characterizations, which shows a low overpotential of 50&#8197;mV at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 550&#8197;h. With sulfonic acid-doped polyaniline (SPANI) cathodes, UPMC-based full cells show high energy/power densities of 168.6&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/2.1&#8197;kWh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and voltage plateau of 1.3&#8197;V, far overwhelming conventional aqueous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering To Enhance Reactivity and Selectivity in an Ultrafast Photoclick Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of the key parameters of the 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone&#8208;electron&#8208;rich alkene (PQ&#8208;ERA) photocycloaddition has led to a system that combines PQs and enamines. This next&#8208;generation system shows drastically enhanced rates, high photoreaction quantum yields, tunable fluorescence output, and high fluorescence quantum yields of the adducts. Furthermore, an orthogonal reaction system was achieved in both solution and on nanoparticle surfaces.







Abstract
Light&#8208;induced 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone&#8208;electron&#8208;rich alkene (PQ&#8208;ERA) photocycloadditions are an attractive new type of photoclick reaction, featuring fast conversions and high biocompatibility. However, the tunability of the reaction was hardly investigated up to now. To this end, we explored the influence of substituents on both reaction partners and the reaction rate between the PQs and ERAs. We identified new handles for functionalization and discovered that using enamines as ERAs leads to drastically enhanced rates (&gt;5400&#8197;times faster), high photoreaction quantum yields (&#934;P, up to 65&#8201;%), and multicolor emission output as well as a high fluorescence quantum yield of the adducts (&#934;F, up to 97&#8201;%). Further investigation of the photophysical and photochemical properties provided insights to design orthogonal reaction systems both in solution and on nanoparticle surfaces for ultrafast chemoselective functionalization by photoclick reactions.

         <title>Novel Strategy to Drive the Intracellular Uptake of Lipid Nanoparticles for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a novel aminopolycarboxylic acid lipid&#8208;embedded porphyrin nanoparticle and elucidated its unique cellular delivery mechanism that affords its enhanced intracellular uptake, fast fluorescence activation, and superior photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) efficacy. By exploiting this enhanced delivery strategy, we might overcome challenges associated with intracellular drug delivery to advance therapeutic outcomes.







Abstract
Nanoparticles&#8217; uptake by cancer cells upon reaching the tumor microenvironment is often the rate&#8208;limiting step in cancer nanomedicine. Herein, we report that the inclusion of aminopolycarboxylic acid conjugated lipids, such as EDTA&#8208; or DTPA&#8208;hexadecylamide lipids in liposome&#8208;like porphyrin nanoparticles (PS) enhanced their intracellular uptake by 25&#8208;fold, which was attributed to these lipids&#8217; ability to fluidize the cell membrane in a detergent&#8208;like manner rather than by metal chelation of EDTA or DTPA. EDTA&#8208;lipid&#8208;incorporated&#8208;PS (ePS) take advantage of its unique active uptake mechanism to achieve &gt;95&#8201;% photodynamic therapy (PDT) cell killing compared to &lt;5&#8201;% cell killing by PS. In multiple tumor models, ePS demonstrated fast fluorescence&#8208;enabled tumor delineation within minutes post&#8208;injection and increased PDT potency (100&#8201;% survival rate) compared to PS (60&#8201;%). This study offers a new nanoparticle cellular uptake strategy to overcome challenges associated with conventional drug delivery.

         <title>Generation and Use of Glycosyl Radicals under Acidic Conditions: Glycosyl Sulfinates as Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyl radicals were generated under acidic conditions for the first time by the use of glycosyl sulfinates as precursors. This development enables the installation of glycosyl units directly onto pharmaceutically relevant pyridine cores by the Minisci reaction.







Abstract
We herein report a method that enables the generation of glycosyl radicals under highly acidic conditions. Key to the success is the design and use of glycosyl sulfinates as radical precursors, which are bench&#8208;stable solids and can be readily prepared from commercial starting materials. This development allows the installation of glycosyl units onto pyridine rings directly by the Minisci reaction. We further demonstrate the utility of this method in the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug molecules, including the anticancer agent camptothecin. Experimental studies provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Multiplex Identification of Post&#8208;Translational Modifications at Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care by Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Hydrogel Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep learning&#8208;assisted multiplex detection method based on photonic crystal hydrogels for both peptides, cellular proteins and upregulation of phosphorylation in live mammalian cells, is reported. It is the first intelligent strategy for multiplex identification of common PTMs with the naked eye, with high selectivity and sensitivity.







Abstract
Multiplex detection of protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), especially at point&#8208;of&#8208;care, is of great significance in cancer diagnosis. Herein, we report a machine learning&#8208;assisted photonic crystal hydrogel (PCH) sensor for multiplex detection of PTMs. With closely&#8208;related PCH sensors microfabricated on a single chip, our design achieved not only rapid screening of PTMs at specific protein sites by using only naked eyes/cellphone, but also the feasibility of real&#8208;time monitoring of phosphorylation reactions. By taking advantage of multiplex sensor chips and a neural network algorithm, accurate prediction of PTMs by both their types and concentrations was enabled. This approach was ultimately used to detect and differentiate up/down regulation of different phosphorylation sites within the same protein in live mammalian cells. Our developed method thus holds potential for POC identification of various PTMs in early&#8208;stage diagnosis of protein&#8208;related diseases.

This non&#8208;orthogonal tandem catalysis in an encapsulin nanocompartment opens an exciting toolbox for the development of compartmentalized prodrug activation reactions in biological systems.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the creation of an artificial protein cage housing a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;tagged guest protein that catalyzes a linear, two&#8208;step sequential cascade reaction. The guest protein consists of a fusion protein of HaloTag and monomeric rhizavidin. Inside the protein capsid, we established a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed allylcarbamate deprotection reaction followed by a gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing hydroamination reaction that led to indoles and phenanthridines with an overall yield of up to 66&#8201;% in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, we show that the encapsulation stabilizes the metal catalysts against deactivation by air, proteins and cell lysate.

         <title>Discovering the Intrinsic Causes of Dendrite Formation in Zinc Metal Anodes: Lattice Defects and Residual Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Residual stress and lattice defects in commercial zinc anode have been confirmed to be essential factors to the dendrite formation during zinc deposition by experiments and theoretical calculations, as they induced heterogeneous deposition on the zinc surface and limited the epitaxial growth of zinc.







Abstract
Developing a highly stable and dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode is essential to the commercial application of zinc metal batteries. However, the understanding of zinc dendrites formation mechanism is still insufficient. Herein, for the first time, we discover that the interfacial heterogeneous deposition induced by lattice defects and epitaxial growth limited by residual stress are intrinsic and critical causes for zinc dendrite formation. Therefore, an annealing reconstruction strategy was proposed to eliminate lattice defects and stresses in zinc crystals, which achieve dense epitaxial electrodeposition of zinc anode. The as&#8208;prepared annealed zinc anodes exhibit dendrite&#8208;free morphology and enhanced electrochemical cycling stability. This work first proves that lattice defects and residual stresses are also very important factors for epitaxial electrodeposition of zinc in addition to crystal orientation, which can provide a new mechanism for future researches on zinc anode modification.

         <title>Ligand Assisted Thermal Atomization of Palladium Clusters: An Inspiring Approach for the Rational Design of Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation from metal nanocluster catalysts to metal single&#8208;atom catalysts is an important procedure in the rational design of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs). Herein, an inspiring approach is reported. Cl ligands coordinated to Pd nanoclusters make them become less stable and have a stronger tendency to collapse, thus allowing the transformation from Pd nanocluster to Pd single atom to happen at a relative low temperature.







Abstract
The transformation from metal nanocluster catalysts to metal single&#8208;atom catalysts is an important procedure in the rational design of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs). However, the conversion methods often involve high annealing temperature as well as reducing atmosphere. Herein, we reported a continuous and convenient approach to transfer Pd nanocluster into Pd single&#8208;atom in a ligand assisted annealing procedure, by which means we reduced its activating temperature low to 400&#8201;&#176;C. Using ex&#8208;situ microscopy and spectroscopy, we comprehensively monitored the structural evolution of Pd species though the whole atomization process. Theoretical calculation revealed that the structural instability caused by remaining Cl ligands was the main reason for this low&#8208;temperature transformation. The present atomization strategy and mechanistic knowledge for the conversion from cluster to atomic dispersion provides guidelines for the rational design of ADCs.

         <title>Chiral Single&#8208;Molecule Potentiometers Based on Stapled ortho&#8208; Oligo(phenylene)ethynylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stapled chiral helical single&#8208;molecule potentiometer based on ortho&#8208;oligophenylethynylene skeleton is described. Its stretching during STM measurements promotes different conductive pathways, attributed to different conformations of the helical scaffold, while maintaining the helicity. State of the art calculations on polarization pave the way to use these structures as unimolecular spin filters.







Abstract
We report on the chemical design of chiral molecular junctions with stress&#8208;dependent conductance, whose helicity is maintained during the stretching of a single molecule junction due to the stapling of both ends of the inner helix. In the reported compounds, different conductive pathways are observed, with clearly different conductance values and plateau&#8208;length distributions, attributed to different conformations of the helical structures. The large chiro&#8208;optical responses and the potential use of these molecules as unimolecular spin filters have been theoretically proved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, including a fully ab&#8208;initio estimation of the CISS&#8208;originating spin polarization which is done, for the first time, for a realistic molecular system.

         <title>Dithienylethene&#8208;Based Single Molecular Photothermal Linear Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mechanically controlled break junction (MCBJ) technique, we have demonstrated a single molecule&#8208;based photothermal linear actuator whose conductance remains constant during its operation. The actuation is achieved by the unique design of the molecular system, which allows a perfect balance of molecular length and band gap change upon isomerization that counteracts the effect of one another to give constant conductance with actuation.







Abstract
By employing a mechanically controllable break junction technique, we have realized an ideal single molecular linear actuator based on dithienylethene (DTE) based molecular architecture, which undergoes reversible photothermal isomerization when subjected to UV irradiation under ambient conditions. As a result, open form (compressed, UV OFF) and closed form (elongated, UV ON) of dithienylethene&#8208;based molecular junctions are achieved. Interestingly, the mechanical actuation is achieved without changing the conductance of the molecular junction around the Fermi level over several cycles, which is an essential property required for an ideal single molecular actuator. Our study demonstrates a unique example of achieving a perfect balance between tunneling width and barrier height change upon photothermal isomerization, resulting in no change in conductance but a change in the molecular length, which results in mechanical actuation at the single molecular level.

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Embedded Heterocyclic Narrowband Emitters with Strengthened Molecular Rigidity and Suppressed High&#8208;Frequency Vibronic Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Restricted excited state relaxation was achieved by strengthening molecular rigidity, and this was combined with the suppressed high&#8208;frequency bending vibration possible by introducing the sulfone group. In this way, extremely narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum of 25 and 28&#8197;nm were realized for 2tCPD and tPD, respectively.







Abstract
Sulfone&#8208;embedded heterocyclics are of great interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), however, exploring highly efficient narrowband emitters based on sulfone&#8208;embedded heterocyclics remains challenging. Herein, five emitters with different sulfur valence state and molecular rigidity, namely tP, tCPD, 2tCPD, tPD and tPT, are thoroughly analysed. With restricted twisting of flexible peripheral phenyl by strengthening molecular rigidity, molecular emission spectra can be enormously narrowed. Further, introducing the sulfone group with bending vibration in low&#8208;frequency region that suppresses high&#8208;frequency vibration, sharp narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum of 28 and 25&#8197;nm are achieved for 2tCPD and tPD, respectively. Maximum external quantum efficiencies of 22.0&#8201;% and 27.1&#8201;% are successfully realized for 2tCPD&#8208; and tPD&#8208;based OLED devices.

     alt="Sulfone-Embedded Heterocyclic Narrowband Emitters with Strengthened Molecular Rigidity and Suppressed High-Frequency Vibronic Coupling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restricted excited state relaxation was achieved by strengthening molecular rigidity, and this was combined with the suppressed high-frequency bending vibration possible by introducing the sulfone group. In this way, extremely narrow full-widths at half-maximum of 25 and 28&#8197;nm were realized for 2tCPD and tPD, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfone-embedded heterocyclics are of great interest in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), however, exploring highly efficient narrowband emitters based on sulfone-embedded heterocyclics remains challenging. Herein, five emitters with different sulfur valence state and molecular rigidity, namely tP, tCPD, 2tCPD, tPD and tPT, are thoroughly analysed. With restricted twisting of flexible peripheral phenyl by strengthening molecular rigidity, molecular emission spectra can be enormously narrowed. Further, introducing the sulfone group with bending vibration in low-frequency region that suppresses high-frequency vibration, sharp narrow full-widths at half-maximum of 28 and 25&#8197;nm are achieved for 2tCPD and tPD, respectively. Maximum external quantum efficiencies of 22.0&#8201;% and 27.1&#8201;% are successfully realized for 2tCPD- and tPD-based OLED devices. These results offer a novel design strategy for constructing narrowband emitters by introducing sulfone group into a rigid molecular framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesogenic Groups Control the Emitter Orientation in Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Films

Our work shows how the distinct self&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystalline MR&#8208;TADF emitter can be exploited for generating (partially) aligned via solution&#8208;processed thin films &#8211; an advance towards high performance solution&#8208;processable organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters and emitters that show preferential horizontal orientation of their transition dipole moment (TDM) are two emerging strategies to enhance the efficiency of OLEDs. We present the first example of a liquid crystalline multi&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, DiKTa&#8208;LC. The compound possesses a nematic liquid crystalline phase between 80&#8201;&#176;C and 110&#8201;&#176;C. Importantly, the TDM of the spin&#8208;coated film shows preferential horizontal orientation, with an anisotropy factor, a, of 0.28, which is preserved in doped poly(vinylcarbazole) films. Green&#8208;emitting (&#955;EL=492&#8197;nm) solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on DiKTa&#8208;LC showed an EQEmax of 13.6&#8201;%. We thus demonstrate for the first time how self&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystalline TADF emitter can lead to the so&#8208;far elusive control of the orientation of the transition dipole in solution&#8208;processed films, which will be of relevance for high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed OLEDs.

         <title>Efficient Narrowband Circularly Polarized Light Emitters Based on 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded Rigid Donor&#8211;Acceptor Helicenes</title>

Addressing the issue of broad fluorescence and CPL from helicenes, we present a design strategy capitalizing on intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions between N and B atoms. A straightforward synthesis of 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded, configurationally stable single and double helicenes is described. The synthesized molecules exhibit unprecedentedly narrow&#8208;band emission (FWHM of 17&#8211;28&#8197;nm, 0.07&#8211;0.13&#8197;eV) and high quantum yields (72&#8201;%&#8211;85&#8201;%) for helicene&#8208;type compounds.







Abstract
Narrow&#8208;band emission is essential for applicable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active materials in ultrahigh&#8208;definition CP&#8208;OLEDs. One of the most promising classes of CPL active molecules, helicenes, however, typically exhibit broad emission with a large Stokes shift. We present, herein, a design strategy capitalizing on intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions between nitrogen and boron atoms to address this issue. 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded configurationally stable single&#8208; and double helicenes were synthesized straightforwardly. Both helicenes show unprecedentedly narrow fluorescence and CPL bands (full width at half maximum between 17&#8211;28&#8197;nm, 0.07&#8211;0.13&#8197;eV) along with high fluorescence quantum yields (72&#8211;85&#8201;%). Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the relative localization of the natural transition orbitals, mainly on the rigid core of the molecule, and small values of root&#8208;mean&#8208;square displacements between S0 and S1 state geometries, contribute to the narrower emission.

Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom tuning and control of pore aperture in metal&#8211;organic frameworks was achieved through expansion of linker dimensionality for selective separation of linear, monobranched, and dibranched hexane isomers.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed as a promising material for non&#8208;thermal chemical separations owing to their high structural diversity and tunability. Here, we report the synthesis of a zinc&#8208;based MOF containing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) linker, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, with high thermal stability towards the separation of hexane isomers. The incorporation of the 3D linker enhances the structural stability and provides well&#8208;defined pore apertures/channels with sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom precision. This precision allowed for the separation of similarly sized hexane isomers based on subtle differences in their kinetic diameters. Multi&#8208;component liquid phase batch experiments confirmed the separation of hexanes mixture into linear, monobranched, and dibranched isomers. This work represents a significant milestone in the construction of stable Zn&#8208;based MOFs and the incorporation of 3D linkers as a potential solution to challenging separations.

         <title>Sn Anodes Protected by Intermetallic FeSn2 Layers for Long&#8208;lifespan Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with High Initial Coulombic Efficiency of 93.8 %</title>

The intermetallic FeSn2 layer alleviates the huge volume change and prevents the coarsening of Sn anodes to provide a high ICE of 93.8&#8201;% and long life for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
With a theoretical capacity of 847&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, Sn has emerged as promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, enormous volume expansion and agglomeration of nano Sn lead to low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability. Herein, an intermetallic FeSn2 layer is designed via thermal reduction of polymer&#8208;Fe2O3 coated hollow SnO2 spheres to construct a yolk&#8208;shell structured Sn/FeSn2@C. The FeSn2 layer can relieve internal stress, avoid the agglomeration of Sn to accelerate the Na+ transport, and enable fast electronic conduction, which endows quick electrochemical dynamics and long&#8208;term stability. As a result, the Sn/FeSn2@C anode exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE=93.8&#8201;%) and a high reversible capacity of 409&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1500&#8197;cycles, corresponding to an 80&#8201;% capacity retention. In addition, NVP//Sn/FeSn2@C sodium&#8208;ion full cell shows outstanding cycle stability (capacity retaining rate of 89.7&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C).

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Potassium Batteries Enabled by Electric and Thermal Field Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual regulation strategy of electric and thermal field in Potassium metal battery is realized by a highly ordered 1D CNT nanoarray. This unique electrode not only provides uniform K ion flux distribution, but also reduces the thermal fluctuation, therefore, enabling PMBs to work at low temperature.







Abstract
Recharging batteries operate at sub&#8208;zero temperature is usually limited by the slow ion diffusion and uneven charge distribution at low temperature. Here, we report a strategy to regulate electric field and thermal field simultaneously, creating a fast and uniform deposition surroundings for potassium ion in potassium metal batteries (PMBs). This regulation is achieved by using a highly ordered 1D nanoarray electrode which provides a dense and flat surface for uniforming the electric field and high thermal conductivity for reducing the temperature fluctuation. Consequently, this electrode could achieve high&#8208;areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Besides, the dependence of potassium nucleation on temperature is unveiled. Furthermore, a full&#8208;cell could steady operate with over 80&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Those respectable performances demonstrate that this strategy is valid, potentially providing guidelines for the rational design of advanced electrodes toward PMBs.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Acetylene Enabled by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the regio&#8208; and stereoselective light&#8208;enabled installation of two distinct sulfides into acetylene. The resulting S&#8208;containing vinyl frameworks are important and versatile scaffolds that can be easily transformed into diverse functionalized molecules and chiral sulfoxide&#8208;containing bidentate ligands. Experimental and theoretical data on the mechanism are reported.







Abstract
Although the direct conversion of gaseous acetylene into value&#8208;added liquid commodity chemicals is becoming increasingly attractive, the majority of the established methodologies are focused on cross&#8208;coupling, hydro&#8208;functionalization, and polymerization. Herein, we describe a 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization method that inserts acetylene directly into readily available bifunctional reagents. This method provides access to diverse C2&#8208;linked 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;heteroatom products in high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity along with opening up previously unexplored synthetic directions. In addition, we demonstrate this method's synthetic potential by converting the obtained products into diverse functionalized molecules and chiral sulfoxide&#8208;containing bidentate ligands. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, the mechanism for this insertion reaction was investigated.

         <title>Mitigating Swelling of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase using an Inorganic Anion Switch for Low&#8208;temperature Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inclusion of difluorophosphate anion in the primary solvation sheath of a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte helps to switch the swelling properties of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a graphite (Gr) composite anode. By forming a low&#8208;swelling, Li3PO4&#8208;enriched SEI, reversible Li+ (de)intercalation was enabled at a stable Gr&#8208;electrolyte interface, contributing to improved low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance of a Li&#8208;ion battery.







Abstract
In overcoming the Li+ desolvation barrier for low&#8208;temperature battery operation, a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte based on carboxylate solvent has shown promises. In case of an organic&#8208;anion&#8208;enriched primary solvation sheath (PSS), we found that the electrolyte tends to form a highly swollen, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that shows a high permeability to the electrolyte components, accounting for quickly declined electrochemical performance of graphite&#8208;based anode. Here we proposed a facile strategy to tune the swelling property of SEI by introducing an inorganic anion switch into the PSS, via LiDFP co&#8208;solute method. By forming a low&#8208;swelling, Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI, the electrolyte&#8208;consuming parasitic reactions and solvent co&#8208;intercalation at graphite&#8208;electrolyte interface are suppressed, which contributes to efficient Li+ transport, reversible Li+ (de)intercalation and stable structural evolution of graphite anode in high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries at a low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Spontaneous Proton Chemistry Enables Ultralow&#8208;temperature and Long&#8208;life Aqueous Copper Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A Cu(BF4)2 electrolyte that spontaneously generates protons is developed for ultralow&#8208;temperature copper metal batteries. Benefiting from the excellent thermodynamic stability and low temperature resistance of the electrolyte, the assembled full battery exhibits a extra&#8208;long and stable cycling lifespan over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C and works well even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aqueous copper metal batteries with acidic electrolytes are regarded as promising candidates for low&#8208;temperature energy storage, benefiting from fast kinetics of protons and acid resistance of copper. Here, a Cu(BF4)2 electrolyte that spontaneously generates protons is developed for ultralow&#8208;temperature copper metal batteries. Systematic studies demonstrate that the hydrolysis of BF4&#8722; generates more protons, rendering the Cu(BF4)2 among the most effective aqueous electrolyte capable of breaking hydrogen bonds in water molecules. This electrolyte endows a polyaniline/Cu battery to deliver a short charging time of 21&#8197;s and a charge/discharge capability of up to 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, along with a high discharge specific capacity of 70&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a supercapacitor&#8208;comparable power density of 3000&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Furthermore, it can exhibit a long and stable cycling lifespan over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C and works well at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Unbiased Screening of Novel Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials with High Thermal Conductivity: Long&#8208;neglected Nitrides and Popular Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an unbiased high&#8208;throughput screening of over 100&#8201;000 compounds based on thermal conductivity nonlinear optical materials with high thermal conductivity are discovered successfully. 106 compounds show well&#8208;balanced optical performances, including 81 with good thermal conductivity. And unreported chalcogenides with larger SHG response and nitrides with higher thermal conductivity are discovered.







Abstract
Traditional infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials such as AgGaS2 are crucial to key devices for solid&#8208;state lasers, however, low laser damage thresholds intrinsically hinder their practical application. Here, a robust strategy is proposed for unbiased high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 140&#8201;000 materials to explore novel IR NLO materials with high thermal conductivity and wide band gap which are crucial to intrinsic laser damage threshold. Via our strategy, 106 compounds with desired band gaps, NLO coefficients and thermal conductivity are screened out, including 8 nitrides, 68 chalcogenides, in which Sr2SnS4 is synthesized to verify the reliability of our process. Remarkably, thermal conductivity of nitrides is much higher than that of chalcogenides, e.g., 5&#215;AgGaS2 (5.13&#8197;W/m&#8201;K) for ZrZnN2, indicating that nitrides could be a long&#8208;neglected system for IR NLO materials.

&lt;p&gt;In an unbiased high-throughput screening of over 100&#8201;000 compounds based on thermal conductivity nonlinear optical materials with high thermal conductivity are discovered successfully. 106 compounds show well-balanced optical performances, including 81 with good thermal conductivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials such as AgGaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are crucial to key devices for solid-state lasers, however, low laser damage thresholds intrinsically hinder their practical application. Here, a robust strategy is proposed for unbiased high-throughput screening of more than 140&#8201;000 materials to explore novel IR NLO materials with high thermal conductivity and wide band gap which are crucial to intrinsic laser damage threshold. Via our strategy, 106 compounds with desired band gaps, NLO coefficients and thermal conductivity are screened out, including 8 nitrides, 68 chalcogenides, in which Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is synthesized to verify the reliability of our process.

         <title>When It's Heavier: Interfacial and Solvation Chemistry of Isotopes in Aqueous Electrolytes for Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical effect of isotope of water is introduced into a Zn&#8208;ion battery electrolyte to control severe side reactions and massive gas production. Due to the low diffusion and strong coordination of ions in D2O, the possibility of side reaction is decreased, resulting in a broader electrochemically stable potential window, less pH change, less zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) generation and pure phase ZHS precipitation during cycling.







Abstract
The electrochemical effect of isotope (EEI) of water is introduced in the Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) electrolyte to deal with the challenge of severe side reactions and massive gas production. Due to the low diffusion and strong coordination of ions in D2O, the possibility of side reactions is decreased, resulting in a broader electrochemically stable potential window, less pH change, and less zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) generation during cycling. Moreover, we demonstrate that D2O eliminates the different ZHS phases generated by the change of bound water during cycling because of the consistently low local ion and molecule concentration, resulting in a stable interface between the electrode and electrolyte. The full cells with D2O&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrated more stable cycling performance which displayed &#8764;100&#8201;% reversible efficiencies after 1,000 cycles with a wide voltage window of 0.8&#8211;2.0&#8197;V and 3,000 cycles with a normal voltage window of 0.8&#8211;1.9&#8197;V at a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Enantioselective Radical&#8208;Type 1,2&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;Phosphinoylation to Styrenes Catalyzed by Chiral Vanadyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;alkoxyphosphinoylation of styrenes with a broad substitution scope was realized for the first time by the use of a vanadyl complex bearing 3&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;Br&#8208;substituted N&#8208;salicylidene&#8208;t&#8208;leucinate. The unprecedented catalytic reactions proceeded smoothly at 0&#8201;&#176;C with HP(O)Ph2 and t&#8208;BuOOH leading to products in up to 96&#8201;% ee. The remarkable asymmetric radical reactions involved highly enantioselective internal delivery of vanadyl&#8208;bound alkoxide to the benzylic center with the coordinated phosphinoyl group in a radical homolytic substitution manner.







Abstract
A series of vanadyl complexes bearing 3&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo, 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo, 3,5&#8208;dihalo&#8208;, and benzo&#8208;fused N&#8208;salicylidene&#8208;tert&#8208;leucinates was examined as catalysts for 1,2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;phosphinoylation of 4&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 3,4&#8208;, and 3,5&#8208;substituted styrene derivatives (including Me/t&#8208;Bu, Ph, OR, Cl/Br, OAc, NO2, C(O)Me, CO2Me, CN, and benzo&#8208;fused) with HP(O)Ph2 in the presence of t&#8208;BuOOH (TBHP) in a given alcohol or cosolvent with MeOH. The best scenario involved the use of 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% 3&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;Br (i.e., 3&#8208;DMP&#8208;5&#8208;Br) catalyst at 0&#8201;&#176;C in MeOH. The desired catalytic cross coupling reactions proceeded smoothly with enantioselectivities of up to 95&#8201;% ee of (R)&#8208;configuration as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of several recrystallized products. The origin of enantiocontrol and homolytic substitution of the benzylic intermediates by vanadyl&#8208;bound methoxide and radical type catalytic mechanism were proposed.

         <title>Functional Ionic Liquid Polymer Stabilizer for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;liquid polymer additive (poly[Se&#8208;MI][BF4]) is developed to stabilize perovskite precursor inks used to fabricate perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). A chemical homogeneity of the inks contributes to improving the quality of perovskite films by stabilizing the colloids and compositions for over two months. Moreover, polymers anchored at the grain boundaries can further suppress the migration of I&#8722; ions. Thus, the pero&#8208;SCs exhibit overall improved stability and efficiency.







Abstract
The stability&#8208;related issues arising from the perovskite precursor inks, films, device structures and interdependence remain severely under&#8208;explored to date. Herein, we designed an ionic&#8208;liquid polymer (poly[Se&#8208;MI][BF4]), containing functional moieties like carbonyl (C=O), selenium (Se+), and tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ions, to stabilize the whole device fabrication process. The C=O and Se+ can coordinate with lead and iodine (I&#8722;) ions to stabilize lead polyhalide colloids and the compositions of the perovskite precursor inks for over two months. The Se+ anchored on grain boundaries and the defects passivated by BF4&#8722; efficiently suppress the dissociation and migration of I&#8722; in perovskite films. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of poly[Se&#8208;MI][BF4], high efficiencies of 25.10&#8201;% and 20.85&#8201;% were exhibited by a 0.062&#8208;cm2 device and 15.39&#8208;cm2 module, respectively. The devices retained over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency under operation for 2200&#8197;h.

A chiral metal&#8211;organic cage (MOC) was extended and fixed into a porous framework using a post&#8208;assembly modification strategy, which made it easier to study the host&#8211;guest chemistry of the solid&#8208;state MOC using a single&#8208;crystal diffraction technique. Anionic Ti4L6 (L=embonate) cage can be used as a 4&#8208;connecting crystal engineering tecton, and its optical resolution was achieved, thus homochiral &#916;&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208; and &#923;&#923;&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ti4L6] cages were obtained. Accordingly, a pair of homochiral cage&#8208;based microporous frameworks (PTC&#8208;236(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;236(&#923;)) were easily prepared by a post&#8208;assembly reaction. PTC&#8208;236 has rich recognition sites provided by the Ti4L6 moieties, chiral channels and high framework stability, affording a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation for guest structure analyses. Thus it was successfully utilized for the recognition and separation of isomeric molecules. This study provides a new approach for the orderly combination of well&#8208;defined MOCs into functional porous frameworks.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State THz Vibrations in Aggregates of PtII Complexes Contribute to the Enhancement of Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Efficiencies
</title>

A series of aggregate PtII complexes exhibits low&#8208;frequency (THz) excited&#8208;state vibrations measured by femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy and transient grating photoluminescence spectroscopy. These significant low&#8208;frequency vibronic displacements suppress non&#8208;radiative decay and enhance near&#8208;infrared emission efficiencies.







Abstract
The exploration of deactivation mechanisms for near&#8208;infrared(NIR)&#8208;emissive organic molecules has been a key issue in chemistry, materials science and molecular biology. In this study, based on transient absorption spectroscopy and transient grating photoluminescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the aggregated PtII complex 4H (efficient NIR emitter) exhibits collective out&#8208;of&#8208;plane motions with a frequency of 32&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (0.96&#8197;THz) in the excited states. Importantly, similar THz characteristics were also observed in analogous PtII complexes with prominent NIR emission efficiency. The conservation of THz motions enables excited&#8208;state deactivation to proceed along low&#8208;frequency vibrational coordinates, contributing to the suppression of nonradiative decay and remarkable NIR emission. These novel results highlight the significance of excited&#8208;state vibrations in nonradiative processes, which serve as a benchmark for improving device performance.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Application of a Water&#8208;soluble Photocage for Aqueous Cyclopentadiene&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder Photoclick Chemistry in Hydrogels</title>

A water&#8208;soluble cyclopentadienone&#8208;norbornadiene adduct is disclosed as a photocage for cyclopentadiene&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder photoclick chemistry. We show that this scalable CPD&#8211;NBD derivative can be incorporated into hydrogel formulations and commercial 3D printing resins, providing biocompatible hydrogels that can be patterned with maleimide bearing species upon 365&#8197;nm uncaging of cyclopentadiene.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally functionalized hydrogels have exciting applications in tissue engineering, but their preparation often relies on radical&#8208;based strategies that can be deleterious in biological settings. Herein, the computationally guided design, synthesis, and application of a water&#8208;soluble cyclopentadienone&#8208;norbornadiene (CPD&#8208;NBD) adduct is disclosed as a diene photocage for radical&#8208;free Diels&#8208;Alder photopatterning. We show that this scalable CPD&#8208;NBD derivative is readily incorporated into hydrogel formulations, providing gels that can be patterned with dienophiles upon 365&#8197;nm uncaging of cyclopentadiene. Patterning is first visualized through conjugation of cyanine dyes, then biological utility is highlighted by patterning peptides to direct cellular adhesion. Finally, the ease of use and versatility of this CPD&#8208;NBD derivative is demonstrated by direct incorporation into a commercial 3D printing resin to enable the photopatterning of structurally complex, printed hydrogels.

         <title>Direct &#960;&#8208;Activation vs. O&#8208;Activation in Halogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen Bond (XB) donors are under active development in organocatalysis. In analogy to Hydrogen Bond (HB) donors, they have been considered to activate most organic substrates through the O&#8208;complexation of carbonyl groups. Our results suggest that direct &#960;&#8208;activation (i.e., of the &#960;&#8208;bond involved in the reaction) can be dominant in many cases of XB catalysis, largely altering our view on this type of catalysis.







Abstract
Halogen bond donors had an increasing impact on catalysis in recent years, and their development is highly active. In particular, numerous iodine&#8208;based halogen bond donors have been developed and used to promote various reactions through coordinating carbonyl groups, a ubiquitous mode of activation in catalysis. We now report computational data which strongly suggests that an alternative activation mode, through direct &#960;&#8208;complexation, is operative for unsaturated carbonyl substrates. Calculations also suggest that solvent polarity could have a clear impact on the preference of the mode of activation, raising the possibility of a mechanistic manifold switch through solvent variation. These findings could profoundly impact the development of the next generation of halogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts.

         <title>Hydride&#8208;containing 2&#8208;Electron Pd/Cu Superatoms as Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>

The acid treatment of PdH2Cu14 leads to the transformation of a bicapped icosahedral Cu14 core into an uncomplete Cu11 (in PdHCu11) and a Cu12 (in PdHCu12) cuboctahedron, both of which are 2e superatoms. Electrochemical HER experiments indicate while PdHCu11, PdHCu12, and PdH2Cu14 are active catalysts, the stability and efficiency of PdHCu11 is much higher than those of PdHCu12 and PdH2Cu14.







Abstract
The first hydride&#8208;containing 2&#8208;electron palladium/copper alloys, [PdHCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)4] (PdHCu11) and [PdHCu12{S2P(OiPr)2}5{S2PO(OiPr)} (C&#8801;CPh)4] (PdHCu12), are synthesized from the reaction of [PdH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)6] (PdH2Cu14) with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the PdHCu11 and PdHCu12 kernels consist of a central PdH unit encapsulated within a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron and complete Cu12 cuboctahedron, respectively. DFT calculations indicate that both PdHCu11 and PdHCu12 can be considered as axially&#8208;distorted 2&#8208;electron superatoms. PdHCu11 shows excellent HER activity, unprecedented within metal nanoclusters, with an onset potential of &#8722;0.05&#8197;V (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a Tafel slope of 40&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and consistent HER activity during 1000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Our study suggests that the accessible central Pd site is the key to HER activity and may provide guidelines for correlating catalyst structures and HER activity.

A Rh+/H8&#8208;binap complex catalyzes the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of three unsymmetric 2&#960; components. The two&#8208;component [2+2+2] cycloaddition of two arylacetylenes and cis&#8208;enamides yields protected chiral cyclohexadienylamines. Replacing one arylacetylene with a silylacetylene enables the three&#8208;component [2+2+2] cycloaddition.







Abstract
We have developed the Rh+/H8&#8208;binap&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of three unsymmetric 2&#960; components. Thus, two arylacetylenes react with a cis&#8208;enamide to yield a protected chiral cyclohexadienylamine. Moreover, replacing one arylacetylene with a silylacetylene enables the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of three distinct unsymmetric 2&#960; components. These transformations proceed with excellent selectivity (complete regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity and up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Mechanistic studies suggest the chemo&#8208; and regioselective formation of a rhodacyclopentadiene intermediate from the two terminal alkynes.

         <title>Liquid Precursor&#8208;Guided Phase Engineering of Single&#8208;Crystal VO2 Beams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates the implications of liquid V2O5 precursor on the liquid&#8208;assisted growth of VO2 and further phase engineering of single&#8208;crystal VO2 beams between the M1&#8208;, M2&#8208;, and T&#8208;phases by manipulation of oxygen stoichiometry, enabling various multiphase structures in single VO2 beams and enriching the deformation modes for their actuation applications.







Abstract
The study of VO2 flourishes due to its rich competing phases induced by slight stoichiometry variations. However, the vague mechanism of stoichiometry manipulation makes the precise phase engineering of VO2 still challenging. Here, stoichiometry manipulation of single&#8208;crystal VO2 beams in liquid&#8208;assisted growth is systematically studied. Contrary to previous experience, oxygen&#8208;rich VO2 phases are abnormally synthesized under a reduced oxygen concentration, revealing the important function of liquid V2O5 precursor: It submerges VO2 crystals and stabilizes their stoichiometric phase (M1) by isolating them from the reactive atmosphere, while the uncovered crystals are oxidized by the growth atmosphere. By varying the thickness of liquid V2O5 precursor and thus the exposure time of VO2 to the atmosphere, various VO2 phases (M1, T, and M2) can be selectively stabilized. Furthermore, this liquid precursor&#8208;guided growth can be used to spatially manages multiphase structures in single VO2 beams, enriching their deformation modes for actuation applications.

         <title>Lithium Salt Dissociation Promoted by 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 Ether Additive toward Dilute Electrolytes for High Performance Lithium Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether additive regulates the solvation structure of electrolyte, prevents nucleophilic attack of reactive oxygen species on the solvent, and reduces the release of harmful gases. The solution&#8208;mediated mechanism is triggered to enhance the discharge capacity, and the anion&#8208;derived SEI protects Li anode to improve the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are well known for their high energy density. However, their reversibility and rate performance are challenged due to the sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, serious side reactions and uncontrollable Li dendrite growth. The electrolyte plays a key role in transport of Li+ and reactive oxygen species in LOBs. Here, we tailored a dilute electrolyte by screening suitable crown ether additives to promote lithium salt dissociation and Li+ solvation through electrostatic interaction. The electrolyte containing 100&#8197;mM 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether (100&#8208;18C6) exhibits enhanced electrochemical stability and triggers a solution&#8208;mediated Li2O2 growth pathway in LOBs, showing high discharge capacity of 10&#8201;828.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;gcarbon&#8722;1. Moreover, optimized electrode/electrolyte interfaces promote ORR/OER kinetics on cathode and achieve dendrite&#8208;free Li anode, which enhances the cycle life. This work casts new lights on the design of low&#8208;cost dilute electrolytes for high performance LOBs.

The electrolyte plays a key role in transport of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and reactive oxygen species in LOBs. Here, we tailored a dilute electrolyte by screening suitable crown ether additives to promote lithium salt dissociation and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation through electrostatic interaction. The electrolyte containing 100&#8197;mM 18-crown-6 ether (100-18C6) exhibits enhanced electrochemical stability and triggers a solution-mediated Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; growth pathway in LOBs, showing high discharge capacity of 10&#8201;828.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;carbon&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, optimized electrode/electrolyte interfaces promote ORR/OER kinetics on cathode and achieve dendrite-free Li anode, which enhances the cycle life. This work casts new lights on the design of low-cost dilute electrolytes for high performance LOBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>RAFT&#8208;Mediated Emulsion Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly for the Synthesis of Core&#8208;Degradable Waterborne Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulsion copolymerization of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) with either styrene or n&#8208;butyl acrylate was carried out in water to produce block copolymer nanoparticles via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA in emulsion. Hydrophilic blocks are either poly(N&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) or poly(ethylene glycol), two polymers largely used for their known biocompatibility. The degradability of the hydrophobic core block is ensured by in&#8208;chain cleavable thioester functions.







Abstract
Poly(N&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (PNAM)&#8208;decorated waterborne nanoparticles comprising a core of either degradable polystyrene (PS) or poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) (PBA) were synthesized by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in water. A PNAM bearing a trithiocarbonate chain end (PNAM&#8208;TTC) was extended via reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)&#8208;mediated emulsion copolymerization of either styrene (S) or n&#8208;butyl acrylate (BA) with dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT). Well&#8208;defined amphiphilic block copolymers were obtained. The in situ self&#8208;assembly of these polymers resulted in the formation of stable nanoparticles. The insertion of thioester units in the vinylic blocks enabled their degradation under basic conditions. The same strategy was then applied to the emulsion copolymerization of BA with DOT using a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) equipped with a trithiocarbonate end group, resulting in PEG&#8208;decorated nanoparticles with degradable PBA&#8208;based cores.

         <title>A LDH Template Triggers the Formation of a Highly Compact MIL&#8208;53 Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane for Acid Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A LDH nanoflake template layer triggers conversion into a highly compact MIL&#8208;53 membrane. The template guides MIL&#8208;53 crystals to replicate its imprint out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and modulates the availability of Al from the alumina support for in&#8208;plane growth of MIL&#8208;53. The membrane can achieve complete dewatering from azeotropic formic acid and save 77&#8201;% of the energy consumption compared to distillation.







Abstract
Highly compact metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes offer hope for the ambition to cope with challenging separation scenarios with industrial implications. A continuous layer of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes on an alumina support as a template triggered a chemical self&#8208;conversion to a MIL&#8208;53 membrane, with approximately 8 hexagonal lattices (LDH) traded for 1 orthorhombic lattice (MIL&#8208;53). With the sacrifice of the template, the availability of Al nutrients from the alumina support was dynamically regulated, which resulted in synergy for producing membranes with highly compact architecture. The membrane can realize nearly complete dewatering from formic acid and acetic acid solutions, respectively, and maintain stability in a continuous pervaporation over 200&#8197;h. This is the first success in directly applying a pure MOF membrane to such a corrosive chemical environment (lowest pH value of 0.81). The energy consumption is saved by up to 77&#8201;% when compared with the traditional distillation.

&lt;p&gt;A LDH nanoflake template layer triggers conversion into a highly compact MIL-53 membrane. The template guides MIL-53 crystals to replicate its imprint out-of-plane and modulates the availability of Al from the alumina support for in-plane growth of MIL-53. The membrane can achieve complete dewatering from azeotropic formic acid and save 77&#8201;% of the energy consumption compared to distillation.

The superior efficacy of aminopolycarboxylic acid conjugated lipid nanoparticles over standard liposomal nanoparticles is described by Juan Chen, Gang Zheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202218218). EDTA&#8211;lipid based nanoparticles fluidize the cell membrane in a detergent&#8208;like manner and improve delivery to the cell by 25&#8208;fold. This novel nanoparticle design feature can be deployed across lipid nanoparticles to accelerate cancer nanomedicine drug delivery.

The low&#8208;temperature conversion of Pd nanoclusters into Pd single atoms with the assistance of Cl ligands is illustrated by Tao Ding, Xiaokang Liu, Manzhou Zhu, Tao Yao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202218630). The Pd nanoclusters collapse when coordinated by Cl ligands, thus enabling the transformation to take place at low temperatures (400&#8201;&#176;C). This study sheds light on the rational design of atomically dispersed metal catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The low-temperature conversion&lt;/b&gt; of Pd nanoclusters into Pd single atoms with the assistance of Cl ligands is illustrated by Tao Ding, Xiaokang Liu, Manzhou Zhu, Tao Yao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202218630"&gt;(e202218630)&lt;/a&gt;. The Pd nanoclusters collapse when coordinated by Cl ligands, thus enabling the transformation to take place at low temperatures (400&#8201;&#176;C). This study sheds light on the rational design of atomically dispersed metal catalysts.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Salt Metathesis: Tetrafluoroborate Anion Rapidly Fluoridates Organoboronic Acids to give Organotrifluoroborates (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 16/2023)</title>

Salt metathesis and BFX (boron&#8211;fluoride exchange) of BF4&#8722; with boronic acids generates RBF3&#8722; derivatives, thus showing the solvolytic lability of BF4&#8722; that enables its use as a fluorinating agent, even though many highly reactive reagents employ BF4&#8722; as a non&#8208;reactive counteranion. In their Research Article (e202215371), David&#8197;M. Perrin and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of RBF3&#8722; derivatives via a salt metathesis reaction using a series of MBF4 salts in methanol. This work highlights the proclivity of BF4&#8722;, generally considered weakly coordinating and unreactive, to rapidly fluorinate boronic acids.

         <title>Stacking Cyclophanes into Chiral Microvessels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights a recent study by Oki and colleagues on stacking bespoke chiral cyclophanes via non&#8208;covalent interactions that enable to craft synchronous crystalline 3D chiral microvessels with controlled orientation and conformational arrangements without the help of a template. The microvessels bear stereocontrolled skeletal morphology, recognize stereoisomers, and serve as containers; this represents a remarkable illustration of molecular engineering.







Abstract
Engineering novel micro&#8208;/nanoscale systems and devices based on supramolecular assembly has tremendous potential from diverse applications perspective. However, controlling the size, shape, spatial arrangements, and hierarchical transcription by a dimensional organizing principle (1D&#8211;3D arrangement) without the help of templates remains a challenging task. In this vein, a recent study by Oki and colleagues reporting the stacking of chiral cyclophanes via intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions for crafting synchronous microcrystalline 3D chiral vessels with controlled conformational arrangements represents a truly remarkable illustration of molecular engineering. The microvessels bear stereocontrolled skeletal morphology, recognize stereoisomers and serve as containers to accommodate microcrystals, polymer particles, and fluorescent dyes. The full application scope of this fascinating research is far beyond non&#8208;covalent interactions, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, and crystal engineering.

         <title>Recent Developments on Understanding Charge Transfer in Molecular Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a few interesting topics on charge transfer (CT) in organic donor&#8208;acceptor systems, include the exciton confinement, symmetry breaking CT, detection of dark states in TADF emitters, discrimination of the singlet and triplet charge separated (CS) states, magnetic effect on charge transfer, determination of the electron exchange energy (J), electron spin transfer accompanying the CT process, and vibration modulated CT process.







Abstract
Charge transfer (CT) in molecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems is pivotal for artificial photosynthesis, photocatalysis, photovoltaics and fundamental photochemistry. We summarized the recent development in study of CT and discussed its application in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. The direct experimental proof of the spin multiplicity of the charge separated (CS) state with pulsed laser excited time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy was discussed. Experimental determination of the electron exchange energy (J) of the CS state, with magnetic field effect on its yield or lifetime was introduced. The electron spin transfer accompanying the CT, studied with pulsed EPR spectra was briefly discussed. Tuning of the CT yield and kinetics with selective vibration excitation of the linker (the bridge) with IR pulse was presented. Above all, these studies show that there are more fun than simply monitoring the formation of the cations and anions and the kinetics or CS yields in this area.

         <title>Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Different Coordination Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the properties of graphdiyne (GDY), the recent progress in the development of GDY&#8208;based atomic catalysts (ACs), especially their applications in energy conversion, and reveals the relationship between the coordination engineering of GDY&#8208;based ACs and their catalytic performance. Future challenges and opportunities are also discussed.







Abstract
As a special carbon material, graphdiyne (GDY) features the superiorities of incomplete charge transfer effect on the atomic level, tunable electronic structure and anchoring metal atoms directly with organometallic coordination bonds M (metal)&#8208;C (alkynyl carbon in GDY), providing it an ideal platform to construct single&#8208;atom catalysts (ACs). The coordination environment of single atoms anchored on GDY plays a key role in their catalytic performance. The mini&#8208;review highlights state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in the rational design of GDY&#8208;based ACs and their applications, and mainly reveals the relationship between the coordination engineering of the GDY&#8208;based ACs and corresponding catalytic performance. Finally, some prospects concerning the future development of GDY&#8208;based ACs in energy conversion are also discussed.

         <title>Macromolecular Information Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transfer of information from one macromolecule to another is a cornerstone of heredity, evolution, and Life. However, it is very difficult to achieve comparable mechanisms with manmade polymers. So far, artificial replication has mainly been demonstrated with small molecules with low information content. Here, we describe and categorize recent efforts that have been made to achieve macromolecular information transfer with synthetic polymers.







Abstract
Macromolecular information transfer can be defined as the process by which a coded monomer sequence is communicated from one macromolecule to another. In such a transfer process, the information sequence can be kept identical, transformed into a complementary sequence or even translated into a different molecular language. Such mechanisms are crucial in biology and take place in DNA&#8594;DNA replication, DNA&#8594;RNA transcription and RNA&#8594;protein translation. In fact, there would be no life on Earth without macromolecular information transfer. Mimicking such processes with synthetic macromolecules would also be of major scientific relevance because it would open up new avenues for technological applications (e.g. data storage and processing) but also for the creation of artificial life. In this important context, this minireview summarizes recent research about information transfer in synthetic oligomers and polymers. Medium&#8208; and long&#8208;term perspectives are also discussed.

         <title>Innovative Electrochemical Strategies for Hydrogen Production: From Electricity Input to Electricity Output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent developments on innovative electrochemical strategies for H2 production. The main focus is on decoupling electrocatalytic H2 production with suitable redox mediators and coupling with other alternative reactions. Novel routes for H2 production at both anode and cathode and even with electricity output are discussed. Finally, existing challenges and perspectives are provided for future development of the research field.







Abstract
Renewable H2 production by water electrolysis has attracted much attention due to its numerous advantages. However, the energy consumption of conventional water electrolysis is high and mainly driven by the kinetically inert anodic oxygen evolution reaction. An alternative approach is the coupling of different half&#8208;cell reactions and the use of redox mediators. In this review, we, therefore, summarize the latest findings on innovative electrochemical strategies for H2 production. First, we address redox mediators utilized in water splitting, including soluble and insoluble species, and the corresponding cell concepts. Second, we discuss alternative anodic reactions involving organic and inorganic chemical transformations. Then, electrochemical H2 production at both the cathode and anode, or even H2 production together with electricity generation, is presented. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects for the future development of this research field are highlighted.

         <title>Spectroscopy vs. Electrochemistry: Catalyst Layer Thickness Effects on Operando/In Situ Measurements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando/in situ spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies often require high loadings and thick catalyst layers (CLs) leading to large ion&#8208; and mass&#8208;transport limitations. In this study we investigate PdH&#8208;formation in two Pd&#8208;catalysts with similar surface areas but drastically different morphologies. Our results unveil that the CL&#8208;thickness largely determines the PdH formation trends calling for the minimization of the CL&#8208;thickness in such experiments.







Abstract
In recent years, operando/in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has become an important tool in the electrocatalysis community. However, the high catalyst loadings often required to acquire XA&#8208;spectra with a satisfactory signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio frequently imply the use of thick catalyst layers (CLs) with large ion&#8208; and mass&#8208;transport limitations. To shed light on the impact of this variable on the spectro&#8208;electrochemical results, in this study we investigate Pd&#8208;hydride formation in carbon&#8208;supported Pd&#8208;nanoparticles (Pd/C) and an unsupported Pd&#8208;aerogel with similar Pd surface areas but drastically different morphologies and electrode packing densities. Our in situ XAS and rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements with different loadings unveil that the CL&#8208;thickness largely determines the hydride formation trends inferred from spectro&#8208;electrochemical experiments, therewith calling for the minimization of the CL&#8208;thickness in such experiments and the use of complementary thin&#8208;film control measurements.

         <title>Experimental Determination of an Isolated trans&#8208;Dinitrosyl Manganese(II) Heme Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structure of a trans&#8208;dinitrosyl porphyrin complex [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] is reported. The complex was also characterized by FT&#8208;IR, EPR and DRIFT spectroscopy. The six&#8208;coordinate [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] complex shows distinct structural and spectroscopic features, including a much longer axial Mn&#8722;NNO bond and a higher NO stretching bond position than those of five&#8208;coordinate mononitrosyl analogues, as well as an isotropic resonance at g = 2.0.







Abstract
The lack of direct proof in either natural or synthetic systems for trans&#8208;dinitrosyl hemes, a key intermediate in the reactions of heme proteins (e.g. soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), cytochrome c&#8242; and So H&#8208;NOX) with nitric oxide (NO), has hampered understanding of the exact reaction mechanisms, such as the formation of the five&#8208;coordinate heme complex with NO at the proximal side (5c NOP). Herein, we report the first isolation of a dinitrosyl metalloporphyrin complex, the six&#8208;coordinate, low&#8208;spin {Mn(NO)2}7 species [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] (TPP2&#8722;=meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin dianion). The complex shows distinct features, such as an elongated axial bond (1.877(9) vs. 1.641(5)&#8197;&#197;), a higher NO stretching bond position (1760 vs. 1735&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and an isotropic resonance at g = 2.0, in sharp contrast to those of five&#8208;coordinate mononitrosyl analogues. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) and EPR studies provided deep insight into the reaction processes, demonstrating different responses of porphyrinates to NO.

         <title>ATRP Enhances Structural Correlations In Polymerization&#8208;Induced Phase Separation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled&#8208;radical polymerization in the solid state is used to induce and arrest the phase separation of highly structurally correlated inclusions. The obtained solid structure is durable and has low size dispersity. It is possible to tune the length scale spontaneously emerging in the system by modifying the synthesis parameters.







Abstract
Synthetic methods to control the structure of materials at sub&#8208;micron scales are typically based on the self&#8208;assembly of structural building blocks with precise size and morphology. On the other hand, many living systems can generate structure across a broad range of length scales in one step directly from macromolecules, using phase separation. Here, we introduce and control structure at the nano&#8208; and microscales through polymerization in the solid state, which has the unusual capability of both triggering and arresting phase separation. In particular, we show that atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) enables control of nucleation, growth, and stabilization of phase&#8208;separated poly&#8208;methylmethacrylate (PMMA) domains in a solid polystyrene (PS) matrix. ATRP yields durable nanostructures with low size dispersity and high degrees of structural correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the length scale of these materials is controlled by the synthesis parameters.

         <title>A Fourfold Gold(I)&#8722;Aryl Macrocycle with Hyperbolic Geometry and its Reductive Elimination to a Carbon Nanoring Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conformationally flexible [6]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene derivative that can adopt a &#8220;chair&#8221; or a &#8220;boat&#8221; conformation and a rigid dinuclear gold(I) complex have been shown to form a metallacycle with a square geometry. Reductive elimination results in an all&#8208;organic nanoring with a large inner cavity that is suitable for the supramolecular binding of several guests with convex &#960;&#8208;surfaces.







Abstract
An ethylene glycol&#8208;decorated [6]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene (CMP) macrocycle was synthesized and utilized as a subunit to construct a fourfold AuI2&#8722;aryl metallacycle with an overall square arrangement. The corners consist of rigid dinuclear gold(I) complexes previously known to form only triangular metallacycles. The interplay between the conformational flexibility of the [6]CMP macrocycle and the rigid dinuclear gold(I) moieties enable the square geometry, as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The formation of the gold complex shows size&#8208;selectivity compared to an alternative route using platinum(II) corner motifs. Upon reductive elimination, an all&#8208;organic ether&#8208;decorated carbon nanoring was obtained. Investigation as a host for the complexation of large guest molecules with a suitable convex &#960;&#8208;surfaces was accomplished using isothermal NMR binding titrations. Association constants for [6]cycloparaphenylene ([6]CPP), [7]CPP, C60, and C70 were determined.

         <title>A Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Scalable Synthesis and Optimal Adsorption and Desorption for Energy&#8208;Efficient Ethylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel durable metal&#8208;organic framework ZU&#8208;901 with an ideal &#8220;S&#8221; shaped adsorption curve exhibits optimal adsorption and desorption behavior. It satisfies the basic criteria for potential industrial application: easy scale&#8208;up, low cost, and high stability. Benefiting from the continuous rapid ethylene/ethane adsorption&#8208;desorption performance, it is shown to be promising in the pressure&#8208;swing adsorption of ethylene and ethane.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative, but its advancement has been hindered by the challenge of industrially potential adsorbents development. Herein, a novel ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8208;organic framework ZU&#8208;901 is designed that satisfies the basic criteria raised by ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) pressure swing adsorption (PSA). ZU&#8208;901 exhibits an &#8220;S&#8221; shaped C2H4 curve with high sorbent selection parameter (65) and could be mildly regenerated. Through green aqueous&#8208;phase synthesis, ZU&#8208;901 is easily scalable with 99&#8201;% yield, and it is stable in water, acid, basic solutions and cycling breakthrough experiments. Polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (99.51&#8201;%) could be obtained via a simulating two&#8208;bed PSA process, and the corresponding energy consumption is only 1/10 of that of simulating cryogenic distillation. Our work has demonstrated the great potential of pore engineering in designing porous materials with desired adsorption and desorption behavior to implement an efficient PSA process.

         <title>Effector Regulated Catalytic Cyclization of Alkynoic Acids Using Pt2L4 Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt2L4 cages are found to catalyze the cyclization of alkynoic acids. The reaction rates are depending on effector guests bound in the cage, leading to an enhancement of the catalytic rate by up to 19&#8208;fold or a decrease by 5&#8208;fold. In contrast to this effector&#8208;controlled rate enhancement using the binding pocket of Pt2L4, the molecular analogue PtL4 displays no significant changes in catalytic rate. By effector induced rate changes of cage catalyzed reactions, unexpected new reactivity and complex autoregulation comes in sight.







Abstract
Metabolic pathways are highly regulated by effector molecules that influences the rate of enzymatic reactions. Inspired by the catalytic regulation found in living cells, we report a Pt2L4 cage of which the activity can be controlled by effectors that bind inside the cage. The cage shows catalytic activity in the lactonization of alkynoic acids, with the reaction rates dependent on the effector guest bound in the cage. Some effector guests enhance the rate of the lactonization by up to 19&#8208;fold, whereas one decreases it by 5&#8208;fold. When mixtures of specific substrates are used, both starting materials and products act as guests for the Pt2L4 cage, enhancing its catalytic activity for one substrate while reducing its activity for the other. The reported regulatory behavior obtained by the addition of effector molecules paves the way to the development of more complex, metabolic&#8208;like catalyst systems.

         <title>Molecular Alignment&#8208;Induced Chemically Patchy Uniaxial Nanoparticles and Their Applications in Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Self&#8208;Assembled Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable particle patches were created by controlling the alignment of the molecules that form particles, and chemically patchy uniaxial nanoparticles were synthesized by synchronous polymerization and crystallization of liquid crystal monomers during precipitation polymerization. The resulting patchy particles have intriguing optical properties and show attractive applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and the construction of superstructures.







Abstract
We report an unusual strategy for synthesizing patchy nanoparticles (NPs) by controlling the orientation of the molecules that form the NPs. This is realized by synchronous polymerization and crystallization of liquid crystal (LC) monomers during scalable precipitation polymerization. The resulting NPs are cylinders with highly uniform shapes and have only a single LC domain. The patchy properties originate from the discrepancy of surface chemical compositions on flat and side surfaces and can be switched on and off by solvent. Extra colloidal blocks can be grown onto the patches, resulting in highly uniform triblock patchy dumbbells, which have integrated optical properties, and as demonstrated, show triple&#8208;mode optical authentication in anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels or patterns. We also demonstrate that the triblock patchy cylinders are attractive building blocks for long LC rods or porous colloidal materials through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>pH&#8208; and Redox&#8208;Responsive Pickering Emulsions Based on Cellulose Nanocrystal Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of the electrostatic interactions between sulfated cellulose nanocrystals (CNC&#8208;OSO3&#8722;) and ferrocenium terminated polystyrene (PS&#8208;Fc+) at the oil&#8208;water interface has resulted in a new type of smart surfactant, termed CNC surfactants. pH&#8208; and redox responsive Pickering emulsions have been achieved by using the CNC surfactants as emulsifiers, with promising applications in encapsulation, biocatalysis, and micro&#8208;reactions.







Abstract
Nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs), formed by using dynamic interactions between nanoparticles and complementary ligands at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface, have emerged as &#8220;smart emulsifiers&#8221; with attributes of high emulsification efficiency, long&#8208;term stability, and on&#8208;demand emulsification/demulsification capabilities. However, only pH&#8208;responsiveness can be adopted for the assembly of reported NPSs formed by electrostatic interactions. Here, we propose an alternative design strategy, by taking advantage of the ferrocenium (Fc+) sulfate ion pair, to develop a new type of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) surfactant. The Fc+ groups are sensitive to pH, redox reagents and voltage, imparting the CNC surfactants and derived Pickering emulsions with multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and showing promising applications in controllable delivery, release, and biphasic biocatalysis.

     alt="pH- and Redox-Responsive Pickering Emulsions Based on Cellulose Nanocrystal Surfactants"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the electrostatic interactions between sulfated cellulose nanocrystals (CNC-OSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and ferrocenium terminated polystyrene (PS-Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) at the oil-water interface has resulted in a new type of smart surfactant, termed CNC surfactants. pH- and redox responsive Pickering emulsions have been achieved by using the CNC surfactants as emulsifiers, with promising applications in encapsulation, biocatalysis, and micro-reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs), formed by using dynamic interactions between nanoparticles and complementary ligands at the liquid-liquid interface, have emerged as &#8220;smart emulsifiers&#8221; with attributes of high emulsification efficiency, long-term stability, and on-demand emulsification/demulsification capabilities. However, only pH-responsiveness can be adopted for the assembly of reported NPSs formed by electrostatic interactions. Here, we propose an alternative design strategy, by taking advantage of the ferrocenium (Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) sulfate ion pair, to develop a new type of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) surfactant. The Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups are sensitive to pH, redox reagents and voltage, imparting the CNC surfactants and derived Pickering emulsions with multi-stimuli-responsiveness, and showing promising applications in controllable delivery, release, and biphasic biocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Quantitative Preparation of Short Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Circles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of splint strands allows for the near&#8208;quantitative monomeric cyclization of single DNA strands as short as 16 bases long by DNA T4 ligase. Circular DNA molecules have enhanced chemical stability in biological fluids, therefore, this work could facilitate a wide range of biomedical applications for single&#8208;stranded, short nucleic acids.







Abstract
Small, single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) circles have many applications, such as templating rolling circle amplification (RCA), capturing microRNAs, and scaffolding DNA nanostructures. However, it is challenging to prepare such ssDNA circles, particularly when the DNA size becomes very small (e.g. a 20 nucleotide (nt) long ssDNA circle). Often, such short ssDNA dominantly form concatemers (either linear or circular) due to intermolecular ligation, instead of forming monomeric ssDNA circles by intramolecular ligation. Herein, a simple method to overcome this problem by designing the complementary linker molecules is reported. It is demonstrated that ssDNA, as short as 16&#8197;nts, can be enzymatically ligated (by the commonly used T4 DNA ligase) into monomeric ssDNA circles at high concentration (100&#8197;&#956;M) with high yield (97&#8201;%). This method does not require any special sequence, thus, it is expected to be generally applicable. The experimental protocol is identical to regular DNA ligation, thus, is expected to be user friendly for general chemists and biologists.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Imaging of Cells and Sub&#8208;Cellular Entities by Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report on label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy using exceptionally low concentrations (nano&#8208; to picomolar) of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore. This work addresses the central issue of the minimal concentration of the ECL luminophore required to image single entities such as cells or mitochondria.







Abstract
Here we report on a label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy using exceptionally low concentrations of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore. This work addresses the central point of the minimal concentration of the ECL luminophore required to image single entities. We demonstrate the possibility to record ECL images of cells and mitochondria at concentrations down to nM and pM. This is 7 orders of magnitude lower than classically&#8208;used concentrations and corresponds to a few hundreds of luminophores diffusing around the biological entities. Yet, it produces remarkably sharp negative optical contrast ECL images, as demonstrated by structural similarity index metric analyses and supported by predictions of the ECL image covering time. Finally, we show that the reported approach is a simple, fast, and highly sensitive method, which opens new avenues for ultrasensitive ECL imaging and ECL reactivity at the single molecule level.

Cothermolysis of Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta(CO)4 with white phosphorus (P4) results in the formation of [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P8)], whose cyclooctatetraene&#8208;like (COT) cyclo&#8208;P8 ligand is the largest monocyclic polyphosphorus species observed to date. The reactivity and electrochemical properties of this exotic species are explored, furnishing unique polyphosphorus species of unprecedented size.







Abstract
The thermolysis of Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta(CO)4 with white phosphorus (P4) gives access to [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P8)] (A), representing the first complex containing a cyclooctatetraene&#8208;like (COT) cyclo&#8208;P8 ligand. While ring sizes of n &gt;6 have remained elusive for cyclo&#8208;Pn structural motifs, the choice of the transition metal, co&#8208;ligand and reaction conditions allowed the isolation of A. Reactivity investigations reveal its versatile coordination behaviour as well as its redox properties. Oxidation leads to dimerization to afford [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}4(&#956;4,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P16)][TEF]2 (4, TEF=[Al(OC{CF3}3)4]&#8722;). Reduction, however, leads to the fission of one P&#8722;P bond in A followed by rapid dimerization to form [K@[2.2.2]cryptand]2[{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}4(&#956;4,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P16)] (5), which features an unprecedented chain&#8208;type P16 ligand. Lastly, A serves as a P2 synthon, via ring contraction to the triple&#8208;decker complex [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}2(&#956;,&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8208;P6)] (B).

         <title>A Zeolite&#8208;Like Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Based Membrane for Reverse Selective Hydrogen Separation and Butane Isomer Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (ZMOF) with an underlying ana topology is reported for the first time as a thin&#8208;film membrane. The ana&#8208;ZMOF membrane possesses high CO2 and butane permeabilities with high sorption CO2/H2 and diffusion C4/i&#8208;C4 selectivities. This new membrane is a promising candidate for application in the areas of high purity H2 production and butane isomer separation.







Abstract
Here, the fabrication of a defect&#8208;free membrane that is based on a zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (ZMOF) with the underlying ana topology is reported. The unique ana&#8208;ZMOF structure provides high degree of pore connectivity, which is reflected by the fast transport of gases. Prominently, it offers an optimum pore&#8208;aperture size, affording notable sieving selectivity for butane/isobutane, and optimal pore energetics for reverse CO2/H2 separation. This emphasize the potential for the application of pure MOF membranes, paving the way to more sustainability of energy resources.

         <title>Expanding the Promiscuity of a Copper&#8208;Dependent Oxidase for Enantioselective Cross&#8208;Coupling of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic promiscuity of a copper oxidase was expanded to accommodate new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 3&#8208;hydroxyindole esters with various nucleophiles. The resulting functionalized 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones showed excellent optical purity as well as anticancer activity.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the highly enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 3&#8208;hydroxyindole esters with various nucleophilic partners as catalyzed by copper efflux oxidase. The biocatalytic transformation delivers functionalized 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with excellent optical purity (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee), which exhibited anticancer activity against MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell lines, as shown by preliminary biological evaluation. Mechanistic studies and molecular docking results suggest the formation of a phenoxyl radical and enantiocontrol facilitated by a suited enzyme chiral pocket. This study is significant with regard to expanding the catalytic repertoire of natural multicopper oxidases as well as enlarging the synthetic toolbox for sustainable asymmetric oxidative coupling.

         <title>Copper(I) Photocatalyzed Bromonitroalkylation of Olefins: Evidence for Highly Efficient Inner&#8208;Sphere Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic bromonitroalkylations of activated and unactivated olefins with broad scope become possible in the presence of CuI&#8208;photocatalysts. The key to success for this transformation is the highly efficient interaction of CuII with radical intermediates, which can even outperform a highly favorable cyclization of a transient to a persistent radical.







Abstract
We report the visible light&#8208;mediated copper&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of olefins utilizing bromonitroalkanes as ATRA reagents. This protocol is characterized by high yields and fast reaction times under environmentally benign reaction conditions with exceptional scope, allowing the rapid functionalization of both activated and unactivated olefins. Moreover, late&#8208;stage functionnalization of biologically active molecules and upscaling to gram quantities is demonstrated, which offers manifold possibilities for further transformations, e.g. access to nitro&#8208; and aminocyclopropanes. Besides the synthetic utility of the title transformation, this study undergirds the exclusive role of copper in photoredox catalysis showing its ability to stabilize and interact with radical intermediates in its coordination sphere. EPR studies suggest that such interactions can even outperform a highly favorable cyclization of transient to persistent radicals contrasting iridium&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Double Deprotonation of CH3CN by an Iron&#8208;Aluminium Complex
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double deprotonation of CH3CN was achieved using an iron&#8208;aluminium complex, yielding products containing a simple yet rare [HC=C=N]2&#8722; dianion, characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT calculations suggest that the mechanism proceeds via a stepwise double deprotonation of the substrate by two equivalents of the bimetallic complex, with the intermediacy of a [NCCH2]&#8722; anion, which was observed spectroscopically in situ.







Abstract
Herein we present the first double deprotonation of acetonitrile (CH3CN) using two equivalents of a bimetallic iron&#8208;aluminium complex. The products of this reaction contain an exceeding simple yet rare [CHCN]2&#8722; dianion moiety that bridges two metal fragments. DFT calculations suggest that the bonding to the metal centres occurs through heavily polarised covalent interactions. Mechanistic studies reveal the intermediacy of a monomeric [CH2CN]&#8722; complex, which has been characterised in situ. Our findings provide an important example in which a bimetallic metal complex achieves a new type of reactivity not previously encountered with monometallic counterparts.[1,&#8201;2] The isolation of a [CHCN]2&#8722; dianion through simple deprotonation of CH3CN also offers the possibility of establishing a broader chemistry of this motif.

         <title>High&#8208;Porosity Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glasses</title>

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glasses of carboxylate linkages were synthesized by reacting Ti&#8208;oxo clusters with carboxylic acid linkers. The activated MOF glass showed a N2 Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface area of 923&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly three times as high as the phenolate&#8208;linked MOF glass with the highest BET surface area prior to this report.







Abstract
We report a synthetic strategy to link titanium&#8208;oxo (Ti&#8208;oxo) clusters into metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glasses with high porosity though the carboxylate linkage. A new series of MOF glasses was synthesized by evaporation of solution containing Ti&#8208;oxo clusters Ti16O16(OEt)32, linkers, and m&#8208;cresol. The formation of carboxylate linkages between the Ti&#8208;oxo clusters and the carboxylate linkers was confirmed by Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy. The structural integrity of the Ti&#8208;oxo clusters within the glasses was evidenced by both X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and 17O magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR. After ligand exchange and activation, the fumarate&#8208;linked MOF glass, termed Ti&#8208;Fum, showed a N2 Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface areas of 923&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly three times as high as the phenolate&#8208;linked MOF glass with the highest BET surface area prior to this report.

         <title>An Electrochemical Nanosensor for Monitoring the Dynamics of Intracellular H2O2 Upon NADH Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A H2O2&#8208;selective nanoelectrode is reported to monitor the dynamics of H2O2 produced by NADH treatment, indicating the potential tumor suppressor role of NADH. This work not only provides a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer therapy, but also offers a powerful technique to screen the cancer treatment.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;based therapeutic strategies play an important role in cancer treatment. However, in situ, real&#8208;time and quantitative analysis of intracellular ROS in cancer treatment for drug screening is still a challenge. Herein we report one selective hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemical nanosensor, which is prepared by electrodeposition of Prussian blue (PB) and polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) onto carbon fiber nanoelectrode. With the nanosensor, we find that the level of intracellular H2O2 increases with NADH treatment and that increase is dose&#8208;dependent to the concentration of NADH. High&#8208;dose of NADH (above 10&#8197;mM) can induce cell death and intratumoral injection of NADH is validated for inhibiting tumor growth in mice. This study highlights the potential of electrochemical nanosensor for tracking and understanding the role of H2O2 in screening new anticancer drug.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Sulfimides through the O&#8208;Alkylation of Enantioenriched Sulfinamides and Addition of Carbon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral sulfimides were synthesized by an unusual oxygen&#8208;selective alkylation of readily available enantioenriched sulfinamides and the subsequent nucleophilic addition of Grignard reagents. This transformation enables access to the various enantioenriched chiral sulfimides including diaryl or dialkyl sulfimides bearing two similar carbon substituents.







Abstract
Chiral sulfimides, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfoxides, are valuable compounds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient method for preparing chiral sulfimides from easily available enantioenriched sulfinamides. The key step of this method is a stereospecific oxygen&#8208;selective alkylation of enantioenriched sulfinamides, which is accomplished by using isopropyl iodide, K2CO3, and DMPU. The resulting chiral sulfinimidate esters are transformed to chiral sulfimides by the nucleophilic addition of the Grignard reagents under simple conditions. This transformation enables access to the enantioenriched diaryl or dialkyl sulfimides bearing two similar carbon substituents, which are difficult to synthesize by previous methods.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenolysis of Aryl Triflates for Construction of Axially Chiral Biaryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis of aryl triflates through desymmetrization and kinetic resolution that allows the facile construction of axially chiral biaryl scaffolds with excellent results. These chiral compounds could be further converted into chiral monophosphine ligands, which were then used in asymmetric allylic alkylation to produce the desired product with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Here we report the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis of readily available aryl triflates via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution for facile construction of axially chiral biaryl scaffolds with excellent enantioselectivities and s selectivity factors. The axially chiral monophosphine ligands could be prepared from these chiral biaryl compounds and were further applied to palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation with excellent ee values and high branched and linear ratio, which demonstrated the potential utility of this methodology.

The unprecedented 8&#8208;alkyl octahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;5,8&#8208;methanofuro[2,3&#8208;b]azepin&#8208;8&#8208;ium motif was generated by intramolecular nucleophilic addition of the tertiary amine nitrogen atom to the oxonium generated in situ from a hemiacetal.

Abstract
A divergent asymmetric total synthesis of voacafricines A and B, hexacyclic monoterpene indole alkaloids, has been accomplished featuring the following key steps: a)&#8197;a catalyst&#8208;controlled asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of 6&#8208;methoxytryptamine with a chiral &#945;&#8208;ketoester affording a 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline in excellent yield and diastereoselectivity; b)&#8197;oxidative cleavage of a 3,5&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene furnishing a dialdehyde intermediate, which was effectively differentiated through spontaneous cyclization with the neighboring hydroxy and secondary amine functions; c)&#8197;intramolecular nucleophilic addition of a tertiary amino nitrogen atom to the in situ generated oxonium species generating stereoselectively an unprecedented 8&#8208;alkyl octahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;5,8&#8208;methanofuro[2,3&#8208;b]azepin&#8208;8&#8208;ium motif bearing five contiguous stereocenters. The synthesis confirmed the absolute configuration of these two natural products.

         <title>A Double&#8208;Walled Tetrahedron with AgI4 Vertices Binds Different Guests in Distinct Sites
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 16, April 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise [Ag4X]3+ (X=I, Br, or Cl) clusters have been incorporated at the vertices of a double&#8208;walled tetrahedron. The cage binds guests in two distinct modes: small aromatic guests bind externally, and anionic guests bind in the central cavity. Halide ions bound to the silver clusters were observed to exchange in a well&#8208;defined hierarchy, with a preference found for the softer halides.







Abstract
A double&#8208;walled tetrahedral metal&#8208;organic cage assembled in solution from silver(I), 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, halide, and a threefold&#8208;symmetric triamine. The AgI4X clusters at its vertices each bring together six naphthyridine&#8208;imine moieties, leading to a structure in which eight tritopic ligands bridge four clusters in an (AgI4X)4L8 arrangement. Four ligands form an inner set of tetrahedron walls that are surrounded by the outer four. The cage has significant interior volume, and was observed to bind anionic guests. The structure also possesses external binding clefts, located at the edges of the cage, which bound small aromatic guests. Halide ions bound to the silver clusters were observed to exchange in a well&#8208;defined hierarchy, allowing modulation of the cavity volume. The principles uncovered here may allow for increasingly more sophisticated cages with silver&#8208;cluster vertex architectures, with post&#8208;assembly tuning of the interior cavity volume enabling targeted binding behavior.

         <title>A Fused [5]Helicene Dimer with a Figure&#8208;Eight Topology: Synthesis, Chiral Resolution, and Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons are promising chiroptical materials; their synthesis, however, remains a big challenge. Herein, we report the facile synthesis and chiral resolution of a double&#8208;stranded figure&#8208;eight carbon nanobelt 1 in which two [5]helicene units are fused together. Two synthetic routes were developed, and particularly, a strategy involving Suzuki coupling&#8208;mediated macrocyclization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ether turned out to be the most efficient. The structure of 1 was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The isolated (P,P)&#8210; and (M,M)&#8210; enantiomers show persistent chiroptical properties with relatively large dissymmetric factors (|gabs| = 5.4&#180;10&#8208;3 and |glum| = 1.0&#180;10&#8208;2), which can be explained by the effective electron delocalization along the fully conjugated belt and the unique D2 symmetry. 1 exhibits local aromatic character with a dominant structure containing eight Clar&#8217;s aromatic sextet rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitope Imprinting of Phospholipids by Oriented Assembly at the Oil/Water Interface for the Selective Recognition of Plasma Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imprinting strategy for targeting the polar epitope of phospholipids was developed based on reversed phase microemulsion oriented molecular imprinting. The prepared phospholipid&#8208;MIP can specifically recognize plasma membranes via a phospholipid exposed on the outer leaflet and thus differentiate physiological conditions of cells such as apoptosis, providing an alternative tool for targeted drug delivery and theranostics.







Abstract
Phospholipids, as fundamental building blocks of the cell membrane, play important roles for molecule transportation, cell recognition, etc. However, due to the structural diversity and amphipathic nature, there are few methods for the specific recognition of lipids as compared to other biomolecules such as proteins and glycans. Herein, we developed a molecular imprinting strategy for controllable imprinting toward the polar head of phospholipid exposed on the surface of cellular membranes for recognition. Phosphatidylserine, as unique lipid on the outer membrane leaflet of exosome and also hallmark for cell apoptosis, was imprinted with the developed method. The phosphatidylserine imprinted materials showed high efficiency and specific targeting capability not only for apoptotic cell imaging but also for the isolation of exosomes. Collectively, the synthesized molecularly imprinted materials have great potential for selective plasma membrane recognition for targeted drug delivery and biomarker discovery.

         <title>Stochastic Bullvalene Architecture Modulates Structural Rigidity in &#960;&#8208;Rich Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bullvalene, a shape&#8208;shifting molecular cage, is incorporated into a pi&#8208;rich polymer backbone to modulate chain architecture. Stochastic bullvalene isomers within the backbone lead to a kinked chain architecture and decreased thermal transitions that are tunable based on percent bullvalene incorporation.







Abstract
The synthesis and processing of &#960;&#8208;rich polymers found in novel electronics and textiles is difficult because chain stiffness leads to low solubility and high thermal transitions. The incorporation of &#8220;shape&#8208;shifting&#8221; molecular cages into &#960;&#8208;rich backbone provides an ensemble of structural kinks to modulate chain architecture via a self&#8208;contained library of valence isomers. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of (bullvalene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene)s that feature smaller persistence lengths than a prototypical rigid rod polymer, poly(p&#8208;phenylene).

     alt="Stochastic Bullvalene Architecture Modulates Structural Rigidity in &#960;-Rich Macromolecules"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullvalene, a shape-shifting molecular cage, is incorporated into a pi-rich polymer backbone to modulate chain architecture. Stochastic bullvalene isomers within the backbone lead to a kinked chain architecture and decreased thermal transitions that are tunable based on percent bullvalene incorporation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and processing of &#960;-rich polymers found in novel electronics and textiles is difficult because chain stiffness leads to low solubility and high thermal transitions. The incorporation of &#8220;shape-shifting&#8221; molecular cages into &#960;-rich backbone provides an ensemble of structural kinks to modulate chain architecture via a self-contained library of valence isomers. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of (bullvalene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene)s that feature smaller persistence lengths than a prototypical rigid rod polymer, poly(&lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;phenylene). By varying the amount of bullvalene incorporation within a poly(&lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;phenylene) chain (0&#8211;50&#8201;%), we can tune thermal properties and solution-state conformation. These features are caused by stochastic bullvalene isomers within the polymer backbone that result in kinked architectures. Synthetically, bullvalene incorporation offers a facile method to decrease structural rigidity within &#960;-rich materials without concomitant crystallization. VT&#8197;NMR experiments confirm that these materials remain dynamic in solution, offering the opportunity for future stimuli-responsive applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Utilization of Black Phosphorus Nanosheets to Enhance Palladium&#8208;Mediated Bioorthogonal Catalytic Activity for Activation of Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is applied to enhance palladium&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity by using a powerful partner: black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, which can accelerate the transformation of Pd2+ to Pd0 to boost the reaction cycle, thus achieving a superior decaging efficiency of prodyes and prodrugs.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed chemistry has played a significant role in the growing subfield of bioorthogonal catalysis. However, rationally designing Pd nanocatalysts that show outstanding catalytic activity and good biocompatibility poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy through exploiting black phosphorous nanosheets (BPNSs) to enhance Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity. Firstly, the electron&#8208;donor properties of BPNSs enable in situ growth of Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on it. Meanwhile, due to the superb capability of reducing PdII, BPNSs can act as hard nucleophiles to accelerate the transmetallation in the decaging reaction process. Secondly, the lone pair electrons of BPNSs can firmly anchor PdNPs on their surface via Pd&#8722;P bonds. This design endows Pd/BP with the capability to retard tumor growth by activating prodrugs. This work proposes new insights into the design of heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts (TMCs) for bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <dc:description>
A virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) model to automatically search the chemical space containing over 420&#8201;000 candidates to identify promising AEMs with highly chemical stability.







Abstract
Without insight into the correlation between the structure and properties, anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for fuel cells are developed usually using the empirical trial and error method or simulation methods. Here, a virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) approach, which does not require the establishment of expensive training databases and can search the chemical space containing more than 4.2&#215;105 candidates was proposed. The accuracy of the V&#8208;MCES model was considerably improved when the model was combined with supervised learning for the feature selection of molecular descriptors. Techniques from V&#8208;MCES, correlating the molecular structures of the AEMs with the predicted chemical stability, generated a ranking list of potential high stability AEMs. Under the guidance of V&#8208;MCES, highly stable AEMs were synthesized. With understanding of AEM structure and performance by machine learning, AEM science may enter a new era of unprecedented levels of architectural design.

         <title>Branched Multimeric Peptides as Affinity Reagents for the Detection of &#945;&#8208;Klotho Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Klotho recognizing branched peptides were prepared via parallel automated fast&#8208;flow synthesis. The branched peptide binders show at least a 30&#8208;fold improvement in affinity relative to the monomeric versions, can be used to study Klotho engagement by pull&#8208;down from cell lysates, and label Klotho for live imaging in kidney cells.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Klotho, an aging&#8208;related protein found in the kidney, parathyroid gland, and choroid plexus, acts as an essential co&#8208;receptor with the fibroblast growth factor 23 receptor complex to regulate serum phosphate and vitamin D levels. Decreased levels of &#945;&#8208;Klotho are a hallmark of age&#8208;associated diseases. Detecting or labeling &#945;&#8208;Klotho in biological milieu has long been a challenge, however, hampering the understanding of its role. Here, we developed branched peptides by single&#8208;shot parallel automated fast&#8208;flow synthesis that recognize &#945;&#8208;Klotho with improved affinity relative to their monomeric versions. These peptides were further shown to selectively label Klotho for live imaging in kidney cells. Our results demonstrate that automated flow technology enables rapid synthesis of complex peptide architectures, showing promise for future detection of &#945;&#8208;Klotho in physiological settings.

         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt with selectively anchored high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts is synthesized by leveraging the chelating functionality of ligands and finely controlled surface reconstruction of Ti&#8208;BPDC. The high activity is confirmed due to the efficient charge separation promoted by the heterojunction and the selective location of Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts on the electron&#8208;enriched domain of the heterojunction.







Abstract
A photocatalyst TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt is developed with a self&#8208;grown TiO2/Ti&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterojunction, i.e., TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC, and selectively anchored high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts on Ti&#8208;BPDC for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This intimate heterojunction, growing from the surface pyrolytic reconstruction of Ti&#8208;BPDC, works in a direct Z&#8208;scheme, efficiently separating electrons and holes. Pt is selectively anchored on Ti&#8208;BPDC by ligands and is found in the form of single atoms with loading up to 1.8&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The selective location of Pt is the electron&#8208;enriched domain of the heterojunction, which further enhances the utilization of the separated electrons. This tailored TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt shows a significantly enhanced activity of 12.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 compared to other TiO2&#8208; or MOF&#8208;based catalysts. The structure&#8208;activity relationship further proves the balance of two simultaneously exposed domains of heterojunctions is critical to fulfilling this kind of catalyst.

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Benzotriazulene with Three Embedded Azulene Units and Large Stokes Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C3&#8208;symmetrical truxene&#8208;based benzotriazulene derivative with three embedded azulene units was concisely synthesized by means of a cascade [4+3] annulation involving a Suzuki coupling followed by Knoevenagel condensation of a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. The regioselectively trinitrated product exhibits a large Stokes shift of up to 5100&#8197;cm&#8722;1 along with unique solvatochromic effects in different solvents.







Abstract
We report here the one&#8208;pot synthesis of benzo[1,2&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;a&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;a&#8242;&#8242;]triazulene (BTA), wherein three azulene units are embedded through a tandem reaction comprising two steps, Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation, between a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. Its nitration leads to a regioselective trinitrated product, namely, BTA&#8208;NO2. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the superstructure of BTA consists of a dimer stacked by two enantiomeric helicene conformers, while that of BTA&#8208;NO2 consists of an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;tetramer stacked from two enantiomeric dimers, that is, four distinct helicene conformers. Both compounds show excellent stability and fluorescence with large Stokes shifts of up to 5100&#8197;cm&#8722;1. In addition, BTA&#8208;NO2 exhibits a unique solvatochromic effect in different solvents and hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced emission transfer in different ratios of THF/H2O solutions.

&lt;/i&gt;-symmetrical truxene-based benzotriazulene derivative with three embedded azulene units was concisely synthesized by means of a cascade [4+3] annulation involving a Suzuki coupling followed by Knoevenagel condensation of a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8-bromo-1-naphthaldehyde.

         <title>Transformation of an Imine Cage to a Covalent Organic Framework Film at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent chemistry&#8208;directed transformation of an imine cage to highly porous covalent organic framework free&#8208;standing films at the aqueous&#8211;organic interface has been demonstrated under ambient conditions for size&#8208;selective molecular separation. The faster formation and better crystallinity of cage&#8208;derived COF films are due to the imine intermediate&#8208;assisted facile transimination and the dynamic self&#8208;assembly processes at the interface.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) opens up a fascinating route for the construction of well&#8208;organized supramolecular architectures, starting from organic molecular cages to crystalline macromolecular covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein, for the first time, we have manifested a facile room&#8208;temperature DCC&#8208;directed transformation of discrete organic imine cage&#8208;to&#8208;COF film at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The unfolding of the cage leading to the generation of imine intermediates, followed by their interface&#8208;assisted preorganization and subsequent growth of the COF film, are elucidated through detailed spectroscopic and microscopic investigations. The interfacial cage&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation provides a facile route for the faster fabrication of free&#8208;standing COF films with high porosity and crystallinity, demonstrating excellent performance towards molecular sieving and high solvent permeance. Thus, the current study opens up a new route for structural interconversion between two crystalline entities with diverse dimensionality employing DCC at the confined interface.

         <title>Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed&#8208;Fluorescence Small Molecules: Long&#8208;Axis Polymerization Leads to a Nearly Concentration&#8208;Independent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nearly concentration&#8208;independent luminescence has been demonstrated by polymerizing a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor type TADF small molecule through its long&#8208;axis direction rather than the short&#8208;axis one. The corresponding PLQY remains almost unchanged, leading a promising EQE up to 20&#8201;% in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nowadays numerous thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers have been developed for PLEDs to realize high device performance and tunable emission colors. However, they often possess a strong concentration dependence on their luminescence including aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Herein, we first report a nearly concentration&#8208;independent TADF polymer based on the strategy of polymerized TADF small molecules. It is found that when a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) type TADF small molecule is polymerized through its long&#8208;axis direction, the triplet state is distributed along the polymeric backbone to effectively suppress the unwanted concentration quenching. Unlike the short&#8208;axis one with an ACQ effect, the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of the resultant long&#8208;axis polymer remains almost unchanged with the increasing doping concentration. Accordingly, a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 20&#8201;% is successfully achieved in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reactions Accelerated by Interpretable Intrinsic Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes an interpretable intrinsic descriptor to accelerate the high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700&#8197;single&#8208;atom catalysts without calculations by combining physical insights with machine learning. The role of metal&#8208;ligand interaction on activity is also clarified using this descriptor. A series of experiments further verify the descriptor's guidance.







Abstract
Developing easily accessible descriptors is crucial but challenging to rationally design single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). This paper describes a simple and interpretable activity descriptor, which is easily obtained from the atomic databases. The defined descriptor proves to accelerate high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700&#8197;graphene&#8208;based SACs without computations, universal for 3&#8211;5d transition metals and C/N/P/B/O&#8208;based coordination environments. Meanwhile, the analytical formula of this descriptor reveals the structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. Using electrochemical nitrogen reduction as an example, this descriptor's guidance role has been experimentally validated by 13&#8197;previous reports as well as our synthesized 4&#8197;SACs. Orderly combining machine learning with physical insights, this work provides a new generalized strategy for low&#8208;cost high&#8208;throughput screening while comprehensive understanding the structure&#8208;mechanism&#8208;activity relationship.

         <title>Suppressing Universal Cathode Crossover in High&#8208;Energy Lithium Metal Batteries via a Versatile Interlayer Design
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin versatile interlayer consisting of multifunctional adsorption sites is introduced to suppress the cathode crossover in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries using various high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Ni&#8208;rich layered metal oxide cathode, Li&#8208;/Mn&#8208;rich cathode, and sulfur cathode, while stabilizing the lithium stripping/plating process even under current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The universal cathode crossover such as chemical and oxygen has been significantly overlooked in lithium metal batteries using high&#8208;energy cathodes which leads to severe capacity degradation and raises serious safety concerns. Herein, a versatile and thin (&#8776;25&#8197;&#956;m) interlayer composed of multifunctional active sites was developed to simultaneously regulate the Li deposition process and suppress the cathode crossover. The as&#8208;induced dual&#8208;gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase combined with abundant lithiophilic sites enable stable Li stripping/plating process even under high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray experiments revealed that N&#8208;rich framework and CoZn dual active sites can effectively mitigate the undesired cathode crossover, hence significantly minimizing Li corrosion. Therefore, assembled lithium metal cells using various high&#8208;energy cathode materials including LiNi0.7Mn0.2Co0.1O2, Li1.2Co0.1Mn0.55Ni0.15O2, and sulfur demonstrate significantly improved cycling stability with high cathode loading.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Photocage Based on a Ruthenium Complex for Cancer Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru complex&#8208;based photocage that can be activated by NIR light was designed and was engineered into amphiphilic block copolymers which self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles. Upon irradiation, Ru complexes are released from the nanoparticles and effectively inhibit tumor proliferation in mice via combined chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, demonstrating the promising anticancer applications of the Ru&#8208;based photocage in vivo.







Abstract
Conventional photocages only respond to short wavelength light, which is a significant obstacle to developing efficient phototherapy in vivo. The development of photocages activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light at wavelengths from 700 to 950&#8197;nm is important for in vivo studies but remains challenging. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a photocage based on a ruthenium (Ru) complex with NIR light&#8208;triggered photocleavage reaction. The commercial anticancer drug, tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), was coordinated to the RuII center to create the Ru&#8208;based photocage that is readily responsive to NIR light at 760&#8197;nm. The photocage inherited the anticancer properties of THC. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we further engineered a self&#8208;assembled photocage&#8208;based nanoparticle system with amphiphilic block copolymers. Upon exposure to NIR light at 760&#8197;nm, the Ru complex&#8208;based photocages were released from the polymeric nanoparticles and efficiently inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo.

         <title>Study of Intermolecular Reconfiguration of Flexible COF&#8208;5 Film and Its Ultra&#8208;high Chemiresistive Humidity Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible COF&#8208;5 film is synthesized on PI substrate by a vapor&#8208;assisted conversion method and fabricate humidity sensor. The sensor shows resistance response to 11&#8201;%&#8211;98&#8201;% RH in 4 orders of magnitude and maintains liner relation even bended at 180&#176;. Simulations are applied to reveal the intermolecular reconfiguration mechanism in humidity sensing. The superior sensitivity makes COF&#8208;5 films a protential candidate for human respiration monitoring.







Abstract
Recently, abundant active materials are developed to achieve the wearable detection of human body humidity. However, the limited response signal and sensitivity restrict further application due to their moderate affinity to water. Herein, we propose a flexible COF&#8208;5 film synthesized by a brief vapor&#8208;assisted method at room temperature. Intermediates are calculated by DFT simulation to investigate the interaction between COF&#8208;5 and water. The adsorption and desorption of water molecule result in a reversible deformation of COF layers while creating new conductive path by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;5 films are applied to the flexible humidity sensors, exhibiting a resistance change in 4 orders of magnitude with remarkable linear relation between log function of resistance and relative humidity (RH) in 11&#8201;%&#8211;98&#8201;% RH range. Applications including respiratory monitoring and non&#8208;contact switch are tested, providing a promising prospect for the detection of human body humidity.

         <title>Intramolecular Ynamide&#8211;Benzyne (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions involving benzyne and ynamides as three&#8208;atom components have been accomplished through the utilization of benzyne precursors having a linking functionality. The ambivalent nature of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom, is thus brought to light in this approach.







Abstract
We report herein intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions between ynamides as three&#8208;atom components and benzyne. In these intramolecular reactions, the two&#8208;bond formation is realized by exploiting benzyne precursors that contain a chlorosilyl group as a linking functionality. This method thus highlights the ambivalent character of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom.

         <title>Mimicking Photosynthesis: A Natural Z&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst Constructed from Red Mud Bauxite Waste for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;mimicking Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalyst was constructed by coupling acid&#8208;activated and alkali&#8208;treated red mud bauxite waste with an iron electron mediator. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state system presented a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity for overall water splitting, which even exceeded several artificially synthesized Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts. This work provides a sustainable way for new energy production through component engineering of natural mineral&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts have attracted significant attention due to their great potential for solar fuel production. However, delicately coupling two individual semiconductors with a charge shuttle by a material strategy remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a new protocol of natural Z&#8208;Scheme heterostructures by strategically engineering the component and interfacial structure of red mud bauxite waste. Advanced characterizations elucidated that the hydrogen&#8208;induced formation of metallic Fe enabled the effective Z&#8208;Scheme electron transfer from &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 to TiO2, leading to the significantly boosted spatial separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers for overall water splitting. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction based on natural minerals for solar fuel production. Thus our work provides a new avenue toward the utilization of natural minerals for advanced catalysis applications.

         <title>DOPA Residues Endow Collagen with Radical Scavenging Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we uncover collagen, the main structural protein of all connective tissues, as a redox&#8208;active material. We identify dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) residues, post&#8208;translational oxidation products of tyrosine residues, to be common in collagen derived from different connective tissues. We observe that these DOPA residues endow collagen with substantial radical scavenging capacity. When reducing radicals, DOPA residues work as redox relay: they convert to the quinone and generate hydrogen peroxide. In this dual function, DOPA outcompetes its amino acid precursors and ascorbic acid. Our results establish DOPA residues as redox&#8208;active side chains of collagens, probably protecting connective tissues against radicals formed under mechanical stress and/or inflammation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy of&#160;Cu/C3N4 Interface and Cu Nanoparticles Dual Catalytic Regions in Electrolysis of CO to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction reaction of carbon monoxide (CORR) offers a promising way to manufacture acetic acid directly from gaseous CO and water at mild condition. Herein, we discovered that the graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) supported Cu nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;CN) with the appropriate size showed a high acetate faradaic efficiency of 62.8% with a partial current density of 188 mA cm&#8208;2 in CORR. In&#8208;situ experimental and density functional theory calculation studies revealed that the Cu/C3N4 interface and metallic Cu surface synergistically promoted CORR into acetic acid. The generation of pivotal intermediate &#8208;*CHO is advantage around the Cu/C3N4 interface and migrated *CHO facilitate acetic acid generation on metallic Cu surface with promoted *CHO coverage. Moreover, continuous production of acetic acid aqueous solution was achieved in a porous solid electrolyte reactor, indicating the great potential of Cu&#8208;CN catalyst in the industrial application.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H Carbonylative Arylation with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel, selective and high&#8208;yielding palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative arylation of a variety of weakly acidic (pKa 25&#8211;35 in DMSO) benzylic and heterobenzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with aryl bromides has been achieved. This system is applicable to a range of pro&#8208;nucleophiles for access to sterically and electronically diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl or &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones, which are ubiquitous substructures in biologically active compounds. The JosiPhos SL&#8208;J001&#8208;1&#8208;based palladium catalyst was identified as the most efficient and selective by high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE), enabling carbonylative arylation with aryl bromides under 1 atm CO to provide the ketone products without the formation of direct coupling byproducts. Additionally, (Josiphos)Pd(CO)2 was identified as the catalyst resting state. A kinetic study suggests that the oxidative addition of aryl bromides is the turnover&#8208;limiting step. Key catalytic intermediates were also isolated.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Artificial Receptors as Transmembrane Signal Transduction Systems for Protocellular Communication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to reproduce signal transduction and cellular communication in artificial cell systems is significant in synthetic protobiology. Here, we describe an artificial transmembrane signal transduction through low pH&#8208;mediated formation of the i&#8208;motif and dimerization of DNA&#8208;based artificial membrane receptors, which is coupled to the occurrence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer and the activation of G&#8208;quadruplex/hemin&#8208;mediated fluorescence amplification inside giant unilamellar vesicles. Moreover, an intercellular signal communication model is established when the extravesicular H+ input is replaced by coacervate microdroplets, which activate the dimerization of the artificial receptors, and subsequent fluorescence production or polymerisation in giant unilamellar vesicles. This study represents a crucial step towards designing artificial signalling systems with environmental response, and provides an opportunity to establish signalling networks in protocell colonies.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Trade&#8208;Off between C2H2 Sorption and Separation Performance by Regulating Metal&#8208;Alkyne Chemical Interaction in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing porous materials for C2H2 purification and safe storage is essential research for industrial utilization. We emphatically regulate the metal&#8208;alkyne interaction of Pd(II) and Pt(II) on C2H2 sorption and C2H2/CO2 separation in two isostructural NbO metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA and Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA. The experimental investigations and systematic theoretical calculations reveal that Pd(II) in Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA undergoes spontaneous chemical reaction with C2H2, leading to irreversible structural collapse and loss of C2H2/CO2 sorption and separation. Contrarily, Pt(II) in Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA shows strong di&#8208;&#963; bond interaction with C2H2 to form specific &#960;&#8208;complexation, contributing to high C2H2 capture (28.7 cm3/g at 0.01 bar and 153 cm3/g at 1 bar). The reusable Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA efficiently separates C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures with satisfying selectivity and C2H2 capacity (37 min/g). This research provides valuable insight into designing high&#8208;performance MOFs for gas sorption and separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated Solid&#8208;Phase Oligo(disulfide) Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A methodology for automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis of oligo(disulfide)s was developed. It is based on a synthetic cycle comprising removal of a protection group from a resin&#8208;bound thiol followed by treatment with monomers containing a thiosulfonate as an activated precursor. For ease of purification and characterization the disulfide oligomers were synthesized as extensions of oligonucleotides on an automated oligonucleotide synthesizer. Six different dithiol monomer building blocks were synthesized. Sequence&#8208;defined oligomers of up to 7 disulfide units were synthesized and purified. The sequence of the oligomer was confirmed by tandem MS/MS analysis. One of the monomers contains a coumarin cargo that can be released by a thiol&#8208;mediated release mechanism. When the monomer was incorporated into an oligo(disulfide) and subjected to reducing conditions, the cargo was released under near&#8208;physiological conditions, which underlines the potential use of these molecules in drug delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Paired Oxidative and Reductive Catalysis: Breaking the Potential Barrier of Electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the intrinsic inertness of alkanes, strong oxidative conditions are typically required to enable their C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. Herein, a paired electrocatalysis strategy was developed by integrating oxidative catalysis with reductive catalysis in one cell without interference, in which earth&#8208;abundant iron and nickel are employed as the anodic and cathodic catalysts, respectively. This approach lowers the previously high oxidation potential required for alkane activation, enabling electrochemical alkane functionalization at the ultra&#8208;low oxidation potential of ~0.25 V&#160;vs. Ag/AgCl under mild conditions. Structurally diverse alkenes, including challenging all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted olefins, can be accessed using readily available alkenyl electrophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Ene Reductase Enabled Intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Substituted Cyclohexanones for Efficient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds containing 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold have many applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. However, their synthesis is challenging and mainly limited to chemical synthesis. Herein we report that ene reductases (EREDs) can facilitate an unprecedented intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reaction for the synthesis of bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles containing the 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold. To streamline the synthesis of these privileged motifs, we developed a gram scale one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic cascade by combining iridium photocatalysis with EREDs using readily available N&#8208;phenylglycines and cyclohexenones that can be obtained from biomass. Further derivatization using enzymatic or chemical methods can convert 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#8208;one to 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;ols, which can be potentially utilized for the synthesis of azaprophen and its analogues for drug discovery. Mechanistic studies revealed the reaction requires oxygen presumably to produce oxidized flavin which can selectively dehydrogenate the 3&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone derivatives to form the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which subsequently undergoes spontaneous intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael addition under basic conditions.</dc:description>

Herein we report that ene reductases (EREDs) can facilitate an unprecedented intramolecular &#946;-C&#8722;H functionalization reaction for the synthesis of bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles containing the 6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold. To streamline the synthesis of these privileged motifs, we developed a gram scale one-pot chemoenzymatic cascade by combining iridium photocatalysis with EREDs using readily available N-phenylglycines and cyclohexenones that can be obtained from biomass. Further derivatization using enzymatic or chemical methods can convert 6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one to 6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3&#945;-ols, which can be potentially utilized for the synthesis of azaprophen and its analogues for drug discovery. Mechanistic studies revealed the reaction requires oxygen presumably to produce oxidized flavin which can selectively dehydrogenate the 3-substituted cyclohexanone derivatives to form the &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketone, which subsequently undergoes spontaneous intramolecular Aza-Michael addition under basic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical&#8208;Mechanical Robustness of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enabled by Surface Atomic Arrangement Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered transition metal oxide cathodes have been one of the dominant cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with efficient Li+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by the weak layered interaction and unstable surface, mechanical and chemical failure plagues their electrochemical performance, especially for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. Here, adopting a simultaneous elemental&#8208;structural atomic arrangement control based on the intrinsic Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn system, the surface role is intensively investigated. Within the invariant oxygen sublattice of the crystal, a robust surface with the synergistic concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure is constructed on the model single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode. With mechanical strain dissipation and chemical erosion suppression, the cathode exhibits an impressive capacity retention of 82% even at the harsh 60 oC after 150 cycles at 1C. This work highlights the coupling effect of structure and composition on the chemical&#8208;mechanical properties, and the concept will spur more researches on the cathodes that share the same sublattice.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing highly effective biocatalysts with controllable coordination geometry for eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) is extremely desirable but remains challenging for addressing the current bottlenecks in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics. Here, inspired by the coordination structure of manganese&#8208;based antioxidase, we report a&#160;manganese&#8208;coordinated polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based biocatalyst (Mn&#8208;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8208;N5 sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated networks to serve as artificial antioxidase for rescuing stem cell fates. Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, the Mn&#8208;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, including the H2O2 and O2&#8226;&#8722;, which surpasses the by&#8208;far&#8208;reported Mn&#8208;based ROS&#8208;scavenging artificial antioxidases. Consequently, the Mn&#8208;PcBC provides efficient rescuing of the bioactivities and functionalities of stem cells in high ROS&#8208;level microenvironments via protecting the transcription of osteogenesis&#8208;related genes. This work not only offers essential insights into the crucial functions of axially coordinated Mn&#8208;N5 sites in ROS&#8208;scavenging but also proposes new strategies to create efficient artificial antioxidases for stem&#8208;cell therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation and Recycling of Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accumulation of plastic waste, due to lack of recycling, has led to serious environmental pollution. Although mechanical recycling can alleviate this issue, it inevitably reduces the molecular weight and weakens the mechanical properties of materials and is not suitable for mixed materials. Chemical recycling, on the other hand, breaks the polymer into monomers or small&#8208;molecule constituents, allowing for the preparation of materials of quality comparable to that of the virgin polymers and can be applied to mixed materials. Mechanochemical degradation and recycling leverages the advantages of mechanical techniques, such as scalability and efficient energy use, to achieve chemical recycling. We summarize recent progress in mechanochemical degradation and recycling of synthetic polymers, including both commercial polymers and those designed for more efficient mechanochemical degradation. We also point out the limitations of mechanochemical degradation and present our perspectives on how the challenges can be mitigated for a circular polymer economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Electric Double Layer Adsorption for Stable Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase in 2.3 Ah Zn&#8208;Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing a reliable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is imperative for enabling highly reversible zinc metal (Zn0) electrodes. Contrary to conventional &#8220;bulk solvation&#8221; mechanism, we found the SEI structure is dominated by electric double layer (EDL) adsorption. We manipulate the EDL adsorption and Zn2+ solvation with ether additives (i.e. 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5, 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4, and triglyme). The 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 with medium adsorption on EDL leads to a layer&#8208;structured SEI with inner inorganic ZnFx/ZnSx and outer organic C&#8208;O&#8208;C components. This structure endows SEI with high rigidness and strong toughness enabling the 100&#160;cm2 Zn||Zn pouch cell to exhibit a cumulative capacity of 4250 mAh cm&#8722;2 at areal&#8208;capacity of 10&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2. More importantly, a 2.3 Ah Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#8226;nH2O pouch cell delivers a recorded energy density of 104 Wh Lcell&#8722;1 and runs for &gt; 70 days under the harsh conditions of low negative/positive electrode ratio (2.2:1), lean electrolyte (8&#160;g&#160;Ah&#8208;1), and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity (~13&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2).</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of Benzothiophenes at C4 by Activation as their Benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzothiophenes, activated by oxidation to the corresponding S&#8208;oxides, undergo C&#8208;H/C&#8208;H&#8208;type coupling with phenols to give C4 arylation products. While an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C3 of the benzothiophene is important, the process operates without a directing group and a metal catalyst, thus rendering it compatible with sensitive functionalities &#8208; e.g. halides and formyl groups. Quantum chemical calculations suggest a formal stepwise mechanism involving heterolytic cleavage of an aryloxysulfur species to give a &#960;&#8208;complex of the corresponding benzothiophene and a phenoxonium cation. Subsequent addition of the phenoxonium cation to the C4 position of the benzothiophene is favored over the addition to C3; Fukui functions predict that the major regioisomer is formed at the more electron&#8208;rich position between C3 and C4. Varied selective manipulation of the benzothiophene products showcase the synthetic utility of the metal&#8208;free arylation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Prenucleation&#8208;Induced Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite film with high crystal quality is fundamental to achieving high&#8208;performance solar cells. A fast nucleation process is crucial to improving the crystallization quality. Here, we propose a self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy to achieve fast nucleation. This is realized through rational solvent design. The key characteristics of different solvents are systematically evaluated. Among them, formamide, with ultra&#8208;high dielectric constant, low Gutman donor number, and a high boiling point, is selected as the co&#8208;solvent. These unique characteristics render formamide a double&#8208;face solvent that is a good solvent for formamidinium iodide (FAI) and CsI while a poor solvent for PbI2. As a result, formamide induces the self&#8208;driven prenucleation of PbI2&#8208;DMSO seeding crystals and accelerates the nucleation, improving the crystalline quality of perovskite film. The efficiency of the hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells is boosted beyond 19% for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Traceless Chiral Shift Reagent Based on Nonbonding Interaction with Single&#8208;Handed Helical Poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;handed poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)s (PQX) have been found to serve as a new chiral shift reagent (CSR) for determining the enantiomeric ratio by NMR. Even though there is no specific binding site in PQX, its nonbonding interaction with chiral analytes leads to a significant shift of the NMR chemical shift, allowing quantification of the enantiomeric ratio. The new CSR has the advantages of a wide scope of analytes including ethers, haloalkanes, and alkanes, easy tunability of the degree of chemical shifts by measurement temperature, and erasability of proton signals of CSR because of the short spin&#8211;spin (T2) relaxation of the macromolecular scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation of Aryl Bromides Enabled by Potassium Metabisulfite as a Uniquely Effective SO2 Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides has been developed utilizing an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. While initial mechanistic studies identified SO2 as a catalyst poison, later use of the isolated oxidative addition complex revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2 slowly released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5.







Abstract
The development and mechanistic investigation of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides is disclosed. The reaction proceeds in good yields for a variety of substrates and utilizes an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. The active oxidative addition complex was synthesized, isolated, and fully characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis. The use of the isolated oxidative addition complex in both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2, likely released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5. Key to the success of the reaction is the role of K2S2O5 as a reservoir of SO2 that is slowly released, thus preventing catalyst poisoning.

         <dc:description>
A new and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative procedure of bromoacetonitrile has been developed. A variety of valuable 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, this transformation can be carried out under atmospheric pressure and provides an alternative route to 7 drug compounds.







Abstract
Nitrile compounds containing ester and amide groups are important functionalized chemicals in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. In this article, an efficient and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative procedure toward 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions via radical intermediate which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization. Gram&#8208;scale experiment was performed successfully under low catalyst loading and gave the target product in excellent yield. Additionally, this transformation can be performed under atmospheric pressure and provide alternative routes to 7 drug precursors.

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial RNA Modification for Cancer RNA Interference Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known cyclization reaction between furan and nucleotides of nucleic acid under the ignition of 1O2, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification (NIMiRM) strategy was herein developed for long&#8208;term NIR/PA dual&#8208;modality imaging and remarkable suppression of tumors in vivo.







Abstract
Mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) plays a critical role in synthesis of mitochondrial proteins. Interfering mtRNA is a highly effective way to induce cell apoptosis. Herein, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification approach for long&#8208;term imaging and effective suppression of tumors. A tumor&#8208;targetable NIR fluorescent probe f&#8208;CRI consisting of a cyclic RGD peptide, a NIR fluorophore IR780, and a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;labile furan group for RNA modification was rationally designed and synthesized. This probe was demonstrated to dominantly accumulate in cellular mitochondria and could be covalently conjugated onto mtRNA upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation resulting in prolonged retention in tumors. More notably, this covalent modification of mtRNA by f&#8208;CRI could perturb the function of mitochondria leading to remarkable tumor suppression. We thus envision that our current approach would offer a potential approach for cancer RNA interference therapeutics.

         <title>From Dinitrogen to N&#8208;Containing Organic Compounds: Using Li2CN2 as a Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the conversion of inert N2 into various nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compounds is presented. The activated N&#8208;containing species Li2CN2 is successfully prepared in high yields from N2 gas, C and LiH. Li2CN2 can be transformed into a range of N&#8208;containing organic compounds, including cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives. 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives, have also been prepared from 15N2 gas.







Abstract
Through the synergies of a heterogeneous synthetic approach and a homogeneous synthetic methodology, N&#8208;containing organic compounds can be synthesized via activated N&#8208;containing species prepared from N2 gas and suitable carbon sources. From N2, carbon, and LiH, we have previously succeeded in the high&#8208;yield preparation of Li2CN2 as the activated N&#8208;containing species. In this work, we applied Li2CN2 as a novel synthetic synthon for constructing N&#8208;containing organic compounds. A series of reaction models, including a substitution reaction, cycloaddition reaction, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction, were successfully performed using Li2CN2 under mild conditions. Various valuable cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives were readily synthesized in moderate to excellent yields. With this method, the 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives with anti&#8208;cancer activity, could also be facilely prepared from 15N2 gas.

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Atomic Pt Nanozymes for Enzymatic Theranostics of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled single&#8208;atomic Pt nanozyme was developed using a facile missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination strategy. The nanozyme shows superior catalase&#8208;mimicking activity for the catalytic conversion of H2O2 overproduced in tumors into localized O2 for tumor hypoxia alleviation, which leads to enhanced ROS generation from loaded photosensitizers for apoptotic cancer cell death.







Abstract
Conventional nanozymes often possess low active site density. Pursuing effective strategies for constructing highly active single&#8208;atomic nanosystems with maximum atom utilization efficiency is exceptionally attractive. Herein, we develop a facile &#8220;missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination&#8221; strategy to fabricate two self&#8208;assembled nanozymes, i.e., conventional nanozyme (NE) and single&#8208;atomic nanozyme (SAE), which respectively consist of Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms as active catalytic sites anchored in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated photosensitizers for catalase&#8208;mimicking enhanced photodynamic therapy. Compared to a Pt nanoparticle&#8208;based conventional nanozyme, a Pt single&#8208;atomic nanozyme shows enhanced catalase&#8208;mimicking activity in generating oxygen for overcoming tumor hypoxia, thus exhibiting a more efficient reactive oxygen species generation and high tumor inhibition rate.

         <title>A Hydrazine&#8208;Nitrate Flow Battery Catalyzed by a Bimetallic RuCo Precatalyst for Wastewater Purification along with Simultaneous Generation of Ammonia and Electricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new and general electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst can efficiently catalyze both the hydrazine oxidation and nitrate reduction reactions so as to assemble a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery with electricity and ammonia generation.







Abstract
The traditional technologies for industrial and agricultural effluent treatment are often energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we suggest an electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, we propose a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery (HNFB) that can efficiently purify the wastewater and meanwhile generate both ammonia fuel and electricity with the assistance of our developed bimetallic RuCo precatalyst. Specifically, the battery delivers a peak power density of 12&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and continuously operates for 20&#8197;h with an ammonia yield rate of ca. 0.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The generated electricity can further drive a hydrazine electrolyzer to produce hydrogen fuel. Our work provides an alternative pathway to purify wastewater and generate high value&#8208;added fuels at low cost.

         <title>Catalytic Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Radical Carbocyanation of 2&#8208;Azadienes for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and broadly applicable method for the construction of complex &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derivatives through a novel cascade strategy is presented. Alkyl radicals are generated by the photo&#8208;mediated reductive decarboxylation of redox&#8208;active esters, captured by 2&#8208;azadienes to provide 2&#8208;azallyl radicals and cyanized by a copper catalyst.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amino nitriles are versatile structural motifs in a variety of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals and they serve as valuable building blocks in synthesis. The preparation of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles from readily available scaffolds, however, remains challenging. Herein is reported a novel dual catalytic photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and regioselective radical carbocyanation of 2&#8208;azadienes to access functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles by using redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) and trimethylsilyl cyanide. This cascade process employs a broad scope of RAEs and provides the corresponding &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile building blocks in 50&#8211;95&#8201;% yields (51 examples, regioselectivity &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5). The products were transformed into prized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical cascade coupling process.

         <dc:description>
Dense, smooth, substrate&#8208;integrated, large&#8208;area and thickness&#8208;controlled perovskite microcrystalline films are prepared. They are used as self&#8208;powered microcrystalline X&#8208;ray detectors with an impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which may further reduce the X&#8208;ray radiation risk to patients.







Abstract
Perovskite single crystals and polycrystalline films have complementary merits and deficiencies in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Herein, we report preparation of dense and smooth perovskite microcrystalline films with both merits of single crystals and polycrystalline films through polycrystal&#8208;induced growth and hot&#8208;pressing treatment (HPT). Utilizing polycrystalline films as seeds, multi&#8208;inch&#8208;sized microcrystalline films can be in situ grown on diverse substrates with maximum grain size reaching 100&#8197;&#956;m, which endows the microcrystalline films with comparable carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#956;&#964;) product as single crystals. As a result, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors with impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 are achieved, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. Combining with the fast response speed (186&#8197;&#956;s), this work may contribute to the development of perovskite&#8208;based low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging.

&lt;p&gt;Perovskite single crystals and polycrystalline films have complementary merits and deficiencies in X-ray detection and imaging. Herein, we report preparation of dense and smooth perovskite microcrystalline films with both merits of single crystals and polycrystalline films through polycrystal-induced growth and hot-pressing treatment (HPT). Utilizing polycrystalline films as seeds, multi-inch-sized microcrystalline films can be in situ grown on diverse substrates with maximum grain size reaching 100&#8197;&#956;m, which endows the microcrystalline films with comparable carrier mobility-lifetime (&lt;i&gt;&#956;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;) product as single crystals. As a result, self-powered X-ray detectors with impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved, leading to high-contrast X-ray imaging at an ultra-low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Combining with the fast response speed (186&#8197;&#956;s), this work may contribute to the development of perovskite-based low-dose X-ray imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium/TiO2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenolysis of Polyethylene Terephthalate: Reaction Pathways Dominated by Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination environment of Ru in Ru/TiO2 dictates the reaction pathway for polyethylene terephthalate hydrogenolysis. Under&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor the formation of arenes through a desired binding orientation of aromatic adsorbates, which discourages ring hydrogenation and ring&#8208;opening reactions.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrogenolysis can produce benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), where the selectivity control is challenging. We report a reaction pathway dictated by the Ru coordination environment by examining the binding geometries of adsorbates on differently coordinated Ru centers and their evolution during PET hydrogenolysis. A BTX yield of 77&#8201;% was obtained using a Ru/TiO2 with a Ru coordination number of ca. 5.0 where edge/corner sites are dominant, while more gas and saturated products were formed for Ru/TiO2 containing primarily terrace sites. Density functional theory and isotopic labelling revealed that under&#8208;coordinated Ru edge sites favor &#8220;upright&#8221; adsorption of aromatic adsorbates while well&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; adsorption, where the former mitigates ring hydrogenation and opening. This study demonstrates that reaction pathways can be directed through controlled reactant/intermediate binding via tuning of the Ru coordination environment for efficient conversion of PET to BTX.

         <title>Cooperative Proton and Li&#8208;ion Conduction in a 2D&#8208;Layered MOF via Mechanical Insertion of Lithium Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high ionic conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) was observed in the 2D&#8208;Ti&#8208;dobdc MOF after Li salt intercalation, which improved the H2O affinity of the frameworks, facilitating Li+ and H+ diffusion. Furthermore, the ion diffusion evaluated by PFG&#8197;NMR indicates the counter anion effect. It was demonstrated that the moderate covalent/ionic character of LiBr and the high H2O uptake are crucial factors in efficient ionic conductors.







Abstract
Ionic conduction in highly designable and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks has been explored through the introduction of various ionic species (H+, OH&#8722;, Li+, etc.) using post&#8208;synthetic modification such as acid, salt, or ionic liquid incorporation. Here, we report on high ionic conductivity (&#963;&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in a two&#8208;dimensionally (2D)&#8208;layered Ti&#8208;dobdc (Ti2(Hdobdc)2(H2dobdc), H4dobdc: 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid) via LiX (X=Cl, Br, I) intercalation using mechanical mixing. The anionic species in lithium halide strongly affect the ionic conductivity and durability of conductivity. Solid&#8208;state pulsed&#8208;field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG&#8197;NMR ) verified the high mobility of H+ and Li+ ions in the temperature range of 300&#8211;400&#8197;K. In particular, the insertion of Li salts improved the H+ mobility above 373&#8197;K owing to strong binding with H2O. Furthermore, the continuous increase in Li+ mobility with temperature contributed to the retention of the overall high ionic conductivity at high temperatures.

         <title>CuNi Nanoalloys with Tunable Composition and Oxygen Defects for the Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal synthesis is an excellent tool for the study of cooperative effects in nanoalloys. In this work, bimetallic model CuNi nanoparticles of defined size and composition are fully characterized and tested for the oxygen evolution reaction. Copper addition to nickel leads to modifications in the structural and electronic properties, showing a higher concentration of surface oxygen defects and formation of active Ni3+ sites under reaction conditions. The ratio OV/OL between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen shows a clear correlation with the overpotential, being an excellent descriptor of the electrocatalytic activity. This is attributed to modifications in the crystalline structure, leading to lattice strain and grain size effects. Bimetallic Cu50Ni50NP showed the lowest overpotential (318 mV vs RHE), low Tafel slope (63.9 mV dec&#8208;1), and excellent stability. This work unravels the relative concentration between oxygen defects and lattice oxygen (OV/OL) as an excellent descriptor of the catalytic activity of bimetallic precatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (CXMS) has emerged as a powerful technology to analyze protein complexes. However, the progress of in vivo CXMS studies has been limited by cross&#8208;linking biocompatibility and data analysis. Herein, a glycosidic bond&#8208;based MS&#8208;cleavable cross&#8208;linker of trehalose disuccinimidyl ester (TDS) was designed and synthesized, which was fragmented in MS under CID/HCD to simplify the cross&#8208;linked peptides into conventional single peptides via selective cleavage between glycosidic and peptide bonds under individual MS collision energy. Consequently, the cross&#8208;linking identification accuracy and throughput were significantly enhanced, and the popular MS mode of stepped HCD was allowed. In addition, TDS showed proper cell&#8208;penetrating properties while being highly water&#8208;soluble, making it non&#8208;DMSO dependent during solubilization. Collectively, TDS provides a promising toolkit for CXMS characterization of living systems with high biocompatibility and accuracy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two covalent organic frameworks consisting of carbazolylene&#8208;ethynylene shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles with azine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1) or imine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;2) linkages were synthesized via imine condensation. The obtained 2D frameworks are fully conjugated which imparts semiconducting properties. In addition, the frameworks showed high porosity with aligned accessible porous channels along the z axis, serving as an ideal platform for post&#8208;synthetic incorporation of I2 into the channels to enable electrical conductivity. The resulting MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 showed an electrical conductivity up to 7.8 &#215; 10&#8208;4 S/cm at room temperature upon I2 doping with the activation energy as low as 0.09 eV. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the electrical properties of both MC&#8208;COFs are switchable between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states by simply implementing doping&#8208;regenerating cycles. The knowledge gained in this study opens new possibilities for the future development of tunable conductive 2D organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers 5&#8208;Aminolevulinic Acid and Porphyrin for Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends on the subcellular localization of photosensitizers. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoparticle platform for enhanced PDT of cancer. By grafting 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a Hf12&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (Hf&#8208;MOL) via carboxylate coordination, ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL enhanced ALA delivery and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis in mitochondria, and trapped the Hf&#8208;MOL comprising 5,15&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;benzoatoporphyrin (DBP) photosensitizers in lysosomes. Light irradiation at 630 nm simultaneously excited PpIX and DBP to generate single oxygen and rapidly damage both mitochondria and lysosomes, leading to synergistic enhancement of the PDT efficacy. The dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL outperformed Hf&#8208;MOL in preclinical PDT studies, with a 2.7&#8208;fold lower half maximal inhibitory concentration in cytotoxicity assays in vitro and a 3&#8208;fold higher cure rate in a colon cancer model in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Methylation of Unactivated Alkenes with Engineered Methyltransferases To Generate Non&#8208;natural Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>numerous biological functions. Selective late&#8208;stage modification of their carbon scaffold has the potential to optimize or transform their biological activities. However, the synthesis of terpenoids with a non&#8208;natural carbon scaffold is often a challenging endeavor because of the complexity of these molecules. Here we report the identification and engineering of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent sterol methyltransferases for selective C&#8209;methylation of linear terpenoids. The engineered enzyme catalyzes selective methylation of unactivated alkenes in mono&#8208;, sesqui&#8208; and diterpenoids to produce C11, C16&#160;and C21&#160;derivatives. Preparative conversion and product isolation reveals that this biocatalyst performs C&#8209;C bond formation with high chemo&#8209; and regioselectivity. The alkene methylation most likely proceeds via a carbocation intermediate and regioselective deprotonation. This method opens new avenues for modifying the carbon scaffold of alkenes in general and terpenoids in particular.</dc:description>

         <title>Triphenylamine&#8208;Derived Solid&#8208;State Emissive Carbon Dots for Multicolor High&#8208;Efficiency Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) have emerged as fantastic luminescent nanomaterials in electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the device performance of the reported CDs&#8208;based electroluminescent LEDs is far from satisfactory due to the serious aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of CDs. Here, inspired by the nonplanar structure and good carrier mobility of triphenylamine unit, two kinds of triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive CDs with orange and yellow color are facilely synthesized through a solvothermal treatment. Theoretical calculations show that the triphenylamine structure could greatly inhibit the direct &#960;&#8208;&#960;* stacking of aromatic skeletons and enhance the fluorescence properties of CDs in aggregation state. Delightedly, both the two CDs show strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence, excellent solution&#8208;processability, good film&#8208;forming ability, and high electron/hole mobility. More interestingly, by adopting the obtained CDs as single emissive layer, high&#8208;performance orange&#8208;color and green&#8208;color LEDs are successfully fabricated, with maximum brightness of 9450/4236 cd/m2, high current efficiency of 1.57/2.34 cd/A and low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.1/3.6 eV are respectively achieved. Significantly, white&#8208;color LED device with a CIE coordinate of (0.30, 0.39), maximum brightness of 5726 cd/m2 and low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.0 eV is further prepared. This work provides a universal platform for the construction of novel solid&#8208;state emissive CDs with significant applications in photoelectric device.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Axially Chiral Arylpyrroles via Atroposelective Diyne Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral biaryls widely exist in natural products and pharmaceuticals and are used as chiral ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis. Compared to the well&#8208;established axially chiral 6&#8208;membered biaryl skeletons, examples of 5&#8208;membered biaryls have been quite scarce, and mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers have not been reported. Here, we disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective diyne cyclization for the construction of a range of axially chiral arylpyrrole biaryls in good to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities via oxidation and X&#8211;H insertion of vinyl cations. Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers, but also constitutes the first example of atroposelective diyne cyclization and the first atropisomer construction via vinyl cations. Theoretical calculations further support the mechanism of vinyl cation&#8208;involved cyclization and elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure of an i&#8208;Motif from the HRAS Oncogene Promoter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An i&#8208;motif is a non&#8208;canonical DNA structure implicated in gene regulation and linked to cancers. The C&#8208;rich strand of the HRAS oncogene, 5&#8217;&#8208;CGCCCGTGCCCTGCGCCCGCAACCCGA&#8208;3&#8217; (here referred to as iHRAS), forms an i&#8208;motif in vitro but its exact structure was unknown. HRAS is a member of the RAS proto&#8208;oncogene family. About 19% of US cancer patients carry mutations in RAS genes. We solved the structure of iHRAS at 1.77 &#197; resolution. The structure reveals that iHRAS folds into a double hairpin. The two double hairpins associate in an antiparallel fashion, forming an i&#8208;motif dimer capped by two loops on each end and linked by a connecting region. Six C&#8208;C+ base pairs form each i&#8208;motif core, and the core regions are extended by a G&#8208;G base pair and C stacking. Extensive canonical and non&#8208;canonical base pairing and stacking stabilizes the connecting region and loops. The iHRAS structure is the first atomic resolution structure of an i&#8208;motif from a human oncogene. This structure sheds light on i&#8208;motifs folding and function in the cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Total Syntheses of&#160;(&#8722;)&#8208;Daphnezomines A and B and (+)&#8208;Dapholdhamine B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The daphnezomine A&#8208;type subfamily of Daphniphyllum alkaloids structurally features a unique aza&#8208;adamantane core skeleton and anticipates efficient strategies for completing their syntheses to thoroughly investigate their biological activities.

         <title>Diazabicyclic Electroactive Ionenes for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroactive ionenes combining caged&#8208;shaped diazabicyclic cations and aromatic diimides were developed as interlayers in organic solar cells (OSCs). These ionenes reduce the work&#8208;function of air&#8208;stable metal electrodes (e.g., Ag, Cu and Au) by generating strong interfacial dipoles, and their optoelectronic and morphological characters can be modulated by aromatic diimides, leading to high conductivity and good compatibility with active layers. The optimal ionene exhibits superior charge&#8208;transport, desirable crystallinity, and weak visible&#8208;absorption, boosting the efficiency of benchmark PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs up to 17.44%. The corresponding normal devices show excellent stability at maximum power point test under one sun illumination for 1000 h. Replacing Y6 with L8&#8208;BO promotes the efficiency to 18.43%, one of the highest in binary OSCs. Notably, high efficiencies &gt; 16% are maintained as the interlayer thickness increasing to 105 nm, the best result with interlayer&#8208;thickness over 100 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission by Molecular Design: A Route to High&#8208;Performance Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emission efficiency of organic semiconductors (OSCs) often suffers from aggregation caused quenching (ACQ). An elegant solution is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), which constitutes the design of the OSC so that its morphology inhibits quenching &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and non&#8208;radiative motional deactivation. The light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) can be sustainably fabricated, but its function depends on motion of bulky ions in proximity of the OSC. It is therefore questionable whether the AIE morphology can be retained during LEC operation. Here, we synthesize two structurally similar OSCs, which are distinguished by that 1 features ACQ while 2 delivers AIE. Interestingly, we find that the AIE&#8208;LEC significantly outperforms the ACQ&#8208;LEC. We rationalize our finding by showing that the AIE morphology remains intact during LEC operation, and that it can feature appropriately sized free&#8208;volume voids for facile ion transport and suppressed non&#8208;radiative excitonic deactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Longitudinally Grafting of Graphene with Iron Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Porous Organic Polymer to Boost Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymers (PFePc) are attractive noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the low site&#8208;exposure degree and poor electrical conductivity of bulk PFePc restricted their practical applications. Herein, laminar PFePc nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) was prepared. Such structural engineering qualifies 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc with high site utilization and rapid mass transfer. Thence, 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc demonstrates efficient ORR performance with a high specific activity of 69.31 &#956;A cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 81.88 A g&#8722;1, and a high turnover frequency of 0.93 e s&#8722;1 site&#8722;1 at 0.90 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode in O2&#8208;saturated 0.1 M KOH, outperforming the lamellar PFePc wrapped graphene counterpart. Systematic electrochemical analyses integrating variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in&#8208;situ scanning electrochemical microscopy further underline the rapid kinetics of 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc towards ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Tough, Reprocessable and Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Polymers with Ultrastable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers, whose emission can persist for a long period after photoexcitation, are of great importance in practical applications. Herein, dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8211;N coordination are incorporated into commercial epoxy matrix. The reversible dissociation of B&#8211;N bonds upon loading provides an efficient energy dissipation pathway for the epoxy network, while the rigid epoxy matrix can inhibit the quenching of triplet excitons in boronic esters. The obtained polymers exhibit enhanced mechanical toughness (12.26 MJ m&#8208;3), ultralong RTP (&#964; = 540.4 ms) and shape memory behavior. Notably, the RTP property shows no obvious decrease upon prolonged immersion in various solvents due to the robust networks. Moreover, the dynamic bonds endow the polymers with superior reprocessablity and recyclability. Based on these novel properties, their potential applications for information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting were demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A systematic evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N versus C&#8208;O cross&#8208;couplings involving model compounds enabled development of hitherto unknown chemoselective O&#8208; and N&#8208;arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry. Use of the CyPAd&#8208;DalPhos precatalyst C2 enabled particularly challenging O&#8208;arylation chemoselectivity in amino alcohols featuring branched primary and secondary alkylamine groups, while selective N&#8208;arylation was observed in substrates featuring less&#8208;hindered linear alkylamine and aniline reacting groups. Useful reaction scope in the (hetero)aryl chloride was achieved throughout, and the ability to conduct such transformations using benchtop handling of materials is demonstrated.</dc:description>

Thus, the development of methods for their synthesis is highly valuable yet remains challenging. Herein, an unprecedented catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted acrylamides with aminating agents has been developed, accessing enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives.

Notably, extremely steric congested aliphatic &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam derivatives were synthesized by Cu&#8208;H catalyzed asymmetric forge of C&#8208;N bond with tertiary alkyl species for the first time.

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four highly porous pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The reported findings highlight that the presence of pyrene active sites in very close proximity leads to unwanted H2O2 decomposition. Accordingly, a biphasic system (benzyl alcohol and water) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition.







Abstract
Four highly porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing pyrene units were prepared and explored for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The experimental studies are complemented by density functional theory calculations, proving that the pyrene unit is more active for H2O2 production than the bipyridine and (diarylamino)benzene units reported previously. H2O2 decomposition experiments verified that the distribution of pyrene units over a large surface area of COFs plays an important role in catalytic performance. The Py&#8208;Py&#8208;COF though contains more pyrene units than other COFs which induces a high H2O2 decomposition due to a dense concentration of pyrene in close proximity over a limited surface area. Therefore, a two&#8208;phase reaction system (water&#8208;benzyl alcohol) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition. This is the first report on applying pyrene&#8208;based COFs in a two&#8208;phase system for photocatalytic H2O2 generation.

         <title>Imaging Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Membrane Interactions: Ion&#8208;Channel Pores and Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Permeability in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;association of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) into oligomeric, protofibril, annular and fibril assemblies is intimately linked with neuronal toxicity and Alzheimer's disease. A&#946; can have a range of impacts on the lipid membrane including a carpeting effect and ion&#8208;channel pore formation. Imaging these interactions with the lipid bilayer is providing a clearer picture of A&#946;&#8208;induced membrane permeability, which leads to loss of cellular homeostasis.







Abstract
The accumulation of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides (A&#946;) is central to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism by which A&#946; triggers a cascade of events that leads to dementia is a topic of intense investigation. A&#946; self&#8208;associates into a series of complex assemblies with different structural and biophysical properties. It is the interaction of these oligomeric, protofibril and fibrillar assemblies with lipid membranes, or with membrane receptors, that results in membrane permeability and loss of cellular homeostasis, a key event in Alzheimer's disease pathology. A&#946; can have an array of impacts on lipid membranes, reports have included: a carpeting effect; a detergent effect; and A&#946; ion&#8208;channel pore formation. Recent advances imaging these interactions are providing a clearer picture of A&#946; induced membrane disruption. Understanding the relationship between different A&#946; structures and membrane permeability will inform therapeutics targeting A&#946; cytotoxicity.

         <title>Decrypting the Controlled Product Selectivity over Ag&#8722;Cu Bimetallic Surface Alloys for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8722;Cu surface alloys, as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, demonstrated controllable product selectivity with their surface compositions and the applied potentials rationally tuned. The working mechanism of these catalysts was revealed by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations. A predominant region map describing the thermodynamic predominance of *CO involved subsequent reactions is provided as reliable guidance for the design of catalysts CO2 reduction towards value&#8208;added products.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) with controlled product selectivity is realized on Ag&#8722;Cu bimetallic surface alloys, with high selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;60&#8201;% faradaic efficiency, FE), C1 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;41&#8201;% FE) and CO (&#8776;74&#8201;% FE) achieved by tuning surface compositions and applied potentials. In situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that surface&#8208;composition&#8208;dependent d&#8208;band center could tune *CO binding strengths, regulating the *CO subsequent reaction pathways and then the product selectivity. Further adjusting the applied potentials will alter the energy of participated electrons, which leads to controlled ECO2RR selectivity towards desired products. A predominant region map, with an indicator proposed to evaluate the thermodynamic predominance of the *CO subsequent reactions, is then provided as a reliable theoretical guidance for the controllable ECO2RR product selectivity over bimetallic alloys.

         <title>Toward Scalable Nanofluidic Osmotic Power Generation from Hypersaline Water Sources with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a strategy toward scalable nanofluidic osmotic power generation by using PSS/HKUST&#8208;1 membrane with subnanometer pores and using hypersaline water sources. The hypersaline water sources provide high ionic conductivity and the subnanometer pores guarantee charge selectivity under high salinity. The power density stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 when the membrane area increased to 7&#8197;mm2, the highest for macro&#8208;sized nanofluidic membranes.







Abstract
Nanofluidic membranes have shown great promise in harvesting osmotic energy but its scalablity remains challenging since most studies only tested with a membrane area of &#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;mm2 or smaller. We demonstrate that metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework membranes with subnanometer pores can be used for scalable osmotic power generation from hypersaline water sources. Our membrane can be scaled up to a few mm2, and the power density can be stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2. We reveal that the key is to improve the out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane conductance while keeping the membrane's charge selectivity, contradicting the previous conception that the ionic conductivity of the membrane plays the dominating role. We highlight that subnanometer pores are essential to ensure the charge selectivity in hypersaline water sources. Our results suggest the importance to engineer the interplay between the in&#8208;membrane and out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane ion transport properties for scalable osmotic power generation.

         <title>Rationally Modulating the Functions of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx Nanocomposite Electrocatalysts towards Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the understanding of intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the interactions with all pertinent intermediates, an efficient Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx electrocatalyst was designed and proven to realize mutual coordination among functions of active sites on the efficient dissociative adsorption of water, the easy desorption of OH&#8722;, and the facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation concurrently, leading to significantly boosted alkaline HER kinetics.







Abstract
Identifying electrocatalysts with functions of easy dissociation of water, rapid transformation of hydroxyl and facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation are indispensable while challenge for realizing efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we presented the design of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx nanocomposites towards addressing this challenge. We showed that Ni3Sn2 possessed ideal hydrogen adsorption and low hydroxyl adsorption abilities and NiSnOx facilitated water dissociation and hydroxyl transfer process, respectively. Consequently, the fine&#8208;tuned interplay of the two functional parts realized the mutual coordination among the multiple functions and led to significantly boosted HER kinetics. Current densities of 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were obtained at overpotentials of 14 and 165&#8197;mV on the optimized catalyst. This work highlights the significance of considering intrinsic interactions between active sites and all pertinent intermediates on obtaining promising electrocatalysts.

&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposites towards addressing this challenge. We showed that Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; possessed ideal hydrogen adsorption and low hydroxyl adsorption abilities and NiSnO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; facilitated water dissociation and hydroxyl transfer process, respectively. Consequently, the fine-tuned interplay of the two functional parts realized the mutual coordination among the multiple functions and led to significantly boosted HER kinetics. Current densities of 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; were obtained at overpotentials of 14 and 165&#8197;mV on the optimized catalyst. This work highlights the significance of considering intrinsic interactions between active sites and all pertinent intermediates on obtaining promising electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical CaC2&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Biochar to C2H2: High Carbon Efficiency and Low Contamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid cathode electrolysis in molten salts is expected to convert biomass carbon into CaC2 with 100&#8201;% carbon efficiency. Simultaneously, the electrolysis can remove elements such as S and P from biomass, circumventing the contamination of harmful H2S and H3P in the final hydrolytic C2H2 product.







Abstract
The carbon to CaC2 route is promising to provide a sustainable elementary unit, C2H2, for the organic synthesis industry, but the traditional thermal reaction process suffers from low carbon efficiency, harmful gas contamination, high temperature operation, and risky CO management. We herein report a high carbon efficiency (ca. 100&#8201;%) conversion of biochar to C2H2 through an electrolytic synthesis of solid CaC2 in molten CaCl2/KCl/CaO at 973&#8197;K. The main reactions are carbon reduction to CaC2 at the solid carbon cathode and oxygen evolution at an inert anode. Meanwhile, the electrolysis removes S and P from the solid cathode, avoiding the formation of CaS and Ca3P2 in CaC2 and consequently eliminating H2S and PH3 contamination in the finally produced C2H2.

         <title>Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the periodic surface of catalysts by the inclusion of single atoms can help building atomic electric fields that highly promote the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. We show here that this is achieved by modulating the interfacial water orientation and by subsequently decreasing the active sites&#8208;hydrogen distance.







Abstract
The slow water dissociation process in alkaline electrolyte severely limits the kinetics of HER. The orientation of H2O is well known to affect the dissociation process, but H2O orientation is hard to control because of its random distribution. Herein, an atomically asymmetric local electric field was designed by IrRu dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to tune the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation, thus optimizing its dissociation process. The electric field intensity of IrRu DSACs is over 4.00&#215;1010&#8197;N/C. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis on the adsorption behavior of H2O show that the M&#8722;H bond length (M=active site) is shortened at the interface due to the strong local electric field gradient and the optimized water orientation promotes the dissociation process of interfacial water. This work provides a new way to explore the role of single atomic sites in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activated Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Copper(I) Cluster&#8208;Assembled Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) copper cluster&#8208;assembled chains was prepared, which exhibited unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property. Based on which the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was constructed, which showed reversible photo&#8208;response property with excellent fatigue resistance.







Abstract
In this study, a pair of chiral copper(I) cluster&#8208;assembled materials (R/S&#8208;2) was prepared, exhibiting unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with a concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property in DMSO solution. By the combination of R/S&#8208;2 with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was developed, the CPL signal (glum=9&#215;10&#8722;3) of which could be induced by UV light irradiation. Moreover, the film exhibited a reversible photo&#8208;response and extremely good fatigue resistance. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response properties of the R/S&#8208;2 solution and film are attributed to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics of R/S&#8208;2 and a photo&#8208;induced deoxygenation process. This study enriches the types of luminescent cluster&#8208;assembled molecules and provides a new strategy for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive composite materials.

         <title>C&#8208;Bound or O&#8208;Bound Surface: Which One Boosts Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the localized negatively charged surface with C&#8208;affinity is superior to the positively charged one with O&#8208;affinity, providing guidance for screening and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate under ambient conditions is kind of sustainable and promising alternative method for urea synthesis. To date, the influence of catalyst surface properties on molecular adsorption configuration and electrocatalytic urea synthesis activity is unclear. In this work, we proposed that the urea synthesis activity is closely linked with the localized surface charge on bimetallic electrocatalysts, it is found that a negatively charged surface induces C&#8208;bound path and boosts urea synthesis. The urea yield rate can reach 13.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 on negatively charged Cu97In3&#8208;C, which is about 13&#8197;times that of positively charged Cu30In70&#8208;C counterpart with O&#8208;bound surface. This conclusion also applies to Cu&#8722;Bi and Cu&#8722;Sn systems. The molecular modification shifts the surface of Cu97In3&#8208;C to positively charged state, which leads to a sharp decline in urea synthesis performance. We demonstrated that the C&#8208;bound surface is more favorable than O&#8208;bound one to boost electrocatalytic urea synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive (Hetero)Arylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Imines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides have been uncovered with a chiral cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. This approach complements the traditional strategy using preformed organometallic reagents, and it exhibits good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition of aryl organometallic reagents to imines has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for the formation of optically active diarylmethylamines. Here, we report the first asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides enabled by a chiral cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. This approach shows good functional group compatibility and complements the reported strategy without use of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic investigations supported that aryl&#8208;cobalt, instead of an arylzinc reagent, was formed in situ in this reductive aryl&#8208;addition event.

Here, we report the first asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides enabled by a chiral cobalt-bisphosphine catalyst. This approach shows good functional group compatibility and complements the reported strategy without use of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic investigations supported that aryl-cobalt, instead of an arylzinc reagent, was formed in situ in this reductive aryl-addition event.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Li Plating on Graphite Anodes through Electrolyte Engineering for Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte engineering towards a high&#8208;quality SEI regulates Li plating on graphite anode with a high reversibility and uniform morphology during fast&#8208;charging. This work provides a novel strategy to address the Li plating issue for fast&#8208;charging batteries.







Abstract
The difficulties to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step cause the lithium (Li) plating hard to be completely avoided on graphite anodes during fast charging. Therefore, Li plating regulation and morphology control are proposed to address this issue. Specifically, a Li plating&#8208;reversible graphite anode is achieved via a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to successfully regulate the Li plating with high reversibility over high&#8208;rate cycling. The evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) before and after Li plating is deeply investigated to explore the interaction between the lithiation behavior and electrochemical interface polarization. Under the fact that Li plating contributes 40&#8201;% of total lithiation capacity, the stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI renders the anode a higher average Coulombic efficiency (99.9&#8201;%) throughout 240&#8197;cycles and a 99.95&#8201;% reversibility of Li plating. Consequently, a self&#8208;made 1.2&#8208;Ah LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite pouch cell delivers a competitive retention of 84.4&#8201;% even at 7.2&#8197;A (6&#8197;C) after 150&#8197;cycles. This work creates an ingenious bridge between the graphite anode and Li plating, for realizing the high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <title>Boosting Selective Oxidation of Ethylene to Ethylene Glycol Assisted by In situ Generated H2O2 from O2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ generated H2O2 from O2 electroreduction over mesoporous carbon is applied to oxidize ethylene via titanium silicalite&#8208;1. The in situ generated &#8901;OOH on the mesoporous carbon can form the key active species Ti&#8208;OOH over titanium silicalite&#8208;1 and oxidize ethylene. This route exhibits outstanding production rate and selectivity of ethylene glycol.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol is a useful organic compound and chemical intermediate for manufacturing various commodity chemicals of industrial importance. Nevertheless, the production of ethylene glycol in a green and safe manner is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we established an integrated, efficient pathway for oxidizing ethylene into ethylene glycol. Mesoporous carbon catalyst produces H2O2, and titanium silicalite&#8208;1 catalyst would subsequently oxidize ethylene into ethylene glycol with the in situ generated H2O2. This tandem route presents a remarkable activity, i.e., 86&#8201;% H2O2 conversion with 99&#8201;% ethylene glycol selectivity and 51.48&#8197;mmol&#8201;gecat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 production rate at 0.4&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Apart from generated H2O2 as an oxidant, there exists &#8901;OOH intermediate which could omit the step of absorbing and dissociating H2O2 over titanium silicalite&#8208;1, showing faster reaction kinetics compared to the ex situ one. This work not only provides a new idea for yielding ethylene glycol but also demonstrates the superior of in situ generated H2O2 in tandem route.

         <title>Water Activation for Boosting Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is demonstrated as an innovative co&#8208;reactant in the luminol electrochemiluminescence system for the first time, where cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide is afforded as an advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently catalyze the oxidation of water for the generation of reactive oxygen species, achieving the enhancement of electrochemiluminescence emission for sensitive biosensing.







Abstract
In conventional luminol electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems, hydrogen peroxide and dissolved oxygen are employed as typical co&#8208;reactants to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for efficient ECL emission. However, the self&#8208;decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and limited solubility of oxygen in water inevitably restrict the detection accuracy and luminous efficiency of luminol ECL system. Inspired by ROS&#8208;mediated ECL mechanism, for the first time, we used cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide as co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently activate water to generate ROS for enhancing luminol emission. Experimental investigations verify the formation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in the process of electrochemical water oxidation, which subsequently react with luminol anion radicals to trigger strong ECL signals. Finally, the detection of alkaline phosphatase has been successfully achieved with impressive sensitivity and reproducibility for practical sample analysis.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyphenylene Wires Comprising Rigid Aliphatic Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane Isolator Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphenylene wires regularly substituted with rigid aliphatic bicyclopentane isolators were obtained by on&#8208;surface synthesis and characterized with submolecular precision.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) motifs are of growing importance to the pharmaceutical industry as sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres of benzene rings and as molecular building blocks in materials science. Herein we explore the behavior of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties on metal surfaces by combining low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy / non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy studies with density functional theory modeling. We examine the configuration of individual BCP&#8208;containing precursors on Au(111), their supramolecular assembly and thermally activated dehalogenative coupling reactions, affording polymeric chains with incorporated electronically isolating units. Our studies not only provide the first sub&#8208;molecular insights of the BCP scaffold behavior on surfaces, but also extend the potential application of BCP derivatives towards integration in custom&#8208;designed surface architectures.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emerging strategy to enable energy efficient gas storage and separation technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents. Herein, we report two isostructural light&#8208;modulated adsorbents (LMAs) which undergo pressure&#8208;induced transformations from closed (non&#8208;porous) to open (porous) phases via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2.







Abstract
An emerging strategy in the design of efficient gas storage technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents which undergo transformations in response to a particular stimulus, such as pressure, heat or light. Herein, we report two isostructural light modulated adsorbents (LMAs) containing bis&#8208;3&#8208;thienylcyclopentene (BTCP), LMA&#8208;1 [Cd(BTCP)(DPT)2] (DPT=2,5&#8208;diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate) and LMA&#8208;2 [Cd(BTCP)(FDPT)2] (FDPT=5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate). Both LMAs undergo pressure induced switching transformations from non&#8208;porous to porous via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2. LMA&#8208;1 exhibited multi&#8208;step adsorption while LMA&#8208;2 showed a single&#8208;step adsorption isotherm. The light responsive nature of the BTPC ligand in both frameworks was exploited with irradiation of LMA&#8208;1 resulting in a 55&#8201;% maximum reduction of CO2 uptake at 298&#8197;K. This study reports the first example of a switching sorbent (closed to open) that can be further modulated by light.

Herein, we report two isostructural light modulated adsorbents (LMAs) containing bis-3-thienylcyclopentene (BTCP), &lt;b&gt;LMA-1 [Cd(BTCP)(DPT)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/b&gt; (DPT=2,5-diphenylbenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) and &lt;b&gt;LMA-2 [Cd(BTCP)(FDPT)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/b&gt; (FDPT=5-fluoro-2,diphenylbenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate). Both &lt;b&gt;LMAs&lt;/b&gt; undergo pressure induced switching transformations from non-porous to porous via adsorption of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;b&gt;LMA-1&lt;/b&gt; exhibited multi-step adsorption while &lt;b&gt;LMA-2&lt;/b&gt; showed a single-step adsorption isotherm. The light responsive nature of the BTPC ligand in both frameworks was exploited with irradiation of &lt;b&gt;LMA-1&lt;/b&gt; resulting in a 55&#8201;% maximum reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake at 298&#8197;K. This study reports the first example of a switching sorbent (closed to open) that can be further modulated by light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Herein, fully regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydroamination, hydroetherification and hydrothioetherification reactions of SF5&#8208;alkynes and further functionalizations of the corresponding Z&#8208;(hetero)vinyl&#8208;SF5 intermediates towards &#945;&#8208;SF5&#8208;ketones, &#945;&#8208;SF5&#8208;ester and &#946;&#8208;SF5&#8208;amine are described. Experimental and computational comparative studies with CF3&#8208;alkynes are also discussed.







Abstract
Herein is described a fully regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydroelementation reaction of SF5&#8208;alkynes with N, O and S&#8208;nucleophiles and further functionalization of the corresponding Z&#8208;(hetero)vinyl&#8208;SF5 intermediates, a suitable platform to access &#945;&#8208;SF5 ketones and esters, &#946;&#8208;SF5 amines and alcohols under mild reaction conditions. Experimental and computational comparative studies between SF5&#8208; and CF3&#8208;alkynes have been performed to highlight and explain the difference of reactivity and selectivity observed between these two fluorinated motifs.

         <title>Endogenous Enzyme&#8208;Operated Spherical Nucleic Acids for Cell&#8208;Selective Protein Capture and Localization Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;selective regulation of protein translocation is achieved through the rational design of an endogenous enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids platform. The system enables enzyme&#8208;activated capture of proteins of interest and thus regulation of their cytoplasmic&#8208;nuclear shuttling with tumor&#8208;cell specificity, as reported by Mengyuan Li and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202214958).

         <title>The Rigid Core and Flexible Surface of Amyloid Fibrils Probed by Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Spectroscopy of Aromatic Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rock&#8208;solid amyloid?&#160;Aromatic residues in the core of the amyloid fibrils HELLF and HET&#8208;s show no sign&#160;of ring flips suggesting a rigid core that does not undergo &#8222;breathing motions&#8221;. Aromatic residues facing outside on the other hand are highly flexible and show ring flips on various timescales. These conclusions could be drawn from dynamics measurements by solid&#8208;state MAS NMR in combination with specific labeling of phenylalanines and tyrosines as Antoine Loquet, Paul Schanda&#160;et&#8197;al. describe in their Research Article (e202219314).

         <title>Chiral Iron Porphyrins Catalyze Enantioselective Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Amination Upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed for the asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to give chiral indolines and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides in high product yields and with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions, as reported by Li Dang, Yungen Liu, Chi&#8208;Ming Che and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202218577). This method provides a complementary approach to asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H aminations by precious metal&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted protein upregulation by modulating the interaction between a target protein and its E3 ligase is the opposite strategy of targeted protein degradation (PROTAC). In their Research Article (e202300978), Dong&#8208;Sup Lee, Seung&#8197;Bum Park enhanced the cellular STING levels by inhibiting STING&#8208;TRIM29 interaction, which activates innate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and potentiates the immune&#8208;oncology treatment by changing COLD to HOT tumor. Thus, targeted protein upregulation can be an alternative drug discovery strategy for undruggable targets.

         <title>Systematic Enzymatic Synthesis of dTDP&#8208;Activated Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides are the most diverse sugar nucleotides in nature. They serve as the glycosylation donors of glycosyltransferases to produce various carbohydrate structures. In their Research Article (e202217894), Liuqing Wen and co&#8208;workers developed a general strategy for the efficient preparation of dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides from readily available starting materials. This high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy avoids the need for complicated purification procedures.

         <title>Supramolecular Enhancement of Charge Transport through Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;covalent interaction modulation is a promising strategy to guide the design of applicable (supra)molecular electronics. A rare investigation of the relationship between host&#8208;guest interaction and supramolecular charge transport is reported by Xiaobing Li, Siyuan Zhou, Cunlan Guo, Shigui Chen, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (&lt;url href=&#8220;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202216987&#8221;&gt;e202216987). The current density through the pillar[5]arenes&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers can be raised up to &#8764;2.1 orders of magnitude after the introduction of cationic guest molecules, providing a new route for the design of molecular electronic devices and functional sensors with tunable electronic components.

         <title>11C&#8208;Cyanation of Aryl Fluorides via Nickel and Lithium Chloride&#8208;Mediated C&#8211;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl&#160;fluorides are expected to be useful as radiolabeling precursors due to their chemical stability and ready availability. However, direct radiolabeling via carbon&#8211;fluorine (C&#8211;F) bond cleavage is a challenging issue due to its significant inertness. Herein, we report a two&#8208;phase radiosynthetic method for the ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of aryl fluorides to obtain [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8211;F bond activation. We also established a practical protocol that avoids the use of a glovebox, except for the initial preparation of a nickel/phosphine mixture, rendering the method applicable for general PET centers. This method enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse [11C]aryl nitriles from the corresponding aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicated a significant promotion effect of lithium chloride on the oxidative addition, affording an aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complex, which serves as a precursor for rapid 11C&#8208;cyanation.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenazine&#8208;based Compound Realizing Separate Hydrogen and Oxygen Production in Electrolytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable energy is a sustainable approach for hydrogen production. However, conventional water electrolysis may suffer from gas mixing, and the different kinetics between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) will limit the direct use of unstable renewable energies, leading to increased cost of H2 production. Herein, a novel phenazine&#8208;based compound is synthesized to develop the solid&#8208;state redox mediator associated water splititng process, and thus decoupling the H2 and O2 production in acid solution without the use of membrane. Excitingly, this organic redox mediator exhibits high specific capacity (290 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1), excellent rate performance (186 mAh g&#8208;1 at 30 A g&#8208;1) and long cycle life (3000 cycles) due to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic structure and the fast kinetics of H+ storage/release process. Furthermore, a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis architecture driven by solar energy is achieved, demonstrating high&#8208;purity H2 production at different times.</dc:description>

         <title>Passive Gate&#8208;Tunable Kinetic Photovoltage along Semiconductor&#8208;Water Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Moving boundaries of electrical double layer at solid&#8208;liquid interface enables unprecedented persistent energy conversion and provokes a kinetic photovoltaic effect by moving an illumination region along the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. Here, we report a transistor&#8208;inspired gate modulation of kinetic photovoltage by applying a bias at the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. The kinetic photovoltage of both p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type silicon samples can be facilely switched on/off, stemming from the electrical&#8208;field&#8208;modulated surface band bending. In contrast to the function of solid&#8208;state transistors relying on external sources, passive gate modulation of the kinetic photovoltage is achieved simply by introducing a counter electrode with materials of desired electrochemical potential. This architecture provides the ability to modulate the kinetic photovoltage over three orders of magnitude and opens up a new way for self&#8208;powered optoelectronic logic devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advances made in the field of stimuli&#8208;responsive catalysis during the last five years with a focus on the novel recently&#8208;emerged directions and applications have been surveyed. Metal&#8208;free catalysts and organometallic complexes, as well as biomimetic systems and extended structures, which display switchable catalytic activity for a variety of organic transformations, are discussed. Light&#8208;activated systems comprised of photochromic molecules capable of modulating reaction rate, yield, or enantioselectivity based on geometric and electronic changes associated with photoisomerization are the focus of the&#160;detailed discussion. Alternative stimuli, including pH and temperature, which could be applied either alone or in combination with light, are also addressed. Recent advances clearly demonstrate that the capability to finely tune catalyst behavior via an external stimulus is a powerful tool that could alter the landscape of sustainable chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis &#8208; Controlling the Competition of Monomeric versus Dimeric Reaction Pathway Enhances Stereoselectivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral phosphoric acids (CPA) have become a privileged catalyst type in organocatalysis, but the selection of the optimum catalyst is still challenging. So far hidden competing reaction pathways may limit the maximum stereoselectivities and the potential of prediction models. In CPA catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of imines, we identified for many systems two reaction pathways with inverse stereoselectivity, featuring as active catalyst either one CPA or a hydrogen bond bridged dimer. NMR measurements and DFT calculations revealed the dimeric intermediate and a stronger substrate activation via cooperativity. Both pathways are separable: Low temperatures and high catalysts loadings favor the dimeric pathway (ee up to &#8208;98%), while low temperatures with reduced catalyst loading favor the monomeric pathway and give significantly enhanced ee (92&#8208;99% ee; prior 68&#8208;86% at higher temperatures). Thus, a broad impact is expected on CPA catalysis regarding reaction optimization and prediction.</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal Alkynes as One&#8208;Carbon Donors in [5+1] Heteroannulation: Synthesis of Pyridines via Ynimine Intermediates and Application in the Total Synthesis of Anibamine B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed&#160;[4+2] heteroannulation between&#160;a,b&#8208;unsaturated oximes&#160;and their&#160;derivatives with alkynes&#160;have been developed into a powerful strategy for the synthesis of pyridines. It nevertheless lacks the regioselectivity when unsymmetrically substituted alkynes were used. We report herein an&#160;unprecedented&#160;synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines by a formal&#160;[5+1] heteroannulation of two easily accessible building blocks. A Cu&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Sonogashira cross coupling between&#160;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters&#160;with terminal alkynes affords ynimines which, without isolation, undergo acid&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction involving ketenimine formation, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and aromatization to afford pyridines.&#160;Terminal alkynes served as a one carbon donor to the pyridine core in this transformation.&#160;Di&#8208; through penta&#8208;substituted pyridines are accessible with complete regioselectivity and excellent functional group compatibility.&#160;The first total synthesis of anibamine B, an indolizinium alkaloid with potent antiplasmodial activity, is accomplished featuring&#160;this reaction as a key step.</dc:description>

A Cu-catalyzed aza-Sonogashira cross coupling between&#160;&#946;,&#947;-unsaturated oxime esters&#160;with terminal alkynes affords ynimines which, without isolation, undergo acid-catalyzed domino reaction involving ketenimine formation, 6&#960;-electrocyclization and aromatization to afford pyridines.&#160;Terminal alkynes served as a one carbon donor to the pyridine core in this transformation.&#160;Di- through penta-substituted pyridines are accessible with complete regioselectivity and excellent functional group compatibility.&#160;The first total synthesis of anibamine B, an indolizinium alkaloid with potent antiplasmodial activity, is accomplished featuring&#160;this reaction as a key step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A hemilabile NHC&#8208;gold complex and its application to the redox neutral 1,2&#8208;oxyarylation of feedstock alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a Au(I) complex modified with a hemi&#8208;labile (C^N) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand that is able to mediate oxidative addition of aryl iodides. Detailed computational and experimental investigations have been undertaken to verify and rationalize the oxidative addition process. Application of this initiation mode has resulted in the first examples of &#8220;exogenous oxidant&#8208;free&#8221; AuI/AuIII catalyzed 1,2&#8208;oxyarylations of ethylene and propylene. These demanding yet powerful processes establish these commodity chemicals as nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic building blocks in catalytic reaction design.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Multi&#8208;Cationic Molecular Chains for Gate Mechanism Controlled Superionic Conduction in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are high potential in achieving better safety and higher energy density, current solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) cannot fully satisfy the complicated requirements of SSBs. Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF) with multi&#8208;cationic molecular chains (COF&#8208;MCMC) was developed as an efficient SSE. The MCMCs chemically anchored on COF channels were generated by nano&#8208;confined copolymerization of cationic ionic liquid monomers, which can function as Li+ selective gates. The coulombic interaction between MCMCs and anions leads to easier dissociation of Li+ from coordinated states, and thus Li+ transport is accelerated. While the movement of anions is restrained due to the charge interaction, resulting in a high Li+ conductivity of 4.9&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1and Li+ transference number of 0.71 at 30 &#176;C. The SSBs with COF&#8208;MCMC demonstrate an excellent specific energy density of 403.4 Wh kg&#8209;1 with high cathode loading and limited Li metal source.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Perylene diimide&#8208;tethered pillar[5]arene derivatives form aggregates in non&#8208;polar organic solvents, and the complexation of cationic amino acid ethyl ester (cAA&#8208;OEt) with the aggregates induce a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer, leading to intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals having dissymmetric factors gabs of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8208;2. The hierarchical chiral induction exhibited an intriguing threshold dose effect, i.e., the chiral induction does not occur at the low concentration range of cAA&#8208;OEt but is triggered when cAA&#8208;OEt exceeds a threshold concentration. The inhibited interconversion between the Rp and Sp conformers of pillar[5]arene, which is further restricted in the aggregation, plays a crucial role in the threshold effect. When adding an enantiopure cAA&#8208;OEt first to the threshold concentration and then adding an equal amount of the antipodal cAA&#8208;OEt to give cAA&#8208;OEt in racemic form, CD spectra having the same sign as the CD induced by pure first cAA&#8208;OEt were induced, showing an unprecedented "first come, first served" effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Radical Afterglow of Carboxylic Acids with Tunable Spin Populations and Hole&#8208;Electron Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>No matter photoinduced organic radicals have been reported frequently, they are usually non&#8208;luminescent at ambient conditions. The internal mechanism on stability and electronic transitions of photoinduced radicals, is thus crucial for the development of relevant materials. Herein, a series of photoinduced radical emission systems were developed conveniently through doping benzoic acids into the hydrogen donor polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. Visual photoinduced radical emission and photochromism could be observed on Ph&#8208;3COOH@PVA film with the formation of cyclohexadienyl&#8208;type structure. For the first time, radical afterglow appeared with energy transfer from triplet state. The appropriate introduction of carboxylic groups to three nonadjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring was the best for decreasing spin population and promoting electronic transitions of the radical. This study largely expands the radical emission property from both internal mechanism and practical application.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new class of hybrid Wells&#8208;Dawson polyoxometalate (POM) containing a diphosphoryl group (P2O6X) of the general formula [P2W17O57(P2O6X)]6&#8208;&#160; (X = O, NH, or CR1R2). Modifying the bridging unit X was found to impact the redox potentials of the POM. The ease with which a range of &#945;&#8208;functionalized diphosphonic acids (X = CR1R2) can be prepared provides possibilities to access diverse functionalized hybrid POMs. Compared to existing phosphonate hybrid Wells&#8208;Dawson POMs, diphosphoryl&#8208;substituted POMs offer a wider tunable redox window and enhanced hydrolytic stability. This study provides a basis for the rational design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation hybrid Wells&#8208;Dawson POMs.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Density Optophysiology for Recording Intracellular and Extracellular Signals across the Brain of Free&#8208;Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of both intra/extracellular chemical signals across the large&#8208;scale brain is the key bottleneck, for understanding the interactions between the molecules inside and outside neurons. Here we built up a high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology together with developing two probes for specific recognition of L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and dopamine (DA), for simultaneously quantifying of both intracellular Cys and extracellular DA with high selectivity and accuracy across the brain of freely moving animals, as well as recording electrical signals. Using this powerful tool, it was found that intracellular Cys regulated extracellular DA through inducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the depressed mice brain. We also established the functional networks of Cys and DA across 32 brain regions in freely moving animals. More importantly, it was discovered that depression reduced the correlations between adjacent brain regions, which was recovered by the treatment of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine.</dc:description>

         <title>Laser Writing of Block&#8208;Copolymer Images into Mesopores Using SBDC&#8208;Initiated Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the iniferter N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) under visible&#8208;light irradiation with and without additional photocatalyst is demonstrated for the first time. Through the transfer of the polymerization to a commercially available microscope, automated laser writing of different polymers in mesoporous silica films is realized.







Abstract
For miniaturization, as well as for improving artificial nanopore performance, precise local polymer functionalization and the combination of different functionalities are required. Imagining data driven nanopore design automated nanopore functionalization would be beneficial. Using direct laser writing as one option of automated nanopore polymer functionalization visible light induced polymerizations are beneficial. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of mesoporous silicafilms with two different polymers using automated laser writing. For this we developed a visible light (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm and 405&#8197;nm) N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) inifierter initiated polymerization. While transferring this visible light induced polymerization using SBDC to a commercially available microscope, direct, automated laser writing, as well as polymer re&#8208;initiation was demonstrated. Thereby, polymer spots of 37 and 40&#8197;&#956;m in diameter were achieved using 1&#8211;5&#8197;seconds for each irradiated spot.

         <title>Switching Quantum Interference in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions by Mechanical Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching among different anchoring sites of single&#8208;molecule junctions was achieved by mechanical tuning, leading to the control of the transmission pathway between the destructive quantum interference (DQI) and the constructive quantum interference (CQI) at the single&#8208;molecule level, which provides a new strategy for designing molecular electromechanics devices.







Abstract
The charge transport through single&#8208;molecule electronic devices can be controlled mechanically by changing the molecular geometrical configuration in situ, but the tunable conductance range is typically less than two orders of magnitude. Herein, we proposed a new mechanical tuning strategy to control the charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions via switching quantum interference patterns. By designing molecules with multiple anchoring groups, we switched the electron transport between the constructive quantum interference (CQI) pathway and the destructive quantum interference (DQI) pathway, and more than four orders of magnitude conductance variation can be achieved by shifting the electrodes in a range of about 0.6&#8197;nm, which is the highest conductance range ever achieved using mechanical tuning.

         <title>Suppressive Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Ruthenium/TiO2 Promote Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction with Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suppressive strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) enable hot electrons excited on Ru to transfer to a TiO2&#8722;H2 support, thereby reducing the electron density on Ru to accelerate light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with methane. The optimized Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 composite exhibits an enhanced CO2 conversion rate of 400&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) have gained great attention in the heterogeneous catalysis field, but its negative role in regulating light&#8208;induced electron transfer is rarely explored. Herein, we describe how SMSI significantly restrains the activity of Ru/TiO2 in light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by CH4 due to the photo&#8208;induced transfer of electrons from TiO2 to Ru. In contrast, on suppression of SMSI Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 achieves a 46&#8208;fold CO2 conversion rate compared to Ru/TiO2. For Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2, a considerable number of photo&#8208;excited hot electrons from Ru nanoparticles (NPs) migrate to oxygen vacancies (OVs) and facilitate CO2 activation under illumination, simultaneously rendering Ru&#948;+ electron deficient and better able to accelerate CH4 decomposition. Consequently, photothermal catalysis over Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 lowers the activation energy and overcomes the limitations of a purely thermal system. This work offers a novel strategy for designing efficient photothermal catalysts by regulating two&#8208;phase interactions.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Molecular Oxygen Activation in Heterogeneous Thermo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Mini&#8208;review systematically summarized the recent research progress of dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) for molecular oxygen activation (MOA) in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Despite the rapid developments in this field, many great challenges still hinder the practical application of DASCs. We look forward to the challenges and application prospects of DASCs for MOA.







Abstract
Efficient molecular oxygen activation (MOA) is the key to environmentally friendly catalytic oxidation reactions. In the last decade, single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with nearly 100&#8201;% atomic utilization and unique electronic structure have been widely investigated for MOA. However, the single active site makes the activation effect unsatisfactory and difficult to deal with complex catalytic reactions. Recently, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) have provided a new idea for the effective activation of molecular oxygen (O2) due to more diverse active sites and synergetic interactions among adjacent atoms. In this review, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of DASCs for MOA in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Finally, we look forward to the challenges and application prospects in the construction of DASCs for MOA.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Bound Diarylethene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films as Photoactuators with a Directed Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators is presented. The DAE units are assembled in a surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. The light&#8208;induced length changes of the DAE linkers multiply to anisotropic mesoscopic length changes. Due to the architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, here, bending a cantilever and performing work.







Abstract
Molecular machines and responsive materials open a plethora of new opportunities in nanotechnology. We present an oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators, arranged in a way to yield an anisotropic response. The DAE units are assembled, together with a secondary linker, into a monolithic surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. By Infrared (IR) and UV/Vis spectroscopy as well as by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, we show that the light&#8208;induced extension changes of the molecular DAE linkers multiply to yield mesoscopic and anisotropic length changes. Due to the special architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, leading to the bending of a cantilever and performing work. This research shows the potential of assembling light&#8208;powered molecules into SURMOFs to yield photoactuators with a directed response, presenting a path to advanced actuators.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of a Pyryne Precursor to Higher Pyrenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By palladium&#8208;catalyzed oligomerization reactions of pyrene&#8208;based o&#8208;trimethylsilyl triflates larger cyclic pyrenylenes were formed with up to 10&#8208;membered rings as has been unambiguously characterized by SCXRD. Furthermore, the underlying reaction mechanism has been studied by quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract

         <title>Controlled Deformation of Soft Nanogel Particles Generates Artificial Biominerals with Ordered Internal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled deformation of soft nanogel particles during their occlusion within calcite crystals enables the generation of artificial biominerals with oriented internal structure. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and indicates that the rational design of multi&#8208;scale nanocomposite materials should be feasible via nanoparticle occlusion.







Abstract
Biominerals can exhibit exceptional mechanical properties owing to their hierarchically&#8208;ordered organic/inorganic nanocomposite structure. However, synthetic routes to oriented artificial biominerals of comparable complexity remain a formidable technical challenge. Herein we design a series of soft, deformable nanogels that are employed as particulate additives to prepare nanogel@calcite nanocomposite crystals. Remarkably, such nanogels undergo a significant morphological change&#8212;from spherical to pseudo&#8208;hemispherical&#8212;depending on their degree of cross&#8208;linking. This deformation occurs normal to the growth direction of the (104) face of the calcite and the underlying occlusion mechanism is revealed by in situ atomic force microscopy studies. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and offers new avenues for the design of synthetic nanocomposites comprising aligned anisotropic nanoparticles.

         <title>A Spectroscopic Study on Nitrogen Electrooxidation to Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The powerful electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) techniques are employed to detect reaction intermediates. Based on the detected intermediates, the associative mechanism with the addition of hydroxyl at distal N (distal mechanism) is deduced for nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR).







Abstract
As a potential substitute technique for conventional nitrate production, electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is gaining more and more attention. But, the pathway of this reaction is still unknown owing to the lack of understanding on key reaction intermediates. Herein, electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotope&#8208;labeled online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) are employed to study the NOR mechanism over a Rh catalyst. Based on the detected asymmetric NO2&#8722; bending, NO3&#8722; vibration, N=O stretching, and N&#8722;N stretching as well as isotope&#8208;labeled mass signals of N2O and NO, it can be deduced that the NOR undergoes an associative mechanism (distal approach) and the strong N&#8801;N bond in N2 prefers to break concurrently with the hydroxyl addition in distal N.

         <title>Solid Interhalogen Compounds with Effective Br0 Fixing for Stable High&#8208;energy Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound IBr as a cathode, in which the active I fixes the oxidized Br0 without generating crossing&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charge and discharge process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers improved energy density compared with those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes.







Abstract
Though massive efforts have been devoted to exploring Br&#8208;based batteries, the highly soluble Br2/Br3&#8722; species causing rigorous &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, leads to severe self&#8208;discharge and low Coulombic efficiency. Conventionally, quaternary ammonium salts such as methyl ethyl morpholinium bromide (MEMBr) and tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) are used to fix Br2 and Br3&#8722;, but they occupy the mass and volume of battery without capacity contribution. Here, we report an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound, IBr, as a cathode to address the above challenges, in which the oxidized Br0 is fixed by iodine (I), thoroughly eliminating cross&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charging and discharging process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers remarkably high energy density of 385.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is higher than those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes. Our work provides new approaches to achieve active solid interhalogen chemistry for high&#8208;energy electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>Catalytic Homologation&#8208;Allylboration Sequence for Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Densely Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Fluorohydrins with Tertiary Fluoride Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrins with tertiary fluoride stereocenters can be obtained via catalytic homologation and allylboration sequence with stereoselectivities up to 99&#8201;% ee. By allylboration of ketones, the process can also be used to access compounds with adjacent tertiary C&#8722;F and C&#8722;O stereocenters.







Abstract
Homologation of trisubstituted fluoroalkenes followed by allylboration of aldehyde, ketone and imine substrates is suitable for synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrin and amine products. In the presence of (R)&#8208;iodo&#8208;BINOL catalyst enantioselectivities up to 99&#8201;% can be achieved by formation of a single stereoisomer with adjacent stereocenters, of which one is a tertiary C&#8722;F center.

The level of NAD(P)H in mitochondria in living colorectal cancer cells (CRCs) was demonstrated to be highly co&#8208;related to p53 abnormality for the first time by employing a selective NIR fluorescent probe KC8 for NAD(P)H. Due to its NIR emission (745&#8197;nm) and excellent tumor&#8208;targeting character, KC8 was enriched in tumor region when administered intravenously, which was further utilized to discriminate the HCT&#8208;116 p53&#8722;/&#8722; from HCT&#8208;116 in vivo.







Abstract
NAD(P)H is crucial for biosynthetic reactions and antioxidant functions. However, the current probes developed for detecting NAD(P)H in vivo require intratumoral injection, which limited their application for animal imaging. To address this issue, we have developed a liposoluble cationic probe, KC8, which exhibits excellent tumor&#8208;targeting ability and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence after reaction with NAD(P)H. By using KC8, it was demonstrated for the first time that the level of NAD(P)H in the mitochondria of living colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was highly related to the abnormality of the p53. Furthermore, KC8 was successfully used to differentiate not only between tumor and normal tissue but also between tumors with p53 abnormality and normal tumors when administered intravenously. Finally, we evaluated tumor heterogeneity through two fluorescent channels after treating a tumor with 5&#8208;Fu. This study provides a new tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of the p53 abnormality of CRC cells.

&lt;p&gt;The level of NAD(P)H in mitochondria in living colorectal cancer cells (CRCs) was demonstrated to be highly co-related to p53 abnormality for the first time by employing a selective NIR fluorescent probe KC8 for NAD(P)H. Due to its NIR emission (745&#8197;nm) and excellent tumor-targeting character, KC8 was enriched in tumor region when administered intravenously, which was further utilized to discriminate the HCT-116 p53&#8722;/&#8722; from HCT-116 in vivo.
