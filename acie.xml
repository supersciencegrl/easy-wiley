         <title>On Demand Flow Platform for the Generation of Anhydrous Dinitrogen Trioxide and Its Further Use in N&#8208;Nitrosative Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitrogen trioxide (N  2  O  3  ) is a powerful and efficient nitrosating agent that comes with an unprecedented atom economy. However, the synthetic application of N  2  O  3  is still underdeveloped mostly due to its inherent instability and the lack of reliable protocols for its preparation. This paper presents an open&#8208;source setup and procedure for the on&#8208;demand generation of anhydrous N  2  O  3  solution (up to 1 M), which can be further used for reactions under batch and flow conditions. The accuracy and stability of N  2  O  3  concentration are guaranteed with the absence of head&#8208;space in the setup and with the synchronization of the gas flows. The reliability of this protocol is demonstrated by &gt;30 worked examples in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles &#8211; a library of structurally diverse benzotriazoles and sydnones. Kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the  N  &#8208;nitrosative steps are also explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Tetracyclic Pyridinium Alkaloid epi&#8208;Tetradehydrohalicyclamine B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of a tetracyclic marine pyridinium alkaloid hinged on recent advances in chemoselectivity management: While many classical methods failed to afford the perceptively simple pyridine&#8208;containing core of the target, nickel/iridium photoredox dual catalysis allowed the critical C&#8722;C&#8208;bond to be formed in good yield. Likewise, ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) worked well in the presence of the unhindered pyridine despite the innately Lewis acidic Mo(+6) center of the alkylidyne catalyst. Finally, an iridium catalyzed hydrosilylation was uniquely effective in reducing a tertiary amide without compromising an adjacent pyridine and the lateral double bonds; this transformation is largely without precedent. The second strained macrocycle enveloping the core was closed by intramolecular N&#8208;alkylation with formation of the pyridinium unit; the reaction proceeded site&#8208; and chemoselectively in the presence of an a priori more basic tertiary amine.</dc:description>

         <title>Transesterification of Non&#8208;Activated Esters Promoted by Small Molecules Mimicking the Active Site of Hydrolases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small synthetic artificial enzyme&#160;is able to accomplish, for the first time, the transesterification of non&#8208;activated esters under neutral and mild conditions. Inspired by the catalytic machinery of chymotrypsin and N&#8208;terminal hydrolases, Garrido&#8208;Gonz&#225;lez and co&#8208;workers show in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202206072) that a small molecule which mimics the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole of hydrolases can emulate in a test tube the catalytic properties of hydrolytic enzymes.

         <title>Unshared Pair Electrons of Zincophilic Lewis Base Enable&#160;Long&#8208;life Zn Anodes under &#8220;Three High&#8221; Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogen evolution and dendrite issues are the notorious culprits of the limited lifespan and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Zn anodes, particularly at harsh test conditions. Herein, considering the Lewis acidic feature of Zn  2+  , abundant unshared pair electrons of zincophilic Lewis bases are proposed as decent electrolyte additives to stabilize Zn anodes at &#8220;Three High&#8221; conditions (high depth of discharge, high areal capacity and high current). The unshared pair electrons can remove H  2  O from Zn  2+  solvated sheaths and confine the activity of H  2  O by breaking its hydrogen bonding network. The combination of these factors effectively restricts H  2  O&#8208;involved side reactions and enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, even at harsh conditions. The effectiveness of this strategy is fully proved by a series of Lewis base molecules. Noticeably, the Zn||Zn cell with an area of 20 cm  2  , using DMF&#8208;containing electrolyte can be stably cycled over 1000 h at 60% DOD, with a 100% CE.</dc:description>

         <title>Open&#8208;Bandgap Graphene&#8208;based Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Using Oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) Interfacial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic interfacial compounds (OICs) are required as linkers for the highly stable and efficient immobilization of bioprobes in nanobiosensors using 2D nanomaterials such as graphene. Herein, we first demonstrated the fabrication of a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) via a microelectromechanical system process after covalent functionalization on large&#8208;scale graphene by introducing oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene)amine (OPE). OPE was compared to various OICs by density functional theory simulations and was confirmed to have a higher binding energy with graphene and a lower band gap than other OICs. OPE can improve the immobilization efficiency of a bioprobe by forming a self&#8208;assembly monolayer via anion&#8208;based reaction. Using this technology, Magainin I&#8208;conjugated OGMFET (MOGMFET) showed a high sensitivity, high selectivity, with a limit of detection of 100 cfu/mL. These results indicate that the OPE OIC can be applied for stable and comfortable interfacing technology for biosensor fabrication.</dc:description>

         <title>P and Cu Dual Sites on Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Hydrocarbon Fuels with High C2H6 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products is especially meaningful, while the low efficiency of multi&#8208;electron transfer and sluggish C&#8722;C coupling greatly hinder its development. Herein, we report a photocatalyst comprising of P and Cu dual sites anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (P/Cu SAs@CN), which achieves a high C2H6 evolution rate of 616.6 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in reducing CO2 to hydrocarbons. The detailed spectroscopic characterizations identify the formation of charge&#8208;enriched Cu sites, where the isolated P atoms serve as hole capture sites during photocatalysis. Theoretical simulations combined with in&#8208;situ FTIR measurement reveal a kinetically feasible for the formation of C&#8722;C coupling intermediate (*OC&#8722;COH) and confirm the favorable production of C2H6 on the P/Cu SAs@CN photocatalyst. This work offers new insights into the photocatalyst design with atomic precision toward highly efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion to high value&#8208;added carbon products.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly efficient electrosynthesis of nitric oxide for biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) constitutes one of the most versatile therapeutics for biomedical applications because of its manifold signaling functions. The efficient and on&#8208;demand generation of NO essentially dictates its concentration dependent therapeutic activity. Here, we report an electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (i.e., Fe SAC), for high&#8208;efficient and controlled NO generation. The Fe SAC shows superior catalytic ability in electrochemical reduction of nitrite, with maximal rate of NO generation achieving 2.1 &#956;M&#183;(min&#183;&#956;g)  &#8208;1  . DFT studies suggest the significant decrease of Gibbs&#8208;free energy of NO  2  &#8208;  adsorption on single&#8208;iron atom accounts for its high catalytic efficiency. Moreover, ample amount of NO can be controllably generated in a potential dependent manner. Using bacterial elimination as a representative application, the electrochemical generated NO overwhelmingly disrupts gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive strains. The effectiveness of NO generation system underscores a great promise to expedite NO research in both basic and applied sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Transfer Hydrogenation with a Carbon&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Photocatalyst and Water as a Proton Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds receives increasing attention for sustainable organic synthesis, but water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen donor, has rarely been investigated due to the high barrier of splitting water molecules. Here, a carbon nitride supported palladium single&#8209;atom heterogeneous catalyst originates unparalleled performance in photocatalytic water&#8209;donating transfer hydrogenations compared to its nanoparticle counterparts. Isotopic&#8209;labeling experiments and operando nuclear magnetic resonance measurements confirm the direct hydrogenation mechanism using in situ generated protons from water splitting under visible&#8209;light irradiation. Density functional theory calculations attribute the high activity to lower barriers for hydrogenation, facilitated desorption of ethylbenzene, and facile hydrogen replenishment from water on the atomic palladium sites.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable and Reversible Virus&#8208;Mimicking NIR&#8208;II Nanoprobe for Monitoring the Progression of Viral Encephalitis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viral encephalitis is an inflammatory disease of the brain parenchyma and caused by various viral infections. In vivo monitoring of the progression of viral infections can aid accurate diagnosis of viral encephalitis and effective intervention. We developed an activatable and reversible virus&#8208;mimicking near&#8208;infrared II nanoprobe consisting of an Fe  2+  &#8208;coordinated, viral protein&#8208;decorated vesicle encapsulating PbS quantum dots with a 1300 nm fluorescence emission. The probe can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and monitor real&#8208;time changes in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species concentrations during viral infection by tuning the quenching level of quantum dots and regulating the fusion&#8211;fission behavior of vesicles via changes in Fe oxidation state. This switching strategy reduces background noise and improves detection sensitivity, making this nanoprobe a promising imaging agent for dynamic visualization of viral encephalitis and future clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphological Anisotropy in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Micro&#8208;/Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anisotropy plays unique roles in the structural regulation of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites, especially at micron&#8208;/nano&#8208;scale. However, there is a lack of a dedicated review on MOF micro&#8208;/nanoparticles (MNPs) from the morphologically anisotropic perspective. In this minireview, the recent advances in anisotropic MOF MNPs are summarized, with a focus on how morphological anisotropy produces innovative structures and modulates properties. Anisotropic pristine MOF MNPs with diverse morphologies are firstly introduced classified by morphology&#8208;dependent and morphology&#8208;independent anisotropy. Secondly, the anisotropy enabled site&#8208;selective higher&#8208;order architecting of MOF&#8208;based materials are highlighted. Finally, challenges and prospects for anisotropic MOFs are discussed, aiming to provide inspiration for the further development in this interesting research field.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating plasticity and elasticity is theoretically possible for anisotropic molecular crystals and it is beneficial to the rich and complex deformations, however, it is much harder to implement in practice. Here, we report a centimeter&#8208;long organic crystal that is two&#8208;dimensionally (2D) elastic&#8208;bendable not only at room temperature but also at ultralow temperatures (&#8211;196&#186;C). Besides that, the straight crystal can be manually twisted and reconfigured to form arbitrary right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helical structures. The integration of low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant (LTR) 2D elastic&#8208;bending and reconfigurable plastic&#8208;twisting deformations into one organic crystal expands the perspectives of the emerging crystal flexibility. Taking advantage of the unique multi&#8208;type flexibilities, spatial controllability of optical transmission for cryogenic service and reusability of light polarization rotations has been implemented simultaneously on an organic crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Ubiquitin&#8208;like Protein ISG15 Tools Through Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Ligation Catalyzed by a Viral Protease Lbpro</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;like protein ISG15 (interferon&#8208;stimulated gene 15) regulates innate immunity and is implicated in the evasion of the host response by viruses such as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Dissecting ISGylation pathways recently received increasing attention which can illuminate the biological functions of ISG15 and inform related disease interventions, but such studies necessitate the expedient preparation and development of various ISG15 protein tools. Here, we report a finding that the leader protease (Lb  pro  ) encoded by foot&#8208;and&#8208;mouth disease virus can promote ligation reactions between recombinant ISG15 and synthetic glycyl compounds, enabling efficient preparation of various ISG15 protein tools such as ISG15&#8208;propargylamide and ISG15&#8208;rhodamine110, which are needed for cellular proteomic studies of deISGylases, and the screening and evaluation of inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro). Furthermore, the Lb  pro  ligation strategy can also be used for loading recombinant ISG15 onto the lysine of a synthetic peptide through an isopeptide bond, and for chemo&#8208;enzymatic preparation of Ub and NEDD8 protein tools.</dc:description>

         <title>The Crucial Role of Electrode Potential of a Working Anode in Dictating the Structural Evolution of Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of rechargeable lithium (Li) batteries is highly correlated with the structure of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which governs the ion transport at the anode/electrolyte interface and directly impacts the cycle lifespan of the anode. The properties of a working anode are vital factors in determining the structure of SEI; however, the correspondingly poor understanding hinders the rational regulation of SEI. Herein, the role of electrode potential and anode material, two critical properties of a working anode, in dictating the structural evolution of SEI was investigated theoretically and experimentally. The anode potential is identified as the crucial role in dictating the SEI structure. The anode potential determines the reduction products of electrolyte thermodynamically, ultimately giving rise to the mosaic and bilayer SEI structure at high and low potential, respectively. In contrast, the anode material does not cause a significant change of the SEI structure but merely changes the ratio of organic and inorganic compounds in SEI. This work discloses the crucial role of electrode potential in dictating SEI structure and provides rational guidance to regulate SEI structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Conjugation of Aptamers on Carbon Fiber Microelectrode Enables Highly Stable and Selective In Vivo Neurosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacing aptamers with carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFEs) provides a versatile platform to probe the chemical activity in living brain at the molecular level. However, new chemistries are needed for efficient and stable modifying aptamers on electrode surfaces. Here, we present an electrochemical conjugation strategy to covalent couple aptamers onto CFEs with high chemoselectivity, efficiency, and stability for sensing in the brain. The strategy employs an initial electrochemical coupling of catechol on CFE, generating a thin layer of quinone intermediates that couple rapidly with thiol&#8208;containing oligonucleotides under a controlled potential. This approach dramatically simplifies and improves the efficiency for modification on carbon surfaces, allowing direct conjugation of high levels of aptamers on CFE within 5 minutes. Importantly, the covalent linkage between aptamers and carbon surfaces enables a greatly improved sensitivity and stability in sensing of dopamine, offering a robust system for continuously probing dopamine dynamics in living brain of animals.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryldifluoromethylation of Aryl Halides with Aryldifluoromethyl Trimethylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diaryl difluoromethanes are valuable targets for medicinal chemistry because they are bioisosteres of diaryl ethers and can function as replacements for diaryl methane, ketone, and sulfone groups. However, methods to prepare diaryl difluoromethanes are scarce, especially methods starting from abundant aryl halides. We report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed aryldifluoromethylation of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes (TMSCF  2  Ar). The reaction occurs when the catalyst contains a simple, but unusual, dialkylaryl phosphine ligand that promotes transmetallation of the silane. Computational studies show that reductive elimination following transmetallation occurs with a low barrier, despite the fluorine atoms on the  a  &#8208;carbon, due to coordination of the difluorobenzyl p&#8208;system to palladium. The co&#8208;development of a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes broadened the scope of the process including several applications to the synthesis biologically relevant diaryl difluoromethanes.</dc:description>

While the cycloaddition of alkynylnaphthols with imines proceeded via a sequential [2+4] cycloaddition and an auto oxidation reaction.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Chelatable Porphyrinic Frameworks for Single&#8208;Cell Multiplexing with Mass Cytometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy for mass cytometry markers is reported using functionalized mesoporous porphyrinic frameworks (MPF) as scaffolds for chelating metals that have been difficult to integrate in conventional markers. With polyethylene glycol surface functionalization, post&#8208;synthetic metalation and antibody conjugation, the resulting MPF&#8208;based markers exhibit excellent specificity and sensitivity for multi&#8208;parameter single&#8208;cell analysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell multiplexing is key to exploration of the heterogeneous cell populations in biological systems. Although the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mass cytometry (CyTOF) possesses high resolution and multiple dimensions, the lack of suitable marker materials prohibits fully exploiting the available CyTOF detection channels. Here we report a new design strategy for CyTOF markers using functionalized mesoporous porphyrinic frameworks (MPFs) as scaffolds for chelating metals that have been unachievable by conventional approaches. We developed surface modification for stably dispersing the MPF nanoparticles (&lt;40&#8197;nm) during the metalation and antibody conjugation processes. Our markers exhibit higher sensitivity and comparable specificity compared with a polymer&#8208;based commercial benchmark. Compatibility with commercial markers during co&#8208;staining was also confirmed. Furthermore, our markers show promising performance for immunophenotyping and potential implementation in CyTOF systems.

We developed surface modification for stably dispersing the MPF nanoparticles (&amp;lt;40&#8197;nm) during the metalation and antibody conjugation processes. Our markers exhibit higher sensitivity and comparable specificity compared with a polymer-based commercial benchmark. Compatibility with commercial markers during co-staining was also confirmed. Furthermore, our markers show promising performance for immunophenotyping and potential implementation in CyTOF systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Monocrystalline Coordination Polymer with Multiple Redox Centers as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination polymer of CuCA is successfully synthesized by coordinating the high&#8208;capacity carbonyl compound of chloranilic acid (CA) as organic ligand with the high&#8208;voltage Cu2+ as transition metal node. With &#960;&#8211;d conjugation, layered structure and monocrystalline nature, the resulting CuCA cathode presents inorganic and organic redox centers, high electronic conductivity and fast Li+ diffusion kinetics with a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte.







Abstract
Coordination polymers can take advantage of both transition metal redox and organic ligand redox, thus serving as promising cathodes with multiple redox centers toward higher&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we selected the high&#8208;capacity carbonyl compound of chloranilic acid (CA) as organic ligand to coordinate with the high&#8208;voltage Cu2+ as transition metal node and successfully synthesized copper(II) chloranilate (CuCA) with &#960;&#8211;d conjugation, layered structure and monocrystalline nature. The resulting CuCA presents inorganic and organic redox centers, high electronic conductivity and fast Li+ diffusion kinetics, leading to high discharge capacity (297.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (160.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and good cycling stability (165.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles) with quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte. This work will provide insightful understanding of the materials design strategies to develop more efficient coordination polymer cathodes for LIBs.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Cage Binding Iodide Anions over Other Halide Ions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocycle M4+ and a cage C6+ were self&#8208;assembled by hydrazone formation in acidic aqueous solution. The cage is capable of encapsulating I&#8722; selectively over other halide anions in water; the macrocycle does not exhibit any recognition towards these other anions.







Abstract
A triangular&#8208;prism shaped cage was self&#8208;assembled by the formation of a dynamic covalent bond, namely a hydrazone, in acidic aqueous solution. The hexacationic host bears a number of relatively acidic protons pointing inside the cage cavity, which is able to accommodate an iodide anion selectively in water over other halide anions such as F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and Br&#8722;, which are more hydrated. As a comparison, a macrocycle analogue bearing fewer positive charges and fewer hydrogen bond donors shows no anion binding ability. As inferred from the single&#8208;crystal structure and theoretical calculations, the ability of the cage to selectively recognize iodide anions results from the combination of electrostatic forces, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722; hydrogen bonds, and the hydrophobic effect.

         <title>Responsive Peptide Nanofibers with Theranostic and Prognostic Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PEGylated porphyrin&#8208;peptide (PHHPEG6) building block self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers (NFs), which formed aggregates in the acidic tumor microenvironment. The pH&#8208;induced aggregation of PHHPEG6 NFs resulted in enhanced 1O2 generation efficiency and prolonged tumor retention, thus enabling control over the entire PDT process, from the visualization of photosensitizer accumulation to actual PDT and subsequent assessment of the efficacy of the treatment.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a highly promising therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive photosensitizer nanomaterials overcomes certain limitations in clinical PDT. Herein, we report the rational design of a highly sensitive PEGylated photosensitizer&#8208;peptide nanofiber (termed PHHPEG6 NF) that selectively aggregates in the acidic tumor and lysosomal microenvironment. These nanofibers exhibit acid&#8208;induced enhanced singlet oxygen generation, cellular uptake, and PDT efficacy in vitro, as well as fast tumor accumulation, long&#8208;term tumor imaging capacity and effective PDT in vivo. Moreover, based on the prolonged presence of the fluorescent signal at the tumor site, we demonstrate that PHHPEG6 NFs can also be applied for prognostic monitoring of the efficacy of PDT in vivo, which would potentially guide cancer treatment. Therefore, these multifunctional PHHPEG6 NFs allow control over the entire PDT process, from visualization of photosensitizer accumulation, via actual PDT to the assessment of the efficacy of the treatment.

         <title>Pharmacological Chaperones for GCase that Switch Conformation with pH Enhance Enzyme Levels in Gaucher Animal Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational equilibrium in aqueous solution of polyhydroxylated iminoxylitols is related to the ammonium pKa. Engineering of its basicity through chemical modification allows modulation of the pKa value into the physiologically relevant 7.0&#8211;4.5 range. This optimizes GCase inhibition in the intraluminal conditions of the ER, but weakens binding in the more acidic environment of the lysosome.







Abstract
Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations which destabilize the native folded form of GCase, triggering degradation and ultimately resulting in low enzyme activity. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) which stabilize mutant GCase have been used to increase lysosomal activity through improving trafficking efficiency. By engineering their inherent basicity, we have synthesized PCs that change conformation between the ER and the lysosomal environment, thus weakening binding to GCase after its successful trafficking to the lysosome. NMR studies confirmed the conformational change while X&#8208;ray data reveal bound conformations and binding modes. These results were further corroborated by cell studies showing increases in GCase activity when using the pH&#8208;switchable probe at low dosing. Preliminary in vivo assays with humanized mouse models of Gaucher showed enhanced GCase activity levels in relevant tissues, including the brain, further supporting their potential.

         <title>Suppression of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Replication with Stabilized and Click&#8208;Chemistry Modified siRNAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
siRNAs protect cells from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and can be quickly adjusted to variants of concern. An alkyne moiety was integrated at the 3&#8242; end of the siRNA to enable chemical modification of the siRNA via CuI&#8208;catalysed click&#8208;chemistry. Following this strategy, the siRNA can be conjugated to receptor ligands such as hACE2&#8208;binding peptides, which allows target&#8208;specific delivery.







Abstract
The emergence of more transmissible or aggressive variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 requires the development of antiviral medication that is quickly adjustable to evolving viral escape mutations. Here we report the synthesis of chemically stabilized small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The siRNA can be further modified with receptor ligands such as peptides using CuI&#8208;catalysed click&#8208;chemistry. We demonstrate that optimized siRNAs can reduce viral loads and virus&#8208;induced cytotoxicity by up to five orders of magnitude in cell lines challenged with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Furthermore, we show that an ACE2&#8208;binding peptide&#8208;conjugated siRNA is able to reduce virus replication and virus&#8208;induced apoptosis in 3D mucociliary lung microtissues. The adjustment of the siRNA sequence allows a rapid adaptation of their antiviral activity against different variants of concern. The ability to conjugate the siRNA via click&#8208;chemistry to receptor ligands facilitates the construction of targeted siRNAs for a flexible antiviral defence strategy.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Alkaline Electrolyte for Electrically Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries with Long&#8208;Term Operation Stability in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost zinc acetate electrolyte was introduced for electrically rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery for the first time, which could achieve a long&#8208;term operation stability in ambient air without any special cell engineering. The battery reaction mechanism of reversible formation/decomposition of zinc hydroxyacetate dihydrate was revealed using well&#8208;designed electrochemical and analytical techniques.







Abstract
Electrically rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries attract extensive research interests due to their potentially high energy density and low cost but suffer from chemical instability and poor electrochemical reversibility caused by the corrosive nature of the conventional alkaline electrolyte. Here we demonstrate a non&#8208;alkaline zinc acetate electrolyte for electrically rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries with long&#8208;term operation stability (&gt;600&#8197;hours) in ambient air without any special cell engineering. The unique battery chemistry with reversible formation/decomposition of zinc hydroxyacetate dihydrate is systematically revealed using diversified electrochemical and analytical techniques. Furthermore, the carbon&#8208;based air cathode is modified towards a hydrophilic surface to increase the energy efficiency. This work provides new insight on effective electrolyte design to achieve long&#8208;term operation zinc&#8208;air batteries.

         <title>Directing the Morphology, Packing, and Properties of Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Cation Exchange
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Predicting crystal morphologies&#160;is challenging because of the many factors influencing their growth. Dan Oron, Michal Lahav and Milko E. van der Boom and co&#8208;workers demonstrate in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205238) how metal cation exchange in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) results in a series of chiral crystals having a similar morphology, packing and a rare space group (P622). The fact that the crystals maintain their morphology facilitates a quantitative comparison of their optical and magnetic properties. The metal cation exchange is likely to be mediated by differently&#8208;sized nanochannels.

         <dc:description>An unprecedented non&#8208;uniform self&#8208;folding of artificial polymer chains composed of turn moieties and stretched segments is presented through the design of a set of optically active poly(fluorene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diylethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) (poly(fluorenevinylene)) derivatives bearing a neomenthyl group and a pentyl group attached at the 9&#8208;position of fluorene backbone at various ratios.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoswitchable motif of azobenzenes is of great importance across the life and material sciences. This maintains a constant demand for their efficient synthesis, especially that of non&#8208;symmetric derivatives. We disclose here a general strategy for their synthesis through an unprecedented C(sp2)&#8211;N(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling where functionalized aryl&#8208;substituted diazenes masked with a silyl group are employed as diazenyl pronucleophiles. These equivalents of fragile diazenyl anions couple with a diverse set of (hetero)aryl bromides under palladium catalysis  with no loss of dinitrogen  . The competing denitrogenative biaryl formation is fully suppressed. The reaction requires a minimal excess, that is 1.2 equivalents, of the diazenyl component. By this, a broad range of azoarenes decorated with two electron&#8208;rich/deficient aryl groups can be accessed in a predictable way with superb functional&#8208;group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of a Novel Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Type IV IDO1 Inhibitor Chemotype</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural product (NP)&#8208;inspired design principles provide invaluable guidance for bioactive compound discovery. Pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) are de&#8208;novo combinations of NP fragments to target biologically relevant chemical space not covered by NPs. We describe the design and synthesis of apoxidoles, a novel pseudo&#8208;NP class, whereby indole&#8208; and tetrahydropyridine fragments are linked in monopodal connectivity not found in nature. Apoxidoles are efficiently accessible by an enantioselective [4+2] annulation reaction. Biological evaluation revealed that apoxidoles define a new potent type IV inhibitor chemotype of indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a heme&#8208;containing enzyme considered a target for the treatment of neurodegeneration, autoimmunity and cancer. Apoxidoles target apo&#8208;IDO1, prevent heme binding and induce unique amino acid positioning as revealed by crystal structure analysis. Novel type IV apo&#8208;IDO1 inhibitors are in high demand, and apoxidoles may provide new opportunities for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry research.</dc:description>

Pseudo-natural products (PNPs) are de-novo combinations of NP fragments to target biologically relevant chemical space not covered by NPs. We describe the design and synthesis of apoxidoles, a novel pseudo-NP class, whereby indole- and tetrahydropyridine fragments are linked in monopodal connectivity not found in nature. Apoxidoles are efficiently accessible by an enantioselective [4+2] annulation reaction. Biological evaluation revealed that apoxidoles define a new potent type IV inhibitor chemotype of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a heme-containing enzyme considered a target for the treatment of neurodegeneration, autoimmunity and cancer. Apoxidoles target apo-IDO1, prevent heme binding and induce unique amino acid positioning as revealed by crystal structure analysis. Novel type IV apo-IDO1 inhibitors are in high demand, and apoxidoles may provide new opportunities for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Arene&#8208;Ruthenium(II)/Osmium(II) Complexes Potentiate the Anticancer Efficacy of Metformin via Glucose Metabolism Reprogramming</title>

         <dc:description>
Combination of arene&#8208;osmium(II) complex 5 with metformin could be used as a new strategy to treat cancer under hypoglycemia through glucose metabolism reprogramming.







Abstract
Targeting metabolic reprogramming to treat cancer could increase overall survival and reduce side effects. Here, we put forward a strategy using arene&#8208;ruthenium(II)/osmium(II) complexes to potentiate the anticancer effect of metformin (Met.) via glucose metabolism reprogramming. Complexes 1&#8211;6 with oxoglaucine derivatives as ligands were synthesized and their anti&#8208;tumor activities were tested under hypoglycemia. Results indicated that 2 and 5 potentiated the anticancer effects of Met. under hypoglycemia, exhibiting lower toxicity, slower blood glucose decline and inhibition of early tumor liver metastasis. Combination of 5 with Met. could be used as a new strategy to treat cancer under hypoglycemia through glucose metabolism reprogramming.

         <title>Facile Benzylic Alkylation of Arenes with Alcohols by Catalysis with Spirocyclic NHC IrIII Pincer Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile IrIII&#8208;catalyzed benzylic alkylation of arenes with alcohols has been accomplished via borrowing hydrogen (BH) pathways, and the newly developed spirocyclic NHC IrIII pincer complex (Cat A) serves as an efficient catalyst for this atom&#8208;economical and greener transformation. Some drug or bioactive molecules and functional material templates can be easily constructed by this strategy.







Abstract
A facile benzylic alkylation of indenes and other arenes was developed from readily available primary and secondary alcohols using our newly investigated CCC pincer IrIII catalyst (SNIr&#8722;H). Excellent regioselectivity and yield (89&#8201;%) of the C3&#8208;alkylated indenes were obtained. Additionally, the challenging sp2C&#8208;alkylation was readily accomplished. This method could be utilized for the synthesis of the analogs of a histamine H1 receptor antagonist and the functional material template molecule, indeno[2,1&#8208;a]indene. A hemilabile IrIII&#8208;dihydride intermediate was proposed based on control experiments and previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the borrowing hydrogen mechanism and is key to the success of this IrIII catalyst in the reduction of unactivated multi&#8208;substituted olefin intermediates.

         <title>Nearly&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield and 12&#8208;Hour Afterglow from a Transparent Perovskite of Cs2NaScCl6:Tb</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike afterglow phosphors, transparent crystal free of scattering issue held great potential in specific applications such as volumetric display and three&#8208;dimensional encryption. Here, a double&#8208;perovskite host of ~ 85% transparency, namely Cs2NaScCl6 single crystal, was grown in an aqueous solution. Through heavy doping of Tb ions, the crystal exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) up to 98.2%. Both steady&#8208;state and transient PL spectroscopic investigation revealed a cross&#8208;relaxation efficiency (&#951;CR ~ 99%) between Tb ions, which greatly mitigated the electron saturation on the 5D3 level and encouraged the radiative route against quenching. Importantly, the doped crystal displayed an intense afterglow up to 12 h after ceasing the excitation of X&#8208;ray, which inspired the design of a radiation&#8208;storage battery of linear scaling capacity with loading weight. Our work opened many possibilities in photo&#8208;stimulated volumetric display and three&#8208;dimensional information storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth&#8208;Mediated &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Acidic Diketones with ortho&#8208;Substituted Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic and fluoroalkyl 1,3&#8208;diketones is made challenging by the highly stabilized nature of the corresponding enolates, and is especially difficult for sterically demanding aryl partners. As a general solution to this problem, we report the Bi&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling of acidic diones and ortho&#8208;substituted arylboronic acids. Starting from a bench&#8208;stable bismacycle precursor, a sequence of B&#8208;to&#8208;Bi transmetallation, oxidation and C&#8208;C bond formation furnishes the arylated diones. Development of methodology that tolerates both sensitive functionality and steric demand is supported by interrogation of key reactive intermediates. Application of our strategy to cyclic diones enables the concise synthesis of important agrochemical intermediates which were previously prepared using toxic Pb reagents. This methodology also enables the first ever arylation of fluoroalkyl diones which, upon condensation with hydrazine, provides direct access to valuable fluoroalkyl pyrazoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Semi&#8208;Synthetic Glycoconjugate Vaccine Lead Against Acinetobacter baumannii 17978</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acinetobacter baumannii  is a opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for serious nosocomial infections that is becoming increasingly resistant against antibiotics. Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) that cover  A. baumannii  are a major virulence factor that play an important role in pathogenesis, are used to assign serotypes and provide the basis for vaccine development. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of  A. baumannii  17978 were printed onto microarray slides and used to screen sera from patients infected with  A. baumannii  as well as a monoclonal mouse antibody (mAb C8). A synthetic oligosaccharide emerged from glycan array screening as lead for the development of a vaccine against  A. baumannii  17978. Tetrasaccharide  20  is a key epitope for recognition by an antibody and is a vaccine lead.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular ribbons (MRs), one&#8208;dimentional topological polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are of importance for synthetic chemistry and material sciences. Herein, we disclose an effective strategy to develop boron&#8208;doped MRs, i.e. photochemical cyclization on conjugated organoboranes for rapid &#960;&#8208;extension. A series of ribbon&#8208;type boron&#8208;doped PAHs that own multiple cove edges were synthesized using Mallory photoreaction in solution. Two of them feature isomeric C68B2 &#960;&#8208;skeletons with 2.2 nm in length, thus representing a new kind of boron&#8208;doped MRs. The boron atoms endow them with sufficient Lewis acidity, and notably, the formed Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts based on boron&#8208;doped MRs display the photo&#8208;induced dual&#8208;dissociation behavior in the excited state and thus photochromism property. Moreover, despite of the highly contorted topological conformations, their potential utility as organic semiconductor was demonstrated by fabrication of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Removal of the Greenhouse Gas Nitrous Oxide by Liposomal Microreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrous oxide (N  2  O) is a potent greenhouse and ozone&#8208;reactive gas for which emissions are growing rapidly due to increasingly intensive agriculture. Synthetic catalysts for N  2  O decomposition typically contain precious metals and/or operate at elevated temperatures driving a desire for more sustainable alternatives. Here we demonstrate self&#8208;assembly of liposomal microreactors enabling catalytic reduction of N  2  O to the climate neutral product N  2  . Photoexcitation of graphitic N&#8208;doped carbon dots delivers electrons to encapsulated N  2  O Reductase enzyme via a lipid&#8208;soluble biomolecular wire provided by the MtrCAB protein complex. Within the microreactor, electron transfer from MtrCAB to N  2  O Reductase is facilitated by the general redox mediator methyl viologen. The liposomal microreactors use only earth&#8208;abundant elements to catalyze N  2  O removal in ambient, aqueous conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Regioselectivity of Topochemical Polymerization through Cocrystallization of the Monomer with an Inert Isostere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regiochemistry of topochemical reactions depends on the crystal packing and biasing the regiochemistry necessitates precise crystal engineering. The pristine crystals of monomer&#160;1&#160;upon topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction give a 1:1 blend of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked polymers due to the presence of two self&#8208;sorted reactive conformers in the crystal. We designed a binary isomorphous cocrystal of monomer&#160;1&#160;and a structurally similar dummy molecule&#160;2&#160;to limit the number of reactive conformers of&#160;1&#160;to one and thus to get one type of polymer. Equimolar solution of&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2&#160;in chloroform&#8208;acetone mixture gave two 1:1 cocrystals&#160;Co&#8208;I&#160;and&#160;Co&#8208;II.

         <title>Cooperative Surface Passivation and Hierarchical Structuring of Zeolite Beta Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a method to prepare core&#8208;shell zeolite beta (*BEA) with an aluminous core and an epitaxial Si&#8208;rich shell. This method capitalizes on the inherent defects in *BEA crystals to simultaneously passivate acid sites on external surfaces and increase intracrystalline mesoporosity through facile post&#8208;hydrothermal synthesis modification in alkaline media. This process creates more hydrophobic materials by reducing silanol defects and enriching the shell in silica via a combination of dealumination and the relocation of silica from the core to the shell during intracrystalline mesopore formation. The catalytic consequences of *BEA core&#8208;shells relative to conventional analogues were tested using the biomass conversion of levulinic acid and n&#8208;butanol to n&#8208;butyl levulinate as a benchmark reaction. Our findings reveal that siliceous shells and intracrystalline mesopores synergistically enhance the performance of *BEA catalysts.</dc:description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;junction organic solar cells (OSCs) have made significant progress in recent years. Innovations in material design and device optimization have improved the power conversion efficiencies to over 19&#8201;%. In this Minireview, based on recent advances, we discuss molecular design strategies to tune the absorption spectrum, energy level, and intermolecular aggregation as well as highlight the role of molecular electrostatic potential in decreasing energy loss. Then, we introduce the latest progress in four types of OSCs composed of different donor:acceptor combinations: polymer donor:small&#8208;molecule acceptor, all&#8208;polymer, all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule, and small&#8208;molecule donor:polymer acceptor. Finally, the challenges of OSCs in practical applications, including material cost, stability, and multi&#8208;function integration, are discussed.

         <title>The Bifunctional Silyl Reagent Me2(CH2Cl)SiCF3 Enables Highly Enantioselective Ketone Trifluoromethylation and Related Tandem Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional trifluoromethylsilyl reagent (BTR), Me2(CH2Cl)SiCF3 is prepared, which enables ketone trifluoromethylations with excellent enantioselectivity and broad scope. Notably, by taking advantage of the chloromethyl group, a tandem synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated oxasilacyclopentanes and &#945;&#8208;CF3 tertiary alcohols with vicinal tertiary or quaternary stereocenters was developed.







Abstract
We report the development of bifunctional trifluoromethylsilyl reagents for selective trifluoromethylation. The newly developed reagent, Me2(CH2Cl)SiCF3, allows highly enantioselective trifluoromethylations of ketones with broad scope. Notably, by taking advantage of the chloromethyl group, a tandem synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated oxasilacyclopentanes is developed, paving way to &#945;&#8208;CF3 tertiary alcohols with vicinal tertiary or quaternary stereocenters. Theoretical studies revealed the important role of nonclassical C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;C interactions in stabilizing the transition state, and that the presence of the chlorine atom enhances such interactions for better enantiofacial control.

         <title>Precursor Engineering to Reduce Processing Temperature of ZnO Films for Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amine&#8208;free precursor consisting of zinc acetate dehydrate (ZAH) in methanol is proposed to prepare ZnO films. The temperature required for converting the precursor complex into ZnO was as low as 90&#8201;&#176;C, which is substantially lower than that (over 120&#8201;&#176;C) required for the traditional amine&#8208;containing precursor. Low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed ZnO can function efficiently as an electron&#8208;transport layer in nonfullerene solar cells.







Abstract
Sol&#8208;gel&#8208;derived ZnO is one of the most widely used electron&#8208;transport layers in inverted organic solar cells. The sol&#8208;gel ZnO precursor consists of zinc acetate dehydrate (ZAH) and ethanolamine dissolved in 2&#8208;methoxyethanol, where ethanolamine chelates with ZAH, which helps ZAH dissolve in the 2&#8208;methoxyethanol. However, an annealing temperature above 120&#8201;&#176;C is required to convert the complexes into ZnO. High temperatures are incompatible with flexible plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate. In this work, we report an amine&#8208;free recipe consisting of ZAH in methanol to prepare ZnO films. The complex formed in the amine&#8208;free precursor solution is methanol&#8208;solvated ZAH, which is simpler than that of the amine&#8208;containing precursor solution. The temperature required for converting the precursor complex into ZnO was reduced to 90&#8201;&#176;C for the amine&#8208;free recipe. Low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed ZnO can function efficiently as an electron&#8208;transport layer in both rigid and flexible inverted nonfullerene solar cells.

         <title>Spotting Trends in Organocatalyzed and Other Organomediated (De)polymerizations and Polymer Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest trends in polymer synthesis, depolymerization, and postpolymerization functionalization are reviewed, whereby organocatalysis and other organomediated methods take center stage. With today's growing emphasis on sustainability, we describe how transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategies offer fresh opportunities to access novel functional materials and also to valorize postconsumer plastic waste.







Abstract
Organocatalysis has evolved into an effective complement to metal&#8208; or enzyme&#8208;based catalysis in polymerization, polymer functionalization, and depolymerization. The ease of removal and greater sustainability of organocatalysts relative to transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based ones has spurred development in specialty applications, e.g., medical devices, drug delivery, optoelectronics. Despite this, the use of organocatalysis and other organomediated reactions in polymer chemistry is still rapidly developing, and we envisage their rapidly growing application in nascent areas such as controlled radical polymerization, additive manufacturing, and chemical recycling in the coming years. In this Review, we describe ten trending areas where we anticipate paradigm shifts resulting from novel organocatalysts and other transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. We highlight opportunities and challenges and detail how new discoveries could lead to previously inaccessible functional materials and a potentially circular plastics economy.

         <title>Heterogenised Molecular Catalysts for Sustainable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Support materials such as carbon&#8208;based supports, MOFs, COFs, titania, and polymer gels can enhance the stability and selectivity of carbon dioxide reduction catalysts, including those based on earth&#8208;abundant elements, while also providing an effective means for the heterogenisation of molecular electrocatalysts into porous and scalable materials. The performances of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems are compared and the prospects of the field discussed in this Review.







Abstract
There has been a rapid rise in interest regarding the advantages of support materials to protect and immobilise molecular catalysts for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) in order to overcome the weaknesses of many well&#8208;known catalysts in terms of their stability and selectivity. In this Review, the state of the art of different catalyst&#8208;support systems for the CO2RR is discussed with the intention of leading towards standard benchmarking for comparison of such systems across the most relevant supports and immobilisation strategies, taking into account these multiple pertinent metrics, and also enabling clearer consideration of the necessary steps for further progress. The most promising support systems are described, along with a final note on the need for developing more advanced experimental and computational techniques to aid the rational design principles that are prerequisite to prospective industrial upscaling.

         <title>Desymmetric Cyanosilylation of Acyclic 1,3&#8208;Diketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bifunctional complex containing both a hydrogen bond donor and a Lewis acidic magnesium center was discovered to be a stereoselective cyanosilylation catalyst for structurally flexible acyclic 1,3&#8208;diketones. Stereochemically defined vicinal tertiary and quaternary stereocenters can be obtained and further derived to polyfunctionalized molecules.







Abstract
Diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective construction of vicinal stereocenters from easily available starting materials is a challenging task. Here, we report that a bifunctional catalyst prepared from dibutylmagnesium and a pipecolinol&#8208;derived tetradentate ligand can enable an asymmetric cyanosilylation of 1,3&#8208;diketones to forge a pair of neighboring and acyclic tetrasubstituted carbons. The high stereoselectivity results from the rigid conformation of the diketone in the catalyst pocket, where the Lewis acidic magnesium center, together with the free hydroxyl group as a putative hydrogen bond donor, bind with both carbonyls. Consequently, stereochemically well&#8208;defined cyanohydrin silyl ethers with a diverse collection of substituents were prepared. Their rapid derivatization to molecules of higher complexity, such as heterocycles, triols, and fused rings, were also demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;A new bifunctional complex containing both a hydrogen bond donor and a Lewis acidic magnesium center was discovered to be a stereoselective cyanosilylation catalyst for structurally flexible acyclic 1,3-diketones. Stereochemically defined vicinal tertiary and quaternary stereocenters can be obtained and further derived to polyfunctionalized molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diastereo- and enantioselective construction of vicinal stereocenters from easily available starting materials is a challenging task. Here, we report that a bifunctional catalyst prepared from dibutylmagnesium and a pipecolinol-derived tetradentate ligand can enable an asymmetric cyanosilylation of 1,3-diketones to forge a pair of neighboring and acyclic tetrasubstituted carbons. The high stereoselectivity results from the rigid conformation of the diketone in the catalyst pocket, where the Lewis acidic magnesium center, together with the free hydroxyl group as a putative hydrogen bond donor, bind with both carbonyls. Consequently, stereochemically well-defined cyanohydrin silyl ethers with a diverse collection of substituents were prepared. Their rapid derivatization to molecules of higher complexity, such as heterocycles, triols, and fused rings, were also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Impact of Boron Hybridisation on Photocatalytic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fruitful merger of organoboron chemistry and photocatalysis has led to the development of new technologies to access complex (non)borylated frameworks. Central to the success is control of boron hybridisation. This Minireview highlights the current state of the art in photocatalytic processes utilising organoboron compounds, paying particular attention to the role of boron hybridisation for the target transformation.







Abstract
Recently the fruitful merger of organoboron chemistry and photocatalysis has come to the forefront of organic synthesis, resulting in the development of new technologies to access complex (non)borylated frameworks. Central to the success of this combination is control of boron hybridisation. Contingent on the photoactivation mode, boron as its neutral planar form or tetrahedral boronate can be used to regulate reactivity. This Minireview highlights the current state of the art in photocatalytic processes utilising organoboron compounds, paying particular attention to the role of boron hybridisation for the target transformation.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ophiorrhine&#8197;A, G and Ophiorrhiside&#8197;E Featuring a Bioinspired Intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder Cycloaddition
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A late stage bioinspired intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of the indolopyridone of ophiorrhiside&#8197;E was deployed to access the spirocyclic azabicyclic[2.2.2]octanone ring system of ophiorrhiside&#8197;A and achieve its total synthesis. The indolopyridone of ophiorrhiside&#8197;E was synthesized by the cyclodehydration of ophiorrhine&#8197;G which was formed by the acylation of N&#8208;methyl indolylacetamide by a secologanin derivative.







Abstract
We report the first total synthesis of the monoterpene indole alkaloids ophiorrhine&#8197;A via a late stage bioinspired intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition to form the intricate bridged and spirannic polycyclic system. Several strategies were investigated to construct the indolopyridone moiety of ophiorrhiside&#8197;E, the postulated biosynthetic precursor of ophiorrhine&#8197;A. Eventually, the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type coupling of N&#8208;methyl indolyl&#8208;acetamide with a secologanin&#8208;derived acid chloride delivered ophiorrhine&#8197;G. Cyclodehydration of a protected form of the latter was followed by the desired spontaneous intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of protected ophiorrhiside&#8197;E leading to ophiorrhine&#8197;A.

         <title>The Highest Oxidation State of Rhodium: Rhodium(VII) in [RhO3]+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Teaming up with technetium and ruthenium, rhodium is the third element of the 4d series to form the rare +7 oxidation state, the third&#8208;highest oxidation state among all elements. Here, gas&#8208;phase X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, combined with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, are used to elucidate 
 as a 
 trioxido rhodium(VII) cation in 
 point group symmetry, the first chemical species with rhodium in the +7 oxidation state.







Abstract
Although the highest possible oxidation states of all transition elements are rare, they are not only of fundamental interest but also relevant as potentially strong oxidizing agents. In general, the highest oxidation states are found in the electron&#8208;rich late transition elements of groups 7&#8211;9 of the periodic table. Rhodium is the first element of the 4d transition metal series for which the highest known oxidation state does not equal its group number of 9, but reaches only a significantly lower value of +6 in exceptional cases. Higher oxidation states of rhodium have remained elusive so far. In a combined mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical study of gas&#8208;phase
 (n=1&#8211;4), we identify 
 as the 
 trioxidorhodium(VII) cation, the first chemical species to contain rhodium in the +7 oxidation state, which is the third&#8208;highest oxidation state experimentally verified among all elements in the periodic table.

         <title>Mesityl&#8208;Functionalized Multi&#8208;Resonance Organoboron Delayed Fluorescent Frameworks with Wide&#8208;Range Color Tunability for Narrowband OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep blue to pure green boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters with a binary&#8208;doped B/N skeleton have been developed that exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields up to unity, narrow band widths (FWHM &lt;40&#8197;nm), and fast radiative decay rates of about 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 . The materials show maximum external quantum efficiencies up to 39.8&#8201;% and CIEy coordinates of 0.05 when used as emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters are promising for high color&#8208;purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Here, unlike the most common heteroatom ternary&#8208;doped (X/B/N) frameworks, a binary&#8208;doped (B/N) skeleton is reported with a large energy band for wide&#8208;range color tunability. Based on this parent&#8208;segment, a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; catalyst&#8208;free borylation method is developed which generates deep blue to pure green MR emitters from readily available starting materials, with peaks at 426&#8211;532&#8197;nm and full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maxima of 27&#8211;38&#8197;nm. Impressively, a maximum external quantum efficiency of nearly 40&#8201;% is recorded for the corresponding device with Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinates of (0.14, 0.16), representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances. This work presents a new paradigm and synthesis of B/N&#8208;doped MR emitters and will motivate the study of other novel frameworks.

         <title>The Control of the Coordination Chemistry for the Genesis of Heterogeneous Catalytically Active Sites in Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript reviews the use and the role of coordination complexes as precursors for the generation of heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation reactions of interest to fine chemical synthesis. Specific attention is paid to the comprehension of phenomena explaining the formation of active sites in heterogeneous catalysts. Different families of coordination precursors are considered. For each example, a brief critical description on the synthesis, characterization and catalytic performance is reported. A special attention is paid to the chemical environment of the first coordination sphere of the active metal center. The catalysts obtained by heterogenization, grafting or anchoring of homogenous catalysts can therefore exhibit enhanced catalytic performance by merging advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The deposition of coordination complexes over a pre&#8208;formed support is indeed a conceptually versatile strategy to design novel catalysts with tuned and controlled properties.</dc:description>

The deposition of coordination complexes over a pre-formed support is indeed a conceptually versatile strategy to design novel catalysts with tuned and controlled properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous decomposition of an extraordinarily twisted and trans&#8208;bent fully&#8208;phosphanyl&#8208;substituted digermene to an unusual Ge(I) cluster</title>

         <dc:description>Ditetrelenes R  2  E=ER  2  (E = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) substituted by multiple N/P/O/S&#8208;donor groups are extremely rare due to their propensity to disaggregate into their tetrylene monomers R  2  E. We report the synthesis of the first fully phosphanyl&#8208;substituted digermene {(Mes)  2  P}  2  Ge=Ge{P(Mes)  2  }  2  (  3  , Mes = 2,4,6&#8208;Me  3  C  6  H  2  ), which adopts a highly unusual structure in the solid state, that is both strongly  trans  &#8208;bent and highly twisted. Variable&#8208;temperature  31  P{  1  H} NMR spectroscopy suggests that  3  persists in solution, but is subject to a dynamic equilibrium between two conformations, which have different geometries about the Ge=Ge bond (twisted/non&#8208;twisted) due to a difference in the nature of their &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Compound  3  undergoes unprecedented, spontaneous decomposition in solution to give a unique Ge(I) cluster {(Mes)  2  P}  4  Ge  4  .5CyMe (  7  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;Bond Formation in Alumaboranes: Facile Scission of Polar Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present facile access to an alumaborane species with electron precise Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond. The reductive rearrangement of 1&#8208;(AlI  2  ), 8&#8208;(BMes  2  ) naphthalene (Mes = 2,4,6&#8208;Me  3  C  6  H  2  ) affords the alumaborane species  cyclo  &#8208;(1,8&#8208;C  10  H  6  )&#8208;[1&#8208;Al(Mes)(OEt  2  )&#8208;8&#8208;B(Mes)] with a covalent Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond. The Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond performs the reductive scission of multiple bonds: S=C(N  i  PrCMe)  2  affords the naphthalene bridged motif B&#8722;S&#8722;Al(NHC), NHC =  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene, while O=CPh  2  is deoxygenated to afford an B&#8722;O&#8722;Al bridged species with incorporation of the remaining =CPh  2  fragment into the naphthalene scaffold. The reaction with isonitrile Xyl&#8208;N&#8801;C (Xyl = 2,6&#8208;Me  2  C  6  H  4  ) proceeds via a proposed (amino boryl) carbene species; which adds a second equivalent of isonitrile to ultimately form the Al&#8722;N&#8722;B bridged species  cyclo  &#8208;(1,8&#8208;C  10  H  6  )&#8208;[1&#8208;Al(Mes)&#8208;N(Xyl)&#8208;8&#8208;B{C(Mes)=C&#8208;N&#8208;Xyl}] with complete scission of the C&#8801;N triple bond. The latter reaction is supported with isolated intermediates and by DFT calculations.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present facile access to an alumaborane species with electron precise Al&#8722;B &#963;-bond. The reductive rearrangement of 1-(AlI  2  ), 8-(BMes  2  ) naphthalene (Mes = 2,4,6-Me  3  C  6  H  2  ) affords the alumaborane species  cyclo  -(1,8-C  10  H  6  )-[1-Al(Mes)(OEt  2  )-8-B(Mes)] with a covalent Al&#8722;B &#963;-bond.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Initiative Collision at Microelectrodes with Vertically Mobile Micromotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Impact experiments enable single particle analysis for many applications. However, the effect of the trajectory of a particle to an electrode on impact signals still requires further exploration. Here, we investigate the particle impact measurements versus motion using micromotors with controllable vertical motion. With biocatalytic cascade reactions, the micromotor system utilizes buoyancy as the driving force, thus enabling more regulated interactions with the electrode. With the aid of numerical simulations, the dynamic interactions between the electrode and micromotors are categorized into four representative patterns: approaching, departing, approaching&#8208;and&#8208;departing, and departing&#8208;and&#8208;reapproaching, which correspond well with the experimentally observed impact signals. This study offers a possibility of exploring the dynamic interactions between the electrode and particles, shedding light on the design of new electrochemical sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited State Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes Enable Fluorescence Color Changes in a Supramolecular Cyclophane Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p class="Abstract"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;GB"&gt;Mechanochromic mechanophores are reporter molecules that indicate mechanical events through changes of their photophysical properties. Supramolecular mechanophores, in which the activation is based on the rearrangement of luminophores and/or quenchers without any covalent bond scission, remain less well investigated. Here, we report a cyclophane&#8208;based supramolecular mechanophore that contains a &lt;span style="color:black"&gt;1,6&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)pyrene&lt;/span&gt; luminophore and a pyromellitic diimide quencher. In solution, the blue monomer emission of the luminophore is largely quenched and a faint reddish&#8208;orange emission originating from a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex is observed. A polyurethane elastomer containing the mechanophore displays orange emission in the absence of force, which is dominated by the CT&#8208;emission. Mechanical deformation causes a decrease of the CT&#8208;emission and an increase of blue monomer emission, due to the spatial separation between the luminophore and quencher. The ratio of the two emission intensities correlates with the applied stress.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>The Origin of High&#8208;Voltage Stability in Single&#8208;Crystal Layered Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with the polycrystal (PC) Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials, the single&#8208;crystal (SC) counterpart displayed excellent structural stability, high reversible capacity and limited voltage decay during cycling, which received great attention from academic and industry. However, the origin of fascinating high&#8208;voltage stability within SC is poorly understood yet. Herein, we tracked the evolution of phase transitions, in which the destructive volume change and H3 phase formation presented in PC, are effectively suppressed in SC when cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V, further clarifying the origin of high&#8208;voltage stability in SC cathode. Moreover, SC electrode displayed crack&#8208;free morphology, and excellent electrochemical stability during long&#8208;term cycling, whereas PC suffered severe capacity and voltage fade because of the spinel&#8208;like phase, decoding the failure mechanisms of PC and SC during cycling at high cut&#8208;off voltages. This finding provides universal insights into high&#8208;voltage stability and failure mechanisms of layered Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence of Perovskites with Reduced Dimensionality Achieved by Manipulating Adsorption&#8208;Energy Differences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lagging development of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) heavily impedes their practical applications in full&#8208;color display due to the absence of spectrally stable emitters and the mismatch of carrier injection capacity. Herein, we report highly efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs through a new chemical strategy that addresses the dilemma for simultaneously constant electroluminescence (EL) spectra and high&#8208;purify phase in reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites. The success lies in the control of adsorption&#8208;energy differences between phenylbutylamine (PBA) and ethylamine (EA) interacting with perovskites, which facilitates narrow n&#8208;value distribution. This approach leads to an increased exciton binding energy and enhanced surface potential, hence improving radiative recombination.

Herein, we report highly efficient deep-blue PeLEDs through a new chemical strategy that addresses the dilemma for simultaneously constant electroluminescence (EL) spectra and high-purify phase in reduced-dimensional perovskites. The success lies in the control of adsorption-energy differences between phenylbutylamine (PBA) and ethylamine (EA) interacting with perovskites, which facilitates narrow n-value distribution. This approach leads to an increased exciton binding energy and enhanced surface potential, hence improving radiative recombination. As a result, an external quantum efficiency of 4.62% is achieved in PeLEDs with a stable EL peak at 457 nm, demonstrating the best reported result for deep-blue PeLEDs so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrolytically Stable Ionic Fluorogels for High&#8208;Performance Remediation of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PFAS are known bioaccumulative and persistent chemicals which pollute natural waters globally. There exists a lack of granular sorbents to efficiently remove both legacy and emerging PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations. Herein, we report a class of polymer networks with a synergistic combination of ionic and fluorous components that serve as granular materials for the removal of anionic PFAS from water. A library of Ionic Fluorogels (IFs) with systematic variation in charge density and polymer network architecture was synthesized from hydrolytically stable fluorous building blocks. The IFs were demonstrated as effective sorbents for the removal of 21 legacy and emerging PFAS from a natural water and were regenerable over multiple cycles of reuse. Comparison of one IF to a commercial ion exchange resin in mini&#8208;rapid small scale column tests demonstrated superior performance for the removal of short&#8208;chain PFAS from natural water under operationally relevant conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Accuracy of Modelling CO2 Electroreduction on Copper Using Many&#8208;Body Perturbation Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper (Cu) remains the most important metal catalyst for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) into C  2  products. Due to limited evidence from  in situ  experiments, mechanistic studies are often performed in the framework of density functional theory (DFT), using functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level, which have fundamental difficulties to correctly describe CO adsorption and surface stability. We employ the adiabatic connection fluctuation dissipation theorem within the random phase approximation (RPA), in combination with the linearized Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann equation to describe solvation effects, to investigate the mechanism of CO  2  RR on the Cu(100) facet. Qualitatively different from the DFT&#8208;GGA results, RPA results propose the formation of *OCCHO as the potential determining step. The results suggest that it is important to use more accurate methods like RPA when modeling reactions involving multiple CO&#8208;related species like CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;Selective Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C(sp2)&#8210;H Borylation: A Subject of Practical and Ongoing Interest in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considerable advances have been made in the area of C&#8210;H functionalization in the last few decades. A number of approaches including both directed or non&#8208;directed strategies have been developed thus far. Among the various C&#8210;H functionalizations, C&#8210;H borylation is of special interest due to the wide applications of organoborons. In this regard, various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;selective strategies have been appeared. However, the major concern regarding metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8210;H borylation protocols is the requirement of a precious metal as well as the contamination of metal precursor in the desired products, which limit the application of this process in large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, the recent trends have involved the use of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems. We summarize this recent ongoing interest of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regio&#8208;selective C&#8210;H borylation. We believe that this review will definitely help to increase interest in this field and it will stimulate further progress.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Indium&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites Promoting C&#8211;C Coupling for CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreduction of CO  2  to C  2+  solar fuel is a promising carbon&#8208;neutral technology for renewable energy. This strategy is challenged by its low productivity due to low efficiency in multielectron utilization and slow C&#8211;C coupling kinetics. This work reports a dual&#8208;metal photocatalyst consisted of atomically dispersed Indium&#8208;Copper anchored on polymeric carbon nitride (InCu/PCN), on which the photoreduction of CO  2  delivered an excellent ethanol production rate of 28.5 &#956;mol&#183;g  &#8722;1  &#183;h  &#8722;1  with a high selectivity of 92%. Coupled experimental investigation with DFT calculation, this study unveils the following mechanisms underpinning the high performance of this catalyst. Essentially, In&#8208;Cu interaction enhances the charge separation by accelerating charge transfer from PCN to metal sites.  In  also transfers electrons to neighboring Cu via Cu&#8208;N&#8208;In bridges, increasing the electron density of Cu active sites. Furthermore, In&#8208;Cu dual&#8208;metal sites promote the adsorption of *CO intermediates and lower the energy barrier of C&#8211;C coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Route to Dewar 1,3,5&#8208;Triphosphabenzene and Subsequent Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, scalable iron&#8208;catalyzed route to a Dewar phosphabenzene is presented. This species isomerizes in the presence of base to form the 1,3,5&#8208;phosphabenzene, which then spontaneously rearranges to a novel triphospha(tricyclo) species. Onward coordination chemistry of all three phosphines is explored along with an extensive study into the reactivity of the Dewar phosphabenzene.







Abstract
The application of an alkyne cyclotrimerization regime with an [Fe(salen)]2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo (1) catalyst to triphenylmethylphosphaalkyne (2) yields gram&#8208;scale quantities of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(triphenylmethyl)&#8208;Dewar&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene (3). Bulky lithium salt LiHMDS facilitates a rearrangement of 3 to the 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene valence isomer (3&#8242;), which subsequently undergoes an intriguing phosphorus migration reaction to form the ring&#8208;contracted species (3&#8242;&#8242;). Density functional theory calculations provide a plausible mechanism for this rearrangement. Given the stability of 3, a diverse array of unprecedented transformations was investigated. We report novel crystallographically characterized products of successful nucleophilic/electrophilic addition and protonation/oxidation reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;Based Iodonium Reagent via Dyotropic Rearrangement and Its Utilization in Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel hypervalent iodonium salt was developed with the exploitation of a dyotropic rearrangement of iodine and chlorine functions in fluoroalkyl chains from HFO&#8208;1234yf gas. The electrophilic reagent enabled the direct and metal&#8208;free introduction of a special fluoroalkyl group into aniline derivatives and N&#8208;containing heteroaromatic compounds. Detailed experimental and computational data were collected and used to propose a mechanistic description of this unique rearrangement.







Abstract
[1,2]&#8208;shift of atoms in alkyl fragments belongs to the class of dyotropic rearrangements. Various atoms, including halogens can be involved in the migration, however participation of iodine is unprecedented. Herein, we report our experimental and DFT studies on the oxidation triggered dyotropic rearrangement of iodo and chloro functions via butterfly&#8208;type transition state to demonstrate the migrating ability of &#955;3&#8208;iodane centre. With the exploitation of dyotropic rearrangement we designed and synthesized a novel fluoroalkyl iodonium reagent from industrial feedstock gas HFO&#8208;1234yf.

     alt="Synthesis of Hydrofluoroolefin-Based Iodonium Reagent via Dyotropic Rearrangement and Its Utilization in Fluoroalkylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a novel hypervalent iodonium salt was developed with the exploitation of a dyotropic rearrangement of iodine and chlorine functions in fluoroalkyl chains from HFO-1234yf gas. The electrophilic reagent enabled the direct and metal-free introduction of a special fluoroalkyl group into aniline derivatives and N-containing heteroaromatic compounds. Detailed experimental and computational data were collected and used to propose a mechanistic description of this unique rearrangement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1,2]-shift of atoms in alkyl fragments belongs to the class of dyotropic rearrangements. Various atoms, including halogens can be involved in the migration, however participation of iodine is unprecedented. Herein, we report our experimental and DFT studies on the oxidation triggered dyotropic rearrangement of iodo and chloro functions via butterfly-type transition state to demonstrate the migrating ability of &#955;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-iodane centre. With the exploitation of dyotropic rearrangement we designed and synthesized a novel fluoroalkyl iodonium reagent from industrial feedstock gas HFO-1234yf. We demonstrated that the hypervalent reagent serves as an excellent fluoroalkylation agent for various amines and nitrogen heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries Enabled by Amidoxime&#8208;Functionalized Ion&#8208;Selective Polymer Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly ion&#8208;selective robust membranes are developed from a series of amidoxime&#8208;functionalized Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (AO&#8208;PIMs), which enable long lifetime operation of aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) using low&#8208;cost organic redox molecules at benign near&#8208;neutral pH, offering cost&#8208;effective electricity storage for grid&#8208;scale renewable power sources.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) based on aqueous organic electrolytes are a promising technology for safe and cost&#8208;effective large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. Membrane separators are a key component in RFBs, allowing fast conduction of charge&#8208;carrier ions but minimizing the cross&#8208;over of redox&#8208;active species. Here, we report the molecular engineering of amidoxime&#8208;functionalized Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (AO&#8208;PIMs) by tuning their polymer chain topology and pore architecture to optimize membrane ion transport functions. AO&#8208;PIM membranes are integrated with three emerging aqueous organic flow battery chemistries, and the synergetic integration of ion&#8208;selective membranes with molecular engineered organic molecules in neutral&#8208;pH electrolytes leads to significantly enhanced cycling stability.

         <title>Selenoviologen&#8208;Appendant Metallacycles with Highly Stable Radical Cations and Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separation States for Electrochromism and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two selenoviologen (SeV2+)&#8208;appendant metallacycles with tunable optoelectronic properties were synthesized. Selenoviologen radical cations (SeV+.) can be stabilized due to the metallacyclic effect (strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and push&#8211;pull electron structures), which were validated by electrochromism. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra not only confirmed the long&#8208;lived charge separation states of metallacycle, but also demonstrated its vital role in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions with high efficiency (&gt;80&#8201;%).







Abstract
Two coordinated metallacycles (rhomboid for M1, hexagonal for M2) with selenoviologens (SeV2+) pendants were synthesized via coordination&#8208;driven hierarchical self&#8208;assembly. M1/M2 with rigid and discrete metallacyclic cores showed tunable optoelectronic properties due to strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and push&#8211;pull electron structures. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) revealed that the formation of macrocyclic structure can not only enhance the stability of radical cation, but also improve the efficiency of intramolecular charge transfer and produce a long&#8208;lived charge separation state. The electrochromic performances of M1/M2&#8208;based devices were exhibited to show decent radical stabilization. By using M1/M2 as the photocatalyst, the improved catalytic efficiency (&gt;80&#8201;%) of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions was achieved due to the highly stable radical cations and long&#8208;lived charge separation states, which were also confirmed by fs&#8208;TA.

         <title>Thermally Depolymerizable Polyether Electrolytes for Convenient and Low&#8208;Cost Recycling of LiTFSI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of F&#8208;containing thermally depolymerizable polyethers were prepared as solid electrolytes, and with the help of the thermal degradation of polyethers, the LiTFSI was successfully reclaimed in high yields of 80&#8201;%, providing an example for the recycling of LiTFSI and benefiting the cost control of solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with LiTFSI (lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide)) are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state batteries, owing to their good interfacial contact with solid electrodes. Here, three copolymerized polyethers were prepared as SPEs, using the catalysts of SnF2 or SnF2&#8208;LiPF6. The thermal depolymerization of these polyethers was observed at elevated temperatures, which limits their operating temperature ranges. Once the catalyst is removed, the thermal degradation temperatures of these SPEs are raised by 30&#8211;55&#8201;&#176;C, together with improved thermal performance in cells. For SPEs, the high price of LiTFSI is an obstacle for their large&#8208;scale application, and it's recycling is hindered by the strong interaction with polymers. By the thermal depolymerization of polyethers, LiTFSI can be easier reclaimed from above mentioned SPEs and even the commercial PEO(poly(ethylene&#8208;oxide)) based SPE in rates of 70&#8211;80&#8201;%, providing a low&#8208;cost strategy for the recycling of LiTFSI.

         <title>Leveraging Isothermal Titration Calorimetry to Explore Structure&#8211;Property Relationships of Protein Immobilization in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothermal titration calorimetry was leveraged to systematically study how the structural properties of MOFs, such as hydrophobicity, pore size, and topology, influence the thermodynamics of protein immobilization by using a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs as the host and insulin as the model protein probe. The thermodynamics of binding can elucidate a major driving force for protein encapsulation, which could not be revealed in bulk adsorption studies.







Abstract
Proteins immobilized in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) often show extraordinary stability. However, most efforts to immobilize proteins in MOFs have only been exploratory. Herein, we present the first systematic study on the thermodynamics of protein immobilization in MOFs. Using insulin as a probe, we leveraged isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to investigate how topology, pore size, and hydrophobicity of MOFs influence immobilization. ITC data obtained from the encapsulation of insulin in a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs reveals that MOFs provide proteins with a hydrophobic stabilizing microenvironment, making the encapsulation entropically driven. In particular, the pyrene&#8208;based NU&#8208;1000 tightly encapsulates insulin in its ideally sized mesopores and stabilizes insulin through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, resulting in the most enthalpically favored encapsulation process among this series. This study reveals critical insights into the structure&#8211;property relationships of protein immobilization.

         <title>Radical Hydro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which are highly in demand in various disciplines, particularly in chemical biology and drug discovery. Here, we report the first establishment of radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkenes, which is enabled by using 1&#8208;fluorosulfonyl 2&#8208;aryl benzoimidazolium (FABI) as an effective redox&#8208;active radical precursor. This method provides a new and facile approach for the synthesis of aliphatic sulfonyl fluorides from unactivated alkenes, and can be further applied to the late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and peptides, as well as ligation of drugs in combination with click chemistry. Remarkably, this system could enable the radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes, affording valuable alkenylsulfonyl fluoride products with a rare, high  Z&#8208;selectivity, which are normally less stable and more challenging to synthesize in comparison with the  E&#8208;configured products.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride, Alkenes and Diazo Compounds and Synthesis of&#160;Pentafluorosulfanylfurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the three&#8208;component radical addition reaction of SF  5  Cl, alkene and diazo compounds for the selective formation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SF  5  carbonyl compounds. The three&#8208;component addition reaction proceeded through the first reaction of SF  5  radical with the diazo compound followed by the addition of the in situ generated carbon radical to alkene. The synthetic useful &#945;&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SF  5  carbonyl compounds were successfully prepared when allyl trimethylsilanes were used as the alkene substrates. Furthermore, the three&#8208;component adducts formed from SF  5  Cl, &#945;&#8208;diazoacetophenones and vinyl acetates were converted into pentafluorosulfanylfurans. This transformation provided a practical and efficeint method for the synthesis of pentafluorosulfanylfurans.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Coordination Effects for the Regioselective Zincation of Diazines Using TMPZnX&#183;LiX (X = Cl, Br)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new method for regioselective zincations of challenging N&#8208;heterocyclic substrates such as pyrimidines and pyridazine was reported using bimetallic bases TMPZnX&#183;LiX (TMP = 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl; X = Cl, Br). X = Cl, Br). Reactions occurred under mild conditions (25&#8211;70 &#176;C, using 1.75 equivalents of base without additives), furnishing 2&#8208;zincated pyrimidines and 3&#8208;zincated pyridazine, which were then trapped with a variety of electrophiles. Contrasting with other s&#8208;block metalating systems, which lack selectivity in their reactions even when operating at low temperatures, these mixed Li/Zn bases enabled unprecedented regioselectivities that cannot be replicated by either LiTMP nor Zn(TMP)2 on their own. Spectroscopic and structural interrogations of organometallic intermediates involved in these reactions have shed light on the complex constitution of reaction mixtures and the origins of their special reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Multiple C(sp2)&#8722;H Insertions of Malonate Metal Carbenes for Late&#8208;Stage Functionalizations of Azahelicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral quinacridines react up to four times, step&#8208;by&#8208;step, with a&#8208;diazomalonates under Ru(II) and Rh(II) catalysis. By selecting the catalyst, [CpRu(CH  3  CN)  3  ][PF  6  ] (Cp = cyclopentadienyl) or Rh  2  (oct)  4  , chemo and regioselective insertions of derived metal carbenes are achieved in favor of mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;functionalized malonate derivatives respectively (r.r. &gt; 49:1, up to 77% yield, 12 examples). This multi&#8208;introduction of malonate groups is particularly useful to tune optical and chemical properties such as absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging. Density&#8208;functional theory further elucidates the origin of the carbene insertion selectivity and also showcases the importance of conformations in the optical response.</dc:description>

         <title>Near Infrared Light Induced Radical Polymerization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a gold nanorod (AuNR) driven methodology to induce free radical polymerization in water with near infrared light (800 nm). The process exploits photothermal conversion in AuNR and subsequent heat transfer to a radical initiator (here azobisisobutyronitrile) for primary radical generation. A broad range of reaction conditions were investigated, demonstrating control over molecular weight and reaction conversion of dimethylacrylamide polymers, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We underpin our experimental data with finite element simulation of the spatio&#8208;temporal temperature profile surrounding the AuNR directly after femtosecond laser pulse excitation. Critically, we evidence that polymerization can be induced through biological tissues given the enhanced penetration depth of the near infrared light. We submit that the presented initiation mechanism in aqueous systems holds promise for radical polymerization in biological environments, including cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution Kinetics by Tuning Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Environment on Functionalized Pt Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient catalytic systems for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER) is essential in the world&#8217;s transition to renewable energy. There is a growing recognition that the HOR/HER activity depends on properties of the electrochemical interface, rather than just the composition and structure of the catalyst Herein, we demonstrate that specifically adsorbed organic additives (theophylline derivatives) could enhance the intrinsic HOR/HER activity in base on polycrystalline Pt by up to a factor of 3 via introducing weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water, which is supported by in situ surface enhanced infrared and Raman spectroscopies. Optimal HOR/HER activity is achieved on 7&#8208;n&#8208;butyltheophylline decorated Pt surface, which sufficiently disrupts the hydrogen bonding network in the double layer without depleting the interfacial water. This work demonstrates the promise of electrochemical interfacial engineering as a strategy to boost electrocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

The 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl group is highly stereodirecting for the construction of challenging &#946;&#8208;configured 2,6&#8208;dideoxyglycosides and d/l&#8208;rhamnosides. Its synthetic potential was demonstrated in linear or convergent approaches to relevant complex carbohydrates. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies provided evidence that the reaction proceeds by hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery.







Abstract
Anomeric stereocontrol is usually one of the major issues in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates, particularly those involving &#946;&#8208;configured 2,6&#8208;dideoxyglycoside and d/l&#8208;rhamnoside moieties. Herein, we report that 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl is highly effective as a remote stereodirecting group in the direct synthesis of these challenging &#946;&#8208;glycosides under mild conditions. A deoxy&#8208;trisaccharide as a mimic of the sugar chain of landomycin E was prepared stereospecifically in high yield. The synthetic potential was also highlighted in the synthesis of Citrobacter freundii O&#8208;antigens composed of a [&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Manp&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Rhap(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Rhap&#8208;(1&#8594;] repeating unit, wherein the convergent assembly up to a nonasaccharide was realized with a strongly &#946;&#8208;directing trisaccharide donor. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies indicate the presence of intermolecular H&#8208;bonding between the donor and the bulky acceptor as direct spectral evidence in support of the concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery.

         <title>Origin of Red&#8208;Shifted Phosphorescence from Triphenylamines: Triplet Excimer or Impurity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
How much should triplet excimer phosphorescence shift in energy compared to that of the monomer? An original study on triphenylamine from more than 30&#8197;years ago showed a large shift of &gt;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which is now debunked as new evidence suggests impurity phosphorescence interference. The purified aggregate phosphorescence shift is estimated to be &lt;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Triphenylamine (TPA) was reported to exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence, where the red&#8208;shifted band was assigned as the excimeric phosphorescence with an energy shift of &gt;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (J. Phys. Chem. 1991, 95, 7189). Here we show that purified TPA (purity: &gt;99.97&#8201;%) shows a single phosphorescence band with a small energy shift of &lt;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1 under the same experimental conditions. The new experimental results, along with theoretical calculations, suggest that the previously reported triplet excimer of TPA is probably not valid and is most likely due to an unidentified impurity. As&#8208;received TPA samples, however, do exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence bands, and the wavelength, relative intensity, and temperature dependence of the lower&#8208;energy phosphorescence band vary significantly depending on dopant structures. It was found that dopant phosphorescence could still become dominant even in dilute third&#8208;party solutions of the host at low temperature.

         <title>Enhancing the Release Efficiency of a Molecular Chemotherapeutic Prodrug by Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular prodrug, namely CS&#8208;P, was designed and synthesized to demonstrate the feasibility of using the PDT process to effectively promote the release of hypoxia&#8208;activated drugs. The experimental results indicated that CS&#8208;P can be selectively activated by tumor hypoxia to release chemotherapeutic drugs and photosensitizers, and then further release chemotherapeutic drugs after light irradiation. The design strategy proposed provides a new idea for enhancing hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs release.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific, hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs have been developed to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. However, the release efficiency of hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs is restricted by the degree of tumor hypoxia, which further leads to poor cancer treatment effects. On the other hand, oxygen is consumed gradually in photodynamic therapy (PDT), which aggravates hypoxia at the tumor site. In this study, we combined hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs with PDT agents to promote the prodrugs release, thereby improving their bioavailability and therapeutic effects. As a proof of concept, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular prodrug, CS&#8208;P, was designed and synthesized. It can be selectively activated by tumor hypoxia to release chemotherapeutic drugs and photosensitizers, and then further discharge drugs after light irradiation. The design strategy proposed in this paper provides a new idea for enhancing hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug release and real&#8208;time monitoring prodrug release.

         <title>Control of Redox&#8208;Active Ester Reactivity Enables a General Cross&#8208;Electrophile Approach to Access Arylated Strained Rings
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aliphatic strained rings can be (hetero)arylated through a decarboxylative cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. The keys to this advance are: 1)&#8197;a new ligand that enables tolerance of a variety of strained ring classes and 2)&#8197;electronic tunability of redox&#8208;active esters to control the rate of radical generation.







Abstract
Strained rings are increasingly important for the design of pharmaceutical candidates, but cross&#8208;coupling of strained rings remains challenging. An attractive, but underdeveloped, approach to diverse functionalized carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks containing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers is the coupling of abundant strained&#8208;ring carboxylic acids with abundant aryl halides. Herein we disclose the development of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile approach that couples a variety of strained ring N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters, derived from the carboxylic acid in one step, with various aryl and heteroaryl halides under reductive conditions. The chemistry is enabled by the discovery of methods to control NHP ester reactivity, by tuning the solvent or using modified NHP esters, and the discovery that t&#8208;BuBpyCamCN, an L2X ligand, avoids problematic side reactions. This method can be run in flow and in 96&#8208;well plates.

         <title>Efficient Broadband Near&#8208;Infrared Emission from Lead&#8208;Free Halide Double Perovskite Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;inorganic bismuth halide perovskite Cs2AgBiCl6 single crystal achieves efficient broadband NIR emission by introducing Na ions. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the emission originates from self&#8208;trapped excitons emission. The role of Na is to weaken the strong coupling between electrons and phonons and to localize the electron and hole wave functions to enhance this emission.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials are the most important component of NIR light&#8208;emitting devices (LED) and are crucial for their performance in sensing applications.

The nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reductive carbonylation of alkyl halides, aryl halides, and ethyl chloroformate is described. The use of ethyl chloroformate as a safe and readily available source of CO provides an efficient and practical alternative for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones.







Abstract
The nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reductive carbonylation of alkyl halides, aryl halides, and ethyl chloroformate is described. Ethyl chloroformate is utilized as a safe and readily available source of CO in this multi&#8208;component protocol, providing an efficient and practical alternative for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones. The reaction exhibits a wide substrate scope and good functional group compatibility. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies highlight the complexity of the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and provide insight into the sequence of the three consecutive oxidative additions of aryl halide, chloroformate, and alkyl halide.

         <title>Reverse Sequence Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly in Aqueous Media</title>

         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects are prepared in aqueous media using a highly counter&#8208;intuitive formulation based on reverse sequence polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The hydrophobic block is prepared first in the form of a ca. 600&#8197;nm charge&#8208;stabilized latex using an ionic reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agent. Subsequent growth of a hydrophilic block produces sterically stabilized nanoparticles.







Abstract
We report a new aqueous polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) formulation that enables the hydrophobic block to be prepared first when targeting diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects. This counter&#8208;intuitive reverse sequence approach uses an ionic reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agent for the RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization of 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) to produce charge&#8208;stabilized latex particles. Chain extension using a water&#8208;soluble methacrylic, acrylic or acrylamide comonomer then produces sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles in an aqueous one&#8208;pot formulation. In each case, the monomer diffuses into the PHPMA particles, which act as the locus for the polymerization. A remarkable change in morphology occurs as the &#8776;600&#8197;nm latex is converted into much smaller sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which exhibit thermoresponsive behavior. Such reverse sequence PISA formulations enable the efficient synthesis of new functional diblock copolymer nanoparticles.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Carbonylation of Ethers and Olefins: Direct Access to &#947;&#8208;Oxy Esters and Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nickel&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation of ethers with olefins to synthesize &#947;&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds has been developed. A variety of &#947;&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds were produced in excellent yields under 1&#8197;atm pressure of CO. Notably, this strategy has been successfully applied to the one&#8208;step synthesis of the drug molecule Naftidrofuryl, which is a medicine for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD).







Abstract
Multi&#8208;component carbonylation of olefins, a reaction that installs both a carbon&#8211;carbon(heteroatom) bond and a carbonyl group across the double bond, is an attractive strategy for alkene functionalization. Herein, we developed a novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation of olefins with ethers under low CO gas pressure. Using alcohols and amines as the reaction partner, diverse &#947;&#8208;oxy&#8208;substituted esters and amides were produced in good yields with excellent functional group tolerance. Notably, Naftidrofuryl, a medicine for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD), can be synthesized by this process straightforwardly.

         <title>Selective, Anisotropic, or Consistent Polarized&#8208;Photon Out&#8208;Coupling of 2D Organic Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multichannel selective, anisotropic, or consistent polarized&#8208;photon out&#8208;coupling has been realized in a set of 2D organic microcrystals, with the polarization direction and degree being either varied or retained with respect to the source luminescence. The molecular arrangement and spatial distribution of the transition dipole moments are found to play prominent roles in determining the polarization properties of the source and out&#8208;coupled emissions.







Abstract
Nano&#8208; and micromaterials with anisotropic photoluminescence and photon transport have widespread application prospects in quantum optics, optoelectronics, and displays. But the nature of the polarization information of the out&#8208;coupled light, with respect to that of the source luminescence, has never been explored in active optical&#8208;waveguiding organic crystals. Herein, three different modes (selective, anisotropic, and consistent) of polarized&#8208;photon out&#8208;coupling are proposed and successfully implemented in a set of 2D organic microcrystals with highly linearly&#8208;polarized luminescence. It is found that the polarization direction and degree of the luminescence out&#8208;coupled through different waveguiding channels can either be essentially retained or distinctly changed with respect to those of the original luminescence, depending on the molecular arrangement and the orientation of transition dipole moments of the crystal. This work demonstrates the promising potential of 2D emissive microcrystals in multi&#8208;channel polarized photon transport.

         <title>Thermally Activated and Aggregation&#8208;Regulated Excitonic Coupling Enable Emissive High&#8208;Lying Triplet Excitons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two naphthalene&#8208;based luminophores that exhibit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from a higher&#8208;lying triplet excited state are reported. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that unusual RTP originates from the multiple accessible triplet excited&#8208;stated conformers, regulated by thermal activation and aggregation. This unique RTP family enables functional temperature sensing.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) originating from higher&#8208;lying triplet excitons remains a rather rarely documented occurrence for purely organic molecular systems.

&lt;p&gt;Two naphthalene-based luminophores that exhibit room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from a higher-lying triplet excited state are reported. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that unusual RTP originates from the multiple accessible triplet excited-stated conformers, regulated by thermal activation and aggregation. This unique RTP family enables functional temperature sensing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) originating from higher-lying triplet excitons remains a rather rarely documented occurrence for purely organic molecular systems. Here, we report two naphthalene-based RTP luminophores whose phosphorescence emission is enabled by radiative decay of high-lying triplet excitons. In contrast, upon cooling the dominant phosphorescence originates from the lowest-lying triplet excited state, which is manifested by a red-shifted emission. Photophysical and theoretical studies reveal that the unusual RTP results from thermally activated excitonic coupling between different conformations of the compounds. Aggregation-regulated excitonic coupling is observed when increasing the doping concentration of the emitters in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA). Further, the RTP quantum efficiency improves more than 80-fold in 1,3-bis(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) compared to that in PMMA. This design principle offers important insight into triplet excited state dynamics and has been exploited in afterglow-indicating temperature sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Medium Diradical Character, Small Hole and Electron Reorganization Energies and Ambipolar Transistors in Difluorenoheteroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diradicals are electrically ambipolar owing to the semiaperture of the &#960;&#8208;electron shell which produces redox amphoteric behaviour and small reorganization energies for hole and electron transports.







Abstract
Four difluorenoheteroles having a central quinoidal core with the heteroring varying as furan, thiophene, its dioxide derivative and pyrrole have shown to be medium character diradicals. Solid&#8208;state structures, optical, photophysical, magnetic, and electrochemical properties have been discussed in terms of diradical character, variation of aromatic character and captodative effects (electron affinity). Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have been prepared, showing balanced hole and electron mobilities of the order of 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 or ambipolar charge transport which is first inferred from their redox amphoterism. Quantum chemical calculations show that the electrical behavior is originated from the medium diradical character which produces similar reorganization energies for hole and electron transports. The vision of a diradical as simultaneously bearing pseudo&#8208;hole and pseudo&#8208;electron defects might justify the reduced values of reorganization energies for both regimes. Structure&#8208;function relationships between diradical and ambipolar electrical behavior are revealed.

         <title>Application of an Imprint&#8208;and&#8208;Report Sensor Array for Detection of the Dietary Metabolite Trimethylamine N&#8208;Oxide and Its Precursors in Complex Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs) imprinted with a fluorophore were used as sensors to differentially detect four dietary metabolites (betaine, carnitine, choline, and TMAO) in a high&#8208;throughput manner. The method was successful in creating sensor arrays for the analytes at several concentrations, as well as differentiating human plasma samples with elevated TMAO from those with healthy TMAO levels.







Abstract
Trimethylamine N&#8208;oxide (TMAO) is produced in the gut via metabolism of dietary betaine, choline, and carnitine, and elevated TMAO in plasma is associated with adverse health effects, including cardiovascular events. Currently, we lack high throughput methods for sensing these metabolites and detecting high TMAO. Thus, we have adapted our previously described &#8220;imprint&#8208;and&#8208;report&#8221; fluorescent sensing method using dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs) to create a sensor array for these four metabolites that functions at physiologically relevant concentrations. Templation of DCLs with dye and subsequent addition of analytes generates a fluorescent fingerprint for each metabolite and allows for differentiation via principal component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this system can be used to characterize mixtures of the metabolites in both buffer and human plasma samples. Using three to six DCLs, we can distinguish between plasma samples with healthy and elevated levels of TMAO.

A new type of crystalline luminescent organic nanodot (&lt;3.5&#8197;nm) prepared by kinetically trapped self&#8208;assembly is reported, which is then used as a simplified &#960;&#8208;packing model to simulate the precise structure of CDs.

Abstract
This work reports the successful preparation of a new type of crystalline luminescent organic nanodot (&lt;3.5&#8197;nm) by kinetically trapped self&#8208;assembly, which is then used as a simplified &#960;&#8208;packing model to simulate the structure of CDs. The precise structure and J&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced photoluminescence (PL) of the nanodots are revealed by investigating the structural relationship between the nanodots and the corresponding single crystals and their properties. Compared with the single crystals, crystalline organic nanodots show longer PL lifetime, higher PL quantum yield, and narrower PL peak, indicating that they are potential organic quantum nanodots. In addition, the efficient &#960;&#8208;stacking environment in the corresponding single crystals can promote &#960;&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced PL anisotropy. This work indicates crystalline organic nanodots with precise structures to be potentially useful for understanding the structures of CDs and to be attractive potential luminescent materials.

         <title>Chiral RuII&#8208;PtII Complexes Inducing Telomere Dysfunction against Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Cancer Cells</title>

Chiral RuII&#8208;PtII complexes were developed to act as G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers in molecular crowding environments. When encapsulated with biotin&#8208;functionalized DNA cages, the nanoparticles induced telomere dysfunction and displayed significant antitumor activity against cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells.







Abstract
The application of G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers presents a promising anticancer strategy. However, the molecular crowding conditions within cells diminish the potency of current G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers. Herein, chiral RuII&#8208;PtII dinuclear complexes were developed as highly potent G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers even under challenging molecular crowding conditions. The compounds were encapsulated with biotin&#8208;functionalized DNA cages to enhance sub&#8208;cellular localization and provide cancer selectivity. The nanoparticles were able to efficiently inhibit the endogenous activities of telomerase in cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells and cause cell death by apoptosis. The nanomaterials demonstrated high antitumor activity towards cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells as well as tumor&#8208;bearing mice. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first example of a RuII&#8208;PtII dinuclear complex as a G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer with an anti&#8208;cancer effect towards drug&#8208;resistant tumors inside an animal model.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides Using Planar Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane&#8208;Imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands</title>

A facile synthetic route towards a series of novel [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived ligands (UCD&#8208;IMPHANOL) possessing central chirality and planar chirality has been developed. These ligands demonstrated excellent enantioselectivities in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;catalyzed azomethine ylide cycloaddition.







Abstract
We present a facile synthetic route toward a novel series of imidazolinyl&#8208;[2.2]paracyclophanol (UCD&#8208;Imphanol) ligands possessing central and planar chirality. Both sets of diastereomeric ligands were successfully purified by column chromatography. The preliminary application of this family of ligands showed excellent activities in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;catalyzed azomethine ylide cycloaddition. Enantioenriched pyrrolidines, in a substrate scope of 20 examples, were accessed in high levels of endo/exo ratios (up to &gt;99/1) and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) with excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) by using (S,S,SP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol/(S,S,RP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol, respectively.

         <title>Dissipative Formation of Covalent Basket Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent basket cages can now be made to exist for a tunable period of time as a function of the chemical fuel used to drive their formation. The stage is thus set to explore the functional characteristics of these fascinating molecules and mimic the action of natural systems capable of directing folding, catalysis, and transport in a spatiotemporal manner.







Abstract
Living systems use chemical fuels to transiently assemble functional structures. As a step toward constructing abiotic mimics of such structures, we herein describe dissipative formation of covalent basket cage CBC 5 by reversible imine condensation of cup&#8208;shaped aldehyde 2 (i.e., basket) with trivalent aromatic amine 4. This nanosized [4+4] cage (V=5&#8197;nm3, Mw=6150&#8197;Da) has shape of a truncated tetrahedron with four baskets at its vertices and four aromatic amines forming the faces. Importantly, tris&#8208;aldehyde basket 2 and aliphatic tris&#8208;amine 7 undergo condensation to give small [1+1] cage 6. The imine metathesis of 6 and aromatic tris&#8208;amine 4 into CBC 5 was optimized to bias the equilibrium favouring 6. Addition of tribromoacetic acid (TBA) as a chemical fuel perturbs this equilibrium to result in the transient formation of CBC 5, with subsequent consumption of TBA via decarboxylation driving the system back to the starting state.

         <title>Monitoring the Dynamic Regulation of the Mitochondrial GTP&#8208;to&#8208;GDP Ratio with a Genetically Encoded Fluorescent Biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
GTP/GDP is known to be a sensitive indicator reflecting both energy consumption and the overall status of cellular metabolism. A genetically encoded sensor was developed for monitoring GTP/GDP ratio fluctuations in living cells, named GRISerHR, with excellent fluorescence response and selectivity. GRISerHR can accurately report on mitochondrial GTP/GDP ratio dynamics as modulated by metabolic perturbation, supporting the elucidation of metabolic regulation networks of guanosine nucleotides.







Abstract
The interconversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is known to be integral to a wide variety of biological cellular activities, yet to date there are no analytical methods available to directly detect the ratio of intracellular GTP to GDP. Herein, we report GRISerHR, a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor to monitor the GTP&#8201;:&#8201;GDP ratio in multiple cell types and in various organelles under metabolic perturbation. Additionally, we characterized the differential mitochondrial GTP&#8201;:&#8201;GDP ratios resulting from genetic modulation of two isoforms of a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme (succinyl&#8208;CoA synthetase; SCS&#8208;ATP and SCS&#8208;GTP) and of a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle enzyme (PEPCK&#8208;M). Thus, our GRISerHR sensor achieves spatiotemporally precise detection of dynamic changes in the endogenous GTP&#8201;:&#8201;GDP ratio in living cells and can help deepen our understanding about the energy metabolic contributions of guanosine nucleotides in biology.

         <title>Combinatorial Self&#8208;Assembly of Coordination Cages with Systematically Fine&#8208;Tuned Cavities for Efficient Co&#8208;Encapsulation and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combinatorial self&#8208;assembly approach gives rise to a family of palladium&#8208;organic cages featuring systematically fine&#8208;tuned shapes and cavities. Emergent guest&#8208;binding and catalytic functions were observed that are due to the fusion of two half cavities on the heteroleptic cages from their parent homoleptic cages.







Abstract
Controllable arrangement of different ligands in a single assembly will not only bring increased complexity but also offers a new route to fine&#8208;tune the function of the designed architecture. We report here a combinatorial self&#8208;assembly with enPd(NO3)2 and three different ligands (L1&#8211;3), which gave rise to a family of six palladium&#8208;organic cages (C1&#8208;6) with systematically varied shapes and cavities, including three new heteroleptic (Pd5L12L2, Pd5L12L3, Pd4L2L3), one new homoleptic (Pd4L32) cages, and two known homoleptic (Pd6L14, Pd4L22) cages. Emergent functions due to the fusion of two half cavities on the heteroleptic cages from their parent homoleptic cages have been observed: the heteroleptic cages can form ternary complexes by co&#8208;encapsulation of both aromatic and aliphatic guests, while their homoleptic counterparts can only form binary complexes. Such a forced co&#8208;encapsulation effect endows the heteroleptic cages with enhanced catalytic power for the Knoevenagel condensation.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Doped Quintuple [9]Helicene with Azacorannulene as Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two conformers of a novel quintuple [9]helicene with an azabuckybowl as the core were obtained by the deliberate introduction of sulfur heteroatoms into the helical skeleton. The structure&#8211;property relationship of different conformers was investigated through detailed experiment and theoretical calculations. The success of the sulfur&#8208;doped strategy implies the potential of realizing higher multiple [n]helicenes with various conformers.







Abstract
Herein, a hetero(S,N)&#8208;quintuple [9]helicene (SNQ9H) molecule with an azacorannulene core was synthesized, currently representing the highest hetero&#8208;helicene reported in the field of multiple [n]helicenes. X&#8208;ray crystallography indicated that SNQ9H includes not only a propeller&#8208;shaped conformer SNQ9H&#8208;1, but also an unforeseen quasi&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped conformer SNQ9H&#8208;2. Different conformers were observed for the first time in multiple [n&#8805;9]helicenes, likely owing to the doping of heteroatomic sulfurs in the helical skeletons. Remarkably, the ratio of SNQ9H&#8208;1 to SNQ9H&#8208;2 can be regulated in situ by the reaction temperature. Experimental studies on the photophysical and redox properties of SNQ9H and theoretical calculations clearly demonstrated that the electronic structures of SNQ9H depend on their molecular conformations. The strategy of introducing heteroatomic sulfurs into the helical skeleton may be useful in constructing various conformers of higher multiple [n]helicenes in the future.

&lt;p&gt;Two conformers of a novel quintuple [9]helicene with an azabuckybowl as the core were obtained by the deliberate introduction of sulfur heteroatoms into the helical skeleton. The structure&#8211;property relationship of different conformers was investigated through detailed experiment and theoretical calculations. The success of the sulfur-doped strategy implies the potential of realizing higher multiple [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]helicenes with various conformers.

         <title>Inducing Ring Complexation for Efficient Capture and Detection of Small Gaseous Molecules Using SERS for Environmental Surveillance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Practical applications of gas&#8208;phase surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) suffer from poor analyte affinity to plasmonic substrates, low concentration, and inherently small Raman cross&#8208;sections. Herein, ring complexation is leveraged via formation of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions with small gases to yield effective capture and distinct spectral changes for multiplex detection of SO2 and NO2 in excess of CO2 mimicking artificial exhaust.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;phase surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) remains challenging due to poor analyte affinity to SERS substrates. The reported use of capturing probes suffers from concurrent inconsistent signals and long response time due to the formation of multiple potential probe&#8211;analyte interaction orientations. Here, we demonstrate the use of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions for ring complexation to boost the affinity of small gas molecules, SO2 and NO2, to our SERS platform, achieving rapid capture and multiplex detection down to 100&#8197;ppm. Experimental and in&#8208;silico studies affirm stable ring complex formation, and kinetic investigations reveal a 4&#8208;fold faster response time compared to probes without stable ring complexation capability. By synergizing spectral concatenation and support vector machine regression, we achieve 91.7&#8201;% accuracy for multiplex quantification of SO2 and NO2 in excess CO2, mimicking real&#8208;life exhausts. Our platform shows immense potential for on&#8208;site exhaust and air quality surveillance.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Quantum Tunnelling in Spin Crossovers of Nitrenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin crossover from triplet to singlet in two nitrene reactions is accompanied by simultaneous heavy&#8208;atom quantum tunnelling. Instanton theory was used to unveil the molecular mechanism of this tunnelling process and, in addition to excellent agreement with experiment, appreciable tunnelling effects were found even at room temperature.







Abstract
We simulate two recent matrix&#8208;isolation experiments at cryogenic temperatures, in which a nitrene undergoes spin crossover from its triplet state to a singlet state via quantum tunnelling. We detail the failure of the commonly applied weak&#8208;coupling method (based on a linear approximation of the potentials) in describing these deep&#8208;tunnelling reactions. The more rigorous approach of semiclassical golden&#8208;rule instanton theory in conjunction with double&#8208;hybrid density&#8208;functional theory and multireference perturbation theory does, however, provide rate constants and kinetic isotope effects in good agreement with experiment. In addition, these calculations locate the optimal tunnelling pathways, which provide a molecular picture of the reaction mechanism. The reactions involve substantial heavy&#8208;atom quantum tunnelling of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which unexpectedly even continues to play a role at room temperature.

         <title>&#8220;Like Recycles Like&#8221;: Selective Ring&#8208;Closing Depolymerization of Poly(L&#8208;Lactic Acid) to L&#8208;Lactide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach is taken to decrease the ceiling temperature of L&#8208;lactide, enabling chemical recycling of high molecular weight poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) directly back to the cyclic lactide monomer (CRM) with high selectivity. By utilizing specific solvent interactions, the CRM can be performed at a moderate temperature; thereby, obstructing side reactions are diminished.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) to the cyclic monomer L&#8208;lactide is hampered by low selectivity and by epimerization and elimination reactions, impeding its use on a large scale. The high number of side reactions originates from the high ceiling temperature (Tc) of L&#8208;lactide, which necessitates high temperatures or multistep reactions to achieve recycling to L&#8208;lactide. To circumvent this issue, we utilized the impact of solvent interactions on the monomer&#8211;polymer equilibrium to decrease the Tc of L&#8208;lactide. Analyzing the observed Tc in different solvents in relation to their Hildebrand solubility parameter revealed a &#8220;like recycles like&#8221; relationship. The decreased Tc, obtained by selecting solvents that interact strongly with the monomer (dimethyl formamide or the green solvent &#947;&#8208;valerolactone), allowed chemical recycling of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) directly to L&#8208;lactide, within 1&#8211;4&#8197;h at 140&#8201;&#176;C, with &gt;95&#8201;% conversion and 98&#8211;99&#8201;% selectivity. Recycled L&#8208;lactide was isolated and repolymerized with high control over molecular weight and dispersity, closing the polymer loop.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Alkynes with Carboranes: Facile Construction of a Library of Boron Cluster&#8208;Based AIE&#8208;Active Luminogens</title>

Palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with carboranes enables the construction of a library of boron cluster&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active luminogens. This work provides not only a general design principle for a new type of luminogens but also an efficient methodology to synthesize photo&#8208;functional boron cluster derivatives.







Abstract
The classical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active luminogens (AIEgens) usually include two&#8208;dimensional aromatic systems such as tetraphenylethenes, which are synthesized in several steps by using toxic additives. Here, we proposed a new molecular design strategy for the realization of AIE properties by combining three&#8208;dimensional aromatic boron clusters of carboranes with vinyl group(s). To obtain a library of the boron cluster&#8208;based AIEgens, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with carboranes is reported. This reaction protocol proceeds in one step under mild conditions with rapid reaction rate, excellent yields and regioselectivity. Photophysical property studies demonstrate that the facile molecular motions in solution can be inhibited in the solid state for these molecules, which leads to interesting AIE properties. This work provides not only a general design principle for AIEgens but also an efficient methodology to synthesize boron cluster&#8208;based photo&#8208;functional molecules.

         <title>Unprecedented Ferroelectricity and Ferromagnetism in a Cr2+&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
[3,3&#8208;Difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CrCl4 is a Cr2+&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite that displays both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. It shows ferroelectricity with a high ferroelectric Curie temperature (Tc) up to 387&#8197;K and a saturate polarization of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits soft ferromagnet properties with a Curie temperature of 32.6&#8197;K.







Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have gained tremendous interest for their rich functional properties. However, the coexistence of more than one of ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity has been rarely found in OIHPs. Herein, we report a two&#8208;dimensional Cr2+&#8208;based OIHP, [3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CrCl4 ([DFCBA]2CrCl4), which shows both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. It undergoes a 4/mmmFm type ferroelectric phase transition at a temperature as high as 387&#8197;K and shows multiaxial ferroelectricity with a saturate polarization of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It acts as a soft ferromagnet with a Curie temperature of 32.6&#8197;K. This work throws light on the exploration of OIHPs with the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism for applications in future multifunctional smart devices.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Guided Stepwise Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Lanthanide Hydroxide Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deliberately introduced anions guide the hierarchical assembly of the series of high&#8208;nuclearity lanthanide hydroxide cluster intermediates Er12, Er34, and Er48 toward the complete sodalite cage of Er60.







Abstract
The ability to construct complex molecular architectures with precise control is critical for realizing molecule&#8208;based materials and functions. Using the assembly of a 60&#8208;metal complex of ErIII with histidine as an example, we demonstrate the rational assembly of otherwise synthetically elusive polynuclear lanthanide hydroxide clusters directed by the combined set of I&#8722; and CO32&#8722; as templates. We succeeded in the stepwise transformation starting from Er12 to Er60 by way of two key intermediates Er34 and Er48. The Er12, Er34, and Er48 core motifs represent respectively 1/6, 1/2, and 3/4 of the complete sodalite cage of Er60. This work, representing a rare example of rationally constructing high&#8208;nuclearity lanthanide clusters guided by judiciously chosen templates, is expected to stimulate more future efforts for the controllable synthesis of complex molecular or supramolecular architectures with unprecedented structural sophistication and possibly useful properties.

         <title>Suppression of Chain Transfer at High Temperature in Catalytic Olefin Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living polymerization (PDI 1.04 to 1.08) of ethylene at the record 130&#8201;&#176;C is achieved by completely suppressing the chain transfer using the nickel catalysts bearing the indispensable combination of the major fluorine effect and the minor steric shielding effect. The nickel catalysts are even active at 200&#8201;&#176;C, and enable the formation of semi&#8208;crystalline, ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyethylene at 150&#8201;&#176;C. The key chain transfer reactions are elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Living polymerization by suppressing chain transfer is a very useful method for achieving precise molecular weight and structure control. However, the suppression of chain transfer at high temperatures is extremely challenging in any catalytic polymerization. This has been a severe limitation for catalytic olefin polymerization, which is one of the most important chemical reactions. Here, we report the unprecedented living polymerization of ethylene at 130&#8201;&#176;C, with a narrow molecular weight distribution range of 1.04 to 1.08. This is a significant increase in the reaction temperature. Tailor&#8208;made &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts that exhibit both the steric shielding and fluorine effects play an essential role in this breakthrough. These nickel catalysts are even active at 200&#8201;&#176;C, and enable the formation of semi&#8208;crystalline, ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyethylene at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Mechanistic insights into the key chain transfer reaction are elucidated by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>SuFEx&#8208;Enabled Elastic Polysulfates for Efficient Removal of Radioactive Iodomethane and Polar Aprotic Organics through Weak Intermolecular Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crosslinked elastic polysulfate network (TPC&#8208;cPS) was prepared by a &#8220;one&#8208;step&#8221; SuFEx reaction. TPC&#8208;cPS can adsorb pyridine and become a fast, efficient and recyclable mini&#8208;reactor and trapper for radioactive iodomethane and its vapors. TPC&#8208;cPS can also adsorb some polar aprotic organics (such as DMF) due to the synergistic effect of electrostatic interaction and van der Waals force with the organics.







Abstract
Capturing radioactive iodomethane and its vapors is a major challenge due to its low adsorption capacity. Herein, we have developed for the first time a pyridine&#8208;entrapped elastic crosslinked polysulfate gel (pyridine/TPC&#8208;cPS) as an efficient absorbent for iodomethane capture. Each pyridine&#8208;encased TPC&#8208;cPS network cell acts as a mini&#8208;reactor for salt formation between pyridine and iodomethane. The yield reaches up to 96.65&#8201;% and traps saturated iodomethane vapor of 1.573&#8197;g gpyridine/TPC&#8208;cPS&#8722;1 (equivalent to 18.103&#8197;g&#8201;gTPC&#8208;cPS&#8722;1), which is the highest capacity reported to date. Both experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the unusual adsorption of polysulfate for polar aprotic organics can be attributed to the fact that the electrostatic interactions between the polar group (O=S=O) in the polymer backbone and the polar groups in the organic molecules fixed the solvent in the polymer matrix, while the van der Waals forces between the nonpolar groups in the polymer and molecules induced swelling.

&lt;p&gt;A crosslinked elastic polysulfate network (TPC-cPS) was prepared by a &#8220;one-step&#8221; SuFEx reaction. TPC-cPS can adsorb pyridine and become a fast, efficient and recyclable mini-reactor and trapper for radioactive iodomethane and its vapors. TPC-cPS can also adsorb some polar aprotic organics (such as DMF) due to the synergistic effect of electrostatic interaction and van der Waals force with the organics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capturing radioactive iodomethane and its vapors is a major challenge due to its low adsorption capacity.

The yield reaches up to 96.65&#8201;% and traps saturated iodomethane vapor of 1.573&#8197;g g&lt;sub&gt;pyridine/TPC-cPS&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (equivalent to 18.103&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;TPC-cPS&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>A Nanopore&#8208;Based Saccharide Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneously assembled MspA nanopore is reported. When modified with a single phenylboronic acid adapter, it can be applied in the identification of monosaccharides at the single&#8208;molecule level.







Abstract
Saccharides play critical roles in many forms of cellular activities. Saccharide structures are however complicated and similar, setting a technical hurdle for direct identification. Nanopores, which are emerging single molecule tools sensitive to minor structural differences between analytes, can be engineered to identity saccharides. A hetero&#8208;octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A nanopore containing a phenylboronic acid was prepared, and was able to clearly identify nine monosaccharide types, including D&#8208;fructose, D&#8208;galactose, D&#8208;mannose, D&#8208;glucose, L&#8208;sorbose, D&#8208;ribose, D&#8208;xylose, L&#8208;rhamnose and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. Minor structural differences between saccharide epimers can also be distinguished. To assist automatic event classification, a machine learning algorithm was developed, with which a general accuracy score of 0.96 was achieved. This sensing strategy is generally suitable for other saccharide types and may bring new insights to nanopore saccharide sequencing.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Release of Reactive Oxygen Species and NO for Overcoming Biofilm Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A therapeutic strategy to overcome biofilm heterogeneity is presented, in which antibacterial agent (NO) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) dispersant (reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;inducing Fe3+) are separately loaded in the yolk and shell compartment of a yolk&#8211;shell nanoplatform. The spatiotemporally ordered release manner and pharmacokinetic complementarity of ROS and NO improve the anti&#8208;biofilm outcome synergistically.







Abstract
The heterogeneity in biofilms is a major challenge in biofilm therapies due to different susceptibility of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to antibacterial agents. Here, we describe a therapeutic strategy that overcame biofilm heterogeneity, where antibacterial agent (NO) and EPS dispersant (reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;inducing Fe3+) were separately loaded in the yolk and shell compartment of a yolk&#8211;shell nanoplatform. Compared with traditional combinational chemotherapies which suffer from inconsistent pharmacokinetics profiles, this strategy drew on the pharmacokinetic complementarity of ROS and NO, where ROS with a short diffusion distance and a high redox potential corrupted the EPS, facilitating NO, which has a long diffusion distance and a broad antimicrobial spectrum, to penetrate the biofilm and eliminate the resident bacteria. Additionally, the construction of a three&#8208;dimensional spherical biofilm model is novel and clinically relevant.

         <title>One&#8208;For&#8208;All Polyolefin Functionalization: Active Ester as Gateway to Combine Insertion Polymerization with ROP, NMP, and RAFT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Polyolefin Active&#8208;Ester Exchange (PACE) process serves as a bridge connecting coordination&#8211;insertion polymerization to multiple controlled polymerization methods. It allows for the synthesis of hybrid materials that comprise olefins and ester, styrene, vinylic, acrylate, and acrylamide segments with a broad window for tunability. Nano&#8208;objects with higher&#8208;order morphologies can be obtained directly via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA.







Abstract
This work develops the Polyolefin Active&#8208;Ester Exchange (PACE) process to afford well&#8208;defined polyolefin&#8211;polyvinyl block copolymers. &#945;&#8208;Diimine PdII&#8208;catalyzed olefin polymerizations were investigated through in&#8208;depth kinetic studies in comparison to an analog to establish the critical design that facilitates catalyst activation. Simple transformations lead to a diversity of functional groups forming polyolefin macroinitiators or macro&#8208;mediators for various subsequent controlled polymerization techniques. Preparation of block copolymers with different architectures, molecular weights, and compositions was demonstrated with ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP), and photoiniferter reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PI&#8208;RAFT). The significant difference in the properties of polyolefin&#8211;polyacrylamide block copolymers was harnessed to carry out polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and study the nanostructure behaviors.

         <title>Property&#8208;Driven Development of Passively Permeable Macrocyclic Scaffolds Using Heterocycles
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide macrocycles display an array of bioactivity towards tough intracellular targets, but often exhibit poor physicochemical properties due to their multiple amide linkages. Here, the replacement of amide bonds with azole heterocycles is explored. The unique conformational space directed by heterocycles delivers macrocycles with high passive permeability, opening the door for the development of privileged macrocyclic scaffolds for drug discovery.







Abstract
Passive membrane permeability is a fundamental challenge in the development of bioactive macrocycles. To achieve this objective, chemists have resorted to various strategies, the most common of which is deployment of N&#8208;methylated amino acids and/or D&#8208;amino acids. Here we investigate the effect of heterocyclic grafts on the passive membrane permeability of macrocycles and report the structural consequences of iterative amino acid replacement by azole rings. Through stepwise substitution of amino acid residues for heterocycles, we show that lipophilicity and PAMPA permeability of a macrocycle can be vastly improved. Overall, changes in permeability do not scale linearly as more heterocycles are incorporated, underscoring the subtleties of conformation&#8208;property relationships in this class of molecule. NMR analysis and molecular dynamics simulations provide insights into the structural consequences of the added heterocycles and these frameworks can now be applied as macrocyclic scaffolds for drug discovery.

The biosynthetic pathway of sordarin, a diterpene glycoside with potent antifungal bioactivity, has been uncovered. In particular, it involves three P450 enzymes for the modification of cycloaraneosene to form a biosynthetic intermediate with a terminal alkene and a cyclopentadiene ring, which undergoes an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to form the rearranged sordaricin skeleton. Subsequent methyl oxidation and glycosylation form sordarin.







Abstract
Sordarin (1) is a fungal diterpene glycoside that displays potent antifungal bioactivity through inhibition of elongation factor 2. The structures of sordarin and related compounds feature a highly rearranged tetracyclic diterpene core. In this study, we identified a concise pathway in the biosynthesis of sordarin. A diterpene cyclase (SdnA) generates the 5/8/5 cycloaraneosene framework, which is decorated by a set of P450s that catalyze a series of oxidation reactions, including hydroxylation, desaturation, and C&#8722;C bond oxidative cleavage, to give a carboxylate intermediate with a terminal alkene and a cyclopentadiene moiety. A novel Diels&#8211;Alderase SdnG catalyzes an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder (IMDA) reaction on this intermediate to forge the sordarin core structure. Subsequent methyl hydroxylation and glycosylation complete the biosynthesis of sordarin. Our work discloses a new strategy used by nature for the formation of the rearranged diterpene skeleton.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Enantioisotopomers with Quantitative Chiral Analysis by Chiral Tag Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The validation and application of chiral tagging in molecular rotational resonance spectroscopy is reported for the assignment of absolute configuration and direct determination of enantiomeric excess for enantioisotopomers. Furthermore, a new catalytic, highly enantioselective, and scalable reaction is described for the direct synthesis of enantioisotopomers from styrene substrates.







Abstract
Fundamental to the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral molecules is the ability to assign absolute configuration at each stereogenic center, and to determine the enantiomeric excess for each compound. While determination of enantiomeric excess and absolute configuration is often considered routine in many facets of asymmetric synthesis, the same determinations for enantioisotopomers remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report the first highly enantioselective metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of enantioisotopomers that are chiral by virtue of deuterium substitution along with the first general spectroscopic technique for assignment of the absolute configuration and quantitative determination of the enantiomeric excess of isotopically chiral molecules. Chiral tag rotational spectroscopy uses noncovalent chiral derivatization, which eliminates the possibility of racemization during derivatization, to perform the chiral analysis without the need of reference samples of the enantioisotopomer.

         <title>Weak Cation&#8211;Solvent Interactions in Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes Stabilizing Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In low&#8208;concentrated ether&#8208;based electrolytes, the weak K+&#8211;solvent interactions are conducive to enhancing the potassium metal performance, the oxidation stability of the electrolyte, and enabling the graphite anode to undergo K+ intercalation rather than K+&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation behaviour.







Abstract
Conventional ether&#8208;based electrolytes exhibited a low polarization voltage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, yet suffered from ion&#8211;solvent co&#8208;intercalation phenomena in a graphite anode, inferior potassium&#8208;metal performance, and limited oxidation stability. Here, we reveal that weakening the cation&#8211;solvent interactions could suppress the co&#8208;intercalation behaviour, enhance the potassium&#8208;metal performance, and improve the oxidation stability. Consequently, the graphite anode exhibits K+ intercalation behaviour (K||graphite cell operates 200&#8197;cycles with 86.6&#8201;% capacity retention), the potassium metal shows highly stable plating/stripping (K||Cu cell delivers 550&#8197;cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 98.9&#8201;%) and dendrite&#8208;free (symmetric K||K cell operates over 1400&#8197;hours) properties, and the electrolyte exhibits high oxidation stability up to 4.4&#8197;V. The ion&#8211;solvent interaction tuning strategy provides a promising method to develop high&#8208;performance electrolytes and beyond.

         <title>Divide and Conquer: A Tailored Solid&#8208;state NMR Approach to Study Large Membrane Protein Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a protein&#8208;selective labelling approach that allowed us to probe a single lipoprotein (BamC) in the pentameric BAM membrane protein complex by proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR. Our results generate novel insights into the supramolecular structure of the BAM complex and provide evidence that the three BamC domains exhibit different dynamic properties within the 200&#8197;kDa complex embedded in lipid bilayers.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are known to exert many essential biological functions by forming complexes in cell membranes. An example refers to the &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM), a 200&#8197;kDa pentameric complex containing BAM proteins A&#8211;E that catalyzes the essential process of protein insertion into the outer membrane of gram&#8208;negative bacteria. While progress has been made in capturing three&#8208;dimensional structural snapshots of the BAM complex, the role of the lipoprotein BamC in the complex assembly in functional lipid bilayers has remained unclear. We have devised a component&#8208;selective preparation scheme to directly study BamC as part of the entire BAM complex in lipid bilayers. Combination with proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR methods allowed us to probe the structure, dynamics, and supramolecular topology of full&#8208;length BamC embedded in the entire complex in lipid bilayers. Our approach may help decipher how individual proteins contribute to the dynamic formation and functioning of membrane protein complexes in membranes.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge&#8208;Transfer State in Spiro Compact Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads Based on Pyromellitimide&#8208;Derived Rhodamine: Charge Transfer Dynamics and Electron Spin Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fully rigid spiro electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyad is prepared by linking the electron donor and acceptor via a spiro quaternary carbon atom, thus the torsion between the electron donor and acceptor is completely inhibited. The dyad shows a long&#8208;lived 3CT state (2.6&#8197;&#956;s) with a high energy level (ca. 2.61&#8197;eV), the electron spin multiplicity of the CT state was confirmed with time&#8208;resolved EPR spectra.







Abstract
We observed a long&#8208;lived charge transfer (CT) state in a novel orthogonal compact electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyads, with closed form of rhodamine (Rho) as electron donor and pyromellitimide (PI),or thionated PI, as electron acceptor. The two parts in the dyads are connected via a spiro quaternary carbon atom, thus the torsion between the donor and acceptor is completely inhibited, which is beneficial to reduce the reorganization energy and to exploit the Marcus inverted region effect to prolong the CT state lifetime. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show that the charge separation is rather fast, while nanosecond transient absorption spectra confirmed the formation of long&#8208;lived CT state (2.6&#8197;&#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra determined the spin multiplicity of the long living state and assigned it to a 3CT state. Replacement of an oxygen atom in the PI part with a sulfur atom favoring classical intersystem crossing processes, causes a consistently shortening of the lifetime of the 3CT state (0.29&#8197;&#956;s).

         <title>Expanded Azaporphyrins Consisting of Multiple BODIPY Units: Global Aromaticity and High Affinities Towards Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;coupling reaction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromo&#8208;BODIPY under Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination conditions has led to the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;bridged cyclic BODIPY tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer. Subsequent oxidation of these BODIPY oligomers with DDQ in the presence of alkali metal ions gave 1, 2, and 3, which show high affinities towards alkali metal ions. Expanded azaporphyrins 1 and 2 display global aromaticity.







Abstract
The one&#8208;pot self&#8208;coupling reaction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromo&#8208;BODIPY 9 under Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination conditions gave nitrogen&#8208;bridged cyclic BODIPY tetramer 10, pentamer 11, and hexamer 12. Oxidation of 10, 11, and 12 in the presence of alkali metal ions provided 13, 15, and 16, respectively, as the first examples of expanded azaporphyrins possessing more than six pyrrole rings. Curiously, the oxidation even in the absence of alkali metal ions gave the same complexes as a result of spontaneous complexation. 10&#8211;12 showed large association constants (104&#8211;106&#8197;M&#8722;1) with K+ and Na+, but the spontaneous complexations were not observed, indicating the extremely high affinities of 13&#8211;16 toward alkali metal ions, which can be ascribed to the multiple and effective ion&#8211;dipole interaction of the alkali metal ion with the negatively polarized F atoms of the BF2 walls surrounding the cavity. Importantly, 13, 14, and 15 show diatropic ring currents as a result of global aromaticity.

         <title>Molecular Stacking on Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first prototype of spatially defined graphene 2D hetero&#8208;architectures bearing vertically aligned multiple molecular bricks is realized based on a proposed &#8220;molecular building blocks&#8221; concept. The constructed nano&#8208;assemblies exhibit structural hierarchies across multiple height scales and versatile properties. The results represent a breakthrough and open the door for future construction of promising patterned 3D architectures.







Abstract
The sequential vertical polyfunctionalization of 2D addend&#8208;patterned graphene is still elusive. Here, we report a practical realization of this goal via a &#8220;molecular building blocks&#8221; approach, which is based on a combination of a lithography&#8208;assisted reductive functionalization approach and a post&#8208;functionalization step to sequentially and controllably link the molecular building blocks ethylpyridine, cis&#8208;dichlorobis(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium, and triphenylphosphine (4&#8208;methylbenzenethiol, respectively) on selected lattice regions of a graphene matrix. The assembled 2D hetero&#8208;architectures are unambiguously characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic measurements, revealing the stepwise stacking of the molecular building blocks on the graphene surface. Our method overcomes the current limitation of a one&#8208;layer&#8208;only binding to the graphene surface and opens the door for a vertical growth in the z&#8208;direction.

Carbene&#8208;copper&#8208;amide thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring &#960;&#8208;annulated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands show exceptional radiative rate constants of 1.1&#8211;2.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and can deliver stable and high&#8208;performance full&#8208;color CuI&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with device lifetimes (LT90) up to 1300&#8197;hours at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and ultra&#8208;high brightness up to 222&#8201;200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
A critical step in advancing the practical application of copper&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to bridge the large gap between device efficiency and operational stability at practical luminance. Described is a panel of air&#8208; and thermally stable two&#8208;coordinate CuI emitters featuring bulky pyrazine&#8208; (PzIPr) or pyridine&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (PyIPr*) and carbazole (Cz) ligands with enhanced amide&#8208;Cu&#8208;carbene bonding interactions. These CuI emitters display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from the 1LL&#8242;CT(Cz&#8594;PzIPr/PyIPr*) excited states across the blue to red regions with exceptional radiative rate constants of 1.1&#8211;2.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Vapour&#8208;deposited OLEDs based on these CuI emitters showed excellent external quantum efficiencies and luminance up to 23.6&#8201;% and 222&#8201;200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively, alongside record device lifetimes (LT90) up to 1300&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 under our laboratory conditions, highlighting the practicality of the CuI&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Molecular Engineered Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Protein with Strong Adhesion over a Wide Temperature Range from &#8722;196 to 200&#8201;&#176;C</title>

A crown&#8208;ether&#8208;protein adhesive was synthesized by host&#8211;guest molecular engineering. The internal dynamic molecular interactions endow the adhesives with extraordinary adhesion performance over a wide temperature range from &#8722;196 to 200&#8201;&#176;C. Extremely strong adhesion, long&#8208;lasting adhesion, and biomedical sealing have been achieved. This work offers a promising molecular engineering strategy to fabricate robust supramolecular adhesives for applications under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The inherently tenuous adhesion strength and limited environmental tolerance of supramolecular adhesives severely restrict their application scenarios. It is challenging for the development of robust adhesives with extreme temperature tolerance. Herein, we report a new type of temperature&#8208;resistant crown&#8208;ether&#8208;protein (CEP) adhesive by harnessing synergistic host&#8211;guest molecular interactions between engineered crown ether and protein building blocks. The outputs of CEP adhesive demonstrate ultrahigh shearing adhesion strength of &#8776;22&#8197;MPa over a wide temperature range from &#8722;196 to 200&#8201;&#176;C, superior to other established supramolecular or polymeric adhesives. The temperature&#8208;induced phase transition and internal bound water stabilized the system and led to superb adhesion under extreme conditions. Thus, this work pioneers a molecular engineering approach for the generation of adhesives with tailored applications in extreme settings.

         <title>Asymmetric Living Supramolecular Polymerization: Precise Fabrication of One&#8208;Handed Helical Supramolecular Polymers</title>

         <dc:description>
Right&#8208;handed helical seed micelles prepared from chiral poly(cholesterol allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) induced an asymmetric living supramolecular block copolymerization of achiral poly(alkoxy allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene). This led to right&#8208;handed supramolecular block copolymers with controlled length and low distribution. Remarkably, these copolymers showed white&#8208;light emission and circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Programming the organization of semiconducting polymers to form well&#8208;defined nanoarchitectures is desirable for fabricating functional materials. In this work, semiconducting copolymers, poly(cholesterol allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (PCA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT) containing helical PCA and poly(alkoxy allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (PAA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT) containing achiral PAA segments, were prepared. Crystallization of P3HT and helicity of PCA drove PCA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT self&#8208;assemble into spherical nanoparticles that gradually transformed into one&#8208;handed helical nanofibers. The chirality of PCA was transferred to the supramolecular architectures, induced high optical activity in P3HT. Interestingly, the chiral seed micelles of PCA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT induced asymmetric copolymerization of achiral PAA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT, which led to helical supramolecular block copolymers with defined helicity and controlled length. Remarkably, the supramolecular copolymers showed white&#8208;light emission and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Intramolecular Chloro&#8211;Sulfur Interaction and Asymmetric Side&#8208;Chain Isomerization to Balance Crystallinity and Miscibility in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Introduction of Cl atoms into the backbone in small&#8208;molecule donors (SMDs) enhances the molecular planarity and rigidity through intramolecular Cl&#8722;S interactions. Additionally, asymmetric isomerization of side chains balances crystallinity and miscibility to achieve ideal morphology for simultaneously high short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor to yield a record power conversion efficiency of 15.73&#8201;% among halogenated SMD&#8208;based binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells.







Abstract
Intramolecular Cl&#8722;S non&#8208;covalent interaction is introduced to modify molecular backbone of a benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodamine (BTR) benchmark structure, helping planarize and rigidify the molecular framework for improving charge transport. Theoretical simulations and temperature&#8208;variable NMR experiments clearly validate the existence of Cl&#8722;S non&#8208;covalent interaction in two designed chlorinated donors and explain its important role in enhancing planarity and rigidity of the molecules for enhancing their crystallinity. The asymmetric isomerization of side&#8208;chains further optimizes the molecular orientation and surface energy to strike a balance between its crystallinity and miscibility. This carefully manipulated molecular design helps result in increased carrier mobility and suppressed charge recombination to obtain simultaneously enhanced short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) and a very high efficiency of 15.73&#8201;% in binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Aldol&#8208;Type Coupling of Alkoxyallenes with Pentafluorophenyl Esters Enabled by Synergistic Palladium/Chiral Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of a chiral palladium catalyst and a chiral Lewis base catalyst was used to achieve diastereodivergent aldol&#8208;type coupling reactions of alkoxyallenes with pentafluorophenyl esters. Each of the four stereoisomers of the coupling products could be selectively prepared from the same pair of substrates simply by using an appropriate pair of chiral catalysts. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the stereochemistry of this reaction.







Abstract
As a fundamental and synthetically useful C&#8722;C bond formation reaction, the aldol reaction is one of the most versatile transformations in organic synthesis. However, despite extensive research on asymmetric versions of the reaction, a unified method for stereoselective access to the complementary syn and anti diastereomeric products remains to be developed. In this study, we developed a synergistic palladium/chiral Lewis base system that overcomes the inherent diastereoselectivity bias of aldol reactions and, as a result, allowed us to achieve the first diastereodivergent coupling reactions of alkoxyallenes with pentafluorophenol esters. Computational studies suggest a mechanism involving an intermolecular protonative hydropalladation pathway rather than a palladium&#8208;hydride migratory insertion pathway. The origin of the stereochemistry for this synergistic catalysis system is rationalized by DFT calculations.

         <title>A Site Distance Effect Induced by Reactant Molecule Matchup in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site distance effects are important in a Cu1/N&#8208;doped graphene (Cu1/GN) single&#8208;atom catalyst with record&#8208;breaking kinetics in the oxidation of emerging organic pollutants. A strategy is reported to achieve the desired catalyst behavior by matching the active site with the properties of the reaction molecule peroxydisulfate (PDS).







Abstract
Understanding the site interaction nature of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), especially densely populated SACs, is vital for their application to various catalytic reactions. Herein, we report a site distance effect, which emphasizes how well the distance of the adjacent copper atoms (denoted as dCu1&#8722;Cu1) matches with the reactant peroxydisulfate (PDS) molecular size to determine the Fenton&#8208;like reaction reactivity on the carbon&#8208;supported SACs. The optimized dCu1&#8722;Cu1 in the range of 5&#8211;6&#8197;&#197;, which matches the molecular size of PDS, endows the catalyst with a nearly two times higher turnover frequency than that of dCu1&#8722;Cu1 beyond this range, accordingly achieving record&#8208;breaking kinetics for the oxidation of emerging organic contaminants. Further studies suggest that this site distance effect originates from the alteration of PDS adsorption to a dual&#8208;site structure on Cu1&#8722;Cu1 sites when dCu1&#8722;Cu1 falls within 5&#8211;6&#8197;&#197;, significantly enhancing the interfacial charge transfer and consequently resulting in the most efficient catalyst for PDS activation so far.

         <title>Precise Modulation of Triple&#8208;Phase Boundaries towards a Highly Functional Exsolved Catalyst for Dry Reforming of Methane under a Dilution&#8208;Free System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) extended nanocatalyst converts CO2 and CH4 to industrially useful syngas. Even under a dilution&#8208;free system, the precisely controlled exsolved nanocatalyst was highly active and stable for 1000&#8197;hours without any deactivation. DFT calculations revealed that the Lewis acid and base natures of support and metal, respectively, enhance the adsorption ability of reactants at the TPB site.







Abstract
Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has been emerging as a viable solution to achieving carbon neutrality enhanced by the Paris Agreement as it converts the greenhouse gases of CO2 and CH4 into industrially useful syngas. However, there have been limited studies on the DRM catalyst under mild operating conditions with a high dilution gas ratio due to their deactivation from carbon coking and metal sintering. Herein, we apply the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) concept to DRM catalyst via exsolution phenomenon that can secure elongated TPB by controlling the Fe&#8208;doping ratio in perovskite oxide. Remarkably, the exsolved catalyst with prolongated TPB shows exceptional CO2 and CH4 conversion rates of 95.9&#8201;% and 91.6&#8201;%, respectively, stable for 1000&#8197;hours under a dilution&#8208;free system. DFT calculations confirm that the Lewis acid of support and Lewis base of metal at the TPB promote the adsorption of reactants, resulting in lowering the overall CO2 dissociation and CH4 dehydrogenation energy.

     alt="Precise Modulation of Triple-Phase Boundaries towards a Highly Functional Exsolved Catalyst for Dry Reforming of Methane under a Dilution-Free System"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A triple-phase boundary (TPB) extended nanocatalyst converts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to industrially useful syngas. Even under a dilution-free system, the precisely controlled exsolved nanocatalyst was highly active and stable for 1000&#8197;hours without any deactivation. DFT calculations revealed that the Lewis acid and base natures of support and metal, respectively, enhance the adsorption ability of reactants at the TPB site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has been emerging as a viable solution to achieving carbon neutrality enhanced by the Paris Agreement as it converts the greenhouse gases of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into industrially useful syngas. However, there have been limited studies on the DRM catalyst under mild operating conditions with a high dilution gas ratio due to their deactivation from carbon coking and metal sintering. Herein, we apply the triple-phase boundary (TPB) concept to DRM catalyst via exsolution phenomenon that can secure elongated TPB by controlling the Fe-doping ratio in perovskite oxide. Remarkably, the exsolved catalyst with prolongated TPB shows exceptional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion rates of 95.9&#8201;% and 91.6&#8201;%, respectively, stable for 1000&#8197;hours under a dilution-free system. DFT calculations confirm that the Lewis acid of support and Lewis base of metal at the TPB promote the adsorption of reactants, resulting in lowering the overall CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; dehydrogenation energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Small Molecular Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule, 2,3,7,8&#8208;tetraaminophenazine&#8208;1,4,6,9&#8208;tetraone (TAPT), is reported for symmetric all&#8208;organic lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The rich C=O, C=N and NH2 groups enabled more than two plateaus, strong and plentiful intermolecular interactions, possible chelation with Li ions and hence insolubility, high capacity and cyclability.







Abstract
The structural designability of organic electrode materials makes them attractive for symmetric all&#8208;organic batteries (SAOBs) by virtue of different plateaus. However, quite a few works have reported all&#8208;organic batteries and it is still challenging to develop a high&#8208;performance organic material for SAOBs. Herein, a small molecule, 2,3,7,8&#8208;tetraaminophenazine&#8208;1,4,6,9&#8208;tetraone (TAPT), is reported for SAOBs. The rich C=O and C=N groups ensure the high capacity at both plateaus for C=O/C&#8722;O and C=N/C&#8722;N redox reactions, which are hence utilized as cathodic and anodic active centers respectively. Moreover, the presence of C=O, C=N and NH2 groups resulted in plentiful strong intermolecular interactions, leading to layered structures, insolubility and high stability. The rich functional groups also facilitated the chelation of N and O with Li cations and hence benefited the storage of Li cations. The electrochemical performances of TAPT&#8208;based SAOBs outperformed all of the previously reported SAOBs.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent and Selective Degrader for USP7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first&#8208;in&#8208;class selective USP7 degrader U7D&#8208;1 was developed, inducing potent USP7 degradation in different kinds of cell lines. Importantly, this degrader showed notable anti&#8208;proliferative activities in mutant p53 cancer cells, with USP7 inhibitor having no activity.







Abstract
The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and more than half of cancers contain p53 mutations. The development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for p53 mutant cancer therapy is a big challenge and highly desirable. Ubiquitin&#8208;specific protease 7 (USP7), also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitinating enzyme and proposed to stabilize the oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 that promotes the proteosomal degradation of p53. Herein, we report the design and characterization of U7D&#8208;1 as the first selective USP7&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC). U7D&#8208;1 showed selective and effective USP7 degradation, and maintained potent cell growth inhibition in p53 mutant cancer cells, with USP7 inhibitor showing no activity. These data clearly demonstrated the practicality and importance of PROTAC as a preliminary chemical tool for investigating USP7 protein functions and a promising method for potential p53 mutant cancer therapy.

         <title>Pore&#8208;Structure Control in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Capture of the Greenhouse Gas SF6 with Record Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Ni(ina)2 has pore sizes (6&#8197;&#197;) that are perfectly compatible with the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2&#8197;&#197;), affording the benchmark binding affinity for this potent greenhouse gas that is used in the electronics industry.







Abstract
In the electronics industry, the efficient recovery and capture of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from SF6/N2 mixtures is of great importance. Herein, three metal&#8211;organic frameworks with fine&#8208;tuning pore structures, Cu(peba)2, Ni(pba)2, and Ni(ina)2, were designed for SF6 capture. Among them, Ni(ina)2 has perfect pore sizes (6&#8197;&#197;) that are comparable to the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2&#8197;&#197;), affording the benchmark binding affinity for SF6 gas. Ni(ina)2 exhibits the highest SF6/N2 selectivity (375.1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar) and ultra&#8208;high SF6 uptake capacity (53.5&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 0.1&#8197;bar) at ambient conditions. The remarkable separation performance of Ni(ina)2 was verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations and the SF6&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structure provided critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism. This porous coordination network has the potential to be used in industrial applications.

         <title>Improved Polarization in the Sr6Cd2Sb6O7Se10 Oxyselenide through Design of Lateral Sublattices for Efficient Photoelectric Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new oxyselenide Sr6Cd2Sb6O7Se10 featuring polar lateral sublattices has been designed for efficient photoelectric conversion. The improved polarization of the heteroanionic Sb&#8722;Se/O sublattice facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;induced charge carriers, benefiting the wide spectral photoelectric response of this material.







Abstract
Highly&#8208;polarizable materials are favorable for photoelectric conversion due to their efficient charge separation, while precise design of them is still a big challenge. Herein a novel polar oxyselenide, Sr6Cd2Sb6O7Se10, is rationally designed. It contains lateral sublattices of polarizable [Sb2OSe4]4&#8722; chains and highly&#8208;orientated [CdSe3]4&#8722; chains. The intense polarization was evaluated by significant second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) signal (maximum: 12.6&#215;AgGaS2) in broad spectrum range. The polarization was found to mainly improve the carrier separation with a much longer recombination lifetime (76.5&#8197;&#956;s) than that of the nonpolar compound Sr2Sb2O2Se3 (18.0&#8197;&#956;s), resulting in better photoelectric performance. The single&#8208;crystal photoelectric device exhibited excellent response covering broad spectrum in 500&#8211;1000&#8197;nm with stable reproducibility. This work provides some new insights into the structure design of highly&#8208;polarizable heteroanionic materials for photoelectric conversion.

It contains lateral sublattices of polarizable [Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; chains and highly-orientated [CdSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; chains. The intense polarization was evaluated by significant second-harmonic generation (SHG) signal (maximum: 12.6&#215;AgGaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in broad spectrum range. The polarization was found to mainly improve the carrier separation with a much longer recombination lifetime (76.5&#8197;&#956;s) than that of the nonpolar compound Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (18.0&#8197;&#956;s), resulting in better photoelectric performance. The single-crystal photoelectric device exhibited excellent response covering broad spectrum in 500&#8211;1000&#8197;nm with stable reproducibility. This work provides some new insights into the structure design of highly-polarizable heteroanionic materials for photoelectric conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Closed&#8208;loop recycling of poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) to L&#8208;lactide (LLA) was enabled by specific solvent interactions. In their Research Article (e202204531), Karin Odelius and co&#8208;workers show how the ceiling temperature (Tc) depends not only on concentration, but also on solvent properties. This was utilized to lower the recycling temperature of PLLA, enabling direct ring&#8208;closing depolymerization of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PLLA to the cyclic monomer LLA with high yield and high selectivity.

A combinatorial self&#8208;assembly approach with enPd(NO3)2 and three different ligands is demonstrated by Li&#8208;Xuan Cai, Qihui Chen, Qing&#8208;Fu Sun, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202204732). The controllable arrangement of different ligands not only gives rise to a family of six different palladium&#8211;organic cages with systematically varied shapes and cavities, but also leads to emergent host&#8211;guest chemistry of the heteroleptic cages due to the fusion of two half cavities from their parent homoleptic cages.

The rational synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity lanthanide clusters remains challenging. In their Research Article (e202205385), Min Feng, Zhiping Zheng, and co&#8208;workers developed a stepwise synthesis of a high&#8208;nuclearity sodalite cage&#8208;like cluster Er60, guided by judiciously selected anions. The successive introduction of I&#8722;, CO32&#8722;, and NO3&#8722; led to the isolation of three crucial intermediate clusters, namely the wheel&#8208;like Er12, ship&#8208;like Er34, and bowl&#8208;like Er48. These findings opened the &#8220;black box&#8221; of the elusive self&#8208;assembly process and provided mechanistic insights.

&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;48&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings opened the &#8220;black box&#8221; of the elusive self-assembly process and provided mechanistic insights.

A polyolefin active ester exchange (PACE) process was developed for polyolefin&#8208;containing block copolymer synthesis and serves as a bridge connecting coordination&#8211;insertion polymerization to multiple controlled polymerization methods. As reported by Krzysztof Matyjaszewski, Eva Harth et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202205931), PACE allows for the synthesis of hybrid materials that comprise olefins and ester, styrene, vinylic, acrylate, and acrylamide segments with a broad window for tunability. Nano&#8208;objects with higher&#8208;order morphologies can be obtained directly via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA.

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically formed using hard Lewis basic organic ligands with high oxidation state metal ions. The use of low&#8208;valent metals as structural elements in MOFs is far less common, despite the widespread use of such metals for catalysis, luminescence, and other applications. This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of low&#8208;valent MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline, 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers formed by bonding interactions between metals and multitopic organic ligands. These are typically formed using hard Lewis basic organic ligands with high oxidation state metal ions. The use of low&#8208;valent metals as structural elements in MOFs is far less common, despite the widespread use of such metals for catalysis, luminescence, and other applications. This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of low&#8208;valent MOFs and offers a perspective on the future development of these materials.

         <title>Alloy&#8208;Type Anodes for High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloy&#8208;type anodes are one of the most promising anodes because of their high energy density, relatively low electrode potential and low cost, but they can also undergo large volume expansion, resulting in disintegration and fracturing of anodes. In this Review useful strategies to solve these problems are discussed including the structural design of anodes, construction of a protective interface on anodes, and selection of suitable electrolytes.







Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type anodes are one of the most promising classes of next&#8208;generation anode materials due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity (2&#8211;10&#8197;times that of graphite). However, current alloy&#8208;type anodes have several limitations: huge volume expansion, high tendency to fracture and disintegrate, an unstable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, and low Coulombic efficiency. Efforts to overcome these challenges are ongoing. This Review details recent progress in the research of batteries based on alloy&#8208;type anodes and discusses the direction of their future development. We conclude that improvements in structural design, the introduction of a protective interface, and the selection of suitable electrolytes are the most effective ways to improve the performance of alloy&#8208;type anodes. Furthermore, future studies should direct more attention toward analyzing their synergistic promoting effect.

         <title>Lewis Base Catalyzed Synthesis of Sulfur Heterocycles via the C1&#8208;Pyridinium Enolate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiocarbonyl&#8208;containing compounds undergo reactions with C1&#8208;Lewis base enolates to give sulfur heterocycles. Specifically, dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyses the cyclisation of dithioesters, trithiocarbonates and xanthates to give an array of sulfur heterocycles. The transformation demonstrates the viability of thiocarbonyl&#8208;containing functionality in Lewis base organocatalysis, and defines a new approach to sulfur&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
While the addition of C1&#8208;Lewis base enolates to carbonyls and related structures are well established, the related addition to thiocarbonyls compounds are unknown. Herein, we report a reaction cascade in which a C1&#8208;pyridinium enolate undergos addition to dithioesters, trithiocarbonates and xanthates. The reaction provides access to a range of dihydrothiophenes and dihydrothiopyrans (28&#8208;examples). Mechanistic investigations, including isolation of intermediates, electronic correlation, and kinetic isotope effect studies support the viability of an activated acid intermediate giving rise to the C1&#8208;pyridinium enolate which undergoes turnover limiting cyclization. Subsequent formation of a &#946;&#8208;thiolactone regenerates the catalyst with loss of carbon oxysulfide providing the observed products.

         <title>Phase Transfer&#8208;Mediated Degradation of Ether&#8208;Based Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes in Alkali Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rethinking the stability of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes in alkali metal batteries: Ether solvent can act as a phase transfer reagent that dissolves alkali metals into solvated electrons and metal anions to decompose inert hydrofluoroether co&#8208;solvents, preventing the formation of stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases.







Abstract
Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) have attracted interest in alkali metal batteries due to the advantages of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on anodes and good chemical/electrochemical stability. Herein, a new degradation mechanism is revealed for ether&#8208;based LHCEs that questions their compatibility with alkali metal anodes (Li, Na, and K). Specifically, the ether solvent reacts with alkali metals to generate solvated electrons (es&#8722;) that attack hydrofluoroether co&#8208;solvents to form a series of byproducts. The ether solvent essentially acts as a phase&#8208;transfer reagent that continuously transfers electrons from solid&#8208;phase metals into the solution phase, thus inhibiting the formation of stable SEI and leading to continuous alkali metal corrosion. Switching to an ester&#8208;based solvating solvent or intercalation anodes such as graphite or molybdenum disulfide has been shown to avoid such a degradation mechanism due to the absence of es&#8722;.

         <title>An Aminative Rearrangement of O&#8208;(Arenesulfonyl)hydroxylamines: Facile Access to ortho&#8208;Sulfonyl Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aromatic rearrangement of hydroxylamine derivatives that leads directly to ortho&#8208;sulfonyl anilines from simple starting materials is reported. This is achieved through formation of a new C&#8722;N bond with excellent levels of regiocontrol for the ortho isomer(s), which is proposed to be the result of attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions occurring during the C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming step.







Abstract
Ortho&#8208;sulfonyl anilines are important building blocks for a range of applications. We report the discovery of an aromatic rearrangement reaction of O&#8208;(arenesulfonyl)hydroxylamines which leads directly to ortho&#8208;sulfonyl anilines through formation of a new C&#8722;N bond with excellent levels of regiocontrol for the ortho position(s) over all others. We establish that the rearrangement is proceeding through an intermolecular mechanism and propose that the regiocontrol observed is the result of attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions occurring during the C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming step. Importantly, this method is complementary to classical aniline sulfonation in terms of the variously substituted regioisomers that can be obtained and it is also applicable to O&#8208;(benzylsulfonyl) hydroxylamines.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Targeting Circular Aptamer Strategy Enables the Recognition of Different Leukemia Cells with Enhanced Binding Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the recognition and internalization ability of aptamers, we designed a dual&#8208;targeting circular aptamer (DTCA) that can simultaneously recognize two different biomarkers on cancer cells to significantly improve aptamer&#8211;receptor interactions. This molecular engineering technique considerably boosts binding avidity and expands the recognition spectrum of these aptamers to different subtypes of leukemia cells.







Abstract
Currently, the broad use of monovalent aptamers in oncology faces challenges, including insufficient recognition and internalization caused by a finite number of receptors on the cell surface, as well as a confined recognition spectrum. Herein, we describe the development of a dual&#8208;targeting circular aptamer (DTCA) that can recognize two different biomarkers on living cells to augment aptamer&#8211;receptor interactions, thus enhancing recognition of the target cells. This improvement not only boosts binding and internalization abilities, but also expands the recognition spectrum of these aptamers to different leukemia cells. Moreover, the stability of DTCA in serum can be significantly improved by an enzyme&#8208;promoted terminal ligation strategy. The chemical incorporation of 5&#8208;fluorodeoxyuridine into DTCA resulted in a pharmaceutically functional aptamer that exhibited excellent selectivity, as demonstrated by its high cytotoxicity against target cancer cells, but not to normal cells. The superiority of our newly developed strategy was further highlighted by its precise tumor&#8208;imaging capability.

         <title>Dual Honeycomb&#8208;Superlattice Enables Double&#8208;High Activity and Reversibility of Anion Redox for Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;designed sodium&#8208;ion battery layered cathode has been constructed via dual honeycomb&#8208;superlattice regulation, and this displayed double&#8208;high anion redox activity and reversibility. Experimental and theoretical studies are carried out to explore the mechanism.







Abstract
Anion redox contributes to the anomalous capacity exceeding the theoretical limit of layered oxides. However, double&#8208;high activity and reversibility is challenging due to the structural rearrangement and potential oxygen loss. Here, we propose a strategy for constructing a dual honeycomb&#8208;superlattice structure in Na2/3[Li1/7Mn5/14][Mg1/7Mn5/14]O2 to simultaneously realize high activity and reversibility of lattice O redox. Theoretical simulation and electrochemical tests show that [Li1/7Mn5/14] superlattice units remarkably trigger the anion redox activity and enable the delivery of a record capacity of 285.9&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 in layered sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Nuclear magnetic resonance and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that [Mg1/7Mn5/14] superlattice units are beneficial to the structure and anion redox reversibility, where Li+ reversibly shuttles between Na layers and transition&#8208;metal slabs in contrast to the absence of [Mg1/7Mn5/14] units. Our findings underline the importance of multifunctional units and provide a path to advanced battery materials.

         <title>A Nanobody&#8208;on&#8208;Quantum Dot Displacement Assay for Rapid and Sensitive Quantification of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple is powerful: Terbium complexes labeled with hexahistidine&#8208;tagged nanobodies were displaced from quantum dots via EGFR&#8208;nanobody binding. This simple concept resulted in a rapid and wash&#8208;free single&#8208;nanobody FRET immunoassay with picomolar limits of detection.







Abstract
Biosensing approaches that combine small, engineered antibodies (nanobodies) with nanoparticles are often complicated. Here, we show that nanobodies with different C&#8208;terminal tags can be efficiently attached to a range of the most widely used biocompatible semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Direct implementation into simplified assay formats was demonstrated by designing a rapid and wash&#8208;free mix&#8208;and&#8208;measure immunoassay for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Terbium complex (Tb)&#8208;labeled hexahistidine&#8208;tagged nanobodies were specifically displaced from QD surfaces via EGFR&#8208;nanobody binding, leading to an EGFR concentration&#8208;dependent decrease of the Tb&#8208;to&#8208;QD F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal. The detection limit of 80&#177;20&#8197;pM (16&#177;4&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1) was 3&#8208;fold lower than the clinical cut&#8208;off concentration for soluble EGFR and up to 10&#8208;fold lower compared to conventional sandwich FRET assays that required a pair of different nanobodies.

         <title>Hydrazide Derivatives for Defect Passivation in Pure CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new passivator&#8212;benzoyl hydrazine (BH) with carboxyl, hydrazine and phenyl groups was developed to effectively passivate defects in CsPbI3 through synergetic effects of these groups. Consequently, a highest efficiency of 20.47&#8201;% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage and stability is achieved in a BH&#8208;CsPbI3 solar cell, the highest efficiency among all pure CsPbI3&#8208;based devices reported to date.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite presents preeminent chemical stability and a desirable band gap as the front absorber for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Unfortunately, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still show low efficiency due to high density of defects in solution&#8208;prepared CsPbI3 films. Herein, three kinds of hydrazide derivatives (benzoyl hydrazine (BH), formohydrazide (FH) and benzamide (BA)) are designed to reduce the defect density and stabilize the phase of CsPbI3. Calculation and characterization results corroborate that the carboxyl and hydrazine groups in BH form strong chemical bonds with Pb2+ ions, resulting in synergetic double coordination. In addition, the hydrazine group in the BH also forms a hydrogen bond with iodine to assist the coordination. Consequently, a high efficiency of 20.47&#8201;% is achieved, which is the highest PCE among all pure CsPbI3&#8208;based PSCs reported to date. In addition, an unencapsulated device showed excellent stability in ambient air.

&lt;p&gt;All-inorganic CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite presents preeminent chemical stability and a desirable band gap as the front absorber for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Unfortunately, CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still show low efficiency due to high density of defects in solution-prepared CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films. Herein, three kinds of hydrazide derivatives (benzoyl hydrazine (BH), formohydrazide (FH) and benzamide (BA)) are designed to reduce the defect density and stabilize the phase of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Calculation and characterization results corroborate that the carboxyl and hydrazine groups in BH form strong chemical bonds with Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, resulting in synergetic double coordination. In addition, the hydrazine group in the BH also forms a hydrogen bond with iodine to assist the coordination. Consequently, a high efficiency of 20.47&#8201;% is achieved, which is the highest PCE among all pure CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based PSCs reported to date. In addition, an unencapsulated device showed excellent stability in ambient air.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermophoretic AND Gate Operation on Extracellular Vesicles Improves Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa). A one&#8208;step thermophoretic AND gate operation (Tango) assay for accurate identification of PCa&#8208;derived EVs directly in serum samples within 15&#8197;min is reported. The assay reached an overall accuracy of 91&#8201;% in discriminating PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a single&#8208;step format, showing great potential for rapid, non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of cancers.







Abstract
Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a valuable source of cancer biomarkers. However, the high degree of EV heterogeneity and the complexity of clinical samples pose a challenge in the sensitive identification of tumor&#8208;derived EVs. Here we introduce a one&#8208;step thermophoretic AND gate operation (Tango) assay that integrates polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;enhanced thermophoretic accumulation of EVs and simultaneous AND gate operation on EV membranes by dual&#8208;aptamers recognition. By using the Tango assay to detect tumor&#8208;derived EVs with co&#8208;presence of EpCAM and PSMA directly from serum in a homogeneous, separation&#8208;free format, we can discriminate prostate cancer (PCa) patients from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients in the diagnostic gray zone with an accuracy of 91&#8201;% in 15&#8197;min. Our approach streamlines EV enrichment and AND gate operation on EVs in a single assay, providing a rapid, straightforward, and powerful method for precise and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of cancer.

         <title>Revealing the Role of the Cyaphide Ion as a Bridging Ligand in Heterometallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero bi&#8208; and tri&#8208;metallic transition metal complexes featuring bridging cyaphide ions (C&#8801;P&#8722;) are reported. These were synthesized from reactions of Au(IDipp)(CP) with electron&#8208;rich, nucleophilic transition metal reagents. These studies suggest that the reactivity of Au(IDipp)(CP) is largely LUMO&#8208;driven and that it behaves as a metallo&#8208;phosphaalkyne.







Abstract
The synthesis of heterometallic transition metal complexes featuring bridging cyaphide ions (C&#8801;P&#8722;) is reported. These are synthesized from reactions of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) with electron&#8208;rich, nucleophilic transition metal reagents, affording Au(IDipp)(&#956;2&#8722;C&#8801;P)Ni(MeIiPr)2 (MeIiPr=1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and Au(IDipp)(&#956;2&#8722;C&#8801;P)Rh(Cp*)(PMe3). These studies reveal that, in contrast to the cyanide ion, bimetallic cyaphido complexes strongly favor a &#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2 coordination mode that maximizes the interaction of the second metal (Ni, Rh) with the &#960;&#8208;manifold of the ion (and not the phosphorus atom lone pair). End&#8208;on bridging can be effectively unlocked by blocking the &#960;&#8208;manifold, as demonstrated by reaction of Au(IDipp)(&#956;2&#8722;C&#8801;P)Rh(Cp*)(PMe3) with an electrophilic transition metal reagent, W(CO)5(THF), which affords the heterotrimetallic compound Au(IDipp)(&#956;3&#8722;C&#8801;P)[Rh(Cp*)(PMe3)][W(CO)5].

         <title>Reconfigurable Liquids Constructed by Pillar[6]arene&#8208;Based Nanoparticle Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation, assembly and jamming of a novel pillar[6]arene surfactant at the oil&#8211;water interface is presented. By taking advantage of the high binding energy of pillar[6]arene surfactant to the interface and dynamic host&#8211;guest interactions, reconfigurable all&#8208;liquid constructs with redox or guest&#8208;competitive responsiveness can be achieved.







Abstract
The interfacial jamming of nanoparticle surfactants offers the possibility of structuring liquids and fabricating all&#8208;liquid constructs with advanced functionality. However, less attention has been given to structured liquids with multiple responsiveness. Here, we show a novel, yet highly simplified nanoparticle surfactant model, pillar[6]arene (PA[6]) surfactant, by taking advantage of the host&#8211;guest interactions between a water&#8208;soluble PA[6] and an oil&#8208;soluble ligand, ferrocenium terminated polystyrene. PA[6] surfactants form rapidly at the oil&#8211;water interface, assemble into an elastic film with excellent mechanical strength, and when jammed, offer a &#8220;solid&#8208;like&#8221; assembly to lock&#8208;in highly nonequilibrium shapes of the liquids. The interfacial assembly/jamming and disassembly/unjamming of PA[6] surfactants can be controlled by chemical redox or competitive guest reagents, endowing the structured liquids with redox or guest&#8208;competitive responsiveness.

         <title>Working Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries at 80&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The working feasibility at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 100&#8201;&#176;C of zinc&#8211;air batteries is demonstrated in this work. The operation of zinc&#8211;air batteries under high&#8208;temperature working conditions is systemically investigated. The electrolyte conductivity, the cathode and anode kinetics, and the anode anti&#8208;passivation are optimized at high temperatures, whereas declined anode Faraday efficiency originating from strengthened HER serves as the main bottleneck.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries possess inherent safety and are especially commendable facing high&#8208;temperature working conditions. However, their working feasibility at high temperatures has seldom been investigated. Herein, the working feasibility of high&#8208;temperature zinc&#8211;air batteries is systemically investigated. The effects of temperature on air cathode, zinc anode, and aqueous electrolyte are decoupled to identify the favorable and unfavorable factors. Specifically, parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction strengthens at high temperatures and leads to declined anode Faraday efficiency, which is identified as the main bottleneck. Moreover, zinc&#8211;air batteries demonstrate cycling feasibility at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This work reveals the potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries to satisfy energy storage at high temperatures and guides further development of advanced batteries towards harsh working conditions.

         <title>Highly Distorted Antimony(III) Chloride [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; Dimers for Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence up to 1070&#8197;nm</title>

Three zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid antimony chlorines show unusual room&#8208;temperature near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissions. The maximum emission peak reaches 1070&#8197;nm for (C16H36P)SbCl4. Photoluminescence studies and density functional theory analysis suggest that the NIR luminescence originates from the highly localized self&#8208;trapped excitons that are confined in edge&#8208;shared [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers in the structures.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with unique compositional and structural tunability appear as an emerging class of luminescent materials, but near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters therein are largely unexplored to date. This study presents three novel 0D hybrid antimony chlorines with edge&#8208;sharing [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers, showing unusual room&#8208;temperature broadband NIR emission with the maximum emission wavelength up to 1070&#8197;nm. Photoluminescence studies and density functional theory calculation demonstrate that the emissions originate from the highly localized excitons, and that the confined [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers in these structures show low symmetry and a large degree of structural freedom. These hybrid antimony chlorines with [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers expand the range of new NIR materials in 0D metal halides.

         <title>Linear Nonalternant Isomers of Acenes Fusing Multiple Azulene Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular two&#8208;step [4+3] annulation approach to azulene units was developed starting from readily available aryl&#8208;substituted cyclopentadiene and ortho&#8208;haloaryl aldehyde by dehydration condensation followed by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H coupling. It facilitates the syntheses of four nonalternant isomers of pentacene and hexacene including DBA, BDA1, BDA2, and NDA which exhibit narrow band gaps and protonation&#8208;caused enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission.







Abstract
A modular approach to azulene building blocks was developed starting from readily available aryl&#8208;substituted cyclopentadiene and ortho&#8208;haloaryl aldehyde by dehydration condensation followed by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H coupling. It facilitates the synthesis of four nonalternant isomers of pentacene and hexacene, namely, dibenzo[e,g]azulene, benzo[1,2&#8208;f&#8201;:&#8201;5,4&#8208;f&#8242;]diazulene, benzo[1,2&#8208;f&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;f&#8242;]diazulene, and naphtho[2,3&#8208;f&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;f&#8242;]diazulene, which exhibit narrow band gaps with high stability in addition to protonation&#8208;caused enhanced near&#8208;infrared fluorescence. We discovered that in these isomers, i) constitutional isomerism influences significantly their photoelectric properties and ii) the elongation of the conjugation system does not necessarily lead to a narrowing in the band gap. Due to the easy modifiability of the nonazulene building blocks, this strategy can be extended to modularly prepare numerous multiazulene&#8208;fused aromatics.

         <title>Cis&#8211;Trans Reisomerization Precedes Reprotonation of the Retinal Chromophore in the Photocycle of Schizorhodopsin 4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocycle of a light&#8208;driven inward proton&#8208;pumping schizorhodopsin was characterized using time&#8208;resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy, which demonstrated that cis&#8211;trans reisomerization precedes reprotonation of the retinal chromophore. This has never been observed for the conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins. Notably, the unprecedented sequence provides insights into the mechanism of proton uptake to the chromophore during inward proton pumping.







Abstract
Recent discoveries of light&#8208;driven inward proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins have opened new avenues to exploring the mechanism of unidirectional transport because these proteins transport protons in the opposite direction to conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins, despite their similar protein structure and membrane topology. Schizorhodopsin (SzR) is a newly discovered rhodopsin family of light&#8208;driven inward proton pumps. Here, we report time&#8208;resolved resonance Raman spectra showing that cis&#8211;trans thermal reisomerization precedes reprotonation at the Schiff base of the retinal chromophore in the photocycle of SzR AM_5_00977. This sequence has not been observed for the photocycles of conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins, in which reisomerization follows reprotonation, and thus provides insights into the mechanism of proton uptake to the chromophore during inward proton pumping. The present findings are expected to contribute to controlling the direction of proton transport in engineered proteins.

         <title>Photostability and Dynamic Helical Behavior in Chiral Poly(phenylacetylene)s with a Preferred Screw&#8208;Sense</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photostability of poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) derivatives is closely linked to the dynamic helical behavior of the polyene scaffold. Quasi&#8208;static PPAs are stable under light exposure, while a photochemical electrocyclization is produced in dynamic PPAs.







Abstract
Helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) are interesting materials due to the possibility of tuning their helical scaffold (sense and elongation) once they have been prepared and by the presence of external stimuli. The main limitation in the application of PPAs is their poor photostability. These polymers degrade under visible light exposure through a photochemical electrocyclization process. In this work, it was demonstrated, through a selected example, how the photochemical degradation in PPAs is directly related to their dynamic helical behavior. Thus, while PPAs with dynamic helical structures show poor photostability under UV/Vis light exposure, poly&#8208;(R)&#8208;1, bearing an enantiopure sulfoxide group as pendant group and designed to have a quasi&#8208;static helical behavior, shows a large photostability due to the restricted conformational composition at the polyene backbone, needed to orient the conjugated double bonds prior to the photochemical electrocyclization process and the subsequent degradation of the material.

The first rhodium&#8208;diphosphine&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroformylation of cyclopropyl&#8208;functionalized trisubstituted alkenes to afford high&#8208;value chiral cyclopropyl entities is reported. Insights into this transformation were established by control, deuteroformylation, and gram&#8208;scale reactions (TON up to 1500). Versatile follow&#8208;up transformations to the corresponding alcohol, acid, esters and nitrile were also demonstrated.







Abstract
The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroformylation of cyclopropyl&#8208;functionalized trisubstituted alkenes affording useful chiral cyclopropyl entities is reported. Compared to generally used diphosphine ligands for asymmetric catalysis, the modified hybrid phosphorus ligand, named (R,S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Yanphos, can convert a series of readily available cyclopropyl&#8208;functionalized trisubstituted alkenes into high&#8208;value chiral cyclopropyl&#8208;functionalized aldehydes with high selectivities (81&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). Gram&#8208;scale reactions (TON up to 1500) and follow&#8208;up transformations to the corresponding alcohol, acid, esters and nitrile are also presented. Finally, a possible hydroformylation mechanism involving ring&#8208;open&#8208;hydroformylation pathways is proposed based on control and deuteroformylation reactions.

&lt;p&gt;The first rhodium-diphosphine-catalyzed highly chemo-, regio- and enantioselective hydroformylation of cyclopropyl-functionalized trisubstituted alkenes to afford high-value chiral cyclopropyl entities is reported.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first rhodium-catalyzed highly chemo-, regio- and enantioselective hydroformylation of cyclopropyl-functionalized trisubstituted alkenes affording useful chiral cyclopropyl entities is reported. Compared to generally used diphosphine ligands for asymmetric catalysis, the modified hybrid phosphorus ligand, named (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-DTBM-Yanphos, can convert a series of readily available cyclopropyl-functionalized trisubstituted alkenes into high-value chiral cyclopropyl-functionalized aldehydes with high selectivities (81&#8211;98&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). Gram-scale reactions (TON up to 1500) and follow-up transformations to the corresponding alcohol, acid, esters and nitrile are also presented. Finally, a possible hydroformylation mechanism involving ring-open-hydroformylation pathways is proposed based on control and deuteroformylation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Zn&#8208;Based Halides with Ultra&#8208;Long Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence for Time&#8208;Resolved Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new zero&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based metal halide with ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is reported. The RTP lifetimes can be facilely regulated via halide engineering, paving the way for designing spatial&#8208;time&#8208;dual&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.







Abstract
Though fluorescence&#8208;tag&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology has distinguished itself with cost&#8208;effective features and huge information loading capacity, the clonable decryption process of spatial&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting cannot meet the requirements for high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Herein, we demonstrate a spatial&#8208;time&#8208;dual&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting system based on new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halides BAPPZn2(ClyBr1&#8722;y)8 (BAPP=1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;ammoniopropyl)piperazinium, y=0&#8211;1) with ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Remarkably, the afterglow lifetime can be facilely tuned by regulating the halide&#8208;induced heavy&#8208;atom effect and can be identified by the naked eyes or with the help of a simple machine vision system. Therefore, the short&#8208;lived unicolor fluorescence and lasting&#8208;time&#8208;tunable RTP provide the prerequisites for unicolor&#8208;time&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting, which lowers the decryption&#8208;device requirements and further provides the design strategy of advanced portable anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

         <title>Biomacromolecule&#8208;Fueled Transient Volume Phase Transition of a Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial materials that perform work under out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions have attracted significant attention. A metabolic cycle&#8208;inspired hydrogel which exhibits the biomacromolecule&#8208;fueled transient volume phase transition was developed. The hydrogel was prepared by introducing two inherently connected functions that are affinity and digestive capacity for fuel. The system could also be exploited to realize the fuel&#8208;stimulated transient release of the payload.







Abstract
A metabolic cycle&#8208;inspired hydrogel which exhibits the biomacromolecule&#8208;fueled transient volume phase transition is reported. This hydrogel has the affinity and digestive capacity for a fuel &#945;&#8208;poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine by incorporating acrylic acid and trypsin. The hydrogel captured fuel and transiently shrank owing to the construction of electrostatic cross&#8208;linkages. This process was inherently connected with the digestion of these cross&#8208;linkages and the release of oligo&#8208;lysine as waste, which induced the reswelling of the hydrogel at equilibrium. The transient volume change of the hydrogel realized the fuel&#8208;stimulated transient release of a payload. This study provides a strategy for engineering materials with biomacromolecule&#8208;fueled dynamic functions under the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium condition.

         <title>Capture of Hydroxyl Radicals by Hydronium Cations in Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation and capture of hydroxyl radicals spontaneously generated at the air&#8211;water interface of water microdroplets in the form of OH&#8901;&#8722;H3O+ is reported.







Abstract
Despite the high stability of bulk water, water microdroplets possess strikingly different properties, such as the presence of hydroxyl radicals (OH&#8901;) at the air&#8211;water interface. Previous studies exhibited the recombination of OH&#8901; into H2O2 molecules and the capture of OH&#8901; by oxidizing other molecules. By spraying pure water microdroplets into a mass spectrometer, we detected OH&#8901; in the form of (H4O2)+ that is essentially OH&#8901;&#8722;H3O+, a hydroxyl radical combined with a hydronium cation through hydrogen bonding. We also successfully captured it with two OH&#8901; scavengers, caffeine and melatonin, and key oxidation radical intermediates that bear important mechanistic information were seen. It is suggested that some previous reactions involving (H4O2)+ should be attributed to reactions with OH&#8901;&#8722;H3O+ rather than with the water dimer cation (H2O&#8722;OH2)+.

         <title>An Oxazine&#8208;Based Fluorogenic Probe with Changeable &#960;&#8208;Conjugation to Eliminate False&#8208;Positive Interference of Albumin and Its Application to Sensing Aminopeptidase&#8197;N</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxazine&#8208;based fluorogenic probe with a changeable &#960;&#8208;conjugated system for sensing the enzyme aminopeptidase N was developed, which effectively eliminated the false&#8208;positive interference of albumin. The probe was used to detect the enzyme in cells, human serum and the mouse urine without the influence of albumin.







Abstract
Many fluorophores/probes suffer from the interference of albumin in biosystems. Herein, we propose an effective strategy to overcome this interference by virtue of both an albumin&#8208;insensitive fluorophore and its changeable &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and demonstrate the strategy by designing an oxazine&#8208;based fluorogenic probe for aminopeptidase&#8197;N (APN). The modification on the N atom in the oxazine fluorophore with alanine through a cleavable linker locks the resulting probe in a non&#8208;conjugated, colorless and non&#8208;fluorescent state, so the non&#8208;specific interaction of albumin produces no spectroscopic response. APN can selectively cleave the alanine moiety, restoring the large &#960;&#8208;conjugation and strong fluorescence. The capability of the probe to eliminate the albumin influence has been demonstrated by imaging APN in different cell lines, and by quantitatively determining APN in human serum and mouse urine. The present strategy may be useful for developing more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes.

         <title>Photouncaging of Carboxylic Acids from Cyanine Dyes with Near&#8208;Infrared Light

Photocages based on cyanine dyes that are accessible on multigram scale enable the efficient delivery and release of carboxylic acids in live cells using tissue&#8208;penetrating near&#8208;infrared light. The photouncaging process was examined by using several techniques, with the findings suggesting a photooxidative pathway.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light (NIR; 650&#8211;900&#8197;nm) offers unparalleled advantages as a biocompatible stimulus. The development of photocages that operate in this region represents a fundamental challenge due to the low energy of the excitation light. Herein, we repurpose cyanine dyes into photocages that are available on a multigram scale in three steps and efficiently release carboxylic acids in aqueous media upon irradiation with NIR light up to 820&#8197;nm. The photouncaging process is examined using several techniques, providing evidence that it proceeds via photooxidative pathway. We demonstrate the practical utility in live HeLa cells by delivery and release of the carboxylic acid cargo, that was otherwise not uptaken by cells in its free form. In combination with modularity of the cyanine scaffold, the realization of these accessible photocages will fully unleash the potential of the emerging field of NIR&#8208;photoactivation and facilitate its widespread adoption outside the photochemistry community.

         <title>Selective Reduction of Secondary Amides to Imines Catalysed by Schwartz's Reagent
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mild and selective catalytic reduction of secondary amides to imines was achieved using the classical organometallic reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl (Schwartz's reagent) as a catalyst. This approach avoids overreduction of the imines to amines and utilises hydrosilanes to enable catalyst turnover and control the reactivity.







Abstract
The partial reduction of amides is a challenging transformation that must overcome the intrinsic stability of the amide bond and exhibit high chemoselective control to avoid overreduction to amine products. To address this challenge, we describe a zirconium&#8208;catalysed synthesis of imines by the reductive deoxygenation of secondary amides. This reaction exploits the excellent chemoselectivity of Schwartz's reagent (Cp2Zr(H)Cl) and utilises (EtO)3SiH as a mild stoichiometric reductant to enable catalyst turnover. The reaction generally proceeds with high yields (19 examples, 51 to 95&#8201;% yield) and tolerates a variety of functional groups (alkene, ester, nitro, etc.). Stoichiometric mechanistic investigations suggest the regeneration of the active [Zr]&#8722;H catalyst is achieved through the metathesis of Si&#8722;H and Zr&#8722;OR &#963;&#8208;bonds.

         <title>In Situ Periodic Regeneration of Catalyst during CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;in situ periodic regeneration of catalyst (PR&#8208;C)&#8221; strategy is proposed to maintain the high efficiency of CO2 electroreduction towards C2+ products over a copper catalyst. A positive potential pulse is applied periodically for a short time in the halide&#8208;containing electrolyte. As a result the surface structure and oxidation state of the Cu could be recovered periodically by the PR&#8208;C method.







Abstract
Developing electrocatalytic reactions with high&#8208;efficiency can make important contributions to carbon neutrality. However, poor long&#8208;term stability of catalysts is a bottleneck for its practical application. Herein, an &#8220;in situ periodic regeneration of catalyst (PR&#8208;C)&#8221; strategy is proposed to give long&#8208;term high efficiency of CO2 electroreduction to generate C2+ products over Cu catalyst by applying a positive potential pulse for a short time periodically in the halide&#8208;containing electrolyte. The high Faradaic efficiency (81.2&#8201;%) and current density (22.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) could be maintained completely at least 36&#8197;h, while the activity and selectivity decreased continuously without using the PR&#8208;C method. Control experiments and operando characterization demonstrated that the surface structure and oxidation state of Cu could be recovered periodically by the PR&#8208;C method, which was beneficial for CO2 activation and C&#8722;C coupling.

         <dc:description>
A novel germinal N,N&#8208;bis(silylenyl)aniline 1 degrades white phosphorus (P4) furnishing the first isolable 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208; diphosphapyrrole 2. The latter further reacts readily with P4 and 1 to afford the polycyclic Si=P&#8208;containing species 3 or the unprecedented conjugated Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8722;Si=NPh chain&#8208;containing compound 4 depending on the molar ratio of the reactants. Moreover, the products 3 and 4 can be converted into each other when treated with 1 and P4, respectively.







Abstract
White phosphorus (P4) undergoes degradation to P2 moieties if exposed to the new N,N&#8208;bis(silylenyl)aniline PhNSi2 1 (Si=Si[N(tBu)]2CPh), furnishing the first isolable 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;diphosphapyrrole 2 and the two novel functionalized Si=P doubly bonded compounds 3 and 4. The pathways for the transformation of the non&#8208;aromatic 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;diphosphapyrrole PhNSi2P2 2 into 3 and 4 could be uncovered. It became evident that 2 reacts readily with both reactants P4 and 1 to afford either the polycyclic Si=P&#8208;containing product [PhNSi2P2]2P2 3 or the unprecedented conjugated Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8722;Si=NPh chain&#8208;containing compound 4, depending on the employed molar ratio of 1 and P4 as well as the reaction conditions. Compounds 3 and 4 can be converted into each other by reactions with 1 and P4, respectively. All new compounds 1&#8211;4 were unequivocally characterized including by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In addition, the electronic structures of 2&#8211;4 were established by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White phosphorus (P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) undergoes degradation to P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moieties if exposed to the new &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-bis(silylenyl)aniline PhN&lt;b&gt;Si&lt;/b&gt;

         <title>Fully Conjugated Poly(phthalocyanine) Scaffolds Derived from a Mechanochemical Approach Towards Enhanced Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemistry&#8208;driven approach was developed to afford fully conjugated poly(phthalocyanine (Pc)) scaffolds under neat and ambient conditions, by leveraging the on&#8208;surface polymerization of ortho&#8208;positioned dicyano groups in the presence of metal catalysts. The as&#8208;afforded scaffolds were featured by fully conjugated skeleton, abundant Pc linkages, and permanent porosity, providing them with attractive performance in energy storage.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines (Pc)&#8208;derived materials represent an attractive category of porous organic scaffolds featured by extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks, but their construction is still limited to the solution&#8208;based pathways, producing materials with inferior conductivity and porosity. Herein, a mechanochemistry&#8208;driven approach was developed leveraging the on&#8208;surface polymerization of aromatic nitrile monomers with ortho&#8208;positioned dicyano groups in the presence of metal catalysts (magnesium, zinc, or aluminum) under neat and ambient conditions. Diverse Pc&#8208;functionalized conjugated porous networks (Pc&#8208;CPNs) were obtained featured by extensively and fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons, high surface areas, and hierarchical porosities. The monomers in this mechanochemical approach could be extended to those difficult to be handled in solution&#8208;based procedures. The Pc&#8208;CPNs displayed attractive electrochemical performance as supercapacitor and anodes in batteries, together with superb long&#8208;term stability.

         <dc:description>
A CuI&#8208;phosphine catalytic system activates 1,1&#8208;diborylalkenes stereoselectively. The energetically preferred formation of (Z)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;borylalkenyl copper (I) species and the subsequent coupling reaction with allyl bromides allow the exclusive formation of (Z)&#8208;skipped dienes. This new methodology is applicable to various 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolboryl)alkenes which can be efficiently coupled with different type of allyl halides. The (Z)&#8208;skipped dienes with bromide functionality are treated with NaOtBu to promote cyclization/aromatization patterns via enyne intermediates.

         <title>Chemical Investigations of Differentially Oxidized Polycylic Pyrroles from Bipolaris Fungi: Synthetic Entry Into the Bipolamine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial alkaloids from Bipolaris Fungi represent notable challenges to the field of chemical synthesis owing to their reactive, electron&#8208;rich bispyrrole architectures. Herein we explore the chemical reactivity of this unusual alkaloid framework resulting in the total synthesis of bipolamines D, E, G, and I and a discussion surrounding possible biosynthetic relationships within this family.







Abstract
indolizidine alkaloids of unusual biosynthetic origin have recently been characterized from several species of fungi within the Pleosporaceae family. Possessing distinct polycyclic architectures with two embedded electron&#8208;rich pyrroles as well as reported antibacterial activity against gram positive and negative pathogens, these natural products represent attractive targets for total synthesis. Herein we survey the differential functionalization of a chemically sensitive bispyrrole framework resulting in the preparation of multiple bipolamine alkaloids, work which sheds light on their innate chemical reactivity and potential biosynthetic relationships.

         <title>Intrinsic Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Activate the In&#8197;Situ Synthesis of Trimethine Cyanines in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethine cyanines are synthesized from precursors, assisted by visible light, free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reaction can proceed in&#8197;situ in live cells. The correlation of cyanine expression with the intrinsic cellular ROS production level causes more efficient cyanine production in the cancer cells. The study bridges ROS&#8208;activated in&#8208;cell synthetic chemistry and cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Environment&#8208;responsive in situ synthesis of molecular fluorescent dyes is challenging. Herein, we develop a photoextension strategy to make trimethine cyanines with decent conversion efficiency (up to 81&#8201;%) using 1&#8208;butyl 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl 3H&#8208;indole derivatives as the sole precursors, and demonstrate a free radical mechanism. In the inducer&#8208;extension stage, free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were able to mediate similar reactions with no assistance of light. We explored a Mito&#8208;extension strategy to in situ synthesize trimethine cyanines in the living cells. The cellular ROS&#8208;dependence provided a foundation for preferential cyanine expression in cancer cells. Finally, we applied an iodized precursor as an intrinsic ROS&#8208;activated theranostic agent that integrated mitochondria&#8208;targeted cyanine synthesis, cell imaging and phototherapy.

         <title>Pincer&#8208;Supported Perfluororhodacyclopentanes: High Nucleophilicity of the M&#8722;CF Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by a PBP&#8208;pincer ligand was synthesized. The Rh&#8722;CF bond showed high reactivity toward hydrogenolysis, iodinolysis and protonolysis thanks to the strong &#963;&#8208;donation from the boryl group.







Abstract
Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by PBP pincer ligand PBP&#8208;RhIII(CF2)4 (2) was prepared from PBP&#8208;RhI&#8208;PPh3 (1) and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE). By scXRD analysis, it was revealed that the Rh&#8722;CF bond trans to the boryl ligand was largely elongated compared to the one in the apical position. Although M&#8722;CF bonds of perfluorometallacyclopentanes are known to be very stable, 2 shows high reactivity toward hydrogenolysis, iodinolysis and protonolysis, thanks to the strong trans&#8208;effect of the highly &#963;&#8208;donating boryl ligand. Analogous PCP pincer complex PCP&#8722;RhIII(CF2)4 (4) showed slower reaction rate both in oxidative cyclization with TFE and hydrogenolysis of Rh&#8722;CF bond. Catalytic production of 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4&#8208;octafluorobutane from two TFE and hydrogen in one pot was achieved via repetitive oxidative cyclization of TFE and Rh followed by the hydrogenolysis of Rh&#8722;CF bonds. This report demonstrates the possible application of PBP&#8208;pincer skeleton to the preparation of fluorinated compounds from TFE.

         <title>Multifunctional Charge and Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Effects of Second&#8208;Sphere Imidazolium Pendants Promote Capture and Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Water Catalyzed by Iron Porphyrins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron porphyrins decorated with imidazolium (im) pendants enable the disentangling of second&#8208;sphere contributions that stem from through&#8208;space charge and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Charge effects are the dominant contributor to observed improvements in CO2 conversion with hydrogen bonding effects augmenting CO2 capture affinity, resulting effective homogeneous electrocatalytic CO2RR in water.







Abstract
Microenvironments tailored by multifunctional secondary coordination sphere groups can enhance catalytic performance at primary metal active sites in natural systems. Here, we capture this biological concept in synthetic systems by developing a family of iron porphyrins decorated with imidazolium (im) pendants for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which promotes multiple synergistic effects to enhance CO2RR and enables the disentangling of second&#8208;sphere contributions that stem from each type of interaction. Fe&#8208;ortho&#8208;im(H), which poises imidazolium units featuring both positive charge and hydrogen&#8208;bond capabilities proximal to the active iron center, increases CO2 binding affinity by 25&#8208;fold and CO2RR activity by 2000&#8208;fold relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe&#8208;TPP). Comparison with monofunctional analogs reveals that through&#8208;space charge effects have a greater impact on catalytic CO2RR performance compared to hydrogen bonding in this context.

         <title>Temperature Dependent Properties of the Aqueous Electron

         <dc:description>
Ab&#8197;initio molecular dynamics simulations of the aqueous electron in various thermodynamic conditions at the accuracy of hybrid functional electronic structure theory. This work reveals that the red shift of the absorption maximum results from an increasing gyration radius with temperature.







Abstract
The temperature&#8208;dependent properties of the aqueous electron have been extensively studied using mixed quantum&#8208;classical simulations in a wide range of thermodynamic conditions based on one&#8208;electron pseudopotentials. While the cavity model appears to explain most of the physical properties of the aqueous electron, only a non&#8208;cavity model has so far been successful in accounting for the temperature dependence of the absorption spectrum. Here, we present an accurate and efficient description of the aqueous electron under various thermodynamic conditions by combining hybrid functional&#8208;based molecular dynamics, machine learning techniques, and multiple time&#8208;step methods. Our advanced simulations accurately describe the temperature dependence of the absorption maximum in the presence of cavity formation. Specifically, our work reveals that the red shift of the absorption maximum results from an increasing gyration radius with temperature, rather than from global density variations as previously suggested.

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)&#8208;Targeting DNA Nanodevice for Autophagy&#8208;Dependent Degradation of Proteins in Membrane&#8208;Bound Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new targeted protein degradation (TPD) system composed of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting DNA nanostructure carrying protein binding ligands is developed for proteins in membrane&#8208;bound organelles. It works with the guidance of artificial membrane receptors. The targeted proteins in ERs are degraded via an autophagy&#8208;dependent pathway. This nanosystem compensates the deficiency of current TPD strategies and may contribute to future cancer therapeutics.







Abstract
Targeted protein degradation via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways is a promising therapeutic approach, and proteins in cytoplasm or on the cell membrane can be easily contacted and have become the major targets. However, degradation of disease&#8208;related proteins that exist in membrane&#8208;bound organelles (MBO) such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains unsolved due to the membrane limits. Here we describe a DNA nanodevice that shows ER targeting capacity and undergoes new intracellular degradation via the autophagy&#8208;dependent pathway. Then the DNA nanostructure functionalized with specific ligands is used to selectively catch ER&#8208;localized proteins and then transport them to the lysosome for degradation. Through this technique, the degradation of both exogenous ER&#8208;resident protein (ER&#8208;eGFP) and endogenous overexpressed molecular chaperone (glucose&#8208;regulated protein 78) in cancer cells has been successfully executed with high efficiency.

         <title>Homologous and Heterologous Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization from Exclusively Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achiral C3&#8208;symmetric monomers have been used to build chiral supramolecular polymer architectures by a symmetry&#8208;breaking process in a vortex. Subsequently, the polymers can take the role of chiral seeds to control the ensuing homologous or heterologous chiral supramolecular polymerization.







Abstract
Among the enticing issues of chiral origins are: how chirality is born from the initial achiral units and the mechanisms for the transfer of chiral information. In this work, by combining a physical vortex and chiral seeds, a general process is revealed to generate chiral supramolecular polymers from achiral C3&#8208;symmetric molecules. The symmetry&#8208;broken assemblies from the achiral molecules could work as chiral seeds to initiate the polymerization of either homologous or heterologous achiral monomers. Concomitantly, the fragmentation of the polymer caused by the vortex during the nucleation&#8208;elongation stages is shown to enlarge the domains of the chiral nuclei and then guide the polymer to grow into the predominant helicity with a high reactivity ratio. Moreover, the chiral structural information can be stored in different forms of assemblies. These new polymerization modes will provide guidance for the preparation of chiral materials.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization and C&#8722;C Bond Activation to Access Non&#8208;canonical Tricyclic Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic Fe&#8722;NO complex catalyses the cycloisomerization of cyclopropyl enyne to fused non&#8208;canonical cyclobutanes with up to four consecutive stereocenters with exclusive diastereoselectivity. Only Ag(+I)&#8208;was found to show comparable activity, albeit significantly lower reactivity.







Abstract
Cycloisomerizations are powerful skeletal rearrangements that allow the construction of complex molecular architectures in an atom&#8208;economic way. We present here an unusual type of cyclopropyl enyne cycloisomerization that couples the process of a cycloisomerization with the activation of a C&#8722;C bond in cyclopropanes. A set of substituted non&#8208;canonical tricyclic cyclobutanes were synthesized under mild conditions using [(Ph3P)2Fe(CO)(NO)]BF4 as catalyst in good to excellent yields with high levels of stereocontrol.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of a &#963;&#8208;Donating Ni0&#8208;Stabilized Silyliumylidene Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a silyliumylidene cation complex stabilized by a Ni0&#8208;based donating ligand is reported. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that the highly electrophilic SiII center is stabilized by a dative Ni&#8594;Si &#963;&#8208;interaction and &#960;&#8208;donations from the amino&#8208; and Ni&#8208;moieties. Due to the energetically close frontier orbitals localized on Si and Ni atoms, this silyliumylidene complex presents competitive reactivity at Si and Ni sites.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Imaging of Sterculic Acid&#8212;a Naturally Occurring 1,2&#8208;Cyclopropene Fatty Acid&#8212;by Bioorthogonal Reaction with Turn&#8208;On Tetrazine&#8208;Fluorophore Conjugates

This paper describes the use of a cyclopropene&#8208;containing oleic acid analogue for studying live cell lipid uptake by dendritic cells. The minimal oleic acid analogue is incorporated into membranes and lipoproteins, which can be studied by live cell microscopy and lipoproteomics.







Abstract
In the field of lipid research, bioorthogonal chemistry has made the study of lipid uptake and processing in living systems possible, whilst minimising biological properties arising from detectable pendant groups. To allow the study of unsaturated free fatty acids in live cells, we here report the use of sterculic acid, a 1,2&#8208;cyclopropene&#8208;containing oleic acid analogue, as a bioorthogonal probe. We show that this lipid can be readily taken up by dendritic cells without toxic side effects, and that it can subsequently be visualised using an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with quenched tetrazine&#8208;fluorophore conjugates. In addition, the lipid can be used to identify changes in protein oleoylation after immune cell activation. Finally, this reaction can be integrated into a multiplexed bioorthogonal reaction workflow by combining it with two sequential copper&#8208;catalysed Huisgen ligation reactions. This allows for the study of multiple biomolecules in the cell simultaneously by multimodal confocal imaging.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Functionalized Quinolines by Direct Conversion of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of quinolines synthesis from a major lignin motif by a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction is reported in yields of up to 89&#8201;%. The reaction path involves selective C&#8722;O bond cleavage, dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, and C&#8722;N bond formation along with heterocyclic aromatic ring construction. This transformation provides a new example for the application of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 segments in the construction of N&#8208;heterocyclic aromatic compounds, thus offering a petroleum&#8208;independent path to heterocyclic aromatic chemicals.







Abstract
Direct production of heterocyclic aromatic compounds from lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 models remains a huge challenge due to the incompatible catalysis for aryl ether bonds cleavage and heterocyclic ring formation. Herein, the first example of quinoline synthesis from &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds by a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction is reported in yields up to 89&#8201;%. The reaction pathway involves selective cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds, dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, C&#8722;N bond formation along with heterocyclic aromatic ring construction. The control experiments suggest that both imine and chalcone were identified as the key intermediates, and the rate determining step as well as the preferred pathway were experimentally clarified and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on this protocol, the conversion of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 polymer delivered 56&#8197;wt&#8201;% yield of quinoline derivative in three steps. This transformation provides a potential petroleum&#8208;independent choice for heterocyclic aromatic chemicals.

         <title>Enabling Sustainable Chemistry with Ionic Liquids and Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Fad or the Future?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) continue to generate interest within and beyond the chemistry community. Their property tunability through a rational selection of precursors, including bioderived ones, provides a strategy to ameliorate toxicity, lower cost, and endow new functions for sustainable chemistry. This Review discusses whether ILs and DESs are sustainable solvents and how they contribute to sustainable chemical processes.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) debuted with a promise of a superior sustainability footprint due to their low vapor pressure. However, their toxicity and high cost compromise this footprint, impeding their real&#8208;world applications. Fortunately, their property tunability through a rational selection of precursors, including bioderived ones, provides a strategy to ameliorate toxicity, lower cost, and endow new functions. This Review discusses whether ILs and DESs are sustainable solvents and how they contribute to sustainable chemical processes.

Thermochromic phosphors are intriguing materials for realizing thermochromic behaviors of light&#8208;emitting diodes. Here a highly luminescent and stable thermochromic phosphor based on one&#8208;dimensional Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 is reported. This unique ionic copper&#8208;iodine chain&#8208;based hybrid exhibits near&#8208;unity photoluminescence efficiency owing to the through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer character of relevant electronic transitions. More importantly, an alternative mechanism of thermochromic phosphorescence was unraveled, supported by a first principles simulation of concerted copper atom migration in the copper&#8208;iodine chain. Furthermore, we successfully fabricate a bright thermochromic light&#8208;emitting diode using this Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 thermochromic phosphor. Our reported flexible ionic copper&#8208;iodine chain&#8208;based thermochromic luminescent material represents a new type of cost&#8208;effective functional phosphor.

         <title>Stable Monodisperse Pb1&#8722;xCdxS Quantum Dots for NIR&#8208;II Bioimaging by Aqueous Coprecipitation of Bimetallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly monodisperse and stable Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs are prepared by a simple aqueous method with Pb4&#8722;nCdnO4 clusters as building blocks. They emit at 1100&#8197;nm in the NIR&#8208;II window with 17.72&#8201;% PLQY in water. Fine lymphography, angiography and dual&#8208;channel bioimaging at low power density (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) excitation can be successfully achieved by using these ternary QDs. The excellent stability makes this material very competitive in practical applications.







Abstract
Aqueous lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) synthesized by traditional methods are unstable, so that they are usually coated with cadmium sulfide (CdS) to prevent oxidation, which are complicated and not satisfactory for mass production. Here, stable ternary Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs were synthesized by in situ coprecipitation of Pb4&#8722;nCdnO4 bimetallic clusters in an aqueous solution, which possess a uniform size of 4.0&#177;0.2&#8197;nm and the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission at 1100&#8197;nm with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 17.72&#8201;%. Stored at 4&#8201;&#176;C and in colloidal form, the PLQY of Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs remained at 90.9&#8201;% of the initial value after 15&#8197;days, while stored as powder, the spectra did not change after 5&#8197;months. The high PLQY and good water compatibility of Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs provide a good performance in vivo vasculature imaging and lymphatic system imaging at a very low power density (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in the NIR&#8208;II window.

         <title>Sp&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen as New Anchoring Sites of Iron Single Atoms to Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the specific structure of graphdiyne (GDY), an atomic Fe catalyst anchored by sp&#8208;N was designed and synthesized, which tailored the electronic structure of Fe and thus changed the binding energy between Fe centers and intermediate species in the ORR process. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY) exhibited excellent oxygen reduction performance and achieved long&#8208;term stability in the assembled zinc&#8211;air battery.







Abstract
Carbon supported single&#8208;atom catalysts with metal&#8208;Nx configuration are considered as one of the most efficient catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, most of the metal&#8208;Nx active sites are composed by pyridinic N at the defect locations of graphene&#8208;like supports. Here, we employ graphdiyne (GDY) as a new carbon substrate to synthesize an iron (Fe) single atom catalyst (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY), showing excellent catalytic performance. Benefitting from the abundant acetylenic bonds in GDY, sp&#8208;N anchored metal atoms are created without forming defects. The sp&#8208;N and OH ligands regulate the electronic structure of Fe atoms and optimize the adsorption energy of ORR intermediates on the active sites by reducing the electron local density of Fe atoms, which accelerates the reaction kinetics and promotes the ORR activity of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY. Furthermore, the practical application of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY is corroborated by its high power density and long&#8208;term performance via assembling a zinc&#8211;air battery.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Disulfide Exchange as a Route for Endosomal Escape of Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric nanogels with judiciously placed disulfide bonds have been synthesized and tested for cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Comparison with their non&#8208;disulfide counterparts show that disulfide moieties play a key role in endosomal escape.







Abstract
Endosomal entrapment has remained the major bottleneck for cytosolic delivery of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems. Uncovering fundamentally new pathways for endosomal escape is therefore highly sought. Herein, we report that disulfide bonds can enhance endosomal escape through contacts with cellular exofacial thiols, in addition to facilitating cellular uptake. Our results are supported through comparative analysis of polymeric nanogels with variable accessibility to disulfide bonds by placing these functionalities at the core or the shell of the nanogels. The findings here inform future chemical design of delivery vehicles.

         <title>The Heaviest Bottleable Metallylone: Synthesis of a Monatomic, Zero&#8208;Valent Lead Complex (&#8220;Plumbylone&#8221;)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive plumbylone {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0} stabilized by a bis(silylene)xanthene chelating ligand, [SiII(Xant)SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si(Xant)Si(NtBu)2CPh], and its isolable carbonyl iron complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0Fe(CO)4} are reported. The latter can insert the PbFe(CO)4 moiety into a Rh&#8722;Cl bond to give a RhPbClFe(CO)4 complex.







Abstract
The elusive plumbylone {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0} 3 stabilized by the bis(silylene)xanthene chelating ligand 1, [SiII(Xant)SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si(Xant)Si(NtBu)2CPh], and its isolable carbonyl iron complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0Fe(CO)4} 4 are reported. The compounds 3 and 4 were obtained stepwise via reduction of the lead(II) dibromide complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]PbBr2} 2, prepared from the bis(silylene)xanthene 1 and PbBr2, employing potassium naphthalenide and K2Fe(CO)4, respectively. While the genuine plumbylone 3 is rather labile even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, its Pb0&#8594;Fe(CO)4 complex 4 turned out to be relatively stable and bottleable. However, solutions of 4 decompose readily to elemental Pb and {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Fe(CO)3} 5 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Reaction of 4 with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 leads to the formation of the unusual dimeric [(OC)2RhPb(Cl)Fe(CO)4] complex 6 with trimetallic Rh&#8722;Pb&#8722;Fe bonds. The molecular and electronic structures of 3 and 4 were established by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

&lt;p&gt;The elusive plumbylone {[Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Xant)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;]Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;} stabilized by a bis(silylene)xanthene chelating ligand, [Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Xant)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;=PhC(N&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si(Xant)Si(N&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CPh], and its isolable carbonyl iron complex {[Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Xant)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;]Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} are reported.

&lt;p&gt;The elusive plumbylone {[Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Xant)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;]Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;} &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; stabilized by the bis(silylene)xanthene chelating ligand &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, [Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Xant)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;=PhC(N&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si(Xant)Si(N&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CPh], and its isolable carbonyl iron complex {[Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Xant)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;]Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; are reported. The compounds &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; were obtained stepwise via reduction of the lead(II) dibromide complex {[Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Xant)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;]PbBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, prepared from the bis(silylene)xanthene &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and PbBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, employing potassium naphthalenide and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. While the genuine plumbylone &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is rather labile even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, its Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complex &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; turned out to be relatively stable and bottleable. However, solutions of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; decompose readily to elemental Pb and {[Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Xant)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;]Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Reaction of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with [Rh(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to the formation of the unusual dimeric [(OC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RhPb(Cl)Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] complex &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; with trimetallic Rh&#8722;Pb&#8722;Fe bonds. The molecular and electronic structures of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; were established by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Interfacial Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Moieties in Turbostratic Carbon for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8722;N&#8722;C configurations is fabricated by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid, which is directly applied for HO2&#8722; synthesis in alkaline media through an O2 reduction reaction. Based on the combined spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8722;N moieties and HO2&#8722; selectivity is established.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) provides a green route for decentralized H2O2 synthesis, where a structure&#8211;selectivity relationship is pivotal for the control of a highly selective and active two&#8208;electron pathway. Here, we report the fabrication of a boron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8722;N&#8722;C configurations (CNB&#8208;ZIL) by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production. Combined spectroscopic analysis reveals a fine tailored B&#8722;N moiety in CNB&#8208;ZIL, where interfacial B&#8722;N species in a homogeneous distribution tend to segregate into hexagonal boron nitride domains at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Based on the experimental observations, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8722;N moieties and HO2&#8722; selectivity is established. The CNB&#8208;ZIL electrocatalysts with optimal interfacial B&#8722;N moieties exhibit a high HO2&#8722; selectivity with small overpotentials in alkaline media, giving a HO2&#8722; yield of &#8776;1787&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V in a flow&#8208;cell reactor.

         <title>A Cathode Interface Layer Based on 4,5,9,10&#8208;Pyrene Diimide for Highly Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel self&#8208;doped molecules named t&#8208;PyDIN, t&#8208;PyDINO and t&#8208;PyDINBr are developed as cathode interfacial materials for OSCs. The devices based on t&#8208;PyDINBr and t&#8208;PyDINO exhibit PCEs of 17.24&#8201;% and 17.56&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the device based on t&#8208;PyDIN even reached a PCE of 18.25&#8201;%, which is improved by 51.3&#8201;% compared with that of the device without a cathode interfacial layer. This result is among the best efficiencies reported to date.







Abstract
Efficient cathode interfacial layers (CILs) are becoming essential elements for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the absorption of commonly used cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) is either too weak or overlaps too much with that of photoactive materials, hindering their contribution to the light absorption. In this work, we demonstrate the construction of highly efficient CIMs based on 2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene diimide (t&#8208;PyDI) framework. By introducing amino, amino N&#8208;oxide and quaternary ammonium bromide as functional groups, three novel self&#8208;doped CIMs named t&#8208;PyDIN, t&#8208;PyDINO and t&#8208;PyDINBr are synthesized. These CIMs are capable of boosting the device performances by broadening the absorption, forming ohmic contact at the interface of active layer and electrode, as well as facilitating electron collection. Notably, the device based on t&#8208;PyDIN achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.25&#8201;%, which is among the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs.

         <title>Periphery&#8208;Core Strategy to Access a Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecule Bearing Multiple Heteroatoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bowl&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with up to four sulfur atoms and two embedded B&#8722;N bonds has been synthesized by a periphery&#8208;core strategy, whereby the bottom of the bowl is closed in the final step. The incorporation of sulfur and nitrogen atoms enriches the electronic density of the buckybowl and results in a strong intermolecular interaction with C60 fullerene.







Abstract
Most of the bowl&#8208;shaped molecules are synthesized via a core&#8208;periphery strategy with the bowl rim closed at the final stage. However, the construction of heteroatom&#8208;doped buckybowls by the periphery&#8208;core method with the bowl bottom sealed by inserting new atoms in the last step is quite limited. Herein we report the synthesis of a bowl&#8208;shaped compound containing four sulfur atoms and two embedded N&#8722;B bonds with the ratio of carbon atom and heteroatom as low as four through a periphery&#8208;core strategy. Crystallographic analysis confirms the formation of a bowl&#8208;shaped structure. The multiple heteroatoms alter the molecular electronic structure, thus resulting in the distinct aromaticity when compared with its all&#8208;carbon congener. The electron&#8208;rich buckybowl shows a strong interaction with the electron&#8208;deficient fullerene C60 by forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex in toluene.

         <title>A Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe with a Reversible Response to Hydrogen Sulfide and Hydroxyl Radicals for Dynamic Imaging of Liver Inflammation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe is designed, which shows a reversible switch in the PA ratio (PA690/PA825) in response to the redox cycle between &#8901;OH and H2S. The probe allows the non&#8208;invasive and dynamic imaging of the redox fluctuation in mice during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced liver inflammation and the subsequent N&#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC)&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;inflammation process.







Abstract
Reversible imaging probes that allow for the dynamic visualization of the redox cycle between hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are vital to probe the redox imbalance&#8208;involved pathological process in vivo. Herein, we report a reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging nanoprobe (1&#8208;PAIN) for the real&#8208;time imaging of &#8901;OH/H2S redox cycle in vivo. 1&#8208;PAIN displays a low PA ratio between 690 and 825&#8197;nm (PA690/PA825), which significantly increases by &#8776;5&#8208;fold upon oxidation by &#8901;OH, and is switched back to the initially low PA690/PA825 value upon reduction by H2S. 1&#8208;PAIN could dynamically report on the hepatic &#8901;OH production in mice during the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced liver inflammation process, and visualize hepatic H2S generation during the N&#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC)&#8208;induced anti&#8208;inflammation process. 1&#8208;PAIN can act as a useful tool to probe the redox state in living biology, beneficial for the study of redox imbalance&#8208;related diseases.

     alt="A Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe with a Reversible Response to Hydrogen Sulfide and Hydroxyl Radicals for Dynamic Imaging of Liver Inflammation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe is designed, which shows a reversible switch in the PA ratio (PA&lt;sub&gt;690&lt;/sub&gt;/PA&lt;sub&gt;825&lt;/sub&gt;) in response to the redox cycle between &#8901;OH and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. The probe allows the non-invasive and dynamic imaging of the redox fluctuation in mice during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver inflammation and the subsequent &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl cysteine (NAC)-mediated anti-inflammation process.

         <title>A Desilylative Approach to Alkyl Substituted C(1)&#8208;Ammonium Enolates: Application in Enantioselective [2+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic generation of unsubstituted and alkyl substituted C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates from &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted carboxylic acids using the isothiourea HyperBTM has been developed and applied in enantioselective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic generation of C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted carboxylic acids using the isothiourea HyperBTM is reported. This desilylative approach grants access to &#945;&#8208;unsubstituted and &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates, which are typically difficult to access through traditional methods reliant upon deprotonation. The scope and limitations of this process is established in enantioselective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition processes with perfluoroalkylketones (31 examples, up to 96&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er), as well as selective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with trifluoromethyl enones (4 examples, up to 75&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er). Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate this process proceeds through an initial kinetic resolution of an in situ prepared (&#177;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted anhydride, while the reaction process exhibits overall pseudo zero&#8208;order kinetics.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable templated polymerization is reported by Bas&#8197;G.&#8197;P. van&#8197;Ravensteijn, Ilja&#8197;K. Voets et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202206780), as illustrated in the cover picture. The green and grey sections represent the high (green) and low (grey) pH conditions under which the template is switched OFF and ON, respectively. In the OFF state, monomers and growing polymers are not attracted to the template, preventing any monomer conversion. In the ON state, monomers are drawn to the template, facilitating their polymerization. The forming polymers and templates assemble into micellar structures, of which one is highlighted in the middle of the cover.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alstonlarsine A (1), a monoterpenoid indole alkaloid possessing a unique pentacyclic skeleton as well as a rare biological activity, is achieved. The key step is an efficient domino sequence, comprising enamine formation followed by an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand intramolecular dearomative Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition for the construction of 9&#8208;azatricyclo[4.3.1.03,8]decane core. The key intermediate for this domino sequence was synthesized by a newly developed methodology, relying on indole C(2)&#8208;H bond functionalization, combined with intramolecular Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction. This tactical combination offers a new general entry into other (privileged) tricyclic frameworks possessing indole ring fused to 6&#8208;, 7&#8208; or 8&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Autonomous Chiral Microswimmers with Self&#8208;mixing Capabilities for Highly Efficient Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chiral catalysts plays a very important role in various areas of chemical science. Heterogeneous catalysts have the general advantage of allowing a more straightforward separation from the products. One specific case of heterogeneous catalysis is electrocatalysis, being potentially a green chemistry approach. However, a typical drawback is that the redox conversion of molecules occurs only at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and not in the bulk of the electrolyte. The second limitation is that the electrodes have to be physically connected to a power supply to induce the desired reactions. To circumvent these problems, we propose here a complementary approach by replacing macroscopic electrodes with an ensemble of self&#8208;propelled redox active microswimmers. They move autonomously in solution while transforming simultaneously a prochiral starting compound into a specific enantiomer with a very high enantiomeric excess, accompanied by a significantly increased production rate of the favorite enantiomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Conjugation Refining Carbon Nitride for Non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 Photosynthesis and Hypoxic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photocatalysis offers a clean approach for producing H2O2. However, the poor selectivity and activity of H2O2 production hamper traditional industrial applications and emerging photodynamic therapy (PDT)/chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Here, we report a C5N2 photocatalyst with a conjugated C=N linkage for selective and efficient non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 production both in normoxic and hypoxic systems. The strengthened delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons by linkers in C5N2 downshifted the band position, thermodynamically eliminating the side H2 evolution and kinetically promoting the water oxidation. As a result, C5N2 had a competitive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55% in overall H2O2 production and exhibited by far the highest activity in hypoxic conditions (698 &#956;M/h). C5N2 was further applied to hypoxic PDT/CDT with outstanding performance in apparent cancer cell death and synchronous bioimaging. It sheds light on carbon nitrides in photosynthesizing H2O2 for health.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Arene Trifluoromethylation Enabled by a High&#8208;Valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes poses an important synthetic challenge that is highly desirable. High&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF  3  compounds have often been invoked in copper&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation reactions, but the fundamental reactivity toward arenes is elusive. Herein, direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of arenes/heteroarenes by a high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF  3  compound is disclosed for the first time. The Cu(III)&#8208;CF  3  compound serves CF  3  radical and a Cu(II) oxidant by homolytic cleavage of a Cu(III)&#8208;CF  3  bond, which engage synergistically in a S  E  Ar type reaction with arenes. The presence of K  2  S  2  O  8  co&#8208;oxidant can significantly improve the reaction yields. This reaction shows good efficiency, broad functional group tolerance, and the potential in late&#8208;stage functionalization. The reactivity of high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF  3  compounds disclosed in this study represents an important progress in organofluorine and Cu(III) chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage&#8211;Based Prodrug Activation Strategy Applied to &#946;&#8208;Lapachone for Cancer&#8208;Specific Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs are one of the most common strategies for the design of targeted anticancer agents. However, their application is often hampered by the modifiable groups available on parent drugs. Herein, a carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) bond cleavage&#8211;based prodrug activation strategy is reported, which was successfully used to design prodrugs of &#946;&#8208;lapachone (&#946;&#8208;lap), an  ortho  &#8208;quinone natural product without traditional modifiable groups for the construction of C&#8208;N/C&#8208;O bond cleavage&#8211;based prodrugs. The designed &#946;&#8208;lap prodrug with a reactive oxygen species&#8211;specific trigger was quickly activated, releasing &#946;&#8208;lap. It exerted anticancer efficacy via NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)&#8208;mediated futile redox cycling, resulting in potent cytotoxicity that was highly selective for NQO1&#8208;rich cancer cells over normal cells both  in vitro  and  in vivo  . This significantly amplified the therapeutic window of &#946;&#8208;lap. This study provides a practical strategy for the design of prodrugs for parent drugs that do not contain traditional modifiable groups.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rebuilding&#8208;Free Nucleic Acid Detection Strategy Enables Ultrasensitive Genotyping, N&#8208;in&#8208;1 Logic Screening and Accurate Multiplex Assay of Dangerous Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitive, rapid and low&#8208;cost nucleic acid detection is critical for controlling infectious pathogens. Here, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use and multimodal detection based on a rebuilding&#8208;free, ultrasensitive and selective strategy named dual hairpin ligation&#8208;induced isothermal amplification pro (DHLApro). Taking influenza A, influenza B, MERS&#8208;CoV, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as model targets, we demonstrate DHLApro provides ~zM level ultra&#8208;sensitivity, being equaling to 0.45 copy/&#181;L in original sample. By simply changing the recognition module, a set of DHLApro components can be applied to a new target without performance loss. Moreover, DHLApro innovatively allows flexible logic/multiplex assay using one set of primer, for example, the &#8220;N pathogens&#8208;in&#8208;1&#8221;OR gate screening and accurate multi&#8208;channel multiplex assay. Compared with traditional methods, the cost of this logic/multiplex assay has been largely reduced and the cross&#8208;interference between the multiple primer sets is also avoided.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefin&#8211;Borane Interactions in Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Fluorophores that Undergo Frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;Pair&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefin&#8211;borane &#960;&#8208;complexes have been postulated as intermediates for the addition of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) to olefins. In the present study, we have employed this weak interaction to modulate the electronic properties of boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials. A series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) fluorophores that contain an alkenyl&#8208;bridged diarylboryl group is synthesized. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the olefin and boron moieties are held in close proximity. Upon addition of a Lewis base to a solution of these D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A fluorophores, an FLP&#8208;type addition occurs with concurrent significant changes in the absorption and emission properties. The FLP&#8208;type reaction shifts the reaction site from the Lewis&#8208;acidic boron atom to a carbocationic center, and thereby even facilitates a reaction with bulky Lewis bases. For example, a tricyclohexylphosphine adduct thus generated exhibits temperature&#8208;dependent reversible dissociation/association behavior. These results provide a design strategy for stimuli&#8208;responsive emissive boron&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Quantified Lithium Plating Determination Enabled by Dynamic Capacitance Measurement in Working Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The access to full performance of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is hindered by the mysterious lithium plating behavior. A rapid quantified lithium plating determination method compatible with actual working conditions is an urgent necessity for safe working LIBs. In this contribution, the relationship between electrical double layer (EDL) capacitance and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of graphite anodes during the Li&#8208;ion intercalation and Li plating processes is unveiled. We propose an operando lithium plating determination method based on the dynamic capacitance measurement (DCM) test. Reasonable selection of alternating current (AC) frequency protects the anodic responses from the interference of cathodic responses, which allows DCM to be applied in practical LIBs. The onset of lithium plating can be quantitatively traced, demonstrating the promise for real&#8208;time operando determination for lithium plating in a working battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Manipulation of Hydrogen Evolution and Zinc Ion Flux in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries have attracted much attention because of their high theoretical&#8208;capacity, safety, and low&#8208;cost, yet the H2&#8208;evolution, qualification or inhibition mechanism investigations that are closely related to the dendrite&#8208;growth are rare and challenging. Herein, a series of zincophilic metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (e.g., Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF, Zn&#8208;DAAQ&#8208;COF, and Zn&#8208;DAA&#8208;COF) have been explored as model&#8208;platforms to manipulate the H2&#8208;evolution and Zn2+ flux. Best of them, Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF based cell only produces 0.002 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 H2, which is &gt; 2 orders of magnitude lower than bare Zn. Noteworthy, it affords high stability for 3000 cycles (overpotential, &lt; 79.1 mV) at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 in symmetric&#8208;cell and enhanced cycling&#8208;stability up to 6000 cycles at 2000 mA g&#8208;1 in the assembled full&#8208;battery. Besides, mechanistic characterizations show that Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF can enhance the energy&#8208;barrier of H2&#8208;evolution and homogenize the ion&#8208;distribution or electric&#8208;filed to achieve high performance.</dc:description>

         <title>3D Printed CO2&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers and Post&#8208;Printing Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable CO2&#8208;based triblock polycarbonates with tailored thermal and mechanical properties were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy. By dispersing NaCl particles in polymer solutions, thixotropic inks can be formulated and 3D printed. Subsequent removal of the filler yields porous structures. The alkene pendant groups on the polymer backbone can be further modified via UV&#8208; induced thiol&#8208;ene surface functionalization and crosslinking.







Abstract
We report the facile synthesis and 3D printing of a series of triblock copolymers consisting of soft and hard blocks and demonstrate that alkene pendant groups of the hard block can be covalently modified. The polymers are prepared using a salenCo(III)TFA/PPNTFA binary catalyst system and 1,2&#8208;propanediol as a chain transfer agent, providing an efficient one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy to tailor polymer thermal and mechanical properties. Thixotropic inks suitable for direct ink write printing were formulated by dissolving the block copolymers in organic solvent and dispersing NaCl particles. After printing, porous structures were produced by removing solvent and NaCl with water to give printed structures with surfaces that could be modified via UV&#8208;initiated thiol&#8208;ene click reactions. Alternatively, a tetra&#8208;thiol could be incorporated into the ink and used for cross&#8208;linking to give objects with high solvent resistance and selective degradability.

         <title>1:1 Ca2+:Cu2+ A&#8208;site order in a ferrimagnetic double double perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation ordering in ABX  3  perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we report discovery of CaCuFeReO  6  with the tetragonal AA&#8217;BB&#8217;O  6  double double perovskite structure that was previously only reported for A&#8217; = Mn compositions. CaCuFeReO  6  occurs in the same phase field as CaCu  3  Fe  2  Re  2  O  12  demonstrating that different A&#8208;cation ordered peroskites may be obtained in the same chemical system. CaCuFeReO  6  has ferrimagnetic order of Fe, Re and Cu spins below  T  C  = 567 K, in contrast to Mn analogues where the Mn spins order separately at much lower temperatures. The magnetoresistance of CaCuFeReO  6  displays low&#8208;field &#8216;butterfly&#8217; hysteresis with an unusual change from negative to positive values as field increases. Many more AA&#8217;BB&#8217;O  6  double double perovskites may be accessible for A&#8217; = Cu and other divalent transition metals at high pressure, so the presently known phases likely represent only the &#8216;tip of the iceberg&#8217; for this family.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Electrochemical Reductive Splitting of Dinitrogen with a Molybdenum Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen reduction in mild conditions (room T and atmospheric P), using a non&#8208;fossil source of hydrogen remains a challenge. Molecular metal complexes, notably Mo based, have recently shown to be active for such nitrogen fixation. In this work, we report about the electrochemical N2 splitting with MoIII triphosphino complex [(PPP)MoI3], at room temperature and a moderately negative potential. A MoIV nitride species was generated, which was confirmed by electrochemistry and NMR studies. The reaction goes through two successive one electron reduction of the starting Mo species, coordination of an N2 molecule, and further splitting to a MoIV nitride complex. Preliminary DFT investigation supports the formation of a bridging MoIN2MoI dinitrogen dimer evolving to the Mo nitride via a low energy transition state. This example joins a short list of molecular complexes for N2 electrochemical reductive cleavage. It opens a door to electrochemical PCET conversion studies of N2 to NH3</dc:description>

         <title>Atropopeptides are a Novel Family of Ribosomally Synthesized and Posttranslationally Modified Peptides with a Complex Molecular Shape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomacromolecules are known to feature complex three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are essential for their function. Among natural products, ambiguous molecular shapes are a rare phenomenon. The hexapeptide tryptorubin A can adopt one of two unusual atropisomeric configurations. Initially hypothesized to be a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide, we show that tryptorubin A is the first characterized member of a new family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that we named atropopeptides. The sole modifying enzyme encoded in the gene cluster, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, is responsible for the atropospecific formation of one carbon&#8211;carbon and two carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds. The characterization of two additional atropopeptide biosynthetic pathways revealed a two&#8208;step maturation process. Atropopeptides promote pro&#8208;angiogenic cell functions as indicated by an increase in endothelial cell proliferation and undirected migration. Our study expands the biochemical space of RiPP&#8208;modifying enzymes and paves the way towards the chemoenzymatic utilization of atropopeptide&#8208;modifying P450s.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;induced Symmetry Conversion of DNA Origami Lattices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology has provided credible approaches for assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lattices with complex patterns. However, the symmetries are strictly dependent on their initial configurations and difficult to alter via non&#8208;thermal treatments. While switchable nucleic acid structures have been employed to construct deformable DNA motifs, it remains challenging to arrange them anisotropically in 3D lattices to trigger directed collective shape transition and dynamic symmetry conversion. In this work, we used octahedral DNA origami frames to synthesize four DNA origami lattices by placing the pH&#8208;reactive i&#8208;motif sequences in the desired dimensions. Thereinto, lattices with an anisotropic design can switch between simple cubic (  SC  ) and simple tetragonal (  ST  ) upon pH change. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) results reveals the feasibility of obtaining 3D lattices with sensitive responses to external stimuli, expanding the way to obtain low&#8208;symmetry lattices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Growing lubricious hydrogel coatings in controllable manners on diverse material surfaces demonstrates promising applications. Here, a surface modification method is reported for in&#8208;situ growing hydrogel coatings onto surfaces of diverse substrates in the absence of UV assistance. It is performed by decorating substrates with a universal mussel&#8208;inspired synthetic adhesive with catechol groups. Upon being immersed in reaction solution, these groups can assist substrate bonding and in&#8208;situ capture and reduce Fe  3+  into Fe  2+  for decomposing S  2  O  8  2&#8208;  into SO  4  &#8208;  &#8226; catalytically at the interface to initiate interface polymerization of monomers. As a result, hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness could be grown on surfaces of arbitrary substrates to change their surface characteristics regardless of materials size, category, geometry and transparency, implying considerable potential in surface engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Encoded Bead&#8208;Based Immunoassay with Tunable Detection Range for COVID&#8208;19 Serum Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiplexed strategy for chip&#8208;based sandwich immunoassays integrated with color/size dual&#8208;barcoded beads and rolling circle amplification (RCA) is presented. RCA based on beads of various sizes allows for a tunable detection range from pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 to &#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1.







Abstract
Serological assay for coronavirus 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) patients including asymptomatic cases can inform on disease progression and prognosis. A detection method taking into account multiplex, high sensitivity, and a wider detection range will help to identify and treat COVID&#8208;19. Here we integrated color&#8208;size dual&#8208;encoded beads and rolling circle amplification (RCA) into a bead&#8208;based fluorescence immunoassay implemented in a size sorting chip to achieve high&#8208;throughput and sensitive detection. We used the assay for quantifying COVID&#8208;19 antibodies against spike S1, nucleocapsid, the receptor binding domain antigens. It also detected inflammatory biomarkers including interleukin&#8208;6, interleukin&#8208;1&#946;, procalcitonin, C&#8208;reactive protein whose concentrations range from pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 to &#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Use of different size beads integrating with RCA results in a tunable detection range. The assay can be readily modified to simultaneously measure more COVID&#8208;19 serological molecules differing by orders of magnitude.

         <title>Linker Scissoring Strategy Enables Precise Shaping of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Chromatographic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;linker scissoring&#8221; strategy to control the shape of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles from nanoplate to nanorod by surface conformational pairing is reported by Hong&#8208;Cai Zhou, Zhi&#8208;Yuan Gu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207786). Both structure and shape influence the separation ability of MOF stationary phases in gas chromatography by affecting the thermodynamic and kinetic diffusion factors.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Modulated Circularly Polarized Luminescence by Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Chirality Transfer in Heteroleptic PdII Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intra&#8208;assembly chirality transfer&#160;from a helicene onto a non&#8208;chiral, emissive fluorenone ligand leads to circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in a heteroleptic coordination cage. The Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205725) by Guido Clever et&#8197;al. shows that guest addition shifts and enhances the CPL effect, providing a modular platform for supramolecular materials with tunable chiroptical properties. The background, showing the &#8220;North America&#8221; emission nebula (NGC 7000) in the constellation Cygnus, was shot in the night sky over Dortmund using an apochromatic refractor telescope.
