      <title>Proving and Probing the Presence of the Elusive C&#8208;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O Hydrogen Bond in Liquid Solutions at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) play a major role in defining the structure and properties of many substances, as well as phenomena and processes. Traditional H&#8208;bonds are ubiquitous in nature and have received considerable attention, yet the demonstration of weak H&#8208;bonds, as occur between a highly polarized C&#8208;H group and an electron&#8208;rich oxygen atom, have proven elusive. Herein, we detail linear and non&#8208;linear IR spectroscopy experiments that reveal the presence of H&#8208;bonds between the chloroform C&#8208;H group and an amide carbonyl oxygen, in solution at room temperature. Evidence is provided for an amide solvation shell featuring two clearly distinguishable chloroform arrangements that undergo chemical exchange with a time scale of ~2 ps. Furthermore, the enthalpy of breaking the hydrogen bond is found to be 6&#8208;20 kJ/mol. &#160;Ab&#8208;initio computations support our findings of two distinct solvation shells formed by three chloroform molecules, where one thermally undergoes hydrogen bond making and breaking. Our experiments also illustrate extension of the phenomenon to other carbonyl&#8208;containing molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Divergent Synthesis of Monosubstituted and Unsymmetrical 3,6&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazines from Carboxylic Ester Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>As tetrazines are important tools to the field of bioorthogonal chemistry, there is a need for new approaches to synthesize unsymmetrical and 3&#8208;monosubstituted tetrazines. Described here is a general, one&#8208;pot method for converting (3&#8208;methyloxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methyl carboxylic esters into 3&#8208;thiomethyltetrazines. These versatile intermediates were applied as a platform for the synthesis of unsymmetrical tetrazines via Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling and in the first example of catalytic thioether reduction to access monosubstituted tetrazines. The method enables the development of new tetrazines possessing a favorable combination of kinetics, small size and hydrophilicity. &#160; The chemistry was applied to a broad range of aliphatic and aromatic ester precursors and to the synthesis of heterocycles including BODIPY fluorophores and biotin. In addition, a series of tetrazine probes for monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) were synthesized and the most reactive one was applied in labeling of endogenous MAGL in live cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Concentrated Electrolyte towards Enhanced Energy Density and Cycling Life of Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) have attracted much attention owing to their low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;voltage, and environmental friendliness. As the source of active ions during the charging/discharging process, the electrolyte plays a critical role in the performance of DIBs, including capacity, energy density, and cycling life. However, most used electrolyte systems based on the LiPF  6  salt shows unsatisfied performance in DIBs. In this work, we successfully developed a 7.5 m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in carbonate electrolyte system. Compared with diluted electrolytes, this highly concentrated electrolyte exhibits several advantages: (1) enhanced intercalation capacity and cycling stability of graphite cathode; (2) optimized structural stability of Al anode; (3) significantly increased battery energy density. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept DIB based on this concentrated electrolyte exhibits a discharge capacity of 94.0 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 200 mA g  &#8208;1  and 96.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles. By counting both the electrode materials and electrolyte, the energy density of this pro&#8208;type DIB reaches up to ~180 Wh kg  &#8208;1  , which is among the best performance of previously reported DIBs.</dc:description>

      <title>4&#8208;Dimensional DNA&#8208;gold nanoparticle assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>Although utilizing oligonucleotides to organize gold nanoobjects has resulted in many three dimensional colloidal assemblies that show a large diversity in size, shape and complexity, autonomous and temporal control of their formation is still a great challenge. In contrast, living systems temporally and spatially self&#8208;regulate the formation of functional structures by internally orchestrating assembly and disassembly kinetics of dissipative biomacromolecular networks. Taking such systems from nature as inspiration, we herein present a novel approach for fabricating 4&#8208;dimensional gold nanostructures by adding an additional dimension of structural information, i.e. the time component. The dissipative character of our system was achieved by utilizing DNA as the fuel and exonuclease III (Exo III) digestion of this DNA fuel as energy dissipating pathway. We showed the central concept of the temporal control over amorphous clusters composed of spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and well&#8208;defined core&#8208;satellite structures from gold nanorods (AuNRs) and AuNPs. Furthermore, the high specificity of DNA hybridization allowed us to demonstrate selective activation of the evolution of multiple architectures of higher complexity in a single mixture containing small and larger spherical AuNPs and AuNRs, proving the outstanding opportunities of DNA acting as a programmable fuel. We anticipate that the integration of time as the fourth dimension in existing 3D assembly systems will fuel the development of next generation of adaptive and life&#8208;like programmable DNA templated gold nanoobjects.</dc:description>

      <title>Two Pyrophosphates with Large Birefringences and Second&#8208;Harmonic Responses as Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Two new pyrophosphates nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, Rb3PbBi(P2O7)2 (I) and Cs3PbBi(P2O7)2 (II), were successfully designed and synthesized. Both compounds exhibit large nonlinear optical (NLO) effects and birefringences. Especially, I presents the scarce case of possessing the coexistence of large birefringence (0.031 at 1064 nm and 0.037 at 532 nm) and second harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.8 &#215; KDP) in ultraviolet (UV) NLO phosphates and breaks through the zero pyrophosphates with large SHG (&gt;2 &#215; KDP). Both I and II have three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystal structures composed of corner&#8208;shared RbO12 (CsO11), RbO10 (CsO10), BiO6, PbO7 (PbO6) and P2O7 groups, in which P2O7 and PbO7 (PbO6) units form alveolate [PbPO]&#8734; skeleton frame. Theoretical calculations reveal that the P&#8208;O and Bi&#8208;O units are mainly responsible for the birefringence, while P&#8208;O and Pb&#8208;O groups are essential for large SHG efficiency for I.</dc:description>

      <title>The mineral/water interface probed with nonlinear optical spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The interaction between minerals and water is relevant for a wide range of geological, atmospheric, environmental, and electro(photo&#8208;)chemical systems. This interaction is manifold and complex: the mineral surface can be (de&#8208;)protonated by water, thereby changing its charge, and thus the interaction with water; mineral ions dissolved into the aqueous phase screen the surface charges, also modifying the water interaction. Intrinsically molecular&#8208;level processes and interactions thus govern macroscopic phenomena such as flow&#8208;induced dissolution, wetting, and charging. This realization is increasingly prompting molecular&#8208;level studies of mineral&#8208;water interfaces. Here, we review recent developments in second&#8208;order nonlinear spectroscopy techniques like Sum Frequency and Second Harmonic Generation (SFG/SHG), which can provide information about the molecular arrangement of the first few layers of water molecules directly at the mineral surface. The results illustrate the subtleties of both chemical and physical interactions between water and the mineral and the critical role of mineral dissolution and other ions in solution for determining those interactions.

      <title>An RCM&#8208;Based Total Synthesis of the Antibiotic Disciformycin B</title>
      <dc:description>The total synthesis of the potent new antibiotic disciformycin B (2) is described, which shows significant activity against methicillin&#8208; and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/VRSA) strains. The synthetic route is based on macrocyclization of a tetraene substrate to the 12&#8208;membered macrolactone core by ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis (RCM). Although macrocyclization was accompanied by concomitant cyclopentene formation by an alternative RCM pathway, conditions could eventually be established that gave the macrocycle as the major product.

      <title>Template&#8208;directed copying of RNA by non&#8208;enzymatic ligation</title>
      <dc:description>The non&#8208;enzymatic replication of the primordial genetic material is thought to have enabled the evolution of early forms of RNA&#8208;based life. However, the replication of oligonucleotides long enough to encode catalytic functions is problematic due to the low efficiency of template copying with mononucleotides. Here we show that template&#8208;directed ligation can assemble long RNAs from shorter oligonucleotides, which would be easier to replicate. The rate of ligation can be greatly enhanced by employing a 3&#697;&#8208;amino group at the 3&#697;&#8208;end of each oligonucleotide, in combination with an N&#8208;alkyl imidazole organocatalyst. These modifications enable the copying of RNA templates by the multi&#8208;step ligation of tetranucleotide building blocks, as well as the assembly of long oligonucleotides using short splint oligonucleotides. We also demonstrate the formation of long oligonucleotides inside model prebiotic vesicles, suggesting a potential route to the assembly of artificial cells capable of evolution.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The non&#8208;enzymatic replication of the primordial genetic material is thought to have enabled the evolution of early forms of RNA&#8208;based life. However, the replication of oligonucleotides long enough to encode catalytic functions is problematic due to the low efficiency of template copying with mononucleotides. Here we show that template&#8208;directed ligation can assemble long RNAs from shorter oligonucleotides, which would be easier to replicate. The rate of ligation can be greatly enhanced by employing a 3&#697;&#8208;amino group at the 3&#697;&#8208;end of each oligonucleotide, in combination with an N&#8208;alkyl imidazole organocatalyst. These modifications enable the copying of RNA templates by the multi&#8208;step ligation of tetranucleotide building blocks, as well as the assembly of long oligonucleotides using short splint oligonucleotides. We also demonstrate the formation of long oligonucleotides inside model prebiotic vesicles, suggesting a potential route to the assembly of artificial cells capable of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H activation was achieved with excellent selectivity under mild conditions and inquisitively 30 mol% of NaF additive was found to be crucial for the efficient dienylation. The methodology features high stereoselectivity, mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance. C&#8208;8 Alkenylation of quinoline&#8208;  N  &#8208;oxides was achieved in case of allenes devoid of leaving groups as coupling partners.

      <title>Organic&#8208;Free Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite Y via a Combined Strategy of In Situ Hydroxyl Radical Assistance and Post&#8208;Synthesis Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolite Y with high SiO  2  /Al  2  O  3  ratio (SAR) plays an important role in fluidized catalytic cracking process. However, in situ synthesis of zeolite Y with high SAR remains challenges due to kinetic limitations. Herein, zeolite Y with SAR of 6.35 was first synthesized via a hydroxyl radical&#8208;assisted route coupled with post&#8208;synthesis treatment, where hydrogen peroxide was used as the initiator of hydroxyl radicals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that hydroxyl radicals preferentially enhanced the formation of Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si bonds, thus leading to an increased SAR. To further increase SAR, a dealumination process was carried out by citric acid followed by second&#8208;step hydrothermal crystallization, giving SAR up to 7.5 while maintaining good crystallinity and high product yield. The resultant zeolite Y showed superior performance in cumene cracking. This work introduces a new strategy for synthesizing high SAR zeolite Y that is heavily used in commercial applications.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first iridium catalyzed, enantioconvergent amination of allenylic carbonates is reported. This process utilizes various commercially available carbamates and sulfonamides to generate allenylic amines including commonly employed protected groups (Boc, Fmoc, Cbz, Ts, Ns) in 62&#8208;82% yield and 87&#8208;98% ee. The products generated via this scalable procedure serve as effective linchpins for the rapid, enantiospecific synthesis of a wide range of complex structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling Through Crossing Potential Energy Surfaces: Cyclization of a Triplet 2&#8208;Formylarylnitrene to a Singlet 2,1&#8208;Benzisoxazole</title>
      <dc:description>Not long ago, the occurrence of quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) chemistry involving atoms heavier than hydrogen was considered unreasonable. Contributing to the shift of this paradigm, we present here the discovery of a new and distinct heavy&#8208;atom QMT reaction. Triplet  syn  &#8208;2&#8208;formyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluorophenylnitrene, generated in argon matrices by UV&#8208;irradiation of an azide precursor, was found to spontaneously cyclize to singlet 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole. Monitoring the transformation by IR spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;independent rate constants (  k  ~1.4 &#215; 10  &#8722;3  s  &#8722;1  ; half&#8208;life of ~8 min) were measured from 10 to 20 K. Computations estimate rate constants in fair agreement with experimental values, providing evidence for a mechanism involving heavy&#8208;atom QMT through crossing triplet to singlet potential energy surfaces. Moreover, the heavy&#8208;atom QMT takes place with considerable displacement of the oxygen atom, which establishes a new limit for the heavier atom involved in a QMT reaction in cryogenic matrices.</dc:description>

      <title>Graphdiyne:A New Structure of Fluorescent Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY) as an emerging two&#8208;dimensional carbon allotrope exhibits excellent performance in energy chemistry, catalytic chemistry, optoelectronics, electronics, etc. due to the unique structure combines sp&#8208; and sp2 hybrid carbon network. However, the poor solubility of pristine GDY is the major obstacle to its applications in many fields. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to control the preparation of graphdiyne quantum dots (GDY&#8208;Py QDs), in which pyrene groups are covalently linked to GDY by Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The as&#8208;prepared GDY&#8208;Py QDs with average diameter of about 3 &#177; 0.1 nm show superior dispersibility in many organic solvents and water. The GDY&#8208;Py QDs display not only brightly fluorescent with a high relative quantum yield (QY) of 42.82%, but also well&#8208;behaved as contrast agents in cell&#8208;imaging. The GDY&#8208;Py QDs are bestowed with high stability and non&#8208;cytotoxicity and exhibit long fluorescent time, which could offer great potential in optical imaging and biomedical application.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermarriage of Halide Perovskites and Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>This review examines the intermarriage of perovskite and metal&#8208;organic framework crystals as bringing new paradigms for material design and functionality. The strategic combination of halide perovskites and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) crystals has generated a new family of porous composite materials that will enable new applications including optoelectronic, catalysis, sensing, and data encryption. This review surveys the current progress of this exciting new area. The fundamental aspects, including perovskite nucleation and growth, heterojunction electron&#8208;hole transfer, electronic structure and luminescence within confined spaces, are highlighted, suggesting the approaches by which guest confinement within MOFs can be synthetically designed. We further address the underlying principles and discuss the new insights and tools for the manipulation of these composite materials, pointing the way to the development of synthetic microporous semiconducting composites, as well as new strategies for host&#8208;guest interfacial engineering.</dc:description>

      <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Formation Pathway for CdTeSe Alloy Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Little is known about the pathway of room&#8208;temperature formation of ternary CdTeSe magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) obtained via mixing binary CdTe and CdSe induction period&#160;samples containing binary precursor compounds (PCs) of MSCs, monomers (Ms), and fragments (Fs). Also, unestablished are dispersion effects that occur when as&#8208;mixed samples (without incubation) are placed in toluene (Tol) and octylamine (OTA) mixtures. The resulting ternary MSCs, exhibiting sharp optical absorption peaking at 399 nm, are labelled &#8220;CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399&#8221;, and their particular PCs are &#8220;CdTeSe PC&#8208;399&#8221;. It is shown that when the amount of the primary amine (OTA) was relatively small, single&#8208;ensemble MSC&#8208;399 evolved without binary CdTe or CdSe MSCs. When the OTA amount was relatively large, CdTe MSC&#8208;371 appeared initially and then disappeared, while single&#8208;ensemble MSC&#8208;399 developed more deliberately. The larger the OTA amount was, the more slowly these changes proceeded. The substitution reaction of CdTe PC + CdSe M/F &#8660; CdTeSe PC&#8208;399 + CdTe M/F is proposed to be rate&#8208;determining for the MSC&#8208;399 formation in a Tol and OTA mixture. The present study provides further understanding regarding the transformation pathway between MSCs.</dc:description>

Distance&#8208;dependent surface plasmonic field induces rapid photoredox catalysis of surface&#8208;bound catalytic labels, and distance&#8208;dependent mediated electron transfer allows for rapid electron transfer from the surface&#8208;bound labels to the electrode. An optimal system consists of a chemically reversible acceptor (Ru(NH 3  ) 6  3+  ), a chemically reversible photoredox catalyst (eosin Y), and a chemically irreversible donor (triethanolamine). The side reactions by O 2  do not significantly decrease the efficiency of photoredox catalysis. The energy transfer quenching between the electrode and label can be lowered by increasing the distance between them. Washing&#8208;free DNA detection permits a detection limit of ~0.3 nM in buffer and ~0.4 nM in serum without a washing step.</dc:description>

      <title>Advances in the Interfacial Assembly of Mesoporous Silica on Magnetite Particles</title>
      <dc:description>
Multifaceted materials: Interface assembly enables the integration of magnetic particles and mesoporous materials to form advanced core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous materials for a variety of applications in catalysis, environmental remediation, and biomedicine. This Minireview summarizes progress made in the synthesis of core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.







Abstract
Interfacing magnetic particles with ordered mesoporous materials is an effective direction for the development of functional porous composite materials with rationally designed core&#8211;shell structures. Owing to the combined properties of magnetic nanoparticles and mesoporous silica (high surface area, large pore volume, porosity, and biocompatibility), core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica materials have generated tremendous interest in various disciplines, including chemistry, materials, bioengineering, and biomedicine. Interfacial assembly strategies enable the rational construction of magnetic mesoporous silica materials with well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell structure, morphology, pore parameters, and surface wettability, which can decisively influence their physical and chemical properties and thus improve their application performance. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the synthesis of core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.

      <dc:description>
More light in chemistry: This Minireview highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and emerging techniques in theoretical and computational photochemistry. This is a challenging and rapidly evolving field that relates time&#8208;dependent spectroscopy with electronic structure theory and molecular dynamics for electronic excited states.







Abstract
Photochemistry is a fascinating branch of chemistry that is concerned with molecules and light. However, the importance of simulating light&#8208;induced processes is reflected also in fields as diverse as biology, material science, and medicine. This Minireview highlights recent progress achieved in theoretical chemistry to calculate electronically excited states of molecules and simulate their photoinduced dynamics, with the aim of reaching experimental accuracy. We focus on emergent methods and give selected examples that illustrate the progress in recent years towards predicting complex electronic structures with strong correlation, calculations on large molecules, describing multichromophoric systems, and simulating non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics over long time scales, for molecules in the gas phase or in complex biological environments.

      <title>CAIXplatins: highly potent Pt(IV) prodrugs selectively against hypoxic tumors via microenvironment and metabolism regulation</title>

      <dc:description>From the understanding of biological processes and metalloenzymes to the development of inorganic catalysts, electro&#8208; and photocatalytic systems for fuel generation have evolved considerably during the last decades. Recently, organic and hybrid organic systems have emerged to challenge the classical inorganic structures through their enormous chemical diversity and modularity that led earlier to their success in organic (opto)electronics.

      <title>Regeneration of burnt&#8208;bridges on a DNA catenane walker</title>
      <dc:description>DNA walkers are molecular machines that can move with high precision in the nanoscale due to their structural and functional programmability. Despite recent advances in the field that allow exploring different energy sources, stimuli and mechanism of action for these nanomachines, continuous operation and re&#8208;usability of DNA walkers remains challenging because in most cases the steps, once taken by the walker, cannot be taken again. Herein we report the path regeneration of a burnt&#8208;bridges DNA catenane walker using RNase A. This walker uses a T7RNA polymerase that produces long RNA transcripts to hybridize to the path and move forward while the RNA remains hybridized to the path and blocks it for an additional walking cycle. We show that RNase A triggered RNA degradation restores the path and returns the walker to the initial position. RNase inhibition restarts the function of the walker. To date there is no similar strategy allowing the regeneration and continuous operation of burnt bridges DNA walkers. Our approach opens new avenues to expand the functionalities and applications of this type of artificial molecular motors.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermal&#8208;Gated Polymer Electrolytes for Smart Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The smart self&#8208;protection is essential to avoid the safety issue of energy storage devices. However, conventional strategies based on sol&#8208;gel transition electrolytes often suffer from unstable self&#8208;recovery performance. Herein, smart separators based on thermal&#8208;gated poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel electrolytes were developed for rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Such PNIPAM&#8208;based separators not only display a pore structure evolution from opened to closed state, but also exhibit a surface wettability transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic behaviors when the temperature rises. This can suppress the migration of electrolyte ions across the separators, realizing the self&#8208;protection of ZIBs at high temperature. Furthermore, the thermal&#8208;gated behavior is highly reversible even after multiple heating/cooling cycles due to the reversibility of temperature&#8208;dependent structural evolution and hydrophilic/hydrophobic transition. This work will pave the way for designing thermal&#8208;responsive energy storage devices with safe and controlled energy delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct atomic level imaging of Zeolites: Oxygen, Na in Na&#8208;LTA and Fe in Fe&#8208;MFI</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolites are becoming more versatile in their chemical functions through rational design of their frameworks, both in geometries and composition.&#160; Therefore, direct imaging of all atoms at the atomic scale, basic units (Si, Al and O), heteroatoms in the framework, and extraframework cations, is urgently needed. TEM is ideally suited to provide local information at the atomic level, but the serious problem of electron&#8208;beam damage needs to be overcome. Herein, we report the successful observation of all framework atoms, including oxygen and most of the extraframework Na&#8208;cations, in one of the most electron&#8208;beam sensitive and lowest framework density zeolites, Na&#8208;  LTA  . Beyond the basic properties, zeolite performance, for instance in catalysis, is considered to be highly dependent on the location of incorporated heteroatoms. We succeeded for the first time to image Fe single atomic sites in the  MFI  framework. The approach presented here, that combines image analysis, electron diffraction and DFT calculations can provide essential structural keys for tuning catalytically active sites at the atomic level.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zeolites are becoming more versatile in their chemical functions through rational design of their frameworks, both in geometries and composition.&#160; Therefore, direct imaging of all atoms at the atomic scale, basic units (Si, Al and O), heteroatoms in the framework, and extraframework cations, is urgently needed. TEM is ideally suited to provide local information at the atomic level, but the serious problem of electron&#8208;beam damage needs to be overcome. Herein, we report the successful observation of all framework atoms, including oxygen and most of the extraframework Na&#8208;cations, in one of the most electron&#8208;beam sensitive and lowest framework density zeolites, Na&#8208;  LTA  . Beyond the basic properties, zeolite performance, for instance in catalysis, is considered to be highly dependent on the location of incorporated heteroatoms. We succeeded for the first time to image Fe single atomic sites in the  MFI  framework. The approach presented here, that combines image analysis, electron diffraction and DFT calculations can provide essential structural keys for tuning catalytically active sites at the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Dynamic covalent formation of concave disulfide macrocycles mechanically interlocked with single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes</title>
      <dc:description>The formation of discrete macrocycles wrapped around single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has recently emerged as an appealing strategy to functionalize these carbon nanomaterials and modify their properties. Here, we demonstrate that the reversible disulfide exchange reaction, which proceeds under mild conditions, is ideally suited to install relatively large amounts of mechanically interlocked disulfide macrocycles on the one&#8208;dimensional nanotubes. Presumably as a result of error&#8208;correction and the presence of relatively rigid, curved &#960;&#8208;systems in our key building blocks, we observed evidence for the size&#8208;selective functionalization of a mixture of SWCNTs of differing diameter. Specifically, a combination of UV/vis/NIR, Raman, photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and transient absorption spectroscopies indicated that the small (6,4)&#8208;

SWCNTs were predominantly functionalized by the small macrocycles  1  2  , whereas the larger (6,5)&#8208;SWCNTs were an ideal match for the larger macrocycles  2  2  . The observation of size selectivity, which was rationalized computationally, could prove useful for the purification of nanotube mixtures, because we were able to remove the disulfide macrocycles quantitatively under mild reductive conditions.</dc:description>

The reaction was carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 0.1 MPa over a temperature range of 275&#8208;375  o  C. During the activity tests, the only carbon&#8208;containing products were DME and CO  2  . The DME productivity (&#181;mol g  cat  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) was comparable to oxygenate productivities reported in the literature for strong oxidants (N  2  O, H  2  O  2  , O  3  ). The NO+O  2  mixture formed NO  2  which acted as the oxygen atom carrier for the ultimate oxidant O  2  . During the methane partial oxidation reaction, NO and NO  2  were not reduced to N&#173;&#173;  2  . In situ FTIR showed the formation of surface nitrate species, that are considered to be key intermediate species for the selective oxidation.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanically Assisted Bioluminescence with Natural Luciferase</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanochemical analogues have been recently established for several enzymatic reactions, however they require periodic interruption of the reaction for sampling, dissolution, and (bio)chemical analysis to monitor their progress. By applying a mechanochemical protocol to induce bioluminescence analogous to that used by the marine ostracod  Cypridina  (  Vargula  )  hilgendorfii  here we demonstrate that the light emitted by a bioluminescent reaction can be used for direct monitoring of the progress of a mechanoenzymatic reaction without sampling. Mechanical treatment of  Cypridina  luciferase and luciferin generates bright blue light which can be readily spectroscopically detected and analyzed. We establish that this mechanically assisted bioluminescence proceeds through a mechanism identical to that of bioluminescence in solution however it has higher activation energy due to being diffusion&#8208;controlled in the viscous matrix. The results open prospects for application of luciferases as light&#8208;emissive reporters for mechanoenzymatic reactions, either as chemically coupled enzymatic labels to the reactant or as an internal standard added in the reaction mixture.</dc:description>

      <title>TMEDA in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Hydromagnesiation: Formation&#160;of Iron(II)&#8208;Alkyl Species for Controlled Reduction to&#160;Alkene&#8208;Stabilized Iron(0)</title>
      <dc:description>N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) has been one of the most prevalent and successful additives used in iron&#8208;catalysis, finding application in reactions as diverse as cross&#8208;coupling, C&#8208;H activation and borylation. However, the role that TMEDA plays in these reactions remains largely undefined. Herein, studying the iron&#8208;catalyzed hydromagnesiation of styrene derivatives using TMEDA has provided molecular&#8208;level insight into the role of TMEDA in achieving effective catalysis. Key is the initial formation of TMEDA&#8208;iron(II) alkyl species which undergo a controlled reduction to selectively form catalytically active styrene&#8208;stabilized iron(0)&#8208;alkyl complexes. While TMEDA is not bound to the catalytically active species, these active iron(0) complexes cannot be accessed in the absence of TMEDA. This mode of action, allowing for controlled reduction and access to iron(0) species, represents a new paradigm for the role of this important reaction additive in iron catalysis.</dc:description>

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;My first experiment was to initiate my PhD research on the synthesis of soluble conjugated conducting polymers under supervision of John&#8197;W. White with a purely chemical engineering background. My biggest inspiration is NASA's Apollo lunar mission program in the 1960s &lt;/i&gt; &#8230;&#8221; Find out more about Liming Dai in his Author Profile.

      <title>Autonomous Discovery in the Chemical Sciences Part&#8197;II: Outlook</title>
      <dc:description>
Exploring the possibilities: This two&#8208;part Review evaluates the contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. This second part reflects on exemplary case studies introduced in the first part. A set of open research directions in terms of both practical and methodological challenges are defined; addressing these would advance the extent to which these systems can make meaningful discoveries.







Abstract
This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this second part, we reflect on a selection of exemplary studies. It is increasingly important to articulate what the role of automation and computation has been in the scientific process and how that has or has not accelerated discovery. One can argue that even the best automated systems have yet to &#8220;discover&#8221; despite being incredibly useful as laboratory assistants. We must carefully consider how they have been and can be applied to future problems of chemical discovery in order to effectively design and interact with future autonomous platforms. The majority of this Review defines a large set of open research directions, including improving our ability to work with complex data, build empirical models, automate both physical and computational experiments for validation, select experiments, and evaluate whether we are making progress towards the ultimate goal of autonomous discovery. Addressing these practical and methodological challenges will greatly advance the extent to which autonomous systems can make meaningful discoveries.
