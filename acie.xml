         <title>Redox Reactions with Calcium&#8208;Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium metal nanoparticles (5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm) are realized by TMEDA&#8208;supported reduction of CaI2 with [LiNaph] in toluene. Their reactivity is exemplarily evaluated in the liquid phase and results in [{(DippNacNac)(thf)Ca}2(naph)] with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(DippNacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}2(fulvalene)] with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au9(PPh3)8](naph)(tmeda)0.5 with a non&#8208;charged body&#8208;centered cubic Au9 cluster core of zerovalent gold.








Abstract
Calcium is generally a highly reactive alkaline&#8208;earth metal, but as bulk metal, it exhibits only low reactivity at ambient conditions due to small surface area, low solubility, and/or passivation. The reactivity can be significantly enhanced when using small&#8208;sized calcium nanoparticles. In this regard, we describe the first synthesis of Ca(0) nanoparticles, 5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm in size, by TMEDA&#8208;supported reduction of CaI2 with lithium naphthalenide in toluene (TMEDA: N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine). We also show Ca(0) nanoparticles to be substantially different from so&#8208;called &#8220;Rieke calcium&#8221;. The high reactivity can be used for redox reactions, for instance, with [Cp2MoCl2] and the sterically demanding &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand HDippNacNac (Dipp: 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) or with [(Ph3P)AuCl] as a derivative of a ligand&#8208;stabilized noble metal. The Ca(0)&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;driven reactions result in the novel compounds [{(DippNacNac)(thf)Ca}2(naph)] (1) with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(DippNacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}2(fulvalene)] (2) with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au9(PPh3)8](naph)(tmeda)0.5 (3) with a non&#8208;charged body&#8208;centered cubic Au9 cluster core of zerovalent gold. Ca(0) nanoparticles and the compounds 1&#8211;3 are characterized by electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (single crystals, powders), spectroscopy (IR, UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, EPR), and computation. Exemplarily, the formation of 1&#8211;3 points to the potential of nanosized alkaline&#8208;earth metals for chemical syntheses and the different reactivity of nanosized and bulk metals.

         <title>Inverting Palladium&#8211;Phosphorus Lewis Pair Formation: Phosphonium Acting as Z&#8208;Type Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic phosphonium&#8208;palladium(0) complexes were synthesized using an ambiphilic phosphorus&#8208;based ligand. A strong Z&#8208;type interaction was identified by DFT calculations (NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV, and QTAIM analyses), surpassing the strength of classical L&#8208;type P&#9472;Pd bonds. The pronounced Pd(0) stabilization facilitates mild P&#9472;C coupling reaction, showcasing the effect of Z&#8208;type ligands on reductive elimination in transition metal mediated transformations. 








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based ligands are prototypical L&#8208;type donors. Here, we introduce a Lewis acidic phosphonium cation that engages in unprecedented Z&#8208;type coordination to palladium(0). The resulting Pd&#8594;P(V) interactions are structurally unique and stronger than conventional L&#8208;type Pd&#9472;phosphine bonds, as revealed by NMR spectroscopy, x&#8208;ray crystallography, and quantum chemical analyses (NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV, and QTAIM). It enables the formation of rare L2Z&#8208;type Pd(0) complexes with distinctive optical and electronic properties. A notably mild P&#9472;C bond forming reaction suggests an overlooked role of Z&#8208;type interactions for facilitating reductive elimination pathways.

         <title>Solubility, Speciation and Thermodynamics of PuCO3OH(cr) in Carbonate Containing NaCl Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline Pu(III) hydroxo carbonate, PuCO3OH(cr), was synthesized by long&#8208;term equilibration of Pu(OH)3(am) in aqueous Na2CO3 solutions, and structurally characterized by Rietveld analysis and Pu L3&#8208;edge EXAFS. Solubility experiments revealed a great thermodynamic stability of PuCO3OH(cr), that substantially enhances the predominance field of solid Pu(III).








Abstract
The solubility, aqueous speciation, and solid phase formation of trivalent plutonium, Pu(III) was investigated for the first time in pH near&#8208;neutral 0.10&#160;M NaCl solutions under the presence of carbonate at T&#160;=&#160;(23&#160;&#177;&#160;2)&#160;&#176;C in the frame of a comprehensive experimental study. Crystalline PuCO3OH(cr) was synthesized by long&#8208;term equilibration of the binary hydroxide Pu(OH)3(am) in aqueous Na2CO3 solutions and comprehensively characterized by VIS/NIR absorption spectroscopy, SEM/EDX, powder XRD and Rietveld analysis, and Pu L3&#8208;edge EXAFS. Batch solubility experiments with PuCO3OH(cr) equilibrated in 0.10&#160;M NaCl&#8211;Na2CO3 solutions were performed from undersaturation as a function of pHm and followed over time for up to 90 days. A chemical model was derived and the corresponding thermodynamic constants evaluated. These novel data demonstrate that under specific conditions Pu(III) equilibrium concentrations are up to three orders of magnitude lower when controlled by the PuCO3OH(cr) compared to the concentration level defined by Pu(OH)3(am), and reveal a remarkable stabilization of the entire Pu(III) oxidation state in carbonate containing aqueous solutions. The relevance of the new data for geochemical modeling of environmental systems and nuclear waste repositories is discussed.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Mechanically Planar Chiral Rotaxanes by an Asymmetric Povarov Reaction&#8208;Enabled Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective desymmetrization method was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of mechanically planar chiral (MPC) rotaxanes by using chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed Povarov reaction followed by aromatization, yielding various quinoline&#8208;containing MPC rotaxanes with high enantioselectivities, including a complex MPC [3]rotaxane. Extensive control studies were conducted to elucidate the origin of mechanical planar chirality.








Abstract
Mechanically planar chiral (MPC) rotaxanes are a type of chiral mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) characterized by their unique chiral structures and dynamic motion properties, which have shown significant potential in various chiral science research fields. However, the exploration of efficient catalytic enantioselective methods for synthesizing these chiral molecules is still largely underexplored. We here report an efficient method for asymmetric synthesis of MPC rotaxanes through an enantioselective desymmetrization strategy. By employing the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Povarov reaction, the symmetry of prochiral rotaxanes with a rotationally symmetric macrocycle was broken, which was followed by a one&#8208;pot oxidative aromatization step to yield various MPC rotaxanes with good yields and high enantioselectivities. Moreover, in cases where the one&#8208;pot procedure did not provide satisfactory enantioselectivities, a stepwise protocol was employed to produce both enantiomers of MPC rotaxanes with excellent enantioselectivities, highlighting the practicability of this method. Extensive studies were performed to elucidate the origin of mechanical planar chirality within this method, which was postulated to arise from the synergistic interplay between the excellent enantioselectivity in generating point stereogenicity during the asymmetric Povarov reaction and the preferential selection of the mechanical geometric conformer of substrates during this process.

         <title>Deciphering Mn2+ Solvation and Interfacial Chemistry for Rechargeable Nonaqueous Mn&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy combining 2&#8208;methoxyethylamine (MOEA)&#8208;regulated Mn2+ solvation environment and indium nitride (InN)&#8208;enabled electrode interfacial engineering is implemented, improving the kinetics and reversibility of Mn plating/stripping in Mn&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Manganese emerges as a compelling metal anode for multivalent ion batteries given its favorable redox potential (&#8722;1.18&#160;V vs standard hydrogen electrode), high theoretical specific capacity (976 mAh g&#8722;1), and large abundance. However, its practical deployment is hindered by kinetic challenges, including strong Mn2+ solvation effects, electron repulsion from the half&#8208;filled 3d orbital, and surface passivation of oxide layer, which collectively contribute to excessive overpotential during the Mn plating/stripping process. To address these challenges, herein, we propose a synergistic strategy integrating Mn2+ solvation regulation using 2&#8208;methoxyethylamine (MOEA) and electrode interfacial engineering with indium nitride (InN). Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal that MOEA&#8208;regulated Mn2+ solvation sheath reduces the energy barrier associated with charge transfer, while InN&#8208;coated Mn anode leverages abundant nucleation sites to facilitate Mn deposition. These concerted effects enable remarkable plating/stripping stability of Mn||Mn symmetric cells over 3400 h under 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Full cells pairing Mn anodes with pyrene&#8211;4,5,9,10&#8211;tetraone (PTO) cathodes further validate the strategy's efficacy, delivering a specific capacity of 144 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling for 400 cycles. This work provides fundamental insights into Mn2+ solvation and interfacial chemistry for rechargeable Mn&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Precise Pore Engineering at Picometer Scale on Nanofluidic Membrane for Efficient Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of HBF membranes with their pore sizes precisely tuned by altering anion linkers (SiF62&#8722;, GeF62&#8722; and TiF62&#8722;, size difference &lt; 1&#160;&#197;) were successfully fabricated for efficient H2 purification.








Abstract
Hydrogen, a carbon&#8208;free energy carrier is mainly produced through methane steam reforming, generating CO2 as the primary byproduct alongside H2O and CH4, complicating efficient hydrogen purification. Nanofluidic Hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HBF) membranes are promising for gas separation, while methods to precisely tailor pores for enhance performance remain scarce. Herein, a series of HBF membranes (SIFHBF&#8208;Cu, GeFHBF&#8208;Cu and TIFHBF&#8208;Cu) are successfully fabricated for H2 purification. Pore size is precisely tuned at the picometer scale (&lt; 1&#160;&#197;) by altering the anion linkers (SiF62&#8722;, GeF62&#8722; and TiF62&#8722;), enabling efficient H2 purification through the synergy between subtle window adjustments and F&#8208;site&#8208;enhanced CO2 affinity. The SIFHBF&#8208;Cu membrane combines the optimal size&#8208;exclusion and strongest HBF&#8208;CO2 interactions, exhibiting excellent H2/CO2 selectivity (501) and ternary gas separation (H2/CO2: 477, H2/CH4: 557), with stable performance under dry/wet conditions. This study provides a strategy for ultra&#8208;precise pore engineering, showing potential for other challenging separations like seawater desalination and isomer separation.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Bridged Biphasic Molybdenum Carbide Interfaces: A Synergistic Catalyst for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the effectiveness of the synergistic adsorption/desorption/catalysis mechanism in enabling a solid&#8211;solid conversion pathway for Li&#8211;Se batteries. This article not only addresses the issue of solid&#8211;solid conversion kinetics in Li&#8211;Se batteries, but also realizes a paradigm shift from material design to reaction pathway through the &#8220;atomic bridging&#8208;multiphase synergy&#8221; strategy, opening up a new direction for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.








Abstract
Transition metal catalysts are key to developing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;selenium (Li&#8208;Se) batteries. Herein, we report a rationally designed Ni&#8208;bridged biphasic molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) with a multi&#8208;interface structure that exposes abundant active sites and significantly enhances the electrochemically reversibility of Li&#8211;Se batteries under high current operation. The synergistic integration of catalytic and conductive functions facilitates the rapid deposition and conversion of Se/Li2Sex, effectively preventing electrode passivation caused by inactive accumulation during high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;term cycling. Furthermore, Ni serves dual roles as a structural bridge to link Mo2C lattice and an electronic modulator to optimize the d&#8208;orbital configuration of Mo, thereby maximizing the catalytic efficiency of functionalized Mo2C. The synergistic effects of adsorption, desorption, and catalysis enable the rationally designed metal carbide/Se electrode to promote not only the rapid conversion of long&#8208;chain Li2Sen species but also the solid&#8211;solid transformation of Li2Se2 into Li2Se. As a result, the electrode achieves full&#8208;process catalytic conversion in Li&#8211;Se batteries, delivering excellent cycling stability and high&#8208;rate performance. Even under high Se loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), the electrode delivers an initial capacity of 400&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C. These results highlight the effectiveness of the synergistic adsorption/desorption/catalysis mechanism in enabling a fast solid&#8211;solid conversion pathway for Li&#8211;Se batteries.

         <title>Directing the Electrochemical C&#9472;N Coupling Toward Efficient Amide Synthesis via Ammonia Activation&#8208;Mediated Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ammonia&#8208;activation mediated pathway is presented to favor the oxidative C&#9472;N coupling necessary for formamide electrosynthesis using alcohol and ammonia as feedstocks. This manipulated process begins with the oxidation of ammonia to endow active *NH2 species, which exhibits accelerated kinetics and, more importantly, bypasses the formation of unfavorable aldehyde intermediate.








Abstract
Electrochemically oxidative C&#9472;N coupling using alcohol and ammonia as feedstocks offers a sustainable alternative for the chemosynthesis of amide organonitrogens. The achievements of high activity and selectivity yet remains challenging via the conventional alcohol oxidation pathway. Here, we present an alternative ammonia&#8208;activation mediated pathway to favor the electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling necessary. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations untangle that this manipulated process begins with the oxidation of ammonia to endow active *NH2 species, which then efficiently couple with alcohol species to form C&#9472;N bonds. This alternative C&#9472;N coupling pathway exhibits accelerated kinetics and, more importantly, bypasses the formation of aldehyde intermediate, thereby preventing unfavorable overoxidation. As a result, this pathway achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 50.1% and a carbon selectivity of 87.6% for efficient formamide electrosynthesis over a NiCuRu&#8208;based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, with a productivity of 557.2&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Such electrosynthetic approach further exhibit the universality of waste biomass/plastics&#8208;driven carbon feedstocks, achieving considerable Faradaic efficiencies of 32%&#8211;60%. Techno&#8208;economic analysis confirms the potential profitability of using renewable electricity input, highlighting the significant advantages of green chemical manufacturing for sustainable development.

         <title>Discovery of a Heme&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Catalyzing Nitrogen&#8211;Nitrogen Bond Formation in Kinamycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected heme&#8208;dependent enzyme, Alp1J, was identified as the catalyst that installs N&#9472;N bond in kinamycin biosynthesis. Alp1J forms a stable complex with ferredoxin Alp1I, which is essential for activity. Together they convert l&#8208;aspartate and nitrite into a hydrazine intermediate through a four&#8208;electron reductive pathway. The discovery establishes a platform for genome mining and synthetic biology aimed at novel N&#9472;N&#8208;containing therapeutics.








Abstract
A nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen (N&#9472;N) bond is a core feature of diverse natural products with interesting structural and biological properties. Kinamycin and lomaiviticin, featuring a diazobenzo[b]fluorene core, exhibit exceptional potency as chemotherapeutic agents. However, the N&#9472;N bond forming step in their biosynthesis has remained elusive. Through extensive mutagenesis and biochemical studies, we herein report that Alp1J, belonging to a new family of heme&#8208;dependent enzymes, catalyzes the N&#9472;N bond formation in kinamycin biosynthesis. Interestingly, Alp1J forms a stable complex with its partner ferredoxin Alp1I, which can protect the cofactors and is critical for the N&#9472;N bond formation activity. With its partner ferredoxin, Alp1J catalyzes formation of the hydrazine intermediate directly from l&#8208;aspartate and nitrite by a pathway involving four&#8208;electron reduction. Our findings expand the knowledge of enzymatic N&#9472;N bond formation and show the potential for the discovery and development of novel N&#9472;N bond containing natural products through genome mining and synthetic biology.

         <title>Harnessing Halogen Bonds in Porous Molecular Crystals for Efficient SF6/N2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a triptycene&#8208;based porous molecular crystal in which crystal dislocation exposes &#963;&#8208;holes to the pore surface, enabling strong halogen&#8208;bonding interactions with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and achieving high SF6/N2 selectivity. This study showcases the remarkable potential of halogen bonding in gas separation and in the discovery of novel porous materials.








Abstract
Halogen bonding offers a directional and tunable noncovalent interaction that remains underexplored in the design of porous molecular materials. Here, we report FPMC&#8208;1&#8208;&#946;, a porous molecular crystal that uniquely integrates permanent porosity, high thermal stability, solution processability, and halogen bonding capability. Upon desolvation, FPMC&#8208;1&#8208;&#945; undergoes a structural transformation into the denser FPMC&#8208;1&#8208;&#946; phase, featuring distorted 1D channels lined with exposed &#963;&#8208;holes on bromine atoms. This architecture enables selective halogen bond&#8208;mediated interactions with fluorinated gases. FPMC&#8208;1&#8208;&#946; exhibits a sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)/N2 selectivity of 178.6 at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar&#8212;setting a new record among all reported porous molecular crystals and soluble porous materials. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that the high selectivity arises from strong F&#8943;Br halogen bonding with SF6, in contrast to the weak, nonspecific interactions observed for N2.

         <title>Smart Adaptive Artificial Channels Triggered by Hypoxia for Highly Selective Apoptosis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of adaptive artificial channels activatable under hypoxic conditions were developed. Hypoxia&#8208;induced bioreduction triggers the rapid release of channel&#8208;forming units, which dimerize into chloride channels or further evolve into nanopores at high concentrations in the presence of cholesterol, exhibiting exceptional selectivity in killing liver cancer cells.








Abstract
In nature, hypoxia&#8208;sensitive ion channels regulate the ion transport in response to oxygen levels, which are critical for cellular adaptation to low&#8208;oxygen environments. However, this intriguing stimuli&#8208;responsive property has yet to be replicated in artificial ion channels designed to mimic the essential functions of their natural counterparts. Herein, we introduce a novel class of adaptive artificial channels activatable under hypoxic conditions in cancer cells. Reductase&#8208;mediated reduction of nitro and/or azo groups triggers the rapid release of channel&#8208;forming units, which dimerize into chloride channels or further assemble into nanopores of varying cavity sizes at high concentrations in the presence of cholesterol. Upon activation, the most sensitive channel, C1, demonstrates an 18.1&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an IC50 of 2.9&#160;&#181;M. Remarkably, C1 exhibits exceptional selectivity for liver cancer cells over normal liver cells, with a selectivity index of 17.9, surpassing that of doxorubicin by 44.8 folds while maintaining comparable anticancer efficacy.

         <title>Reliable Determination of Photoreaction Kinetics and Cyclization/Cycloreversion Quantum Yields for Dithienylethene Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal model describing photoreaction kinetics in dithienylethene (DTE) systems is presented. It enables reliable determination of photocyclization and photocycloreversion quantum yields under various conditions. It is applicable to a broad range of photoswitch concentrations and accounts for competitive reactions. Statistical treatment of the complete data series reduces the influence of individual measurement errors.








Abstract
A universal and flexible model fully describing photoreaction kinetics in dithienylethene (DTE) systems is presented. The proposed method enables reliable determination of photocyclization and photocycloreversion quantum yields at various conditions. Most importantly, it is applicable to a broad range of photoswitch concentrations and accounts for competitive reactions, such as annulation of the closed form. By employing both analytical and numerical solutions to the kinetic equations, we achieve consistent results: the numerical method ensures high accuracy in quantum yield determination, while the analytical method allows for the prediction of DTE photoreaction behavior. The robustness of the model was validated across four distinct DTE photoswitches under varying concentrations, solvents, excitation wavelengths conditions, demonstrating its broad applicability and reliability.

         <title>Atomic Coordination Engineering of Sub&#8208;Nanometer Cu Clusters for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise steering of the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ alcohols reaction pathway remains a key challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that coordination engineering of Cu sub&#8208;nanometer clusters enables effectively modulation of bond strengths (Cu&#9472;C, C&#9472;O and Cu&#9472;O) in key intermediates (*CO and *OCHCH2). This strategy successfully diverts the product distribution from ethylene dominance toward C2+ alcohols, achieving a remarkable alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of 7.21.








Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols remains a substantial challenge due to the competing ethylene pathway. Precisely tuning the bond energy of key intermediates plays an essential role in dictating the alcohol and ethylene pathway. Herein, we demonstrate that S and N coordinated Cu sub&#8208;nanometer clusters (Cu/SNC) can achieve targeted modulation of the bond energy (Cu&#9472;C, C&#9472;O, and Cu&#9472;O) of multiple key intermediates (*CO and *OCHCH2), thus leading to preferential production of C2+ alcohols rather than ethylene. Notably, Cu/SNC exhibited a C2+ alcohols selectivity of 59.1% and a high alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of 7.21, which is 19 times larger than that without S and N coordination. Mechanistic studies reveal that N and S dopants individually facilitate CO2 activation and lower the *CO adsorption energy barrier, synergistically steering the asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling pathway to promote C2+ species formation. Moreover, N and S co&#8208;coordination enables precise modulation of the adsorption behavior of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. This electronic restructuring weakens Cu&#9472;O interactions while strengthening the C&#9472;O bond, thereby preferentially stabilizing alcohol&#8208;forming pathways. This work provides a framework for precisely regulating the reaction pathway toward the highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ alcohols.

This electronic restructuring weakens Cu&#9472;O interactions while strengthening the C&#9472;O bond, thereby preferentially stabilizing alcohol-forming pathways. This work provides a framework for precisely regulating the reaction pathway toward the highly selective electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; alcohols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Energy Density Heterostructured Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes Enabled by Mechanical&#8208;Chemical Coupling Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the design of P2/O3 heterostructure cathode with mechanical&#8208;chemical coupling effect, problems such as poor air stability, poor structural stability, and slow Na+ transport kinetics in layered oxide cathode have been alleviated. Additionally, the intrinsic mechanism underlying the superior performance of P2/O3 heterostructure cathode has been innovatively elucidated from a mechanical stress perspective. Therefore, this P2/O3 core&#8208;shell structure design with mechanical&#8208;chemical coupling effects will provide new insights for the future development of sodium&#8208;based oxide cathode.








Abstract
Designing cobalt&#8208;free manganese&#8208;based oxide cathode materials with high energy density and excellent stability is of great significance and a challenge. Here, we construct a P2/O3 core&#8211;shell heterostructured layered oxide cathode material with a mechanical&#8208;chemical coupling effect to achieve precise structural modulation and superior electrochemical performance. Using O3&#8208;NaNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 as the core material, the P2/O3 core&#8211;shell heterostructured cathode was obtained by accurately regulating the epitaxial layer. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the O3 bulk phase and P2 shell layer, this heterostructured cathode shows a high energy density (587.34 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1, based on cathode active materials), excellent structure, superior air stability, and full cell performance. The phase transition mechanism of the cathode as well as the atomic arrangement characteristics were analyzed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), respectively. Most importantly, it was verified using stress simulation calculations that the P2 shell layer can share the mechanical stress of the internal O3 bulk phase on a micro&#8208;scale, suppressing the plastic yielding and structural degradation of the material during electrochemical processes, and dramatically enhancing the structural stability. The heterostructured cathode with the mechanical&#8208;chemical coupling effect designed in this study will provide new insights for the optimization of other electrode materials.

         <title>Breaking Solubility Limitation via Molecule Design to Build Localized Ultrahigh&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of localized ultrahigh&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LUCEs) with the molar ratio of Li+ and solvent (nLi+/nSol.) as high as 1.8 have been achieved, in which one solvent by two Li+ (2Li+&#8208;Sol.) structure greatly enhances Li+ transference number (LTN), the anion rich solvation structures facilitate the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich thin solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with Coulombic efficiency (CE) up to 99.97%, and the scarce free solvents largely elevate the high&#8208;voltage stability.








Abstract
The increase in salt concentration of electrolytes has been known as a simple but effective approach to restrain solvent activity and regulate solvation structure, thus enabling the long&#8208;term interfacial stability of batteries. Nevertheless, the ion electrostatic intercalations and finite coordination states have frustrated the efforts to further elevate the salt solubility. Here, we break the upper limit of lithium&#8208;salt dissolution through a molecule engineering strategy, in which the solvent with three ether&#8208;oxygen groups provides multi&#8208;coordination sites and the intrinsically inert diluents with low steric hindrance are activated to shield electrostatic repulsion. As a result, a series of localized ultrahigh&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LUCEs) are prepared with a molar ratio of Li+ to the solvent as high as 1.8. The LUCEs are endowed with high Li+ transference number&#160;of 0.682, high Coulombic efficiency for lithium plating/stripping up to 99.97%, and high oxidation stability over 6.5&#160;V. Meanwhile, the scarce free solvent promotes the formation of a robust inorganic&#8208;rich interphase on both the lithium anode and a high&#8208;voltage cathode, which enables the operation of Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries over 180 cycles (&gt;80% capacity retention) under a lean lithium source (20&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;loading cathode (3.885 mAh cm&#8722;2). Our work elucidates the underlying mechanism of salt dissolution chemistry and offers an affordable method for stabilizing energy&#8208;dense electrochemical storage devices.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Rapid Moisture&#8208;Driven Actuation and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an ionic covalent organic framework membrane that responds to humidity within1 s, enabling reversible bending, sensing, and switching behaviors. The integration of guanidinium linkers enhances water affinity and structural adaptability. With high mechanical resilience and environmental responsiveness, the membrane offers promising potential for smart actuators, soft electronics, and moisture sensing applications.








Abstract
The development of smart materials capable of rapid and reversible responses to ambient humidity is essential for next&#8208;generation sensors, monitoring systems, and adaptive devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with their tunable porosity and designable architectures, represent a promising class of materials for such stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, yet practical implementation remains limited. In this study, we report a self&#8208;standing ionic COF membrane, synthesized by integrating hydrogen&#8208;bonding ionic functionalities into the framework backbone. This rational design endows the membrane with exceptional moisture&#8208;driven actuation and sensing behavior. The unique hydrogen bonding interactions within the framework facilitate rapid water uptake and release, enabling a rapid response time of&#160;1&#160;s. The membrane demonstrates excellent mechanical flexibility, high water sorption capacity, and robust cycling durability. Results from DFT calculations and MD simulations revealed that water molecules could strongly adsorb onto the membrane via hydrogen bonding to modulate its micropore structure and facilitate its responsive behavior. Furthermore, its responsive behavior to subtle humidity changes makes it suitable for applications such as human&#8208;interfacing soft actuators, smart switches, and soil moisture sensors. This study highlights the utility of ionic COF membranes as a versatile platform for creating next&#8208;generation intelligent materials.

         <title>Flipping of a Non&#8208;productive Substrate Binding Conformation Facilitates Hydroxynitrile Lyase Catalyzed Hydrocyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;productive substrate binding conformation was identified in the PcHNL5L331A mutant by crystallography and computation. Destabilizing this state through mutagenesis led to a triple mutant with enhanced hydrocyanation activity. These findings highlight a strategy to improve enzyme function by targeting unfavorable states associated with substrate binding.








Abstract
Understanding enzyme&#8211;substrate conformational transformations is crucial to the design and engineering of biocatalysts. However, the mechanisms by which substrates undergo dynamic transformations that regulate the function of an enzyme remain poorly understood. Hydroxynitrile lyase from Prunus communis (PcHNL5) catalyzes the cleavage of cyanohydrins. Its reverse reaction holds significant synthetic potential for the preparation of pharmaceutical precursors. Using a combination of crystallography and computational experiments, a novel flipped substrate binding state is identified within the substrate tunnel of the PcHNL5L331A mutant. This binding state is non&#8208;productive and undergoes a conformational change before the catalytic cycle can proceed. Site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis led to the discovery of a triple mutant, PcHNL5L331A/S333V/P340L, that destabilizes the non&#8208;productive substrate binding state thereby facilitating its transition to the catalytically productive conformation and significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency. Crystallographic studies provide a structural description of the factors that stabilize versus destabilize the different binding conformers in the different enzyme variants and thus the differing catalytic efficiencies. These findings demonstrate that destabilizing unfavorable substrate binding conformations within an enzyme active site can improve functionality and provide a promising strategy for designing efficient biocatalysts.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Asymmetric Wettability for Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework membranes with asymmetric wettability enable efficient photocatalytic H2O2. production through synergistic enhancement of triphase mass transfer and photocatalytic activity, and can be further integrated into diverse membrane reactors for organic pollutant degradation using in situ generated H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis from air and water is a sustainable route but hindered by mass transport and charge separation issues. Here, covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with asymmetric wettability are developed to construct triphase interfaces, locally enriching O2 and H2O for efficient reactions. Converting COF powders into nanostructured membranes enhances light absorption and band alignment, promoting water oxidation and charge separation. These synergistic effects boost H2O2 production to 52.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under O2, with an apparent quantum yield 27.8 times higher than powders, and up to 148.9&#8208;fold under air. The flexible membranes can be integrated into reactors, and the in situ generated H2O2 enables pollutant degradation. This work demonstrates a versatile strategy for high&#8208;performance triphase photocatalysis and multifunctional membrane catalysts toward sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>A Theory&#8208;Driven Moderation Strategy for Electrolyte Design Unlocks Stable Aqueous Zinc Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the Sabatier principle and theoretical calculations, this work establishes a non&#8208;extremum model for additive screening to balance the relationship between additive theoretically properties and the solvation/interface stability in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery electrolytes. Using alcohol molecules as a model system, 1,6&#8208;hexanediol with balanced interfacial parameters enables highly reversible Zn deposition.








Abstract
How theoretically screened solvation characteristics of additives affect zinc deposition behavior has emerged as a critical question of both scientific and practical relevance. Here, using a series of structurally analogous alcohol&#8208;based molecules as a model system and guided by theoretical calculations, we establish a non&#8208;extremum empirical model for additive screening to balance the relationship between additive theoretically properties and the solvation/interface stability in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery electrolytes. Solvation capability, adsorption strength, and interfacial electrostatic properties were calculated to directly probe the critical role of a balanced set of molecular parameters in modulating Zn2+ coordination structure and interface stability. As a result, 1,6&#8208;hexanediol, exhibited a set of balanced and non&#8208;extremum molecular parameters, significantly enhanced the reversibility of zinc deposition/stripping, delivered the best electrochemical performance that extending the cycling lifespan to 2&#160;600&#160;h, which is consistent with the Sabatier principle. This study provides a new theoretical perspective for the rational screen of electrolyte additives and highlights the importance of expanding the selection criteria for optimizing interfacial stability.

Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrogen species offers a sustainable route to mitigate environmental nitrogen pollution while enabling the production of value&#8208;added chemicals such as ammonia, hydroxylamine, and C&#9472;N coupled organonitrogen compounds. However, the practical implementation of conventional potentiostatic methods is hindered by poor product selectivity and competing hydrogen evolution. Pulsed electrolysis has emerged as a transformative strategy to address these challenges by synchronizing catalyst surface dynamics with local microenvironmental changes and reaction kinetics. This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advances in pulsed electrolysis for nitrogen species reduction, with a particular focus on how dynamic potentials influence electrocatalyst behavior and the surrounding reaction environment. Key mechanistic insights and cutting&#8208;edge research findings are discussed, followed by an outlook on established systems and future directions toward scalable and energy&#8208;efficient nitrogen activation.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Directed C&#9472;C Coupling inside Three&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks for CO2 Electroreduction to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) was designed for transforming CO2 to C2 products within its channels. The unique spatial arrangement of the neighboring Fe sites facilitates the C&#9472;C coupling reaction of the *OCH2 intermediates, promoting the formation of CH3CH2OH and C2H4.








Abstract
The CO2 electroreduction reaction to fuels and chemicals is a promising strategy for storing intermittent energy (such as sunlight and wind power) and closing the carbon cycle. Producing multi&#8208;carbon oxygenates and hydrocarbons (C2+) with broader applicability is highly desirable. However, the difficulty of the C&#9472;C coupling reaction hinders the conversion of CO2 to C2+ products with high energy input, low reaction rate, and poor selectivity. Here, we construct a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Fe&#8208;quinoxalinedithiol (Fe&#8208;QDT)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) featuring dual Fe sites within its ordered channel walls, enabling efficient interwall electrocatalysis for C2 coupling reactions. We found that dual Fe sites can co&#8208;catalyze the dimerization of *OCH2 to *OCH2CH2O*, thus facilitating the generation of C2 products. The free energy changes for the potential&#8208;limiting steps in the electroreduction of C2 species are &#8722;0.010 and 0.045&#160;eV for CH3CH2OH and C2H4, respectively, which are significantly lower than those for other C2 products. Consequently, the Fe&#8208;QDT MOFs demonstrate high activity and selectivity in converting CO2 to CH3CH2OH and C2H4. This work designs a novel and efficient active site for C&#9472;C coupling and provides valuable insights into the design principles of electrocatalysts for C2 products.

         <title>Enhancing NMR Signals in Liquids by Fluorine&#8208;19 Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) and Hyperpolarization Transfer to Carbon&#8208;13</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine nuclear spins can be hyperpolarized in solution by Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization from a paramagnetic agent like galvinoxyl. This hyperpolarization can be transferred by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to nearby 13C, leading to 13C signal enhancements up to &#8764;100. The method opens new opportunities for NMR structural determination of fluorine&#8208;containing drugs and synthetic molecules.








Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) plays an essential role in life and material science but suffers from low sensitivity due to the small energy differences it aims to detect. Therefore, techniques that can increase spin polarization, and thus sensitivity, in NMR are gaining tremendous attention. Overhauser effect dynamic nuclear polarization (OE&#8208;DNP) can increase multidimensional NMR signals of small molecules in liquid solutions; however, at high magnetic fields, the direct mechanism to 13C is site selective, while it is poorly efficient for 1H. Here, we report OE&#8208;DNP hyperpolarization of fluorine&#8208;19 (19F) nuclei at 9.4&#160;T, thus expanding the methodological toolbox of 19F NMR. Signal enhancements up to &#8764;20 under steady&#8208;state conditions can be used to either rapidly detect 19F resonances or to enhance through&#8208;bond J&#8208;coupled 13C nuclei by two orders of magnitude. The latter corresponds to a 104 gain in signal acquisition. We demonstrate this with 19F&#8594;13C INEPT (insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer) spectra of the drug flutrimazole at 13C natural abundance, where quaternary carbons become readily detectable, opening perspectives for accelerated NMR on fluorinated drugs or small molecules. The results are corroborated by a theoretical analysis of 19F OE&#8208;DNP coupling factors.

We demonstrate this with &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C INEPT (insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer) spectra of the drug flutrimazole at &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C natural abundance, where quaternary carbons become readily detectable, opening perspectives for accelerated NMR on fluorinated drugs or small molecules. The results are corroborated by a theoretical analysis of &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F OE-DNP coupling factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Scalable Production of Ultra&#8208;Stable Alkyl MOF Featuring Single&#8208;Molecule C3H6 Trap for Record Capture of Trace C3H6 from C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule C3H6 trap based on a low&#8208;polarity aliphatic ultra&#8208;stable Al&#8208;CDC with the opposite dual hydrogen&#8208;bonding and dense alkyl sites is established, which presents a record uptake at trace level, Henry coefficient, initial adsorption heat difference, adsorption kinetics for C3H6 and C2H4 productivity with one of the highest IAST selectivity and initial C3H6 adsorption heat. Scalable production and shaped pellets of Al&#8208;CDC have also been achieved with the highest STY and lowest production cost.








Abstract
Highly efficient capture of trace C3H6 from C2H4 by physisorbents remains an enormous challenge to combine top&#8208;rank separation performance with excellent stability and economical scalability. We, herein, built a single&#8208;molecule C3H6 trap that bears an opposite series of oxygen and dense alkyl groups distributed in an ultramicroporous [Al(OH)(trans&#8208;CDC)] (Al&#8208;CDC, trans&#8208;H2CDC&#160;=&#160;trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid). The ultra&#8208;stable trap with well&#8208;matched pore size and pore chemistry enables a record uptake (40.8 cm3(STP) g&#8722;1) at ultralow concentration, Henry coefficient (12685.5 cm3(STP) g&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1), initial adsorption heat difference (27.2&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1), adsorption kinetic (0.49 min&#8722;1) and kinetic selectivity (3.1) for C3H6 with one of the highest initial C3H6 adsorption heats (50.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) and selectivity (16.3), establishing a novel benchmark for capture of trace C3H6. The C3H6 adsorption mechanism is deciphered to be thermodynamically driven owing to the synergism of multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding and van der Waals (vdW) forces. Breakthrough tests validate that Al&#8208;CDC owns a record C2H4 productivity (&#8805;99.999%) of 410.5 cm3(STP) g&#8722;1 for trace C3H6 capture with excellent reproducibility. The cost&#8208;effective scalable production with the cheapest cost (508.9 $ kg&#8722;1) and highest space&#8208;time yield (4564.8&#160;kg m&#8722;3 day&#8722;1) and shaping of Al&#8208;CDC is realized with unaffected structural property and capture performance.

         <title>Complete Recycling of Polyester Wastes with Dialkyl Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PET can be completely depolymerized into dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) using dimethyl carbonate (DMC) catalyzed by [N4444]Cl at 80&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C. Based on this reaction, highly efficient and complete degradation of PET in various blended textiles has been achieved, yielding DMT while preserving the structural integrity of other components, including both natural and synthetic fibers.








Abstract
Chemical and biological recycling of spent polyesters is of great significance for solving problems caused by their accumulation, but generally suffering from requirements for high temperature, specific catalysts or enzymes, and incomplete depolymerization in most cases. Here, we report a novel strategy for complete depolymerization of polyesters (e.g., poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET) with dialkyl carbonates (e.g., dimethyl carbonate, DMC) into monomers over halide salts (e.g., tetrabutylammonium chloride, [N4444]Cl) under mild conditions. We demonstrate that PET can be completely degraded into dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) using DMC over [N4444]Cl at temperatures of 80&#8764;120 &#176;C. Based on this reaction, we have achieved highly efficient and complete depolymerization of PET in various PET blend textiles into DMT while preserving the structural integrity of other components including natural and synthetic components. Mechanistic studies reveal the key role of methoxy anion derived from DMC in cleaving the acyl C&#9472;O bond of polyesters. Techno&#8208;economic assessment for recycling of spent PET wastes demonstrates excellent economic profit.

         <title>Linkage Multi&#8208;functionalization in Covalent Organic Frameworks via Criss&#8211;Cross 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;functionalization of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been achieved by the criss&#8211;cross 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition between azine linkages in the precursor COFs and alkynes carrying various functional groups. The general applicability and high efficiency of this method have been demonstrated by the synthesis of various COFs with excellent tolerance of a wide range of functional groups.








Abstract
Introducing functional groups to skeletons of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is fundamentally important to create specific properties and functions for this class of crystalline porous polymers. The strategy of multi&#8208;functionalization could introduce multiple functional groups in one&#8208;step but has rarely been developed for polymers. Herein, we report a novel linkage conversion strategy which could simultaneously install multiple functional groups into a single site of azine&#8208;linked COFs. This strategy is based on criss&#8211;cross 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction between azine linkages in COFs and multifarious alkynes carrying different functional groups. Its general applicability and high efficiency have been demonstrated by the successful construction of more than 10 COFs with widespread functional groups, for which homo&#8208;type and hetero&#8208;type functional groups could be introduced. This study provides a general and powerful tool to introduce highly dense functional groups into nanopores of COFs, enabling the further exploration of their applications bestowed by the functional groups.

         <title>Photochromic Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2 Perovskite Nanosheets as a Novel Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our synthesized NO3&#8208;&#8208;doped Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2 perovskite nanosheets exhibit good stability and reversible light&#8208;induced phase separation to CsPb2Br5, accompanied by a tunable photoluminescence transition from 588&#160;nm (orange) to 521&#160;nm (green). This transformation enables the design of a UV&#8208;power&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform.








Abstract
Although the photoinduced segregation phenomenon of mixed halide perovskites has application potential in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage, the easy oxidation of I&#8208; into highly volatile I2 leads to a serious deficiency in material stability. In this study, we addressed this issue by substituting the instable anion of I&#8208; with the stable anion of NO3&#8208; and synthesizing a novel photochromic 2D perovskite of Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2 nanosheets (PNSs). The synthesized functional material exhibited significantly enhanced stability, maintaining stable luminescence under ambient conditions for over a year, far surpassing traditional mixed halide perovskites. Further research revealed that reversible photoluminescence switching between orange and green in Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2 PNSs suspension could be achieved by regulating the UV light power of irradiation and solution concentration, demonstrating the photoinduced segregation phenomenon in non&#8208;halide/halide hybrid perovskites. The photoinduced segregation could be effectively suppressed by doping with Cl&#8208; ions. Based on this photochromic property, we designed a novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting label by exploiting the distinct UV&#8208;response characteristics of Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2 and Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2&#8208;xClx, offering a new design strategy for stimulus&#8208;responsive perovskite materials.

The photoinduced segregation could be effectively suppressed by doping with Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Based on this photochromic property, we designed a novel anti-counterfeiting label by exploiting the distinct UV-response characteristics of Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, offering a new design strategy for stimulus-responsive perovskite materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photoswitchable HaloTag for Spatiotemporal Control of Fluorescence in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable fluorophores are critical for advanced bioimaging. Here, we develop a photoswitchable self&#8208;labeling HaloTag that can reversibly modulate the emission of a bound fluorogenic dye via a light&#8208;induced conformational change. In living cells, this tunable chemigenetic system enables precise spatiotemporal activation and control of emitter density in SMLM.








Abstract
Photosensitive fluorophores, whose emission can be controlled using light, are essential for advanced biological imaging, enabling precise spatiotemporal tracking of molecular features and facilitating super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques. Although irreversibly photoactivatable fluorophores are well established, reversible reporters that can be reactivated multiple times remain scarce, and only a few have been applied in living cells using generalizable protein labeling methods. To address these limitations, we introduce chemigenetic photoswitchable fluorophores, leveraging the self&#8208;labeling HaloTag protein with fluorogenic rhodamine dye ligands. By incorporating a light&#8208;responsive protein domain into HaloTag, we engineer a tunable, photoswitchable HaloTag (psHaloTag), which can reversibly modulate the fluorescence of a bound dye&#8208;ligand via a light&#8208;induced conformational change. Our best performing psHaloTag variants show excellent performance in living cells, with large, reversible, deep&#8208;red fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon 450&#160;nm illumination across various biomolecular targets and SMLM compatibility. Together, this work establishes the chemigenetic approach as a versatile platform for the design of photoswitchable reporters, tunable through both genetic and synthetic modifications, with promising applications for dynamic imaging.

         <title>Rational Engineering of a Pseudaminic Acid Synthase Enzyme Enables Access to a 3&#8208;Fluoro Sugar with Motility Inhibition in Bacterial Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational engineering of a pseudaminic acid synthase enzyme (PseI) enables the synthesis of a 3&#8208;fluorinated pseudaminic acid sugar (3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac), which can be processed to the fluorinated CMP&#8208;donor in vitro by a synthetase enzyme, and impairs the motility of the gut pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, demonstrating the potential utility of fluorinated bacterial &#9082;&#8208;keto acid sugars as anti&#8208;motilins.








Abstract
We report the rational engineering of a pseudaminic acid synthase (PseI), which enables the first synthesis of a 3&#8208;fluorinated pseudaminic acid sugar (3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac), potentially establishing a new class of metabolic inhibitors targeting bacterial glycosylation. Pseudaminic acids are &#9082;&#8208;keto acid sugars essential for O&#8208;glycosylation of flagellin in pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni, where they are critical for motility and virulence. By introducing rational mutations in the PseI active site, we achieve enhanced turnover with unnatural 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phosphoenolpyruvate, facilitating a scalable chemoenzymatic synthesis of the fluorinated sugar. Subsequent treatment of C. jejuni with 3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac resulted in a significant, time&#8208;dependent reduction in motility, and in vitro studies demonstrated bacterial CMP&#8208;pseudaminic acid synthetase enzymes (PseF) can process the fluoro sugar to afford CMP&#8208;3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac, potentially implicating the fluorinated pseudaminic acid or its glycosyltransferase CMP&#8208;donor as an anti&#8208;motilin in vivo. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that fluorinated pseudaminic acids can impair bacterial motility, paving the way for anti&#8208;virulence strategies in pathogenic bacteria. This anti&#8208;motilin approach offers a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics, addressing the urgent need for novel strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance, and could be extended to other bacterial &#9082;&#8208;keto acid sugars.

         <title>Breaking Diffusion Limit in Ester&#8208;Flame&#8208;Proof Na&#8208;Ion Electrolytes Through Solvent Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Develop a descriptor&#8208;guided framework through solvent oxidative stability and Na+ coordination analysis to design flame&#8208;resistant ester electrolytes surpassing diffusion limits. 








Abstract
Traditional electrolyte systems are struggle to meet practical needs for high performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their limited functionality. The design of electrolytes today relies largely on expensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodologies and intricate solvent&#8211;structure engineering, in which various additives and solvents are arbitrarily used without any reasonable selection rules. Motivated by this, we herein establish a descriptor&#8208;guided framework centered on solvent oxidative stability and Na+&#8208;solvent coordination chemistry to identify intrinsically flame&#8208;proof, ester&#8208;based electrolytes that overcome conventional diffusion limits. By screening a number of fluorinated phosphate and cyclic carbonate candidates, the electrolytes with the comprehensive properties, including the electrolyte desolvation processes, oxidation resistance, and flame retardancy, were successfully designed and synthesized, thereby realizing intrinsic flameproofing with fast&#8208;charging capability. Impressively, our optimized electrolytes sustain over 98% capacity retention for 350 cycles at 1.0 C with a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% when deployed in Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cells, whereas benchmark carbonate systems fail within a few tens of cycles. By linking the explicit performance descriptors of solvent electronic structure and ion&#8211;solvent coordination, this work delivers a rational pathway to flame&#8208;proof and high&#8208;rate SIB electrolytes, breaking the long&#8208;standing diffusion limit and brute&#8208;force screening.

         <title>Three&#8208;Segment Protein Labeling Using a Highly Efficient and Cysteine&#8208;Less Split Intein Identified with Computational Prediction of Aggregation Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem protein trans&#8208;splicing (PTS) assembles a protein from three segments. Expanding this technology to individually treat cysteines in each segment, for example, for chemical labeling using thiol bioconjugation, the authors identify a second, highly efficient cysteine&#8208;less split intein. Using computational, sequence&#8208;based analysis of new split intein candidate genes, they streamline the split intein discovery process for the first time by eliminating candidates with a high aggregation propensity that have poor splicing yields.








Abstract
Split inteins are versatile tools in protein engineering. We envisaged a new tandem protein trans&#8208;splicing (PTS) scheme to assemble a protein from three segments, of which each can be individually treated with regard to its cysteine oxidation or chemical labeling status. However, only a single highly efficient cysteine&#8208;less split intein has been reported so far. Split intein activities are currently not predictable and require time&#8208;consuming biochemical characterizations. We aimed to accelerate the discovery of novel split inteins with high splicing efficiency by computational sequence analysis. Inspired by our previous finding that linked reduced splicing efficiency of characterized split intein fragments to soluble, &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich amyloid&#8208;like aggregates, we confirmed the inverse correlation between predicted aggregation propensity and splicing efficiency for new intein candidates by size&#8208;exclusion chromatography and biochemical analysis. The LCGC14 intein emerged as a second available cysteine&#8208;less split intein with virtually quantitative splicing efficiency, significantly expanding protein engineering opportunities independent of thiol chemistries or in oxidizing conditions. We exploit the orthogonality to the cysteine&#8208;less CLm intein to assemble proteins from three selectively labeled segments, as demonstrated for a trimodular non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The prediction of split intein efficiency from their sequence is a significant advancement to streamline future discovery processes.

         <title>Empowering Chemistry Experts with Large Language Models for Literature Interpretation in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis Toward Advanced Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large language models now enable chemistry experts to extract structured data&#160;from voluminous literatures. Here we present a human&#8208;centered workflow that lets chemistry experts explore, curate, and formalize LLM&#8208;extracted data without programming barriers. This work establishes a practical paradigm for collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence and urges chemistry experts to work directly with the extracted data to safeguard human judgment, chemical intuition, and critical thinking at the center of discovery.








Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) hold considerable promise for large&#8208;scale data extraction from scientific literatures for catalyst design and practical optimization. Yet, turning such outputs into reliable, formalized chemical knowledge would heavily rely on domain expertise rather than end&#8208;to&#8208;end automation. Herein, we present a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop workflow integrating LLM&#8208;facilitated structured data extraction with iterative, expert&#8208;guided curation and analysis. As a proof of concept, we take single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as an example, enabling efficient data extraction, rigorous curation, and statistically driven interpretation. Thus, we uncover the key correlations among metal types, coordination environments, reaction substances, and catalytic performance, providing deeper mechanism insights into SAC&#8208;driven AOPs. In contrast to fully automated, end&#8208;to&#8208;end models, our approach relies on human&#8208;driven optimization at multiple stages, and underscores human insight as central to understand LLM outputs. By introducing human&#8208;driven prompt refinement, model comparison, and expert&#8208;led analysis, our method ensures that human cognition remains central to interpreting LLM outputs and converting structured data into reliable scientific knowledge. Our work addresses the limitations inherent in fully automated, end&#8208;to&#8208;end methodologies and effectively bridges the gap between structured outputs and catalytically meaningful insights.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methanol: A Roadmap toward Practical Implementation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review integrates techno&#8208;economic analyses, mechanistic insights, theoretical calculations, and catalyst design strategies for electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MeOH) conversion. Emphasis is placed on key intermediates, pathway divergence, and the role of surface chemistry and operating conditions. Together, these perspectives establish principles for selective, scalable, and economically viable MeOH production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol (MeOH) unites two urgent global needs, carbon recycling and renewable energy storage, into a single, compelling chemical transformation. According to recent techno&#8208;economic analyses, commercially competitive MeOH production (at &#8776;$190 per ton) can be achieved via electroreduction by meeting practical targets for current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and stability. Moreover, MeOH's high energy density (16&#160;MJ&#160;L&#8722;1), substantial hydrogen content (100&#160;g H2 per L), and low storage and transport costs further underscore its strong economic potential. Yet, the complexity of the six&#8208;electron&#8211;proton transfer (ET&#8211;PT) process that governs its formation remains intrinsically complex, with competing pathways threatening selectivity at every stage. This review critically examines current mechanistic insights, highlighting key intermediates such as CO and OCH3, and demonstrating how catalyst surfaces and reaction conditions profoundly influence pathway divergence. We highlight recent advances in catalyst development that exploit a fundamental, molecular&#8208;level understanding of intermediate stabilization to deliver unprecedented MeOH selectivity and activity. Through detailed analysis of operational parameters&#8212;including mass transport dynamics, electrolyte composition, and applied potentials&#8212;this work provides a comprehensive framework for rational catalyst development. Together, these insights converge design principles for next&#8208;generation electrocatalysts capable of selectively converting CO2&#8208;to&#8208;MeOH at scale, advancing economically viable and environmentally sustainable MeOH production.

         <title>Targeting Aurora Kinases as Essential Cell&#8208;Cycle Regulators to Deliver Multi&#8208;Stage Antimalarials Against Plasmodium Falciparum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we repurposed human Aurora kinase&#8208;specific inhibitors to identify potential antimalarial agents. Two inhibitors, hesperadin and TAE684, exhibited sub&#8208;micromolar activity across multiple parasite stages, with hesperadin demonstrating significant potency and selectivity by specifically targeting PfArk1. Inhibition of PfArk1 resulted in anaphase&#8208;like abnormalities, pointing to its role as the primary PfArk for cell division in malaria parasites.








Abstract
Kinases play critical roles in the development and adaptation of Plasmodium falciparum and present novel opportunities for chemotherapeutic intervention. Mitotic kinases that regulate the proliferation of the parasites by controlling nuclear division, segregation, and cytokinesis. We evaluated the potential of human Aurora kinase (Aur) inhibitors to prevent P. falciparum development by targeting members of the Aurora&#8208;related kinase (Ark) family in this parasite. Several human AurB inhibitors exhibited multistage potency (&lt; 250&#160;nM) against all proliferative stages of parasite development, including asexual blood stages, liver schizonts, and male gametes. The most potent compounds, hesperadin, TAE684, and AT83, exhibited&#160;&gt;&#160;1000x selectivity towards the parasite. Importantly, we identified PfArk1 as the principal vulnerable Ark family member, with specific inhibition of PfArk1 as the primary target for hesperadin. Hesperadin's whole&#8208;cell and protein activity validates it as a unique PfArk1 tool compound. Inhibition of PfArk1 results in the parasite's inability to complete mitotic processes, presenting with unsegregated, multi&#8208;lobed nuclei caused by aberrant microtubule organization. This suggests PfArk1 is the main Aur mitotic kinase in proliferative stages of Plasmodium, characterized by bifunctional AurA and B activity. This paves the way for drug&#8208;discovery campaigns based on hesperadin targeting PfArk1.

         <title>Access to Inherently and Centrally Chiral Calix[4]Arenes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Activation and Insertion into Diverse Olefins and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrizative C&#8211;H activation allows enantioselective synthesis of calix[4]arenes with inherent chirality (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% ee) and with integrated inherent and central chirality (all&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1 dr, up to 97% ee) via C&#9472;C coupling with alkenes, alkynes, and 1,3&#8208;enynes.








Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes are important scaffolds in asymmetric catalysis and sensing, yet their enantioselective synthesis remains challenging due to limited synthetic methodology and lengthy synthetic routes. By resorting to rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation of calix[4]arene&#8208;based carboxamides, atom&#8208;economical construction of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes has been realized with alkenes, alkynes, and 1,3&#8208;enynes as the coupling partner. Several classes of calix[4]arenes with inherent chirality (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% ee) and integrated inherent and central chirality (up to 97% ee, &gt;20:1 dr) have been readily accessed under nearly unified conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and diverse downstream transformations demonstrated the scalability and broad utility of this methodology to access other calix[4]arene&#8208;fused heterocycles, such as isoquinoline and isoindolinone. Representative products exhibit promising fluorescence properties, suggesting potential applications in organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Integrative Ni1&#8211;Px Catalytic Pairs for Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heart of the Ni&#8211;P integrative catalytic pair (ICP) lies in the dynamic Ni&#8211;C&#8211;O&#8211;H&#8211;O&#8211;P&#8211;Ni hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring that mediates proton transfer and stabilizes key intermediates. This cooperative interaction unlocks efficient CO2 electroreduction under dilute CO2 feeds.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) powered by renewable electricity offers a promising approach for sustainable carbon utilization. However, under industrially relevant low CO2 concentrations (5&#8211;15&#160;vol.%), the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical CO2RR are significantly constrained by the limited CO2 supply and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report integrative Ni1&#8211;Px catalytic pairs (Ni1&#8211;Px/ICPs) that exhibit super CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency under low&#8208;concentration CO2 conditions. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements show that P incorporation modulates the electrochemical microenvironment and accelerates reaction kinetics. H/D isotopic substitution experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a mechanistic transition from an Eley&#8211;Rideal to Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathway, enabled by cooperative adsorption on adjacent Ni and P sites. Notably, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded six&#8208;membered Ni&#8211;C&#8211;O&#8211;H&#8211;O&#8211;P&#8211;Ni ring forms between adsorbed CO2 and H2O, facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and lowering the reaction barrier. This unique adsorption motif enhances CO2 activation, suppresses HER, and enables efficient CO generation at low CO2 concentrations. Our findings show the importance of atomically dispersed catalytic pairs for advancing carbon utilization and overcoming selectivity challenges in electrochemical hydrogenation.

     alt="Integrative Ni1&#8211;Px Catalytic Pairs for Low-Concentration CO2 Electroreduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of the Ni&#8211;P integrative catalytic pair (ICP) lies in the dynamic Ni&#8211;C&#8211;O&#8211;H&#8211;O&#8211;P&#8211;Ni hydrogen-bonded ring that mediates proton transfer and stabilizes key intermediates. This cooperative interaction unlocks efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction under dilute CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feeds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) powered by renewable electricity offers a promising approach for sustainable carbon utilization. However, under industrially relevant low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations (5&#8211;15&#160;vol.%), the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR are significantly constrained by the limited CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supply and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report integrative Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;P&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; catalytic pairs (Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;P&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/ICPs) that exhibit super CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion efficiency under low-concentration CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements show that P incorporation modulates the electrochemical microenvironment and accelerates reaction kinetics. H/D isotopic substitution experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a mechanistic transition from an Eley&#8211;Rideal to Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathway, enabled by cooperative adsorption on adjacent Ni and P sites. Notably, a hydrogen-bonded six-membered Ni&#8211;C&#8211;O&#8211;H&#8211;O&#8211;P&#8211;Ni ring forms between adsorbed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, facilitating proton-coupled electron transfer and lowering the reaction barrier. This unique adsorption motif enhances CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation, suppresses HER, and enables efficient CO generation at low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. Our findings show the importance of atomically dispersed catalytic pairs for advancing carbon utilization and overcoming selectivity challenges in electrochemical hydrogenation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Zn2+&#8208;Activated Channel Transport Through Monomer&#8208;Dimer Interconversion of Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biological Zn2+&#8208;gated channels, we developed a [2]rotaxane&#8208;based artificial ion channel. It features a K+&#8208;transporting sliding ring and a terpyridine unit that enables reversible Zn2+&#8208;dependent switching between carrier and channel states, offering a novel design for gated biomimetic transporters.








Abstract
Inspired by natural ligand&#8208;gated ion channels, artificial counterparts are of great interest for understanding biological transport mechanisms and developing bioinspired functional systems. Here, we report a Zn2+&#8208;activated artificial ion channel from a [2]rotaxane. Its key components are: i) a sliding bis(benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) unit for K&#8314; transport and ii) a Zn2+&#8208;responsive terpyridine thread that provides gating control. The monomeric rotaxane functions as an inactive carrier, whereas Zn2+&#8208;induced dimerization triggers a switch to a highly efficient channel transport mode. This transition is fully reversible with Zn2+ and competitive ligands. As the first biomimetic Zn2+&#8208;gated artificial ion channel, this work provides a novel design strategy for ligand&#8208;regulated transmembrane transporters.

Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction of homoallylic amides with phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) under Pd(II) catalysis delivers 6&#8208;acetoxylated 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazines through the formation of one C&#9472;C and two C&#9472;O bonds.








Abstract
We report a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed migratory triple functionalization of terminal alkenes. The reaction of homoallylic amides with phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) under Pd(II) catalysis delivers 6&#8208;acetoxylated 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazines through the formation of one C&#9472;C and two C&#9472;O bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest a sequence involving oxypalladation, oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV), a 1,2&#8208;alkyl(aryl)/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement (DR), and subsequent acetoxylation. While Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis with PIDA as the oxidant has enabled numerous powerful transformations, the DR reported here is unprecedented.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Decoupled Altitudinal and Azimuthal Triptycene&#8208;Fused Tetrapodal Molecular Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two tetrapodal triptycene&#8208;based light&#8208;driven molecular motors with precisely oriented rotation axes&#8212;parallel or perpendicular to a gold surface&#8212;achieve full 360&#176; rotation in both solution and as monolayers. The design minimizes surface quenching, enabling functional integration into surface&#8208;mounted nanomachines.








Abstract
Two light&#8208;driven molecular motors, fused to a triptycene&#8208;based tetrapodal platform, with rotational axes oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the surface, were successfully designed and synthesized. Both systems demonstrated complete 360&#176; rotation cycles, efficient photoswitching at 385&#160;&#177;&#160;5&#160;nm (reaching &#8764;90% at the photostationary state), and quantitative thermal helix inversion with half&#8208;lives of &#8764;7&#160;min at 20&#160;&#176;C. When assembled as monolayers on gold surfaces, the motors retained their full rotational functionality, demonstrating the ability of the tetrapodal platform to minimize surface interactions. These findings highlight the potential of these systems for applications in surface&#8208;integrated molecular devices and machines.

         <title>Deciphering Ball Milling Mechanochemistry via Molecular Simulations of Collision&#8208;Driven and Liquid&#8208;Assisted Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supported by experiments, molecular dynamics simulations were developed to reveal how mechanochemical reactions, such as between KCl and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with water as a liquid additive, proceed. Product formation is triggered by collision&#8208;induced fragmentation, with liquid content showing a non&#8208;linear effect. These insights clarify how collision energy and additives affect reactivity, aiding the optimization of milling conditions.








Abstract
Mechanochemistry by ball milling proceeds through a series of discrete, high&#8208;energy collisions between milling balls and the sample, yet the molecular&#8208;level processes that govern the resulting chemical and physical transformations remain poorly understood. In this study, we develop a molecular dynamics simulation protocol to investigate a model mechanochemical reaction between potassium chloride (KCl) and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether, both under dry conditions and in the presence of water as a liquid additive. Our simulations reveal that the reaction is initiated by collision&#8208;induced fragmentation of the KCl crystal into individual ions. This process occurs when the absorbed energy per ion pair during a collision exceeds the crystal's cohesion energy. We further show that the addition of a small amount of water facilitates the formation of complexes between potassium ions and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 molecules. However, excessive water content stabilizes the reactants instead, thereby suppressing complex formation. These findings highlight a non&#8208;linear relationship between liquid additive concentration and the reaction outcome. Our approach offers a molecular&#8208;level perspective on mechanochemical reactivity, providing valuable insights that could guide the rational optimization of milling conditions&#8212;particularly the targeted selection and dosing of liquid additives&#8212;to improve reaction efficiency.

         <title>A Multiply and Long&#8208;Chain Branched Polyolefin with Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE)&#8208;Like Properties Containing Two Types of Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of coordinative chain transfer polymerization of ethylene and branched alpha&#8208;olefins, ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization and hydrogenation catalysis yield a highly flexible catalytic synthesis of multiply and long&#8208;chain branched polyolefins under mild conditions with two types of functional groups.








Abstract
Low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) is an important material or plastic, which, unfortunately, is synthesized under very harsh conditions and challenging to recycle. We report here on a highly flexible catalytic synthesis of multiply branched and long&#8208;chain branched polyolefins under mild conditions. We combine coordinative chain transfer polymerization of ethylene and branched alpha&#8208;olefins with ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization and hydrogenation catalysis. Our plastic contains two types of functional groups: olefins and esters. The olefin functional groups can be used to enable closed&#8208;loop recycling, and the ester groups permit faster decomposition than LDPE to potentially reduce the micro&#8208;plastic formation or enable a second depolymerization pathway. Our material matches key properties of LDPE, such as the melting point, rheology and stress&#8211;strain behavior.

&lt;p&gt;The combination of coordinative chain transfer polymerization of ethylene and branched alpha-olefins, ring-opening metathesis polymerization and hydrogenation catalysis yield a highly flexible catalytic synthesis of multiply and long-chain branched polyolefins under mild conditions with two types of functional groups.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is an important material or plastic, which, unfortunately, is synthesized under very harsh conditions and challenging to recycle. We report here on a highly flexible catalytic synthesis of multiply branched and long-chain branched polyolefins under mild conditions. We combine coordinative chain transfer polymerization of ethylene and branched alpha-olefins with ring-opening metathesis polymerization and hydrogenation catalysis. Our plastic contains two types of functional groups: olefins and esters. The olefin functional groups can be used to enable closed-loop recycling, and the ester groups permit faster decomposition than LDPE to potentially reduce the micro-plastic formation or enable a second depolymerization pathway. Our material matches key properties of LDPE, such as the melting point, rheology and stress&#8211;strain behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrawideband Emission of Bi3+ Ions Spanning Visible to Near&#8208;Infrared Spectral Regions (400 nm&#8211;1700 nm)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing Bi3+&#8208;activated K2MgGeO4, ultrawideband luminescence from 400 to 1700&#160;nm is achieved. This achievement overcomes the longstanding challenge of reabsorption&#8208;induced instability, a critical limitation that has persistently hindered the performance of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped broadband emitters designed for 400&#8211;1700&#160;nm ultrawideband emission when coupled with other visible&#8208;light&#8208;emitting components.








Abstract
Although Bi3+ ions exhibit exceptional luminescent properties and spectral tunability, their potential as activators for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) ultrawideband emission remains underexplored, while transition metal ions such as Ni2+, Fe3+, and Cr3+/4+ have long been the predominant candidates in this demanding research area. Herein, we demonstrate ultrawideband emission from 400 to 1700&#160;nm in K2MgGeO4:Bi3+ (KMGO:Bi3+), achieving an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 88.02% and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 66.41%. The emission spectrum features interconnected visible and NIR bands, peaking at 614 and 1125&#160;nm, respectively. Notably, the full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of the NIR band exceeds 340&#160;nm, significantly broader than most of the conventional phosphors doped with transition metal ions. Through a comprehensive combination of experimental investigations and crystal structure analysis, we elucidate the underlying mechanism of this ultra&#8208;broadband emission, attributing it to Bi3+ centers formed by the substitution of K+ and Mg2+ sites. This work expands the role of Bi3+ ions as activators in the second NIR (NIR&#8208;II) region, offering new insights into the design of ultra&#8208;broadband&#8208;emitting materials and introducing the only known phosphor capable of spanning the full 400&#160;nm to 1700&#160;nm spectrum, thereby filling a longstanding gap in this field.

         <title>Elucidating Ligand&#8208;Dependent Selectivities in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to understand ligand effects on regioselectivities of C&#8211;H activation processes were investigated using an alkynylation of thiophenes as a model system. The results shed light on the role of dispersion models for the correct prediction of reaction outcomes and propose new roles for the solvent and silver additive. The utility of multivariate linear regression in predicting selectivities across mechanistic regimes is demonstrated.








Abstract
Achieving regioselectivity in C&#8211;H activation remains a major challenge. Controlling or even reversing the regioisomeric outcome through the choice of ligand is even harder to achieve, let alone to predict. In this study, we investigated ligand effects in the regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkynylation of thiophenes using multivariate linear regression to build predictive models that offer deeper insight into the structural factors driving regioselectivity and enabled the discovery of a more selective ligand. Combining experimental and DFT studies, we propose a Curtin&#8211;Hammett scenario between the C&#8211;H activation and migratory insertion as the origin of the ligand&#8208;controlled selectivities. A detailed investigation of solvent effects uncovered an inadequate description of solvent&#8208;solute dispersion interactions by implicit solvation models. The crucial role of the solvent in substrate coordination is further evidenced by an inverse solvent kinetic isotope effect. Additionally, the often poorly understood role of silver was scrutinized, showing that it serves to mitigate a detrimental side reaction. This study provides generalizable insights for the computational description of challenging regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities and is expected to aid future mechanistic investigations in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation that holistically consider the role of all reaction components.

         <title>Double&#8208;Donor and Anion&#8208;&#960; Polymer Electrolytes for Fast Li+ Conduction in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a molecularly engineered cellulose trimellitate ester (PCLA) quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with dual&#8208;donor and anion&#8208;&#960; motifs. C&#9552;O/COOH groups coordinate Li+ and anchor TFSI&#8722;, while an electron&#8208;deficient benzene enables anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, improving ion transport and interfacial stability. PCLA delivers 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 ionic conductivity, 57.04&#160;MPa strength, and stable cycling in LFP and NCM811 full cells.








Abstract
Cellulose&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes (QPE) offer advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, renewability, and environmental friendliness, making them ideal candidates for lithium metal batteries. However, the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds within the cellulose framework hinder lithium ion (Li+) transport and reduce ion mobility, limiting their practical applications. In this study, we developed a cellulose trimellitate ester (PCLA) with a double&#8208;donor and anion&#8208;&#960; structure: 1) the carbonyl group (C&#9552;O) as a Li+ donor, 2) the carboxyl group (COOH) serves as a hydrogen bond donor to anchor the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8722;) anion, and 3) the electron&#8208;deficient benzene ring (Ph) interacts with the TFSI&#8722; anion through the anion&#8208;&#960; mechanism. The resulting PCLA QPE achieved high ionic conductivity (1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and excellent tensile strength (57.04&#160;MPa). Full&#8208;cell batteries with LFP and NCM811 cathodes exhibited exceptional cycling stability with remaining 85% and 90% of their initial capacity after 1000 and 200 cycles, respectively. This double&#8208;donor and anion&#8208;&#960; molecular design paves the way for cellulose&#8208;based solid electrolytes with commercial potential, advancing next&#8208;generation safe energy storage technologies.

         <title>Uphill Anion Transporters with Ultrahigh Efficiency Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands enable highly efficient and selective anion transport across lipid bilayers, exhibiting remarkable activity with an EC50 as low as 3.6 pM. Moreover, these NHC&#8208;based organometallic transporters can drive uphill ion transport, reminiscent of proton pumps and ATPases.








Abstract
Essential to the function of living systems, transmembrane ion transport in nature has inspired synthetic mimics that advance therapeutics, separations, sensing, and bioelectronics. Here, we report highly efficient and selective anion transport mediated by simple N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organometallic compounds. Using ruthenium (Ru) as the central metal and ion binding site, we systematically investigated seven classes of organoruthenium scaffolds and found that NHC&#8208;based Ru complexes demonstrated exceptionally high activity and selectivity. Extending the study to more metals, NHC complexes of Pd, Ag, and Cu also exhibited remarkable transport efficiency, with the iPrPh&#8208;NHC organocopper compound achieving an EC50 as low as 3.6 pM, surpassing one of the most active ion transporters, prodigiosin. Notably, NHC&#8208;based organometallic transporters leverage distinct kinetics of ligand binding and membrane diffusion to generate transmembrane potentials, and drive uphill ion transport reminiscent of proton pumps and ATPases. This work provides foundations for further development of organometallic ion transporters with high efficiency, tunable selectivity, and unique functions.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Acidity Interplay in Eu&#8208;Promoted PtSn2 Catalysts for Selective and Stable Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;promoted PtSn2 catalysts leverage the redox activity of Eu and tailored acidity to reduce coke formation, enhancing selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation. This synergy significantly improves propylene yield and extends catalyst lifespan, providing an effective strategy for efficient PDH processes.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts based on Pt alloys are widely employed in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), yet challenges such as coking and poor nanoparticle stability hinder their broader industrial deployment. Strategies to enhance dispersion and tune the catalyst surface properties remain at the forefront of catalyst design. Here, we demonstrate a new class of PtSn2&#8208;based catalysts promoted by rare&#8208;earth elements for efficient and stable PDH. Among the rare&#8208;earth screened, europium (Eu) delivers the most pronounced promotional effect, enabling the formation of &#8764;1.3&#160;nm PtSn2 nanoparticles with improved thermal stability. Through its redox flexibility (Eu3+/Eu2+), Eu modulates the electronic environment of Pt, tunes surface acidity, and suppresses coke accumulation by directing carbon species away from active sites and onto the support. This work shows that rare&#8208;earth elements can serve as multifunctional promoters in alloy catalysts, influencing both structural dispersion and catalytic surface chemistry. The optimized catalyst (0.5% Pt&#8208;3% Sn&#8208;2% Eu on &#947;&#8208;Al2O3) achieves a 40.6% propylene yield at 575&#160;&#176;C and a low deactivation rate (0.047&#160;h&#8722;1), under conditions relevant to industrial practice. Our findings offer a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance diluted alloy catalysts through rare&#8208;earth promotion, applicable to other dehydrogenation and hydrocarbon upgrading reactions where coke suppression and acid&#8211;base balance are critical.

         <title>Facile (Z)&#8208;Selective Synthesis of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones by a Silicon&#8208;based Olefination Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicon&#8208;based olefination strategy has been developed to access challenging (Z)&#8208;configured &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones from readily accessible branched vinyl silanes and acid chlorides. This method enables the straightforward synthesis of a broad variety of deconjugated ketones with high (Z)&#8208;selectivity under mild conditions and provides a new retrosynthetic disconnection to streamline the synthesis of complex scaffolds and natural products.








Abstract
A novel silicon&#8208;based olefination strategy to access challenging &#946;,&#947;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;unsaturated ketones with high diastereoselectivity in a single step from easily accessible, branched vinyl silanes is presented. This new disconnection resolves many longstanding challenges that have prevented general and efficient synthetic approaches to (Z)&#8208;deconjugated enones, affording a broad scope of this type of alkenes with high functional group tolerance. The developed transformation has been applied as a key step in the synthesis of a range of natural products.

         <title>The Weakened Super&#8208;Exchange Interaction Realizes the Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium&#8208;lon Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the Na atom into the tetrahedral sites of the rock&#8208;salt phase, the electronic distribution of the bridging oxygen anion is altered and the magnetic moments of Ni elements are reduced, thereby weakening the linear super&#8208;exchange interactions, which ultimately facilitates the transformation from a rock&#8208;salt structure that hinders Li+ transport to a layered structure favorable for Li+ migration.








Abstract
The direct regeneration of cathodes is an effective technique to address resource waste and environmental pollution caused by spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, Li+ migration within the rock&#8208;salt phase of degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes follows an energetically unfavorable 2&#8208;transition metal (2&#8208;TM) transport pathway (tetrahedral sites between face&#8208;sharing octahedra), creating a kinetic barrier that fundamentally limits direct regeneration. A Na&#8208;based molten salt pretreatment is applied to introduce Na atoms into the unoccupied tetrahedral sites of the rock&#8208;salt phase, which alters the electronic state distribution of bridged oxygen anions and reduces super&#8208;exchange interactions between TM atoms in adjacent layers, thereby triggering a phase transformation from rock&#8208;salt to targeted layered structure. Consequently, the Li+ migration pathway shifts from a high&#8208;energy 2&#8208;TM route to a more favorable low&#8208;barrier 1&#8208;TM route, enabling efficient lithiation and complete restoration of the cathode. The regenerated materials exhibit high structural uniformity and excellent electrochemical performance, achieving 78% capacity retention after 500 cycles. This study provides an insightful perspective on direct LIB recycling by regulating super&#8208;exchange interactions within the degraded cathode structures.

         <title>From Oxygen to Tellurium: The Impact of the Chalcogen on Nucleophilicities and Basicities of Isochalcogenourea Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of different chalcogen atoms allows for the fine&#8208;tuning of nucleophilicity and basicity of commonly used isochalcogenourea organocatalyst scaffolds. Kinetic and thermodynamic descriptors for the molecular properties of the catalysts are introduced as tools to predict their efficiency and tested in acyl transfer and allenoate activation reactions. 








Abstract
Isochalcogenoureas (IChU) embedded in bi&#8208; or tricyclic ring systems have proven to be versatile Lewis base/nucleophilic catalysts that activate a wide range of electrophilic substrates for organocatalytic transformations. Ring size, variation of substituents, and the choice of the chalcogen atom affect the efficiency of IChU catalysis in a complex way. To gain a systematic insight into the key parameters that influence reactivity, 14 IChUs covering the fundamental motifs of these structural variations were selected and analyzed by a combination of kinetic, thermodynamic, and quantum&#8208;chemical methods. Two previously unknown tricyclic isotellurourea catalysts were synthesized to facilitate a comparison of all naturally abundant chalcogens (O, S, Se, and Te) in the IChU structure. Furthermore, their reactivity on the Mayr nucleophilicity scale as well as their Br&#248;nsted and Lewis basicities were determined in polar organic solvents under standardized conditions. Catalyst performance was assessed in two alcohol acylation reactions and in allenoate activation. The low electronegativity of tellurium gave rise to superior nucleophilicity and Lewis basicity of the isotelluroureas when compared to O&#8208;, S&#8208;, or Se&#8208;containing IChUs. Embedding tellurium in IChU structures thus provides a novel handle to influence and fine&#8208;tune the effectiveness of IChU organocatalysis.

         <title>Steam&#8208;Activated Lattice Oxygen Enhances Interfacial Redox Stability for Low&#8208;Temperature N2O Decomposition over Rh/CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature steam activation not only induces the aggregation of partial Rh species on the CeO2 surface but also activates interfacial lattice oxygen species, thereby enhancing O2 desorption capability at low temperatures and improving the catalytic performance of N2O decomposition.








Abstract
Activation of surface lattice oxygen is crucial for enabling low&#8208;temperature catalytic oxidation reactions. While earlier studies have hinted that steam treatment could enhance the activity of lattice oxygen in CeO2 supported catalysts, the mechanistic understanding remains superficial. Here, we unravel the origin and role of steam&#8208;activated lattice oxygen in promoting low&#8208;temperature N2O decomposition. Using a combination of isotope&#8208;labeled steam (H218O), in situ ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP&#8208;XPS), and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we provide direct evidence that high&#8208;temperature steam induces lattice oxygen activation at the Rh&#8211;CeO2 interface. These activated oxygen species facilitate oxygen desorption and enhance the redox cycling stability of Rh and Ce species, dramatically improving catalytic activity at low temperatures. Our findings reveal a previously overlooked pathway for surface lattice oxygen activation and offer mechanistic insights to guide the rational design of efficient low&#8208;temperature redox catalysts.

Using a combination of isotope-labeled steam (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O), in situ ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS), and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we provide direct evidence that high-temperature steam induces lattice oxygen activation at the Rh&#8211;CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface. These activated oxygen species facilitate oxygen desorption and enhance the redox cycling stability of Rh and Ce species, dramatically improving catalytic activity at low temperatures. Our findings reveal a previously overlooked pathway for surface lattice oxygen activation and offer mechanistic insights to guide the rational design of efficient low-temperature redox catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optical Switching of Catalytic Pathways for Hydrogen Generation via Light&#8208;Handedness Control on Chiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the interface between photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis, a chiral Au@CdS nanocatalyst system enables reversible switching between photocatalytic and photothermal hydrogen production by tuning light handedness, leveraging the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect to achieve optically controlled spin&#8208;selective reactivity and enhanced solar&#8208;driven methanol reforming.








Abstract
Precise optical control over catalytic pathways remains a major challenge in solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production. Here, we report a reversible light&#8208;handedness&#8208;dependent switching mechanism between photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis using a standard Au@CdS nanocatalyst functionalized with chiral cysteine ligands. The switching behavior is governed by the interplay of chemical chirality and circularly polarized light, mediated by the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect. When the handedness of circularly polarized light matches the catalyst's chirality, spin&#8208;polarized carriers are efficiently transferred, favoring photocatalysis. In contrast, mismatched conditions suppress charge transfer, enhance recombination, and induce localized heating, shifting the reaction toward photothermal catalysis. Tuning the handedness of circularly polarized light to mismatch the catalyst chirality induces a significant photothermal effect, with temperatures reaching 343 K and hydrogen evolution rates of up to 4.8 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, doubling the performance in the matched case. This study introduces a light&#8208;handedness&#8208;controlled catalytic switch that enables dynamic modulation between two reaction modes using the same chiral catalyst, advancing our mechanistic understanding of spin&#8208;dependent photothermal phenomena and establishing a versatile platform for optically tunable solar fuel production. The interaction of chemical and optical chirality offers a novel approach to designing next&#8208;generation photocatalysts that can be tailored for energy conversion.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Terphenyl Radicals and Anions: Tuning Stability and Redox Properties via Substituent Patterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of C2&#8208;terphenylated derivatives of three N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been reported. The para&#8208;terphenylated species exhibit three stable (reversible) redox states (e.g., [2b]+, [2b]&#9679; and [2b]&#8722;), while for the meta&#8208;terphenylated derivatives only cationic and neutral states (i.e., [3b]+ and [3b]&#9679;) are reversible.








Abstract
Herein, we report the influence of C2&#8208;terphenyl substitution patterns (i.e., p&#8208;terphenyl versus m&#8208;terphenyl) on the redox behavior and stability of the corresponding radicals and anions derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). Three well&#8208;known NHCs; SIPr (1a), IPr (1b), and Me&#8208;IPr (1c) (SIPr&#160;=&#160;C{N(Dipp)CH2}2, IPr&#160;=&#160;C{N(Dipp)CH}2; Me&#8208;IPr&#160;=&#160;C{N(Dipp)CCH3}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3); were functionalized at the C2 position using 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl (p&#8208;TerBr) and 5&#8242;&#8208;bromo&#8208;m&#8208;terphenyl (m&#8208;TerBr) under nickel catalysis, yielding the corresponding cations [(NHC)p&#8208;Ter]Br (2a&#8211;c) and [(NHC)m&#8208;Ter]Br (3a&#8211;c), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of 2a&#8211;c reveal two distinct reversible redox events, while 3a&#8211;c exhibit one reversible and one irreversible or quasi&#8208;reversible wave. Reduction of 2a&#8211;c and 3a&#8211;c with KC8 readily affords stable radicals [(NHC)p&#8208;Ter]&#9679; (4a&#8211;c) and [(NHC&#8208;m&#8208;Ter]&#9679; (5a&#8211;c), isolated as crystalline solids. Further reduction of 4a&#8211;c produces diamagnetic anions [(NHC)p&#8208;Ter]K (6a&#8211;c&#8208;K), consistent with the electrochemical data. In contrast, 5b and 5c are unreactive toward KC8 under similar conditions, while 5a (derived from the more electrophilic NHC 1a) can be reduced to the corresponding anion [(SIPr)m&#8208;Ter]K (7a&#8208;K). Selected compounds have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, with computational studies supporting the experimental findings. The results highlight how the NHC and the C2&#8208;terphenyl substituent influence the properties and stability of the resulting species.

         <title>Pendent No More: Direct Backbone Integration of Stenhouse Salt Enables Multi&#8208;Responsive Commodity Polyurethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stenhouse salt&#8208;based polyurethanes yield stretchable smart elastomers with rapid color changes (&#916;E&#160;&gt;&#160;50) in response to acids, bases, amines, and nerve agent mimics. These materials retain high elasticity (strain 1100% to 2200%) and enable micrometer&#8208;scale photopatterning via photoacid generators, offering broad utility in sensing and display applications. 








Abstract
While donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) have shown exceptional photochromic properties at the molecular level, their integration into polymeric materials has been limited to pendent group architectures that compromise both switching efficiency and materials performance. Here, we report a versatile strategy to overcome these limitations by leveraging the symmetric design of Stenhouse salts&#8212;structural analogues of DASAs&#8212;for direct backbone integration into polyurethane backbones. This approach overcomes the synthetic hurdles and performance compromises typical of pendent DASA systems, producing mechanically robust materials with strain&#8208;to&#8208;break exceeding 1100% and tensile strengths up to 44&#160;MPa, while delivering fully reversible colorimetric responses (&#916;E&#160;&gt;&#160;50) to trace amounts of acids, bases, amines, and nerve agent mimics. Integrating the chromophores into the polymer backbone eliminates leaching and ensures high reproducibility alongside excellent mechanical properties. Moreover, incorporating photoacid generators allows for micrometer&#8208;scale photolithographic patterning, enabling precise spatial and temporal control of chromophore switching under solar or UV light. These backbone&#8208;integrated Stenhouse salt polyurethanes mark a significant advancement over pendent chromophore systems, transforming conventional elastomers into versatile, responsive materials for applications ranging from food packaging and security to protective gear and medical devices.

         <title>Arene Ruthenium(II) Carboxylates for C&#9472;H Alkylations and Arylations at Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activity of arene ruthenium catalysts in C&#9472;H activation was suggested to depend on high reaction temperatures. In contrast, we show arene ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation at near to room temperature. 








Abstract
The long&#8208;term pursuit for more efficient catalysts has stimulated the development of C&#9472;H activations under mild reaction conditions, with the overarching goal to improve their user&#8208;friendly nature, selectivity, and synthetic utility. Herein, we report mild C&#9472;H alkylations enabled by inexpensive and most user&#8208;friendly ruthenium carboxylate complexes. While these bench&#8208;stable arene ruthenium carboxylate complexes catalyzed direct alkylations under ambient conditions, detailed kinetic studies demonstrated a high catalytic performance for the [Ru(O2CR)2(p&#8208;cymene)] during the steady&#8208;state catalytic process. Thus, temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic Arrenhius&#8208;plot analyses of the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H alkylation revealed a comparable activation enthalpy for [Ru(O2CR)2(p&#8208;cymene)] and [Ru(t&#8208;BuCN)5(H2O)](BF4)2, hence, implying entropic factors to be of relevance.

&lt;p&gt;The activity of arene ruthenium catalysts in C&#9472;H activation was suggested to depend on high reaction temperatures. In contrast, we show arene ruthenium-catalyzed C&#9472;H activation at near to room temperature. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term pursuit for more efficient catalysts has stimulated the development of C&#9472;H activations under mild reaction conditions, with the overarching goal to improve their user-friendly nature, selectivity, and synthetic utility. Herein, we report mild C&#9472;H alkylations enabled by inexpensive and most user-friendly ruthenium carboxylate complexes. While these bench-stable arene ruthenium carboxylate complexes catalyzed direct alkylations under ambient conditions, detailed kinetic studies demonstrated a high catalytic performance for the [Ru(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene)] during the steady-state catalytic process. Thus, temperature-dependent kinetic Arrenhius-plot analyses of the ruthenium-catalyzed C&#9472;H alkylation revealed a comparable activation enthalpy for [Ru(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene)] and [Ru(&lt;i&gt;t-&lt;/i&gt;BuCN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, hence, implying entropic factors to be of relevance. The robust arene ruthenium(II) carboxylate-catalyzed C&#9472;H alkylation showed broad versatility under mild reaction conditions with respect to primary, secondary as well as tertiary alkyl bromides in a position-divergent manner, reflecting a wide tolerance of valuable electrophilic functional groups for late-stage functionalizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and general method for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;amido and 2&#8208;alkoxyl dienes is developed. This approach facilitates the expedited and straightforward construction of chiral allylic &#945;&#8208;amino and &#945;&#8208;alkoxyphosphine oxides with tetrasubstituted carbon centers. Both 2&#8208;amido diene and 2&#8208;alkoxyl diene served as excellent coupling partners with a wide range of phosphine oxides.








Abstract
Significant progress has been made in the asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of dienes to construct vinylic stereogenic carbon centers. However, achieving enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of substituted dienes with heteroatom nucleophiles to form vinylic tetrasubstituted carbon centers remains a formidable challenge. This difficulty arises primarily from issues of regio&#8208;control, steric hindrance, and stereo&#8208;discrimination. In this study, we present a palladium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;amido and 2&#8208;alkoxyl dienes using phosphine oxides. This approach successfully constructs chiral allylic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphine oxides and &#945;&#8208;alkoxyphosphine oxides with tetrasubstituted carbon centers. Our method demonstrates a broad substrate scope with excellent enantioselectivity (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% ee) and high yields (up to 99%), achieving exclusive regio&#8208;control under mild conditions. Additionally, the versatile post&#8208;functionalization of the allyl group facilitates the synthesis of a wide variety of tetrasubstituted carbon centers featuring distinct heteroatom.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Driven Interfacial Charge Redistribution in TiO2&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Photoanodes for Formate Production From Plastics and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon interlayer promotes interfacial charge redistribution on photoanodes (Ni(OH)2/C/TiO2), enabling efficient photoelectrochemical coupling of waste plastic reforming and CO2 reduction. This PEC tandem cell achieves selective formate production without external bias, offering a sustainable route for simultaneous waste plastic valorization and greenhouse gas conversion.








Abstract
Coupling photoelectrochemical (PEC) waste plastic reforming with CO2 utilization to co&#8208;produce value&#8208;added chemicals offers a promising strategy to mitigate plastic pollution and carbon emissions. Yet, achieving high selectivity still requires highly active plastic&#8208;reforming photoanodes and effective integration with CO2 reduction photocathodes. Here, an ultrathin carbon interlayer was introduced into Ni(OH)2&#8208;TiO2 (named Ni(OH)2/C/TiO2) photoanode to modulate its interfacial electronic structure, thereby converting alkaline&#8208;pretreated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into formate. The optimized photoanode delivered a formate yield 2.7 times that of bare Ni(OH)2/TiO2 with a stable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.2% across 0.4&#8211;1.2&#160;V versus RHE. The enhancement mechanism of the carbon layer was elucidated by in situ characterization and theoretical calculations. The carbon layer modulated interfacial charge distribution at the photoanode, which not only facilitates charge transfer but also strengthens adsorption of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol and stabilizes key intermediates, achieving high selectivity for formate. Additionally, a stable PEC tandem cell was assembled that co&#8208;converted PET and CO2 to formate without external bias, attaining a formate FE of 171.1% (FEmax&#160;=&#160;192.2% at 0.3&#160;V). This study provides insights into the role of carbon layers in optimizing interfacial reactions, guiding the development of an integrated PEC cell for simultaneous valorization of plastics and CO2.

         <title>Topological Duality: Constructing High&#8208;Nuclearity Metal Clusters with Unleashed Active Sites for Efficient and Durable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;topological&#8208;duality&#8208;driven&#8221; strategy is adopted to construct high&#8208;nuclearity Cu24Ag54 which presents impressive reactivity and durability for CO2 electroreduction with selectivity of 98% and current density up to 750 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Precise control of active sites with atomic resolution in metal nanoclusters (MNCs) presents a promising avenue for catalyst engineering towards CO2 electroreduction. However, effective strategies to construct high&#8208;nuclearity MNCs while balancing catalytic stability and active&#8208;site exposure remain scarce. Herein, we propose a &#8220;topological&#8208;duality&#8208;driven&#8221; strategy to construct a high&#8208;nuclearity Cu24Ag54 nanocluster, featuring an octahedral {Cu24} shell and a double&#8208;truncated cubic {Ag54} core with exposed {Ag3} vertices on {111} facets. Notably, the double&#8208;truncated cubic is a previously unexplored concave polyhedron with over twice the number of {111} facets compared to conventional structures. As a catalyst for CO2 electroreduction, Cu24Ag54 delivers exceptional performance including a Faradaic efficiency for CO of &#8764;98%, catalytic stability exceeding 100 h, and current densities up to 750 mA cm&#8722;2 (total current 3 A), ranking among the highest values of the reported MNCs. Dedicated studies show the nested structure and increased electron delocalization underpin the catalyst durability. The facilitated electron transfer from Ag to the key intermediate *COOH and electron delocalization effect significantly reduce the energy barrier for *COOH formation by 50%. This work provides a new perspective on the potential of topological geometries in designing high&#8208;nuclearity MNCs for highly efficient and robust CO2 electroreduction at industrial current density.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Aza&#8208;[2+2] Cyclization Reaction of Simple Ketoimine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the first catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;[2+2] cyclization of simple ketoimines using magnesium catalyst. This method enables the construction of &#946;&#8208;lactams bearing chiral quaternary carbon centers. Lactam editing of pharmaceutical active molecules and further utilization of the ring&#8208;opening reaction of the obtained lactam for short peptide modification have also been achieved.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first catalytic enantioselective aza&#8208;[2+2] cyclization of simple ketoimines, thereby addressing a persistent challenge in four&#8208;membered aza&#8208;ring construction. While the aza&#8208;[2+2] cyclization represents the most straightforward approach to azetidine synthesis, previous methodologies have been strictly limited to ketoimines, all with an EWG at the central reactive carbon, and predominantly employing cyclic imine substrates. Through rational design of an in situ&#8208;generated magnesium catalytic system and systematic investigation of imine electronic effects, we have successfully developed an asymmetric protocol for simple ketoimines. This breakthrough enables efficient access to enantioenriched monocyclic azetidines with excellent stereocontrol. Moreover, a streamlined one&#8208;pot tandem oxidation readily converts these azetidines into valuable quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams&#8212;privileged scaffolds that are prominent in numerous pharmaceuticals and bioactive agents. A combination of comparative studies, the calculation results of the HOMO and LUMO energies of different imines, relative control experiments, and a series of detailed NLE analysis revealed the coordination difference and the catalytic cycle. The catalytic protocol was used for the synthesis of a series of &#946;&#8208;lactams containing aryl or alkyl groups, as well as for pharmaceutical active molecules&#8217; &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;modifications. Importantly, the preliminary attempt to take advantage of the significant ring strain of &#946;&#8208;lactam for peptide modifications was also achieved on tryptophan.

A combination of comparative studies, the calculation results of the HOMO and LUMO energies of different imines, relative control experiments, and a series of detailed NLE analysis revealed the coordination difference and the catalytic cycle. The catalytic protocol was used for the synthesis of a series of &#946;-lactams containing aryl or alkyl groups, as well as for pharmaceutical active molecules&#8217; &#946;-lactam-modifications. Importantly, the preliminary attempt to take advantage of the significant ring strain of &#946;-lactam for peptide modifications was also achieved on tryptophan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Closed&#8208;Loop Crystal&#8211;Amorphous Solid&#8211;Wet Gel Transformation in Copper MOFs for Exceptional Cycling Stability in Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing a Cu&#8208;MOF with stable and unstable building blocks, this work achieves a quasi&#8208;closed&#8208;loop transition between crystalline, amorphous, and wet gel states. This structural adaptability minimizes catalyst deactivation in click reactions, sustaining 98% yield over 20 cycles through mutual regulation of reaction conditions and catalyst structure.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;closed&#8208;loop transformations between crystals, amorphous solids, and wet gels are rarely explored in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). We report a stimuli&#8208;responsive Cu(I)&#8208;MOF (Cu&#8208;cMOF) constructed from relatively stable 1D Cu(I) secondary building units (s&#8208;SBUs) and unstable trigonal Cu(I) SBUs (us&#8208;SBUs). This unique architecture enables quasi&#8208;closed&#8208;loop crystal&#8208;amorphous solid&#8208;wet gel transformations through the following steps: i) The crystalline framework first undergoes oxidative amorphization via Cu(I)&#8208;to&#8208;Cu(II) conversion at us&#8208;SBUs, forming amorphous Cu&#8208;aMOF; ii) Cu&#8208;aMOF subsequently reorganizes into wet gel (Cu&#8208;MOG) in preheated DMAc via oxygen&#8208; and dimethylamine&#8208;assisted framework fragmentation and colloidal assembly; and iii) Cu&#8208;MOG transforms back to Cu&#8208;cMOF via a solvent&#8208;mediated phase transition. The relative structural persistence of the s&#8208;SBUs&#8212;in contrast to the labile us&#8208;SBUs&#8212;confers a degree of reversibility to the system. Remarkably, mutual regulation between reaction conditions and catalyst structure is achieved in the azidation&#8208;click cascade reaction. The azidation step drives the transformation of Cu&#8208;aMOF into Cu&#8208;cMOF, while the click reaction reverses this process. Each catalyst phase exhibits step&#8208;specific catalytic selectivity, forming a self&#8208;sustaining structural transformation cycle that maintains over 98% efficiency after at least 20 cycles. Additionally, used catalysts can be repurposed as Cu&#8208;MOGs for large&#8208;sized molecule adsorption. This work establishes a cooperative switchable system with adaptive multifunctionality.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Engineered DPP Polymers: Synergistic Hydrogen Bonding and Ring&#8208;Fusion for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;B) enhances intermolecular interaction, enabling localized ordered molecular packing. Ring fusion (R&#8208;F) further intensifies this effect while extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation and optimizing energy levels. As a result, polymer P&#8208;HF (featuring both H&#8208;B and R&#8208;F effects) achieves an outstanding &#956;h of 5.02&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, surpassing that of H&#8208;B&#8208;only polymer P&#8208;H (2.13&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and reference polymer P&#8208;B (0.71&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). This performance ranks P&#8208;HF among the highest reported for DPP&#8208;based polymers.








Abstract
Developing simple and effective molecular design strategies to optimize charge transport mobility remains a key challenge in high&#8208;performance organic semiconductors. In this study, we integrate&#160;hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;B)&#160;and&#160;ring&#8208;fusion (R&#8208;F)&#160;into a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer, yielding a novel material,&#160;P&#8208;HF. For comparison, a reference polymer (P&#8208;B) and a hydrogen&#8208;bonded analogue (P&#8208;H) were synthesized. The synergistic effects of H&#8208;B and R&#8208;F dramatically not only enhance both inter&#8208; and intramolecular charge transport but also optimize the frontier orbital levels; H&#8208;B strengthens intermolecular interactions, enabling localized ordered molecular packing and tighter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, while R&#8208;F further amplifies these effects meanwhile improving backbone planarity, extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and optimizing frontier orbital levels. As a result, P&#8208;HF achieves an outstanding hole mobility of 5.02&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, surpassing P&#8208;B (0.71&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and P&#8208;H (2.13&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), placing it among the highest&#8208;performing DPP&#8208;based polymers reported. This work demonstrates that combining R&#8208;F and H&#8208;B offers a viable strategy for designing high&#8208;mobility conjugated materials, potentially advancing organic semiconductor development. This dual&#8208;engineering strategy is particularly suitable for &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers containing both hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites and ring&#8208;fused backbones.

         <title>Bioorthogonal RNase L Recruitment Enables Targeted Inducible Degradation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal RIsBOTAC (boRIBOTAC) platform enables chemically gated, inducible degradation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA. A cleavable cage masks the RNase L recruiter in ProRIBOTAC, which is reactivated by Staudinger decaging to restore antiviral activity. The system achieves spatiotemporal control of RNA degradation with reduced cytotoxicity, demonstrating conditional activation of RNA&#8208;targeting therapeutics in cells.








Abstract
RIBOTAC (Ribonuclease Targeting Chimera) is a strategy that employs small molecules to selectively bind disease&#8208;associated RNA and recruit endogenous RNase L for targeted RNA degradation. This study advances the concept of bioorthogonal cleavage reactions to develop a novel &#8220;bioorthogonal RIBOTAC&#8221; (boRIBOTAC). Focusing on SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA, we engineered a cleavable &#8220;cage&#8221; protective group into a critical site within the RIBOTAC molecule, rendering it inactive as ProRIBOTAC in its untriggered state. When therapeutic intervention becomes necessary or disease progression demands it, a bioorthogonal cleavage reaction selectively removes the protective group, activating the RIBOTAC and thus facilitating inducible degradation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA. This research not only validates the feasibility of this boRIBOTAC and the inducible SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA degradation strategy but also demonstrates that the boRIBOTAC approach is poised to construct a controllable and effective RNA degradation platform. This platform is anticipated to provide significant technical reserves and practical prospects for addressing potential viral pandemics, chronic infections, and complex disease progressions, while also offering critical insights for future RNA&#8208;targeted drug design.

Perched in equilibrium upon the T4&#8208;CdCu cluster, a balancing bird symbolizes the optimal balance between kinetics and thermodynamics achieved by the semiconductor cluster catalyst under visible&#8208;light excitation. In their Research Article (e202509764), Tao Wu et&#160;al. demonstrate that this equilibrium enables highly efficient and selective activation of inert substrates&#8212;such as non&#8208;activated arenes and aryl halides&#8212;delivering unprecedented photocatalytic performance under mild reaction conditions.

A rollercoaster illustrates the competing pathways of para&#8208;substituted arylazo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trimethylpyrazole photoswitches during thermal Z/E isomerization. In their Research Article (e202514433), the groups of Leticia Gonz&#225;lez and Marko Mihovilovic show how the substituent directs the track: electron&#8208;donating groups favour a nonadiabatic rotational track via the lowest triplet state, while electron&#8208;withdrawing groups follow a conventional ground&#8208;state inversion track. Designed by M. Wutscher.

Synthesis of robust Zr&#8208;MOFs through mild aqueous solid&#8208;state crystallization, achieving one&#8208;pot enzyme encapsulation: This strategy overcomes the harsh solvothermal conditions required for conventional syntheses of Zr&#8208;MOFs by converting amorphous precursors into crystalline MOFs at ambient temperature via water&#8208;mediated ligand exchange, as revealed by solid&#8208;state&#160;13C NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. This study is reported by Xinyue Wang et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202509275) and is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Chia&#8208;Kuang (Frank) Tsung.

The cover shows an artistic interpretation of how bimetallic nanowire arrays are fabricated using block copolymer film templates. The tornado represents the mixing of metal precursors that impregnate the poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) domains. The nanowires are illustrated as periodically arranged flowerbeds, with octahedral Co(CN)63&#8722; as blue, six&#8208;petal flowers, and square&#8208;planar PdCl42&#8722; as four&#8208;petal, red flowers. Details are described in the Research Article (e202512695) by Roy Shenhar et&#160;al.

         <dc:description>
In their Research Article (e202513719), William J. Brittain et al. present the reaction cycle of a tetrafluoroazobenzene (TFA)&#8208;spiropyran (SP) chromophore. Green light selectively isomerizes TFA. SP ring&#8208;opening generates a transient phenolate intermediate, which dramatically accelerates the Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of TFA by factors ranging from 102 to 106. This process is controlled by SP stimuli. This dynamic behavior is depicted as a molecular race along the &#8220;AZOBAHN&#8221;&#8211;a high&#8208;speed track where the usual limits of chemical reaction rates no longer apply.

         <dc:description>
A defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese molecular catalyst was designed to determine the water&#8208;binding and &#8208;activating sites of birnessite at the atomic level, which is key for the high oxygen&#8208;evolving activity of manganese oxides electrocatalysts. Blocking those active sites, in contrast, is profoundly destructive of their catalytic capability. Details are reported by Gang Wu et al. in their Communication (e202511664).

         <title>From Light to Cure: Precision Phototherapies for Antibiotic&#8208;Refractory Biofilm Infections</title>

Bacterial biofilms, formidable barriers to antimicrobial resistance, are prime targets for phototherapies: PTT (local hyperthermia) and PDT (ROS generation). This review examines these approaches and their combinatorial strategies, addressing clinical translation challenges and advancing antibiotic&#8208;independent infection management.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilms serve as formidable barriers in antimicrobial therapy and are central to the emergence and propagation of antimicrobial resistance. Their compact extracellular polymeric matrix, metabolic heterogeneity, and quorum&#8208;sensing&#8211;mediated resistance gene expression collectively endow biofilms with exceptional defense against conventional antibiotics. This review highlights the structural&#8208;functional complexity of biofilms and focuses on emerging phototherapeutic strategies&#8212;photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8212;as promising biofilm&#8208;targeted approaches. PTT employs near&#8208;infrared light to induce localized hyperthermia, disrupting bacterial membranes and enhancing drug penetration. PDT generates reactive oxygen species via photoactivated photosensitizers, leading to oxidative destruction of both cells and extracellular polymeric substances. These strategies offer metabolic independence, precise spatiotemporal control, and efficacy against dormant pathogens. Recent advances in smart nanoplatforms enable the integration of PTT/PDT with responsive drug delivery, imaging guidance, and immune modulation, achieving multimodal, precision antimicrobial effects. Furthermore, synergistic combinations with enzymatic degradation, immune intervention, and antibiotics show promise in treating chronic and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. We conclude by outlining translational challenges and strategic directions for clinical application, underscoring the potential of phototherapy to reshape infection management beyond antibiotic dependence.

         <title>Harnessing Phenonium Ions in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenonium ions have frequently been viewed as intermediates of theoretical interest, but whose synthetic utility was limited. This minireview outlines how physical&#8208;organic characterization has led to a better understanding of controlling their formation, which has resulted in modern strategies to form phenonium ions straightforwardly and use them in a synthetically useful manner.








Abstract
Whereas phenonium ions have been known for decades, their use in synthesis has been surprisingly scarce. This might be attributed to the difficulty in taming their formation and reactivity. However, by considering the physical&#8208;organic properties of phenonium species, through careful design of substrates, or the use of defined reagents/promoter systems, several applications have emerged in recent years to overcome those challenges. This minireview encompasses key recent strategies to generate those highly reactive cationic intermediates in line with their physicochemical properties, with special emphasis on mechanistic aspects, regioselectivity, and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Lower Critical Solution Temperature Active Supramolecular &#960;&#8208;Systems for Smart Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we discuss Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) active supramolecular &#960;&#8208;systems for designing thermoresponsive smart windows, molecular thermometers, and biomedical systems. A critical analysis of such materials and their mechanistic understanding is important for future developments. This minireview outlines both the opportunities and challenges in this emerging field.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems have emerged as an essential requirement for a wide range of smart applications in material sciences and biology. Among various responses, thermal response is a common functional characteristic of macromolecular and supramolecular systems. For example, polyacrylamides and their variants are known to exhibit a phenomenon called lower critical solution temperature (LCST) under aqueous conditions, which is a heat&#8208;induced phase change from a transparent to opaque state. Similarly, numerous amphiphilic supramolecular systems are known to exhibit LCST properties. &#960;&#8208;Conjugated molecules are emerging as preferred building blocks for the construction of LCST active supramolecular materials owing to their inherent electronic and optical properties, which are sensitive to temperature variations. A variety of amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;systems have been reported for the creation of dynamic and adaptive LCST materials, and a combined analysis of such materials is important for further developments. In this minireview, we describe how researchers have exploited the LCST property of supramolecular &#960;&#8208;systems for various smart applications, such as smart windows and nanothermometers, and discuss their future potential and challenges.

         <title>Responsible Use of Kinematic Models: Correspondence on &#8220;Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry&#8221;</title>

Kinematic models offer useful estimates of maximum energy output in ball milling, provided they are applied with accurate parameters and appropriate caution of the model's assumptions and limitations.








Abstract
In their recent article, Jafter et&#160;al. present &#8220;refined&#8221; kinematic models for planetary and mixer mills. While the improvement of such models is a valuable pursuit, we find that aspects of the presentation and application of these models raise concerns. The authors modify an existing planetary mill model, yet the altered equations offer no clear advantage and obscure the underlying milling dynamics. The mixer mill model is similar to known models, but includes additional parameters, such as an empirical scaling factor, that lack theoretical justification. Furthermore, the models are applied using estimated or hypothetical values for important milling parameters, contributing to overestimations of the energy metrics. Rather than dismissing the use of kinematic models, we emphasize the importance of applying them with care by using accurate input parameters, being aware of their assumptions and limitations, and interpreting their outputs in the context of what the energy metrics represent (maximum energies released from impacts). When employed responsibly, kinematic models can provide valuable insight, and thus, we encourage a more rigorous and transparent application of these models to support the broader goal of reproducibility in mechanochemistry.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Ubiquitin Probes Capture the Sulfenylated State of Deubiquitinases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic ubiquitin&#8208;based probe, Biotin&#8208;Ub74&#8208;DYn&#8208;2, was developed to selectively label sulfenylated deubiquitinases (DUB&#8208;SOH). The probe demonstrated high specificity in vitro and enabled the identification of 13 oxidized DUBs in H2O2&#8208;treated 293T cell lysates via label&#8208;free proteomics, offering a new approach to study redox&#8208;regulated DUB activity.








Abstract
Activity&#8208;based ubiquitin probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) are powerful tools for studying the functional landscape of deubiquitinases (DUBs). While most existing Ub probes have focused on examining the native state of DUBs, oxidative stress, especially in cancer and inflammatory contexts, can oxidize the catalytic cysteine of DUBs, significantly altering their activity. Here, we developed three novel ubiquitin&#8208;based activity probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) to selectively trap the sulfenylated form of deubiquitinases (DUB&#8208;SOH). These probes employ ubiquitin as the recognition element and incorporate distinct warheads: an electrophilic norbornene moiety (Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;NMA) or dimedone&#8208;derived cyclic C&#8208;nucleophiles (Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;PRD and Biotin&#8208;Ub75&#8208;DYn&#8208;2), enabling covalent capture of oxidized cysteine residues. Of these, Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;PRD and Biotin&#8208;Ub75&#8208;DYn&#8208;2 successfully labeled DUB&#8208;SOH, highlighting the importance of proper probe&#8208;substrate interaction for effective trapping. Optimization of the ubiquitin length showed that the Ub74 variant displayed enhanced affinity toward DUB&#8208;SOH. Biotin&#8208;Ub74&#8208;DYn&#8208;2 enabled enrichment and identification of DUB&#8208;SOH targets via immunocapture and label&#8208;free quantitative proteomics. Collectively, these sulfenic acid&#8208;targeting Ub&#8208;ABPs represent versatile tools for elucidating redox&#8208;dependent DUB regulation, with potential applications in understanding redox dysregulation in disease contexts.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of a Diterpene Synthase for Chryseojoostenes A&#8211;E from Chryseobacterium Joostei</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bacterial diterpene synthase CjCS for chryseojoostenes was mechanistically characterised through labelling experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and conversion of substrate analogs with blocked reactivity. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis gave access to minor enzyme products, including chryseojoostene E, whose biosynthesis involves a long&#8208;range hydrogen shift that is also relevant to its EIMS fragmentation.








Abstract
A diterpene synthase from Chryseobacterium joostei was characterised and produces the five unique compounds chryseojoostenes A&#8211;E. Chryseojoostenes D and E were produced in too low amounts for isolation from the wildtype enzyme, but extensive site&#8208;directed mutagenesis resulted in an enzyme variant in which the production of these compounds was enhanced. The biosynthesis of the enzyme products was investigated in detail through a combined experimental and computational approach, indicating a complex hydrogen scrambling during terpene cyclisation and a long&#8208;range proton shift towards chryseojoostene E. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a similar long range hydrogen shift is involved in the formation of an even fragment ion (m/z 216), characterising the unique chemistry of the chryseojoostene skeleton. Further insights into the cyclisation mechanism were obtained by enzymatic conversion of two substrate analogs with reduced reactivity.

         <title>Controlling the Regioselectivity of Topochemical Reduction Reactions Through Sequential Anion Insertion and Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reduction reactions allow the preparation of metastable materials containing low&#8208;valent transition&#8208;metal cations. By adopting a fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce reaction scheme, the regioselectivity of these reactions can be modified, allowing the connectivity of the transition&#8208;metal coordination polyhedra in the resulting materials (1D vs. 2D) to be controlled.








Abstract
Topochemical reduction of the n&#160;=&#160;2 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide, LaSr2CoRuO7, yields LaSr2CoRuO5.3, a phase containing (Co/Ru)O4 squares which share corners to form 1D infinite double&#8208;chains. In contrast, fluorination of LaSr2CoRuO7 yields the oxyfluoride LaSr2CoRuO5.5F3.5, which can then be reduced to form LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5. This reduced oxyfluoride is almost isoelectronic with LaSr2CoRuO5.3, but LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5 has a crystal structure in which the (Co/Ru)O4 squares are connected into 2D infinite sheets. Thus, by following a fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce reaction scheme, the regiochemistry of topochemical reduction reactions can be modified, and compounds with different transition&#8208;metal&#8208;centre interconnectivity can be prepared. Both LaSr2CoRuO5.3 and LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5 adopt glassy magnetic states at low temperature, but the magnetic interactions present in LaSr2CoRuO5.3 appear to be significantly stronger than those in LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5, attributable to the differing dimensionality of the transition&#8208;metal connectivity. The structural features of LaSr2CoRuO5.5F3.5 that modify the regioselectivity of the topochemical reduction reaction appear to be common to many fluorinated Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxides, suggesting this fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce strategy could be used to prepare a range of &#8220;infinite&#8208;layer&#8221; reduced phases which cannot be made by direct reduction of Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide precursors.

         <title>Bullvalene&#8208;Containing Molecular Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bullvalenes (BVs) undergo rapid pericyclic rearrangements between a network of constitutional isomers with a variety of different shapes. Their inherent covalent disorder lends them to form molecular glasses. We find that their inclusion in the structures of glass&#8208;forming materials results in an increase in the thermal expansion coefficient.








Abstract
Organic molecular glasses are attractive matrices to disperse active ingredients in pharmaceuticals or electronic devices. Typically, they i) have lower glass transition temperatures than inorganic or polymeric glasses, making them easier to process, and ii) are less prone to phase segregation from other organic active materials. However, there is a dearth of functional groups that are known to induce glass formation in preference to crystallization. We have investigated the relationship between the shapeshifting isomerism of heterodisubstituted bullvalenes (BVs) and their properties as amorphous molecular glasses. Substituting a constitutionally dynamic BV unit in place of the 1,4&#8208;phenylene motif in the molecular structures of two well&#8208;known liquid crystal mesogens, 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;butylbiphenyl, produces materials that readily form glasses. The properties of the two glasses are compared to analogous glasses with fixed constitutions. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM), we show that, unlike the fixed&#8208;structure glasses, the BV&#8208;containing molecular glasses fracture at low temperatures, which is indicative of them having larger thermal expansion coefficients. This article highlights the capability of shapeshifting building blocks to induce glass formation and to alter the physical properties of the resulting molecular materials, producing macroscopic effects that are observable by eye.

Achieving &#197;ngstrom&#8208;precise interlayer control in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) remains elusive. We demonstrate water&#8208;based engineering of bilayer SOFs using length&#8208;tunable bipyridine pillars (L2/L3). Coordination&#8208;driven assembly with a Zn&#8208;porphyrin/CB[8] monolayer SOF yields crystalline bilayers with thicknesses of 5.4&#160;and 6.7&#160;nm&#8212;validated by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). This pillar&#8208;length&#8208;to&#8208;spacing correlation enables sub&#8208;nm precision, opening avenues for tailored interlayer environments.








Abstract
Achieving quantitative control over interlayer spacing in multilayer two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a&#160;molecular pillar engineering strategy&#160;enabling programmable vertical expansion of bilayer architectures. By designing elongated bipyridine pillars&#160;L2/L3&#160;(3.0/4.4&#160;nm) with hydrophilic side chains, we transform a Zn&#8208;porphyrin/CB[8] monolayer SOF (ml&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF, 1.8&#160;nm) into bilayers with&#160;precision&#8208;tuned&#160;thicknesses:&#160;bl&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF&#8208;2&#160;(5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;nm) and&#160;bl&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF&#8208;3&#160;(6.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;nm). Synchrotron small&#8208;angle and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) lattice imaging, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirm structural regularity with&#160;&#197;ngstrom&#8208;level accuracy&#160;in layer spacing. Crucially, we establish a&#160;linear correlation between pillar length and interlayer distance, while multivalency&#8208;driven assembly ensures&#160;&gt;93% bilayer selectivity. This work pioneers quantitative 3D engineering in 2D SOFs, opening avenues for tailored nanoconfined environments.

         <title>A Facile and Efficient Route to Achieve Polythiophene&#8208;Based Nanoparticles With Various Morphologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polythiophene&#8208;based nanoparticles with abundant morphologies are efficiently fabricated by template synthesis strategy, which involves the fabrication of morphology precursors via PISA technique and their further oxidative polymerization. This strategy creates opportunities to obtain conjugated polymer nanoparticles with tunable morphologies and offers a powerful approach for large&#8208;scale fabrication to expand their application in future.








Abstract
Polythiophene&#8208;based nanoparticles (PTNPs), a prominent class of conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) with remarkable optical and electronic properties, have gained significant attention in applications such as electronics and bioimaging. However, current methods in generating PTNPs have run into obstacles including low variety of morphologies, poor reproducibility, and low preparation efficiency, restricting their further application. In this study, we report a facile and efficient fabrication strategy based on template synthesis method. This method combines polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) for the preparation of morphology precursors (PTN&#8208;templates) with subsequent oxidative polymerization to realize the construction of PTNPs. By systematically regulating composition, charge characteristics of hydrophilic segments, and solids content of the polymerization mixtures during RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA, a wide variety of PTN&#8208;templates with various morphologies were obtained. The successful synthesis of PTNPs with representative morphologies was confirmed through morphology retention, the formation of polythiophene chains, and the observed red shift in UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. In summary, we have established important guidelines for efficient fabrication of PTNPs with diverse morphologies, which opens up new avenues for the synthesis of next&#8208;generation conjugated polymer nanomaterials and offers the opportunity for the large&#8208;scale preparation of conjugated polymer nanomaterials.

         <title>Transforming Crowded Coacervates into Multi&#8208;Compartmental Hybrid Microreactors for Practical Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Multicompartmental protocell models with complex architectures are constructed through a versatile structural transformation from membrane&#8208;free coacervates to robust hybrid microreactors, which enables spatiotemporal regulation of individual biocatalysis or divergent cascades with high reaction efficiency.








Abstract
Advancing the design and construction of artificial protocells with organized complexity, diverse functionality and practical applicability is urgently demanded in vitro synthetic biology and bioengineering but remains a grand challenge. Here, we present a versatile Pickering emulsion&#8208;based encapsulation approach to transform membraneless coacervate compartments into robust multicompartmental hybrid microreactors, which concurrently assimilate the expected attributes of hierarchically compartmentalized structure, molecularly crowded environment, selectively permeable ability and mechanically reinforced stability. Single or multiple biological and non&#8208;biological catalytic species can be spatially sequestered in specific domains of the hybrid microreactor, enabling spatiotemporal regulation of individual biocatalysis or divergent cascades with high reaction efficiency. As proof of concept, we not only demonstrate the markedly improved catalytic activity (1.9&#8211;9.2 folds enhancement), strengthened thermostability (up to 100&#160;&#176;C) and impressive long&#8208;term durability (1600&#160;h) of the obtained microreactors in lipase&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of alcohol medicine intermediates, but also showcase their superior capability in processing chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade of ketone hydrogenation&#8208;kinetic resolution and multi&#8208;enzymatic cascade of oxidation reactions. Macromolecular crowding and confinement effects arising from structural features of the hybrid microreactors are identified as the dominant factors for the promotion of catalytic functions.

         <title>Polymerization of L&#8208;Arginine into Nanomicelles for Immunometabolic Engineering of Adoptive Macrophages in Solid Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of regulating immunometabolism of adoptive macrophages in vivo is reported by synthesizing L&#8208;arginine&#8208;based polymeric nanomicelles and integrating them within macrophages (PLANO@M&#248;). PLANO@M&#248; could display augmented tumor&#8208;killing potential and induce robust immune response. In the 4T1 murine model, PLANO@M&#248; showed an obvious inhibition effect on tumor progression.








Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy of adoptive cell therapy is highly dependent on the status and function of the infused cells. However, insufficient nutrient availability within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) often impedes these cells from fully exerting their cytotoxic potential against solid tumors. Here, we present a strategy of integrating adoptively transferred macrophages with intracellular nutrient depots composed of L&#8208;arginine&#8208;based nanomicelles to provide a sustainable supply of essential metabolite and optimize the cellular activity in the nutrient&#8208;deprived TME. Also, the nanomicelles were coated with bacterial outer membrane vesicles to endow them with immunomodulatory capability, which could activate macrophages toward anti&#8208;tumor phenotypes and resist immune suppression. We showed that our approach significantly strengthened the tumor&#8208;killing potential of macrophages, induced robust immune responses, and effectively inhibited solid tumor growth compared to the administration of an equal dose of macrophages without immunometabolic modulation. This work provides a method for orchestrating the behavior of transferred cells in vivo, offering a promising strategy to better unleash the potential of adoptive cell therapies against solid tumors.

In a study of the biosynthesis of the polyether ionophore lysocellin, the P450 enzyme LyoI was found to catalyze a rare oxidation of a hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran moiety to its hemiketal form. The oxidation was identified as the key for unlocking the bioactivity of lysocellin. The sequence of LyoI lacks a key acidic residue, essential for its oxidative capabilities, which was utilized to identify a range of non&#8208;canonical P450 enzymes.








Abstract
Polyether ionophores are potent antimicrobials, albeit also cytotoxic against mammalian cells. We have identified several polyether ionophores containing a common hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran&#8208;2&#8208;ol (hemiketal) moiety, which cannot be derived from the canonical biosynthetic steps observed for the compound class, suggesting an unusual oxidative transformation. To identify the responsible enzyme, we applied CRISPR&#8211;BEST to knock out genes in the lysocellin&#8208;producing strain S. longwoodensis. This allowed us to propose the first annotation of the lysocellin biosynthetic gene cluster and identify the responsible P450 enzyme, LyoI, through reconstitution of the function in vivo. LyoI knockout provided access to the non&#8208;oxidized precursor (pre&#8208;lysocellin) which allowed both in vitro validation of the unusual direct hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran to hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran&#8208;2&#8208;ol oxidation and investigation of the impact on biological activity. Interestingly, absence of the LyoI&#8208;mediated oxidation greatly reduced the biological potency of the compound. Closer investigation of the sequence revealed that LyoI lacks a key conserved acidic residue, which proved essential for the unusual oxidative function of the enzyme. Through a sequence similarity network of LyoI, we were able to identify a wide range of non&#8208;canonical P450 enzymes, highlighting the possibilities of a biosynthesis&#8208;focused approach to discovering novel enzymes.

         <title>&#8220;Twisted&#8221; Terpolymer Donor Enabling High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a new strategy to enhance the stretchability and photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) simultaneously by twisting the conjugated backbone of polymer donors. Efficient OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3% with a remarkable crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 23.8% are fabricated. Moreover, the intrinsically stretchable OSCs (is&#8208;OSCs) achieved a PCE of 14.2% and excellent stretchability with a strain at PCE80% of 31.0%, ranking among the highest values.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (is&#8208;OSCs) hold great potential for next&#8208;generation wearable power generators. Currently, high&#8208;efficiency polymeric donor materials are based on rigid planar conjugated backbones, which limits their mechanical robustness and creates a trade&#8208;off between photovoltaic performance and stretchability. To simultaneously improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness of is&#8208;OSCs, we develop a series of ductile PM&#8208;BOX% terpolymers by incorporating different amounts (X&#160;=&#160;5, 10, and 20) of 3&#8208;butyloctyl&#8208;thiophene (ThBO) units into PM6 backbone. The BO alkyl side chains appended on Th&#8208;BO units induce a more significant twist in the backbone compared to PM6, which increases the disordered contents and facilitates the stress dissipation, hence enhancing the mechanical stretchability. While the conjugated thiophene unit preserves the &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, maintaining efficient charge transport. As a result, the PM&#8208;BO10%:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based devices outperform the PM6&#8208;based ones, achieving a higher PCE of 18.3% and a superior crack&#8208;onset strain of 23.8%. Additionally, PM&#8208;BO10%:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based is&#8208;OSCs reach a PCE of 14.2% with an excellent PCE retention (80% of its initial PCE at 31.0% strain), marking one of the highest values for is&#8208;OSCs. This twisted terpolymer design strategy paves a novel way for designing efficient polymer donors with excellent stretchability for the application in is&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>A Solid&#8208;State Crystallization Strategy for Direct Enzyme Encapsulation in Zr&#8208;MOFs: Eliminating Harsh pH and Thermal Requirements of Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis</title>

Robust Zr&#8208;MOFs synthesized via aqueous solid&#8208;state routes enabling one&#8208;pot enzyme encapsulation and enhanced catalytic stability in harsh conditions.








Abstract
Conventional syntheses of robust Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) rely on harsh solvothermal conditions, precluding the inclusion of fragile functionalities such as enzymes or organisms. Therefore, developing routes to such stable frameworks under ambient conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a mild aqueous solid&#8208;state crystallization (SSC) strategy that enables Zr&#8208;MOF assembly at ambient temperature. This approach transforms an amorphous precursor into a crystalline framework via water&#8208;mediated dynamic ligand exchange. Solid&#8208;state 13C NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal an acid&#8208;catalyzed associative substitution mechanism at Zr6 nodes, in which formate modulators are protonated and displaced by fumarate linkers, driving MOF&#8208;801 crystallization without external heating or organic solvent. We further apply this SSC method to other Zr&#8208;MOFs, including functionalized UiO&#8208;66 analogues, establishing it as a general model for ambient MOF assembly. This amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline transformation represents a new synthetic paradigm for constructing stable porous frameworks under biocompatible conditions and enables the integration of sensitive biomolecules (e.g., enzymes) into robust MOFs. In addition, this method for MOF&#8208;801 formation is universally adaptable for encapsulating various proteins. The enzyme@Zr&#8208;MOF composites significantly enhance enzyme stability in catalytic reactions involving acidic products, demonstrating the necessity of robust Zr&#8208;MOF shells.

         <dc:description>
An ideal semiconductor&#8208;cluster&#8208;based photocatalytic platform is exemplified to clarify the critical balance between kinetics and thermodynamics in inert substrate activation from the perspective of the Marcus charge transfer theory. This balance endows the proposed protocol with remarkable versatility, enabling the dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and hydrodehalogenation of challenging aryl/alkyl chlorides and fluorides, along with arylation and amination under visible light.








Abstract
Photoredox catalysis is an essential component of modern organic synthesis. However, current photocatalysts face the challenge of simultaneously requiring strong redox potentials and efficient charge transfer to meet the thermodynamic and kinetic demands of photoinduced electron transfer processes. Herein, we present an excellent reactivity mode for photocatalysis based on semiconductor clusters, exploiting the ideal Marcus parabola to couple potential and kinetic requirements. Our system demonstrates an exceptionally high negative reduction potential (Ered) (&#8722;2.94&#160;V versus SCE, on par with K0) and realizes efficient charge transfer&#8212;rapid charge separation (CS) and slow charge recombination (CR) kinetics. This duality endows the protocol with remarkable versatility by enabling the dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and reductive dehalogenation of challenging aryl/alkyl chlorides and aryl fluorides, as well as arylation and amination, with a high functional group tolerance under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Furthermore, this platform offers easy recyclability, supports gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and can be extended to the late&#8208;stage functionalization and deuteration of drugs. This innovative catalytic platform provides a new approach for the photochemical activation of inert organic substrates and is foreseen to promote the development of radical reaction&#8208;based pharmaceutical synthesis.

Covalent activation of racemic sulfonimidoyl chlorides via an isothiourea&#8208;derived sulfonimidoyl intermediate is disclosed for the highly enantioselective synthesis of S(VI)&#8208;stereogenic sulfonimidates. The enantioenriched sulfonimidates serve as linchpin intermediates for efficient sulfur(VI)&#8208;phenolate exchange in the construction of a wide range of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfoximines, sulfonimidamides.








Abstract
In contrast to the notable advancements focusing on the preparation of optically enriched S(IV) frameworks in recent years, achieving catalyst stereocontrol over S(VI) stereogenicity to generate chiral S(VI) scaffolds remains a largely underexplored challenge. Herein, we document a new activation mode of isothiourea organocatalysis for the highly enantioselective synthesis of S(VI)&#8208;chiral sulfonimidates. This method involves the covalent activation of racemic S(VI) sulfonimidoyl chlorides through the formation of a pivotal isothiourea&#8208;bound sulfonimidoyl intermediate. The newly formed S(VI)&#8208;based isothiourea reactive species further governs the subsequent asymmetric S&#9472;O bond formation to afford the chiral sulfonimidate products with high yields and selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the facile inversion of the tetrasubstituted S(VI) stereogenic center assisted by the chiral catalyst is crucial in the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) process. Notably, distinct from the extensively studied isothiourea catalysis focused on the activation of &#8220;C&#8221;&#8208;centered substrates, our method introduces a novel S&#8208;atom activation approach, enabling the efficient construction of S(VI) stereogenic centers. Furthermore, the obtained enantioenriched sulfonimidates serve as linchpin intermediates in efficient sulfur&#8208;phenolate exchange for rapid access to diverse S(VI)&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfoximines, sulfonimidamides, and their derivatives, with notable antimicrobial activity against various plant pathogens.

         <title>In&#8208;Built Compatible Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;SPAN Batteries</title>

A in&#8208;situ polymerized interface is successfully constructed between solid polymer electrolytes and electrodes. Al(OTf)3 in the electrolyte initiates 1,3&#8208;dioxolane polymerization to lower interfacial impedance, while fluoroethylene carbonate&#8208;derived CEI suppresses sulfurized polyacrylonitrile&#8217;s shuttle effect. This enables the Li&#8208;S battery to retain 90% capacity after 200 cycles at 0.5C.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have been regarded as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems owing to their high energy density and low cost. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) as a cathode material has received wide interest due to the solid&#8208;solid conversion mechanism, while the Li&#8208;SPAN cell performance has been limited by the notorious issue of lithium metal anode. Developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with favorable electrode&#8208;electrolyte compatibility is urgently desired. Herein, we demonstrate a dual&#8208;interface optimization strategy through in&#8208;situ polymerization interface construction, which synergistically enhances interfacial compatibility between the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) and both the lithium metal anode and SPAN cathode. The initiator pre&#8208;buried in the SPE triggers the in&#8208;situ polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) at the interface, thereby greatly reducing the electrode/electrolyte interfacial impedance. Additionally, the released fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) into the poly&#8208;DOL interface could further reduce the impedance and enhance the interface stability during cycling, simultaneously preventing the dissolution of polysulfides, owing to the inorganic&#8208;rich and dense cathode electrolyte interphase formed on SPAN. As a result, the Li&#8208;SPAN cell could operate more than 200 cycles at 0.5C with a capacity retention of 90%. We believe that this strategy provides prospects for the development of high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Chiral Molecules Induce Enantiomorphic Lattice Helicity in Chiral 0D Tin Bromide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Chiral (R&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 and (S&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 metal halides crystallize in enantiomorphic helical space groups P61 and P65, respectively. The helical orientation of chiral molecules in the lattice arises due to strong N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and is visualized via sixfold symmetry. The crystals show mirror&#8208;image CD spectra (g&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) and circularly polarized SHG with a dissymmetry factor (gCP&#8211;SHG) up to 0.44.








Abstract
Chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides have emerged as a promising class of materials for spin&#8208;controlled optical and optoelectronic effects and related applications. Chiral hybrid metal halides generally crystallize in non&#8208;helical space groups. Herein, we report the discovery of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral (R/S&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 (MBA: methylbenzylammonium cation) single crystals with enantiomorphic lattice helicity. The S&#8208;enantiomer of the chiral molecule induces right&#8208;handed helicity with the P61 space group (right&#8208;handed, P&#8208;helix), while the R&#8208;enantiomer induces right&#8208;handed helicity with the P65 space group (left&#8208;handed, M&#8208;helix). The chiral molecules induce the helical twist of inorganic units in the lattice through N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strong electronic coupling between chiral molecules and SnBr62&#8722; subunits is responsible for the generation of chirality. The chiral crystals exhibit circular dicroism (CD) spectra with a high dissymmetry factor (gCD) of 3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and no Cotton effect, maintaining the same CD sign throughout the spectrum. In addition, they exhibit broadband second harmonic generation (SHG) over a broad excitation range, with a gCP&#8208;SHG up to 0.44. Furthermore, we find that the alloying of Sn with Pb leads to a change in dimensionality from 0D to non&#8208;helical 1D structures. These crystals with helical lattices and interesting CD responses are expected to open new avenues for spin&#8208;controlled applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe with nitric oxide (NO) and acidity dual&#8208;stimuli responsiveness, permitting highly specific near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) with reduced background interference and minimal therapeutic side effects.








Abstract
The development of activatable optical probes has proved to be a promising approach to improve the accuracy of phototheranostics. However, most such probes are usually responsive to single pathological factor and visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I light upon activation, which restricts the theranostic specificity and tissue penetration depth, respectively. Herein, we develop a nitric oxide (NO) and acidity dual&#8208;stimuli responsive semiconducting polymer nanoprobe for activatable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Specifically, a weak electron acceptor (benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;5,6&#8208;diamine, BT2NH2) has been conjugated with diketopyrrolopyrrole to construct the pathological factor&#8208;sensitive molecular probe. Upon the coactivation of NO and acidity, the BT2NH2 is oxidized to generate a strong electron acceptor (5H&#8208;[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;f]&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole, BT3N), leading to the absorption enhancement in the NIR&#8208;II region. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate the successful activation of the probe toward activated macrophages, various cancer cells, drug&#8208;induced liver injury, and breast cancer to output enhanced NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic and photothermal signals, permitting highly specific PAI and PTT with reduced background interference and minimal therapeutic side effects. By virtue of the improved specificity and superior penetration depth, the dual&#8208;stimuli responsive NIR&#8208;II probe has broad prospects for precise visualization and intervention toward NO and acid&#8208;associated pathological and physiological events from deep tissues.

         <title>A Tertiary Amine&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Methylation&#8208;Mediated Steric and Electronic Synergy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N, N&#8208;dimethylurethane (NDMUE), which is formed by methylating the &#945;&#8208;H atoms on the urethane (UE) and N&#8208;methylurethane molecules, results in an increase in steric hindrance and the formation of a hyper&#8208;conjugated structure. This facilitates more anions to participate in Li+ coordination and enhances the stability of the lithium metal, enabling a 3.0&#8208;Ah LiFePO4||Li pouch cell with excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
The application of the amine&#8208;based solvents (AS) in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) electrolyte is hindered by the severe parasitic reactions between active hydrogen and Li metal. In this study, we synthesized a methylated AS (N, N&#8208;dimethylurethane, NDMUE), by replacing the reactive hydrogen with a methyl group. We further demonstrated its performance as a single&#8208;component solvent for LMB electrolytes. Its performance as a single&#8208;component solvent for LMB electrolytes was demonstrated. The methyl substitution was found to enhance steric hindrance and introduce a hyper&#8208;conjugated structure, Its weak solvent &#9472;Li+ interactions promote anion&#8208;dominated solvation, and facilitating controlled solvent reduction. This molecular modification leads to a mechanically robust bilayer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium metal anode through the sequential reduction processes: the anion&#8208;driven reduction produced an inner inorganic layer, while the ester moiety contributed to an outer organic layer. Together, these layers effectively suppressed dendrite growth. As a result, we demonstrated outstanding cycling performance with a 3&#8208;Ah LiFePO4||Li pouch cell using the NDMUE&#8208;based electrolyte, retaining nearly 100% of its capacity after 273 cycles at 0.2 C. This work establishes a rational design strategy for amine&#8208;derived electrolytes and provides a fundamental framework for developing advanced electrolyte systems in durable LMBs.

         <title>Synergistic Construction of In Situ Self&#8208;Polymerized Interface and Localized pH Buffer Zone for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

A multifunctional electrolyte pH buffer, valerolactam, was developed to stabilize the zinc anode, regulate interfacial pH, self&#8208;polymerize into a robust SEI layer, and suppress polyiodide shuttling, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical use is hindered by challenges such as Zn dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion, and polyiodide shuttle effect. In this study, valerolactam (VL) is employed as an organic pH buffer to address these issues. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that VL can regulate the electrolyte local pH while in situ polymerizing on the electrode surface to form a mechanically stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) protection layer, effectively suppressing HER, corrosion, and dendrite growth. Furthermore, the introduction of VL significantly regulates the solvation structure of Zn2+, and disrupts the inherent hydrogen bonding network, which enhances the electrochemical performance. As a result, a symmetric cell with VL&#8208;based electrolyte achieves impressive longevity under ultra&#8208;high current density (4000 cycles at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), 4.3 times higher than the counterpart in the conventional ZnSO4 electrolytes. Moreover, VL effectively suppresses polyiodide shuttle effect and improves electrochemical stability. Consequently, Zn&#8211;I2 full battery exhibits exceptional cycling stability, sustaining 26&#160;500 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 86.4%. Therefore, organic pH buffering engineering has been proved to be a promising strategy for achieving dendrite&#8208;free, shuttle&#8208;free Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Tuning Surface Concentrations of Building Units to Enable the Cathodic Deposition of Metastable ZIF&#8208;L Films for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodic deposition enables the formation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films, yet precise control of surface building&#8208;unit concentrations remain challenging. By finely tuning these concentrations, metastable ZIF&#8208;L membranes are obtained with high gas separation performance. This approach establishes a general strategy for regulating building units under negative bias, applicable to other surface&#8208;sensitive MOFs.








Abstract
Cathodic deposition is an emerging technique for the preparation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films. However, monitoring and controlling the concentrations of MOF building units (i.e., metal nodes and ligands) on the electrode surface remains challenging and has yet to be reported. This limitation greatly hinders the application of this technique to the synthesis of MOFs sensitive to building unit concentrations, such as the well&#8208;known metastable ZIF&#8208;L. Here, using the cathodic deposition of ZIF&#8208;L films as an example, we demonstrate how the surface metal node and ligand concentrations influence ZIF&#8208;L film generation by utilizing in situ pH measurements and theoretical calculations. Also, we propose a strategy to regulate the concentrations of these building units, enabling the straightforward and rapid cathodic deposition of thin ZIF&#8208;L films. With polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) post&#8208;modification, the electrochemically deposited ZIF&#8208;L films on commercial anodized alumina oxide (AAO) substrate exhibit good gas separation performance, achieving a H2/N2 selectivity of 19.4 and a H2 permeance exceeding 360 GPU (1 GPU&#160;=&#160;3.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;1&#8304; mol m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1 Pa&#8722;1).

         <title>Molecular Insights into Active Sites of Manganese Oxide Based Water Oxidation Eletrocatalysts</title>

Tri&#8208; and di&#8208;manganese model complexes are developed to mimic the in&#8208;plane and on&#8208;edge subunits of birnessite&#8208;like heterogeneous MnOx electrocatalysts. Electrochemical results indicate that the former acts as a robust molecular catalyst to facilitate 4&#8208;e WOR to produce O2 while the latter exhibits marginal catalytic activity on WOR, suggesting that the defective tri&#8208;nuclear cubical motif is most likely the active site of MnOx electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Manganese oxides (MnOx) are promising candidates for water oxidation catalysts. However, the true active centers remain elusive due to the dynamic nature of MnOx during electrolysis and/or activation, hindering progress in catalyst design and optimization. Herein, we aim to address such a challenge by preparing a defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese complex and a di&#8208;manganese complex to mimic the in&#8208;plane and on&#8208;edge subunits of birnessite&#8208;like heterogeneous MnOx electrocatalysts. Electrochemical results indicate that the defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese complex is a robust molecular catalyst to facilitate 4e&#8722; water oxidation to produce O2 with an optimal Faradic efficiency of 95% and an average rate of oxygen generation of 46.4&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is among the highest values of reported manganese&#8208;based molecular catalysts and is comparable with representative heterogeneous MnOx systems. In contrast, the di&#8208;manganese complex exhibits marginal catalytic activity. This work provides molecular insights into the true active centers of MnOx and aids in the precise design of more efficient MnOx water oxidation electrocatalysts.

         <title>Switching Enantioselectivity in Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase for the Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Deficient Aromatic d&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Phenylalanine ammonia lyases (PALs) were engineered to switch enantioselectivity, enabling hydroamination for the direct synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient aromatic d&#8208;amino acids (d&#8208;AA). Structure&#8208;guided engineering provided PAL variants with broad substrate scope, high activity, and excellent d&#8208;selectivity, broadening the utility of PALs in asymmetric synthesis.








Abstract
Aromatic d&#8208;amino acids (d&#8208;AAs) are valuable building blocks in drug discovery and peptide therapeutics, yet their direct and efficient biocatalytic synthesis remains a challenge. Here, we report the rational engineering of phenylalanine ammonia lyase from Planctomyces brasiliensis (PbPAL) to enable asymmetric hydroamination for the enantioselective synthesis of d&#8208;aromatic amino acids. By targeting active&#8208;site residue L205, we identified variants capable of highly d&#8208;enantioselective hydroamination, with L205F enabling the transformation of electron&#8208;deficient aryl acrylates with &gt;99% enantiomeric excess (ee). The synthetic utility of this platform was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis of d&#8208;benzoxazole and substituted 2&#8208;pyridylalanines. Structural and mutational studies revealed distinct roles for the 4&#8208;methylideneimidazole&#8208;5&#8208;one (MIO) prosthetic group and active&#8208;site residues L205, Y64, and K397 in modulating enantioselectivity. These results enabled the identification of PbPAL variants with the opposite selectivity, such as L205V&#8208;K397A, which preferentially produce l&#8208;amino acids. This work broadens the utility of PALs as programmable biocatalysts for asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2O2 Production with a Nearly 2% Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Chemical Conversion Efficiency via a Dedicated Construction of Redox Centers in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

NMFS&#8208;Cu showed excellent activity for H2O2 photosynthesis with a nearly 2% solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency. The single&#8208;atom Cu sites in NMFS&#8208;Cu promote the formation of Cu&#8208;&#956;&#8208;peroxide (Cu&#8208;O2&#8722;) and desorption of *H2O2, leading to an efficient 2e&#8722; ORR pathway. The in situ generated O2 via water oxidation reaction is rapidly consumed by ORR resulting in a boosted photocatalytic generation of H2O2.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a green oxidant widely used in a variety of industries. Photocatalytic generation of H2O2 from water and oxygen by sunlight is an appealing strategy compared to the high energy consumption of the industrial anthraquinone process. However, the low activity and selectivity of the two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during the photocatalytic process greatly restricts the H2O2 production efficiency. Here, we demonstrated that the redox centers in MOFs (NMFS&#8208;M, single&#8208;atom M linked to an iron&#8208;oxo cluster in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe) by a molecular linker cysteine, M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for the production of H2O2 from water and oxygen. The optimal NMFS&#8208;Cu stably generates H2O2 under simulated sunlight irradiation with a nearly 2% solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency under AM1.5 spectrum and an apparent quantum yield of 19.6% at 420&#160;nm. Combined with density functional theory calculations, isotopic experiments, and advanced spectroscopic characterizations, the high photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the notably promoted sequential two&#8208;step ORR to H2O2 by forming &#956;&#8208;peroxide and desorption of *H2O2 at the single&#8208;atom Cu sites. The in situ generated O2 via water oxidation reaction is rapidly consumed by ORR, leading to a boosted photocatalytic generation of H2O2.

         <title>Harnessing Electrocatalytic Coupling of Carbon Dioxide and Methanol for High&#8208;Efficiency Formic Acid Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated CO2 reduction and methanol oxidation system employing CuBi cathode and NiCo anode enables efficient cogeneration of formic acid. The electron&#8208;rich Bi sites accelerate HCOO* formation, while low&#8208;coordination Co atoms enhance methanol oxidation. The coupled system delivers total Faradaic efficiencies of 189%&#8211;192% across 2.0&#8211;2.8 V, achieving sustainable and energy&#8208;efficient FA production.








Abstract
The coupling of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) presents a promising strategy for simultaneous cogeneration of formic acid (FA) at both cathode and anode. However, sluggish kinetics, low selectivity and efficiency hinder practical application. Herein, we demonstrate an integrated ECR||MOR system employing CuBi cathode and NiCo anode for energy&#8208;efficient FA cogeneration. The CuBi alloy achieves high Faradaic efficiencies (FE&#160;&gt;&#160;90%) for FA generation over an extensive potential range (&gt;400&#160;mV), attributed to the accelerated formation of HCOO* intermediates in facilitating FA production. Meanwhile, the NiCo alloy reached a remarkable FE of 97.5% for FA generation at 1.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, benefiting from rapid HCOO* intermediate formation that effectively mitigates CO toxicity. This unique system delivered a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 2.07&#160;V, representing a substantial reduction of 320&#160;mV compared to water electrolysis. Across a wide operational voltage window (2.0&#8211;2.8&#160;V), the system consistently delivered total Faradaic efficiencies ranging between 189% and 192%, alongside exceptional FA production capacities surpassing 400&#160;g kWh&#8722;1, which significantly outperformed traditional methods (&#8764;220&#160;g kWh&#8722;1). This work provides an efficient pathway for low&#8208;energy CO2 utilization and sustainable FA production.

         <title>TASK2&#8208;Inspired pH&#8208;Gating Polymeric Nanochannels with Multiple Interconvertible Permeability States by Synergistic Regulation of Conformation and Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic precise permeation regulation of biological ion channels, an extrinsic&#8208;gate composite strategy is provided to build smart polymeric nanochannels with four ion permeability states in response to pH stimuli. Beneficial for synergy transformation of structure and charge properties, the nanochannels achieve pH&#8208;gating on&#8211;off switch of fast cation flux, superhigh cation/anion selectivity, and salinity&#8208;gradient energy transduction, respectively. 








Abstract
Biological ion channels can regulate finely the ion transmembrane permeation, with superhigh ion selectivity and on&#8211;off ion flux in response to external stimuli, for signal transduction and energy conversion. However, fabricating smart artificial nanochannels with analogous functions remain challenging by single design of structure or charge property. In vivo, function basis of pH&#8208;gated TWIK&#8208;related acid&#8208;sensitive K+ channel 2 (TASK2) channels is attributed to synergy control of geometrical conformation and surface potential for filter gates. With this inspiration, we report an extrinsic&#8208;gate composite strategy to construct biomimetic responsive nanochannels, based on dye&#8208;loading branched poly(piperidine)s. Two nanochannel models, negatively&#8208;charged large pores (0.76&#160;nm) and positively&#8208;charged small pores (0.49&#160;nm), can be switched quickly by external pH stimuli, due to protonation/deprotonation and conformation change of gates. Thereby, symmetric and asymmetric pH stimuli at the two sides of nanochannels achieve four distinct permeability states to various ions, respectively, to mimic inactivated, inhibited, rest, and activated states of TASK2 channels. Applying for salinity&#8208;gradient energy conversion, the high&#8208;selectivity/high&#8208;flux states (SNa+/Cl&#8722;&#8764;3332) and low&#8208;selectivity and low&#8208;flux permeability states (SNa+/Cl&#8722;&#8764;0.33) act as an on&#8211;off switch of salinity&#8208;gradient energy nanogenerator, with superhigh energy conversion efficiency of &#8764;50%. This work suggests the potential of extrinsic&#8208;gate composite nanochannels for in vitro biomimetic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Biological ion channels can regulate finely the ion transmembrane permeation, with superhigh ion selectivity and on&#8211;off ion flux in response to external stimuli, for signal transduction and energy conversion. However, fabricating smart artificial nanochannels with analogous functions remain challenging by single design of structure or charge property. In vivo, function basis of pH-gated TWIK-related acid-sensitive K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel 2 (TASK2) channels is attributed to synergy control of geometrical conformation and surface potential for filter gates. With this inspiration, we report an extrinsic-gate composite strategy to construct biomimetic responsive nanochannels, based on dye-loading branched poly(piperidine)s. Two nanochannel models, negatively-charged large pores (0.76&#160;nm) and positively-charged small pores (0.49&#160;nm), can be switched quickly by external pH stimuli, due to protonation/deprotonation and conformation change of gates. Thereby, symmetric and asymmetric pH stimuli at the two sides of nanochannels achieve four distinct permeability states to various ions, respectively, to mimic inactivated, inhibited, rest, and activated states of TASK2 channels. Applying for salinity-gradient energy conversion, the high-selectivity/high-flux states (S&lt;sub&gt;Na+/Cl&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8764;3332) and low-selectivity and low-flux permeability states (S&lt;sub&gt;Na+/Cl&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8764;0.33) act as an on&#8211;off switch of salinity-gradient energy nanogenerator, with superhigh energy conversion efficiency of &#8764;50%. This work suggests the potential of extrinsic-gate composite nanochannels for in vitro biomimetic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precisely Bonded Fe&#9472;Cu Diatomic Sites with Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged Coordination on Hollow C3N4 Spheres for Efficient C&#9472;N Coupling and Selective Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Hollow g&#8208;C3N4 spheres anchored with Fe&#9472;Cu diatomic sites enable efficient photocatalytic CO2 and N2 co&#8208;reduction via selective adsorption and synergistic C&#9472;N coupling. The Fe site activates CO2, while the Cu site stabilizes N2, facilitating *NCON intermediate formation. Atomic&#8208;level Fe&#9472;Cu coordination enhances charge separation, light harvesting, and multireactant activation for sustainable urea synthesis.








Abstract
The photocatalytic synthesis of urea from CO2 and N2 co&#8208;reduction presents a promising alternative to the conventional energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface often limits selectivity and yield. Here, we designed hollow graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) spheres, which serve as a high surface area scaffold for precise anchoring of Fe&#9472;Cu diatomic sites. Hollow architecture enhances light harvesting via inner&#8208;scattering effects and charge separation. Each Fe&#9472;Cu site is coordinated with two nitrogen atoms, forming N2&#9472;Fe1&#9472;Cu1&#9472;N2 /C3N4 DAC (hereafter referred to as FeCu/CN), which enables cooperative activation of CO2 and N2, in contrast to monodispersed diatomic (Fe+Cu/CN), and single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe/CN, Cu/CN). The FeCu/CN bonded pairs serve as highly efficient active centers, facilitating the synergistic adsorption and activation of multiple reactants. Specifically, during the co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and N2, the Fe1 site preferentially adsorbs and activates CO2, while bonded Cu1 sites stabilize N2 on FeCu/CN and enable synergistic C&#9472;N coupling through the formation of *NCON intermediates. As a result, the FeCu/CN achieves an exceptional urea yield of 7.40&#160;mg&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with a 38.58% selectivity under visible light irradiation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atomic&#8208;level coordination in multireactants and offer insights into the C&#9472;N coupling for value&#8208;added products using CO2 and N2 as feedstock.

         <title>Halogenation&#8208;Engineered Acceptor Enables 20.14% Efficiency in Hydrocarbon&#8208;Solvent Processed OSCs: From Binary Trade&#8208;Offs to Ternary Synergy in Exciton and Energy Loss Management</title>

Halogenation engineering of benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors enables nonhalogenated solvent processed organic solar cells with an efficiency 20.14%, revealing how halogenation modulates intermolecular interactions, energy loss, and morphology.








Abstract
Halogenation emerges as a key strategy to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) by tuning molecular packing, energy levels, and charge dynamics. Here, we report three new benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;core small&#8208;molecule acceptors, namely NA5, NA6, and NA7, and systematically evaluate their photovoltaic properties in o&#8208;xylene&#8208;processed binary and ternary OSCs. Halogenation significantly strengthens intermolecular interactions, improves charge carrier mobility, and facilitates exciton dissociation, leading to a remarkable increase in binary device efficiencies from &#8764;2% (NA5) to over 17% (NA6, NA7). However, halogenation also increases charge&#8208;transfer state character, which can induce higher nonradiative recombination and energy loss. Despite this drawback, the enhanced driving force for charge separation and improved morphological order enabled by halogenation outweigh the negative effects on energy loss. Notably, incorporation of NA7 into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 ternary system optimizes blend morphology, suppresses nonradiative recombination, and thus achieves a record power conversion efficiency of 20.14% (certified 19.93%)&#8212;the highest reported for OSCs processed with hydrocarbon solvents. These findings highlight the dual role of halogenation in modulating both beneficial and detrimental aspects of device energetics, providing new insights into molecular design strategies for high&#8208;performance, environmental&#8208;friendly OSCs.

         <title>Cyclometalating Ligand Affords NIR Absorption in Ruthenium Complexes for Type&#8208;I Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Utilizing a cyclometalating ligand, we report &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP, which exhibits (metal and ligand)&#8211;ligand charge transfer, resulting in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region absorption. The TPABP ligand, with its strong electron&#8208;donating capacity, promotes Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy (PDT), rendering it highly effective under hypoxic conditions. This work provides design principles for cyclometalated Ru (II) complexes with NIR absorption for Type&#8208;I PDT.








Abstract
The development of NIR photosensitizers (PSs) based on Ru complexes with Type&#8208;I process holds substantial promise for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer, though this breakthrough remains unrealized to date. Herein, a pair of cyclometalated Ru enantiomers, [&#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;dqpy&#8208;TPABP]Cl (dqpy: 2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine; TPABP: 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)triphenylamine) (&#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP), were synthesized and evaluated. These complexes exhibit strong Ru(d) and TPABP(&#960;) &#8594; dqpy(&#960;*) charge transfer ((metal and ligand)&#8211;ligand charge transfer; ML&#8211;LCT) absorption at &#8764;640&#160;nm, with an extended absorption tail reaching up to 800&#160;nm. Moreover, the TPABP ligand, with its strong electron&#8208;rich capacity, contributes to T1 formation, which increases the electron transfer possibility in the triplet state and promotes Type&#8208;I PDT, making it highly effective for killing cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Further encapsulating &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP into polymeric nanoparticles results in high tumor inhibition efficiency (&gt;85%) and causes a strong tumoricidal effect and inhibits lung metastasis of breast tumors under 700&#160;nm light irradiation, thus offering a new strategy for developing NIR Ru complexes for anticancer treatment through the design of cyclometalating ligand.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [4+2]/Cheletropic Retro&#8208;[4+1] Cycloadditions of Thiophene S,S&#8208;Dioxides with 3&#8208;Substituted Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric IEDDA/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloadditions, using thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides (TDOs) and 3&#8208;substituted indoles as reaction partners, are realized by a chiral Fe(III)/BOX complex. A series of cyclohexa&#8208;fused tricyclic indolines bearing a bridgehead quaternary stereogenic center are synthesized in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities.

Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloadditions of thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides are a prominent method for synthesizing unsaturated six&#8208;membered carbocycles. However, to the best of our knowledge, catalytic asymmetric variations of these reactions have not yet been achieved. Herein, we report Fe(III)&#8208;bis(oxazoline) complex&#8208;catalyzed inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand [4+2] cycloaddition/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] extrusion of SO2 reactions between thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides and 3&#8208;substituted indoles. The key to the success of this transformation involves using thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxide components bearing an N&#8208;acyloxazolidinone group at the C2 position, which coordinates with the chiral catalyst, and a halide group at the C5 position to prevent the self&#8208;dimerization of thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. Computational studies revealed that the [4+2] cycloaddition proceeds via a stepwise mechanism, with the subsequent retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloaddition acting as a driving force to facilitate the initial [4+2] cycloaddition. This [4+2]/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloaddition reaction sequence enables the synthesis of a broad range of hexahydrocarbazoles bearing a quaternary stereogenic center, which are core structures in numerous families of indole alkaloids, in good yields with high enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated through diverse product transformations and a concise, enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;geissoschizoline.

Bio&#8208;inspired proton transport regulation via 5&#8208;fluorouracil tautomerism within sulfonated MOF&#8208;808 to reconcile the inherent trade&#8208;off between low activation energy and sustained proton mobility








Abstract
The strategic modulation of proton transport kinetics and precise control of migration energy barriers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are essential for developing next&#8208;generation proton conductors. Inspired by biological proton channels, this study introduces a dynamic regulation strategy by keto&#8208;enol tautomerism to reconcile the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between low activation energy (Ea) and sustained proton mobility. We successfully construct a hierarchical proton conductive system (denoted as FU@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H) by integrating 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) molecules into sulfonic&#8208;functionalized MOF&#8208;808 through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification. The enol tautomer of 5&#8208;FU reconfigures hydrogen&#8208;bond networks under humidity variations, synergizing with anchored &#9472;SO3H groups to establish proton transport pathways along ordered ionic channels (&#9472;SO3H&#183;&#183;&#183;H2O&#183;&#183;&#183;5&#8208;FU) and tautomerism&#8208;driven delocalization via reversible keto&#8208;enol isomerization. The optimized compound FU@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H exhibits a high proton conductivity of 7.15&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 353&#160;K and 95% RH, representing an approximate 300&#8208;fold enhancement over pristine MOF&#8208;808, a 15&#8208;fold improvement versus the 5&#8208;FU&#8208;encapsulated analogue FU@MOF&#8208;808, and the sulfonated framework MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate an ultra&#8208;low formation energy barrier (9.05 and 1.59&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1) from keto to enol conversion, attributed to sulfonic acid stabilization of protonated transition states. Furthermore, the proton conductive mechanism is visually corroborated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, suggesting Grotthuss&#8208;dominated proton migration within hydrated nanochannels, aligning with experimental results.

         <title>Adjusting Chemical Hardness&#8211;Softness Balance of Electrolyte to Enable High&#8208;Voltage Reversible Fluoride Ion Batteries</title>

An electrolyte system based on tetrabutylammonium fluoride salt and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid solvent is designed based on anion&#8211;cation coordination engineering and hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base balance modulation. The soft&#8208;acid BMIm&#8314; participates in the solvation structure of hard&#8208;base fluoride ions, effectively expanding the electrochemical window and cycling life of fluoride ion batteries based on Cu2O cathode.








Abstract
Fluoride ion batteries (FIBs), as a promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage technology, have attracted significant attention. However, developing an ideal fluoride&#8208;ion electrolyte that suppresses the &#946;&#8208;H abstraction (caused by strong Lewis&#8208;basicity F&#8722;) and electrolyte decomposition remains challenging. To address this bottleneck, we design an electrolyte system based on commercial tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) salt and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMImBF4) ionic liquid solvent through anion&#8211;cation coordination engineering and hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base (HSAB) balance modulation, unveiling its multiscale mechanisms for mitigating interfacial parasitic reaction and enhancing metal anode stability. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the soft&#8208;acid BMIm&#8314; participates in the solvation structure of hard&#8208;base fluoride ions, effectively blocking the &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathway and expanding the electrochemical window to 4.5&#160;V. The ionic conductivity of this ionic liquid based electrolyte reaches 5.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S cm&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C even after in situ polymerization. The Cu2O cathode coupling insertion and conversion reactions can alleviate the volume deformation and capacity decay of Cu2O||Li&#8211;LiF high&#8208;voltage FIBs, with a high resting voltage (2.91&#160;V) and a high initial capacity of 589.9&#160;mAh g&#8722;1. The Cu2O||Pb&#8211;PbF2 FIBs maintain a high reversible capacity of 243.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 even after 800 cycles under 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. The work establishes a novel electrolyte design paradigm for high&#8208;voltage reversible FIBs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Mediated Silacyclization by Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Selective C&#9472;F or C&#9472;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavelength&#8208;dependent, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cascade silacyclization of allylbenzene derivatives with dihydrosilanes is developed to enable the efficient construction of six&#8208;membered benzosilacycles. Selective C&#8211;F functionalization is achieved under 456&#160;nm LED irradiation, while irradiation at 335&#160;nm promotes acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization via C&#8211;H functionalization.








Abstract
Silacycles have gained significant attention within the synthetic community due to their pivotal roles in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Despite recent advancements, the defluorosilylation of aryl fluorides with hydrosilanes and the selective silylation of arenes without external oxidants remains challenging. Herein, we present a wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;mediated cascade silacyclization of allylbenzene derivatives with dihydrosilanes to efficiently construct six&#8208;membered benzosilacycles. By employing a synergistic system of an organophotocatalyst and a thiol&#8208;based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, our approach exploits specific light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) wavelengths (456 and 335&#160;nm) to achieve selective C&#8211;F and C&#8211;H functionalization. This wavelength modulation enables the first successful defluorosilacyclization of ortho&#8208;fluoroallylbenzenes and facilitates an acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization, demonstrating precise site&#8208;selective functionalization. Mechanistic investigations reveal a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;facilitated intermolecular hydrosilylation followed by a wavelength&#8208;dependent, chemoselective intramolecular silacyclization cascade. Additionally, an unprecedented light&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution process involving silane and thiol is uncovered within the cascade C&#8211;H silacyclization. This photo&#8208;mediated strategy offers a sustainable and versatile platform for the synthesis of valuable silacycle compounds, exhibiting broad functional group tolerance and precise wavelength&#8208;dependent chemoselectivity.

By employing a synergistic system of an organophotocatalyst and a thiol-based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, our approach exploits specific light-emitting diode (LED) wavelengths (456 and 335&#160;nm) to achieve selective C&#8211;F and C&#8211;H functionalization. This wavelength modulation enables the first successful defluorosilacyclization of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-fluoroallylbenzenes and facilitates an acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization, demonstrating precise site-selective functionalization. Mechanistic investigations reveal a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-facilitated intermolecular hydrosilylation followed by a wavelength-dependent, chemoselective intramolecular silacyclization cascade. Additionally, an unprecedented light-assisted hydrogen evolution process involving silane and thiol is uncovered within the cascade C&#8211;H silacyclization. This photo-mediated strategy offers a sustainable and versatile platform for the synthesis of valuable silacycle compounds, exhibiting broad functional group tolerance and precise wavelength-dependent chemoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The rigid&#8208;cation&#8208;assisted (benzyl&#8208;DABCO)2Cu5I7 (Bz&#8208;Cu5I7) complex achieves near&#8208;unity PLQY by suppressing nonradiative losses via &#960;&#8208;conjugations. Its flexible scintillator film enables a high&#8208;resolution (&gt;20 lp mm&#8722;1) X&#8208;ray imaging, a low radiation dose (71.2 nGyair s&#8722;1), and detailed 3D X&#8208;ray image reconstruction, demonstrating great potential for computed tomography (CT) applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors are essential for 3D X&#8208;ray imaging in computed tomography (CT), but conventional systems require high radiation doses to achieve fine resolution. All&#8208;In&#8208;One (AIO) Cu(I) halide complexes, capable of forming both ionic and coordinate bonds within a single structure, offer efficient scintillation at lower doses, yet their performance remains limited by nonradiative energy losses during indirect X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion. Here, we develop rigid&#8208;cation&#8208;assisted AIO Cu(I) halide complexes by introducing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions to suppress the nonradiative pathways, achieving near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). In particular, the rigid (benzyl&#8208;DABCO)2Cu5I7 (Bz&#8208;Cu5I7) complex stabilizes triplet emissive states, thereby facilitating high&#8208;efficiency radiative recombination and excellent radioluminescence (RL) properties. When incorporated into flexible scintillator film, Bz&#8208;Cu5I7 demonstrates remarkable X&#8208;ray imaging performance, enabling a high spatial resolution exceeding 20 lp mm&#8722;1 and a low radiation dose of 71.2 nGyair s&#8722;1. Importantly, 3D X&#8208;ray image reconstruction of small electronic components reveals fine structural details, highlighting the potential of Bz&#8208;Cu5I7 as a next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray scintillator for low&#8208;dose CT imaging.

         <title>Chemically Stable Tetrazine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Cages with Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification via Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions for SF6/N2 and CO2/N2 Separation</title>

A rigid tetrazine&#8208;based porous organic cage with record SF6 uptake is post&#8208;synthetically tuned via iEDDA chemistry to enhance stability, and further polymerized into networked materials with tunable porosity for selective CO2/N2 separation.








Abstract
Porous organic cages (POCs) have emerged as promising porous materials for a wide range of applications. However, their development is often limited by insufficient chemical stability and challenges in systematically functionalization. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of a tetrazine&#8208;based POC (TC1) featuring rigid tetrahedral structure, prepared via a one&#8208;pot nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction. TC1 exhibits high porosity, with a BET surface area at 1157&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1, and good chemically stability, surpassing most POCs formed through dynamic covalent chemistry. Its well&#8208;defined, electron&#8208;deficient cage cavity enable efficient SF6/N2 separation, showing the highest SF6 adsorption capacity and selectivity among all reported porous molecular materials to data, as confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Post&#8208;synthetic modification of TC1 via inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (iEDDA) reactions yielded two functionalized cages (TC2 and TC3), which maintain good porosity and display further enhanced chemical stability over a broad pH range (&#8208;1 to 15). Furthermore, cage&#8208;based networked materials (TC1&#8208;P1 and TC1&#8208;P2) were successfully constructed through the iEDDA polymerization using TC1 as building unit, resulting in tunable porous frameworks with improved CO2/N2 selectivity.

         <title>Toward Bimetallic Nanowire Arrays with Controlled Compositions Using Block Copolymer Films: The Interplay Between Metal Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;impregnation of block copolymer films enables the creation of ordered arrays of bimetallic nanowires (NWs). The dependence of the NW composition on the feed revealed direct and indirect modes of mutual influence between the metal precursors stemming from the types of interactions involved. The insights gained now enable to design and fabricate arrays of multimetallic nanostructures with both complex morphologies and controlled compositions.








Abstract
Metallic nanowire (NW) arrays are promising components for nanotechnology owing to their elongated, continuous, and directional structure. Bimetallic NWs present synergistic effects that are advantageous for applications in catalysis and magnetism. Yet, creating bimetallic NW arrays requires concomitant control over composition and organization. Block copolymer films, which exhibit periodic arrays of nano&#8208;domains, provide templates that satisfy this requirement. Impregnating the film using two metal precursors followed by plasma treatment enabled us to prepare NW arrays with different bimetallic compositions. The NW composition was found to depend on the composition of the impregnation solution in a nontrivial way, which was strongly influenced by the type of metals used. Studying the behavior of three model metal pairs unraveled different characteristic co&#8208;impregnation behaviors, which we could associate with metal&#8208;ligand and metal&#8208;metal interactions. The insights gained in this study allow us to create bimetallic NW arrays with compositions tailored to the desired properties.

         <title>Crystal Facet&#8208;Engineered Anion Regulation Enables Fast&#8208;Charging Stability in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet&#8208;engineered ZIF&#8208;8 separators with preferential (110) exposure enable directional Li+ flux by anchoring TFSI&#8722; anions at unsaturated Zn sites, suppressing lithium dendrite growth and stabilizing the interface. The microporous architecture further regulates lithium plating, supporting high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle lithium metal batteries under practical conditions.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) offer exceptional energy density and output voltage. However, their practical application remains hindered by sluggish ion transport and uncontrolled lithium dendrite formation, particularly under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, we report a facet&#8208;engineered anion&#8208;regulating separator based on zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with preferentially crystal&#8208;exposed (110) facets. The coordinatively unsaturated Zn centers on this surface serve as Lewis acid sites that selectively anchor bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions (TFSI&#8722;), inducing directional Li+ flux and suppressing dendritic growth. Concurrently, the microporous framework facilitates spatial lithium confinement, mitigating local current density and enhancing interfacial stability. As a result, the engineered separator enables ultra&#8208;stable cycling of Li||Cu cells for over 1400 cycles at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, delivering an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.7%. In full&#8208;cell configurations, LiFePO4 (LFP) cells exhibit 99.9% Coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles at 5 C, while high&#8208;loading Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811, 12.30&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cell retains 84.4% of its capacity after 135 cycles. Furthermore, a Li||LFP pouch cell with a high cathode loading of 19.92&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 demonstrates robust cycling over 170 cycles. These findings establish facet&#8208;engineered separators based on framework materials as a versatile and scalable strategy for advancing stable and fast&#8208;charging metal batteries.

Here, we report a facet-engineered anion-regulating separator based on zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) with preferentially crystal-exposed (110) facets. The coordinatively unsaturated Zn centers on this surface serve as Lewis acid sites that selectively anchor bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions (TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), inducing directional Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux and suppressing dendritic growth. Concurrently, the microporous framework facilitates spatial lithium confinement, mitigating local current density and enhancing interfacial stability. As a result, the engineered separator enables ultra-stable cycling of Li||Cu cells for over 1400 cycles at 2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, delivering an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.7%. In full-cell configurations, LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LFP) cells exhibit 99.9% Coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles at 5 C, while high-loading Li||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811, 12.30&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cell retains 84.4% of its capacity after 135 cycles. Furthermore, a Li||LFP pouch cell with a high cathode loading of 19.92&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; demonstrates robust cycling over 170 cycles. These findings establish facet-engineered separators based on framework materials as a versatile and scalable strategy for advancing stable and fast-charging metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Divergence in Sulfur&#8208;Ligated Iron(III)&#8208;Alkylperoxo Reactivity: Aldehyde Oxidation Prevails over Deformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the mechanistic investigation into an unusual reactivity of a thioether&#8208;ligated low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;alkylperoxide with cyclohexane&#8211;carboxaldehyde as a mimic of nonheme iron(II) enzyme intermediates and highlights that only efficient catalysis happens from a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species.








Abstract
Metalloenzymes activate molecular oxygen within their catalytic cycles to generate a reactive species capable of substrate transformation. In many iron&#8208;containing enzymes, it is a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex that is synthesized from an iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate, although direct observation and characterization of such species have remained elusive, leaving their mechanistic role uncertain. To address this gap in our understanding, we present here the synthesis, comprehensive characterization, and reactivity of a novel thioether&#8208;ligated iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo complex supported by the ligand 2&#8208;((2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl)thio)&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;amine. Characterization was done using UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, resonance Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Reactivity studies reveal that this complex exhibits electrophilic oxidation of model substrates, including dimethylsulfide, triphenylphosphine, and cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde. Notably, the latter substrate reacts via the unusual aldehyde C&#9472;H bond abstraction leading to cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, which is explained by favorable aldehyde C&#9472;H abstraction transition states due to stabilizing interactions between the ligand framework and the substrate. Moreover, the reaction is initiated with a homolytic O&#9472;O bond cleavage in the iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo group that yields a reactive iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species that mediates substrate oxidation. To our knowledge, this work represents the first example of a mononuclear low&#8208;spin (S = &#189;) nonheme iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo complex displaying such unprecedented electrophilic reactivity.

         <title>Regiodivergent Ligand&#8208;Controlled Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydroxymethylation of Alkynes with Aqueous Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent water&#8208;tolerant reductive hydroxymethylation of terminal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has been developed via synergistic visible light organophotoredox and cobalt dual catalysis. The reaction produced valuable linear and branched allylic alcohols with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities and broad substrate scope. Moreover, regioselective reductive hydroxymethylation of internal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has also been achieved by choosing of suitable ligand under otherwise the same reaction conditions.








Abstract
Allylic alcohols are versatile and essential building blocks in synthetic chemistry, widely used for the preparation of complex molecules, pharmaceuticals, and materials. We report here a regiodivergent reductive hydroxymethylation of terminal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde to prepare allylic alcohols enabled by visible light photoredox and cobalt dual catalysis. Using readily available, bulk, and cheap aqueous formaldehyde as a simple C1 source, this method allows for the selective production of both linear and branched allylic alcohols in one&#8208;step manner. The excellent regioselectivity of the reaction is effectively controlled by adjusting the electronic and steric properties of the ligands. Moreover, regioselective reductive hydroxymethylation of internal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has also been achieved by careful selection of ligands. Mechanistic studies reveal a pathway involving ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and formaldehyde, followed by a protonolysis process, offering new insights into the catalyst design and reaction mechanism.

         <title>Sustained, Reversible, and Adaptive Non&#8208;Equilibrium Steady States of a Dissipative DNA&#8208;Based System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous supply of an RNA chemical fuel allows sustained non&#8208;equilibrium steady states (NESS) of a dissipative DNA strand&#8208;displacement reaction to be achieved. The system can dynamically adapt in real&#8208;time to subtle on&#8208;the&#8208;fly variations of fuel supply, demonstrating remarkable control over a dissipative process, which is unachievable when using batch&#8208;wise fuel additions. We confirmed the non&#8208;equilibrium composition of the system at the NESS.








Abstract
Inspired by nature, researchers have developed several chemical fuel&#8208;driven supramolecular systems aimed at achieving improved kinetic control over their formation and functions. Alongside, DNA&#8208;based systems regulated by energy&#8208;dissipating mechanisms have been reported. However, the majority of these systems rely on batchwise additions of chemical fuels to closed reactors, resulting in transient non&#8208;equilibrium states that differ fundamentally from the sustained and highly adaptable non&#8208;equilibrium steady states (NESS) maintained by living systems through continuous energy dissipation. Here, we demonstrate sustained NESS of a dissipative DNA strand&#8208;displacement reaction achieved through the continuous supply of an RNA fuel to an open semi&#8208;batch reactor, using a custom automated setup that enables tunable fuel infusion rates and in situ analysis. Similar to biological NESS, our system dynamically adapts in real&#8208;time to subtle variations in fuel supply, achieving different steady&#8208;state levels of the strand&#8208;displacement reaction. Our approach demonstrates remarkable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly control over a dissipative DNA nanosystem, unachievable when working under batch conditions. Importantly, by fitting the experimental data to a kinetic model of the reaction network, we were able to confirm that the observed steady states correspond to true non&#8208;equilibrium compositions of the system.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Metal Interaction in Cu&#8208;In Single Atom Alloy Switching Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;In single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, Cu99In1 and Cu1In99, were constructed by reversing the host and guest metals, resulting in a switch in the CO2 electroreduction reaction pathway from favoring CO to HCOOH. In both SAA catalysts, Cu serves as the active site, with its adsorption energy modulated by surrounding Indium atoms, enabling high selectivity for a single product.








Abstract
The catalytic behavior of alloy electrocatalyst is strongly influenced by host&#8211;guest metal interaction, which governs adsorption energy and product selectivity. However, in conventional bimetallic alloy systems, the catalyst composition and the geometric configuration often obscure the identification of critical active sites. Here, we investigate the host&#8211;guest metal interaction in Cu&#8211;In single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, demonstrating a remarkable switching of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) pathway. Doping 1% Indium into a Cu matrix forms isolated In&#8208;Cu interfaces, enabling efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90%. Conversely, doping 1% Cu into an Indium matrix leads to the formation of a CuIn alloy phase, shifting the product selectivity to HCOOH with a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90%. In situ spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that Cu serves as the active site on both Cu&#8211;In SAA catalysts. The adsorption energy of host Cu atoms is affected by doped Indium at the In&#8208;Cu interface, which promotes CO2 adsorption and activation while weakening the binding strength of linearly bonded *CO, thereby enhancing CO selectivity. Conversely, the rigid matrix of the CuIn alloy stabilizes the bridge&#8208;bonded *CO, favoring the production of HCOOH.

         <title>A Universal Voltage&#8208;Enhancement Strategy Based on Multifunctional Ligand&#8208;Mediated Modulation for Na&#8208;Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak&#8208;field ligands reduce Mn octahedral splitting energy, inducing a downshift of the eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ antibonding orbital. This shifts the valence band maximum away from the vacuum level, thereby elevating the Mn3&#8314;/Mn&#8308;&#8314; redox potential with an average voltage increase of 0.24&#160;V.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as promising energy storage solutions due to resource abundance and low cost, yet their practical deployment is hindered by limited operating voltages of cathode materials. Herein, we propose a universal ligand&#8208;field engineering strategy to enhance voltage through electronic structure modulation in transition metal oxides. Using the Na0.67Mg0.2Mn0.8O2 as a model system, weak&#8208;field ligands are introduced to alter the coordination environment of MnO6 octahedra. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the weak&#8208;field ligands reduce Mn octahedral splitting energy, inducing a downshift of the eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ orbital. This shifts the valence band maximum away from the vacuum level, thereby elevating the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox potential with an average voltage increase of 0.24&#160;V. Concurrently, the lowered initial Mn oxidation state induces an increased discharge capacity by 35.7% (153.2&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), while suppressing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions and Mn3+ disproportionation yielding 94.4% capacity retention after 200 cycles (versus 69.9% in pristine sample). This ligand&#8208;engineering strategy in regulating redox voltage can be extended to other systems with eg&#8727;$e_g^*$&#8208;involved redox systems (such as Ni&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, and Mn&#8208;based cathodes). Our work establishes a direct correlation between eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ orbital energy modulation and operating voltage, providing foundational insights for designing Na&#8208;layered oxide cathodes with high operating voltage.

         <title>A New Phase Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) Activated Selective CO2 Reduction into Formate for Underwater Antifouling Glass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D new&#8208;phase transparent conducting oxide: trigonal phase indium tin oxide (m&#8208;ITOs) was reported to achieve formate selectivity up to 93&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% and remained stable for more than 30&#160;h, exhibiting excellent antifouling behavior toward a new application in underwater antifouling windows. 








Abstract
Designing unique electrocatalysts that utilizes carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) for real applications is highly appreciated, yet still suffers from low selectivity, stability, and compatibility. Herein, we first report a new two&#8208;dimensional metastable&#8208;phase transparent conducting oxide: 1T phase indium tin oxide (m&#8208;ITOs) with the space group of P&#8722;3m1 (164), which is totally different from that of the stable cubic phase ITO (Ia&#8722;3 (206)). The internal indium tin catalytic pairs in m&#8208;ITOs trigger the strong electronic coupling, move up the p&#8208;band center, and stabilize the adsorption of HCOO* for increased formate production. In a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, m&#8208;ITOs exhibit a high CO2RR electrocatalytic performance with the formate selectivity up to 93&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% (83&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1% for c&#8208;SnInOx and 74&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6% for In2O3/SnO2) and remains 97% (58% for c&#8208;SnInOx and 60% for In2O3/SnO2) of catalytic activity after a 120,000&#160;s stability test. Owing to the efficient formate formation with directly using the absorbed CO2 in water and high transparent property, m&#8208;ITOs exhibit excellent antifouling behavior of inhibiting Chlorella growth without reducing the transparency of itself, encouraging a promising application of observation windows in water.

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Assay System to Quantify O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) Activity in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genetically encoded, imaging&#8208;based reporter enables direct measurement of O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) activity in living cells. The system exploits OGT&#8208;dependent proteolysis of HCF&#8208;1 to drive nuclear and cytoplasmic redistribution of fluorescent signals, allowing cell&#8208;by&#8208;cell spatially resolved quantification of OGT activity. This OGT&#8208;CAR platform offers a powerful tool for studying OGT regulation and discovering cellular modulators.








Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes O&#8208;GlcNAcylation of many nucleocytoplasmic proteins and plays important roles in regulating diverse cellular functions. Dysregulation of OGT is implicated in various diseases, including cancers and neurodegeneration. Despite its vital roles, little is known about how this enzyme is regulated within cells in part because no current assays directly report on its activity within cells. Here we describe a genetically encoded reporter of cellular OGT glycosyltransferase activity by exploiting the transferase&#8208;dependent proteolytic activity of OGT on host cell factor&#8208;1 (HCF&#8208;1). The reporter comprises sites at which OGT cleaves HCF&#8208;1, which are flanked by two different fluorescent proteins that are linked to either nuclear export or import sequences. OGT&#8208;catalyzed cleavage of this construct leads to separation and independent localization of these two fluorescent proteins. By quantifying their nuclear and cytoplasmic distributions, OGT activity can be measured. We validated this OGT cellular activity reporter (CAR) system using known modulators of the O&#8208;GlcNAc pathway and assessed the effects of several metabolites on OGT activity. Analyses of the dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent effects of these OGT modulators illustrate the sensitivity and precision of this OGT&#8208;CAR strategy. We envision this OGT&#8208;CAR system will aid in discovering and characterizing modifiers of OGT activity.

         <title>Enhancement of Emission Efficiency and Color Tuning by Mixing Platinum(II) and Palladium(II) Complexes in a One&#8208;dimensional Chain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mixing isomorphous Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes, which have very low emission efficiencies at room temperature, in pure crystals, a series of mixed crystals with high emission efficiencies and luminescent colors depending on the mixing ratio were successfully constructed. The characteristic luminescence of the mixed crystals originates from excited oligomers with different Pt/Pd ratios.








Abstract
A series of mixed metal crystals comprising square&#8208;planar platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes, K[M(CN)2(dFppy)]&#183;H2O (M&#160;=&#160;Pt2+, Pd2+; dFppy&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)pyridinate), were prepared, and their unique luminescence properties&#8212;emerging upon mixing&#8212;were revealed. Seven mixed crystals with Pt/Pd ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:4.5, 1:10, and 1:13 adopt the same crystal structure (P21/c) as the pure metal complexes, in which the metal complexes are stacked with short M&#8943;M contacts (3.35&#8211;3.37&#160;&#197; at 293&#160;K). Reflecting the M&#8943;M interactions, the mixed crystals exhibited luminescence attributable to the emission from the triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) state. The emission color varied with the Pt/Pd mixing ratio, and notably, a significant enhancement in emission quantum yield was observed (e.g., &#934;&#160;=&#160;0.64 for the Pt/Pd&#160;=&#160;1:2 crystal at room temperature). The emission efficiency further improved at temperatures above room temperature. These unprecedented emission properties are explained by energy transfer among multiple emission sites within the one&#8208;dimensional chain, involving excited oligomers containing various combinations of Pt and Pd complexes. Thus, metal mixing offers a new strategy for enhancing emission efficiency and enabling color tuning.

Seven mixed crystals with Pt/Pd ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:4.5, 1:10, and 1:13 adopt the same crystal structure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;) as the pure metal complexes, in which the metal complexes are stacked with short M&#8943;M contacts (3.35&#8211;3.37&#160;&#197; at 293&#160;K). Reflecting the M&#8943;M interactions, the mixed crystals exhibited luminescence attributable to the emission from the triplet metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MMLCT) state. The emission color varied with the Pt/Pd mixing ratio, and notably, a significant enhancement in emission quantum yield was observed (&lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.64 for the Pt/Pd&#160;=&#160;1:2 crystal at room temperature). The emission efficiency further improved at temperatures above room temperature. These unprecedented emission properties are explained by energy transfer among multiple emission sites within the one-dimensional chain, involving excited oligomers containing various combinations of Pt and Pd complexes. Thus, metal mixing offers a new strategy for enhancing emission efficiency and enabling color tuning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically Recyclable and Tunable Polyolefin&#8208;Like Multiblock Copolymer Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report chemically recyclable PE&#8208;like multiblock copolymer adhesives with tunable cohesion and adhesion. By controlling crystallinity, ester content, and block structure, these materials achieve up to &#8764;80% stronger adhesion than EVA, while enabling depolymerization, reuse, and multilayer deconstruction&#8212;offering a sustainable and high&#8208;performance HMA platform.








Abstract
Adhesives are important in creating multilayer products, such as in packaging and construction. Most current hot&#8208;melt adhesives such as poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;vinyl acetate) (EVA) and polyurethanes lack chemical recyclability and do not easily de&#8208;bond, complicating recycling. Here, we achieved tunable adhesive properties of chemically recyclable polyolefin&#8208;like multiblock copolymers through regulating the incorporation of crystalline hard blocks, amorphous soft blocks, and ester content highlighted by adhesive strengths up to 6.80&#160;MPa. We further demonstrated applications of these adhesives in multi&#8208;layer films and showed that the adhesives can be readily de&#8208;bonded, recovered, and chemically recycled. Overall, this study into structure&#8211;property relationships, including effects of crystallinity, soft&#8208;block incorporation, and ester content of the multiblock copolymers on adhesive properties, has resulted in a modular hot&#8208;melt adhesive platform that exhibits chemical recyclability for virgin&#8208;quality adhesive re&#8208;generation, reprocessability for repeated reuse of the recovered adhesive, and tunability for designing adhesives with a wide range of low to high (up to &#8764;80% stronger than EVA) adhesion strengths.

         <title>Fluorine Modified Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Enables Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries by Suppression of Polyiodide Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexapod&#8208;shaped fluorine&#8208;modified zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) particles are synthesized as a functional layer on the glass fiber separator to suppress polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. The fluorine&#8208;containing groups in the ZIF particles, served as an electron acceptor, can effectively absorb the shuttling I3&#8722; species, enabling the stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries have emerged as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, owing to their inherent safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high specific capacity. However, their commercial implementation is severely hindered by the irreversible capacity degradation and limited cycle life, which are caused by the unavoidable iodine shuttle effect resulting from the formation of soluble I3&#8722; species. Herein, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional hexapod&#8208;like fluorine&#8208;containing zeolitic imidazolate framework (H&#8208;F&#8208;ZIF) nanoparticles for separator modification to effectively inhibit the iodine shuttle effect. The modified layer can interact with the I3&#8722; species at the cathode&#8211;separator interface where the iodine shuttle occurs. Furthermore, the fluorine&#8208;containing functional group (&#9472;CF3) serves as an electron acceptor, enhancing the electrostatic interaction with I3&#8722; species, and thereby improving the polyiodide capture capacity. As a result, the Zn&#8211;I2 battery using H&#8208;F&#8208;ZIF modified separator exhibits excellent cycling durability and high capacity, retaining a capacity of 155.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 12&#160;000 cycles at 1.2&#160;A g&#8722;1, and a coulombic efficiency of 86.4% after 48&#160;h of resting.

         <title>Engineering Covalent and Noncovalent Interface Synergy in MXenes for Ultralong&#8208;life and Efficient Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the ANF&#8208;mediated thermal reconstruction, we achieved the deep modification of MXene with synergistic noncovalent/covalent interaction toward an optimal reaction interface, which breaks the trade&#8208;off between the reactivity and stability for energetic pseudocapacitive storage chemistry. The unique synergistic interface effects trigger a high specific capacitance of 531.9 F g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 92.2% after 180, 000 cycles.








Abstract
MXenes serve as pivotal candidates for pseudocapacitive energy storage owing to sound proton/electron&#8208;transport capability and tunable topology. However, the metastable surface terminal properties and the progressive oxidation leads to drastic capacity fading, posing significant challenges for sustainable energy applications. Here, with the aramid nanofiber as the interface mediator, we engineer the thermal reconstruction of MXenes to synergistically introduce interfacial covalent and noncovalent interactions, resulting in a high specific capacitance of 531.9 F g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 92.2% after 180,&#160;000 cycles. In&#8208;situ heating transmission electron microscopy observations demonstrate the formation of ultrafine mesopores with interfacial reconstitution for mass transport intensification. Theoretical calculations indicate electronic accumulation adjacent to the covalent bonds, endowing the heterogeneous interface with fast electronic conduction capability and favorable adsorption of H+. In addition, the dual modification improves the oxidation energy barrier of MXenes to TiO2, resulting in a thermodynamically promoted and sustainable storage microenvironment. Our research emphasizes the synergistic mechanism of noncovalent interactions and covalent bonding toward an optimal reaction interface, which breaks the trade&#8208;off of MXenes between the reactivity and stability for energetic energy storage.

         <title>CO2 Versus CH4 Aggregation on Trifluorobenzene: Molecular Level Characterization via Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
What makes aromatic ligands selective for CO2 over CH4? Broadband rotational spectroscopy reveals how 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene forms stronger F&#8943;C tetrel and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with CO2, versus weaker CH&#8943;F hydrogen bonds with CH4, along with intriguing tunneling motions. These molecular&#8208;level insights could benefit the design of ligands for selective gas adsorption in MOFs and related materials.








Abstract
The cluster growth behavior of CO2 and CH4 on an aromatic ligand has been studied through the unambiguous identification of complex structures of 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene&#8208;(CO2)1&#8211;4 and &#8208;&#223;(CH4)1&#8211;2 using broadband rotational spectroscopy in conjunction with extensive theoretical calculations. The results reveal a contrast in the thermodynamically favorable ligand&#8208;gas binding sites and noncovalent interactions of the two gaseous molecules on the ligand. The observation of a tunneling splitting and large centrifugal distortions indicates that CH4 molecules bind to the fluorinated &#960; system via three weak hydrogen bonds without CH4 self&#8208;interactions, resulting in an effective structure displaced toward the dissociation limit. Conversely, CO2 shows diverse and stronger intermolecular interactions with the fluorinated benzene, including F&#9472;C tetrel bonding, lone pair to &#960;&#8208;hole interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and a significant contribution from CO2 self&#8208;interactions. The thorough examination of ligand&#8211;gas interactions and aggregation patterns highlights the significant capacity and selectivity of the fluorinated aromatic ligand for accepting CO2 over CH4.

The observation of a tunneling splitting and large centrifugal distortions indicates that CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules bind to the fluorinated &#960; system via three weak hydrogen bonds without CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; self-interactions, resulting in an effective structure displaced toward the dissociation limit. Conversely, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows diverse and stronger intermolecular interactions with the fluorinated benzene, including F&#9472;C tetrel bonding, lone pair to &#960;-hole interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and a significant contribution from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; self-interactions. The thorough examination of ligand&#8211;gas interactions and aggregation patterns highlights the significant capacity and selectivity of the fluorinated aromatic ligand for accepting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization of Ternary Transition Metal Toward High&#8208;Performance Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the Ru 4d and the C&#8801;N 2p induces &#960;&#8208;backdonation and further modulates the d&#8208;electron structure of V/Fe, enabling the cooperative V3+/V4+, Ru(2x&#8208;&#948;)+/Ru2x+, and Fe2+/Fe3+ multi&#8208;redox reactions.








Abstract
Electrochemical proton storage offers grid&#8208;scale energy storage system with long lifespan, great safety, and eco&#8208;friendliness. However, preparing proton storage materials with balanced conductivity, activity, and stability remains challenging due to suboptimal structure design. Herein, we report atomic&#8208;level engineering of d&#8208;p orbital hybridization strategy to regulate transition metal (V/Fe) d&#8208;band centers. Vanadium hexacyanoferrate (VHCF)/RuOx quantum dots (RuOxQDs) heterostructure (VHCF&#8211;RuOxQDs) was synthesized via in situ co&#8208;precipitation. The d&#8208;p hybridization of Ru's 4d orbital with VHCF's C&#8801;N 2p orbital (cyano) induces &#960;&#8208;backdonation and creates &#8220;electronic highways&#8221; for regulating the d&#8208;electrons of V/Fe, shifting their d&#8208;band centers to achieve continuous multi&#8208;electron transfer. Moreover, optimizing the d&#8208;electron structure reduces the V5+ ratio and thus decreases vanadium dissolution during cycling. The VHCF&#8211;RuOxQDs cathode delivers a large capacity of 162&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, excellent rate capability (127&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 40&#160;A g&#8722;1), and ultralong stability over 10&#160;000 cycles. When paired with MoO3&#8211;MXene anode, the asymmetric full device achieves a high energy density of 53&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1.3&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. The atomic&#8208;level orbital hybridization regulation of d&#8208;electron structure provides a new direction for high&#8208;performance proton storage.

         <title>Optoregulated mRNA Delivery Controls Pleiotropic Immune Signaling for Tumor&#8208;Targeted Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

A light&#8208;induced transfection system (LITS) was designed to precisely control the delivery of mRNA, achieving spatiotemporal de&#8208;coupling of the pleotropic inflammatory and tolerogenic signals of interleukin&#8208;2 to conduct safe eradication of tumors.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of protein expression remains a critical challenge in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics, particularly for tumor&#8208;targeted therapy. Here, we introduce a Light&#8208;Induced Transfection System (LITS) leveraging photosensitizing polymers to deliver mRNA systemically and activate its translation via light&#8208;triggered endosomal escape. This system enables localized protein expression in any irradiated tissue, allowing for spatial control of therapeutic effects. Using interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) as a model, we demonstrate that LITS can trigger proinflammatory cytokine levels in irradiated tumors, while inducing tolerogenic IL&#8208;2 levels in nonirradiated healthy tissues. This modulation of IL&#8208;2&#8242;s pleiotropic effects provides both potent antitumor activity and reduced toxicity. Furthermore, by optimizing light exposure, LITS synergizes IL&#8208;2 efficacy by driving immunogenic cell death to eradicate lung metastasis in a breast cancer model. Our findings establish LITS as a programmable mRNA delivery platform for on&#8208;demand targeted and safe therapies.

         <title>Discrete Actuation of Water&#8208;Responsive Crystalline Metal&#8211;Peptide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design metal&#8211;peptide frameworks that exhibit either continuous or discrete threshold water&#8208;responsive actuation by tuning water&#8208;binding affinities and structural dynamics. In the continuous actuation mode, water molecules evaporate sequentially due to varying interaction strengths and structural roles. Conversely, when water molecules display comparable interactions and roles, they release simultaneously during dehydration, producing discrete threshold actuation.








Abstract
Engineering guest&#8208;responsive materials capable of controlled and precise sorption behavior and structural deformation in response to external stimuli is imperative for various applications. However, existing systems often exhibit complex, unpredictable dynamics, posing challenges for efficient control and utilization. Here, we design crystalline metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with tunable water&#8208;responsive (WR) dynamics by assembling glycine&#8208;threonine (Gly&#8208;Thr, GT) or glycine&#8208;serine (Gly&#8208;Ser, GS) peptides with zinc (Zn) ions, achieving either continuous or discrete threshold water&#8208;sorption&#8208;dependent phase transitions. As ambient relative humidity (RH) changes, the Zn&#8208;GT crystal continuously adsorbs or desorbs water, resulting in gradual structural adaptations, similar to those observed in other supramolecular systems. In contrast, the Zn&#8208;GS crystal undergoes stepwise water sorption and structural transitions at specific RH thresholds. These contrasting WR modes arise from differences in water binding and structural dynamics; in Zn&#8208;GT, each coordinating water molecule contributes varying degrees of framework integrity and evaporates sequentially, whereas in Zn&#8208;GS, water molecules with comparable interactions within a flexible framework are released simultaneously during dehydration. Our study demonstrates the mechanism by which host&#8211;guest interactions can be harnessed to control dynamic sorption and actuation behavior of supramolecular materials at the molecular level, offering mechanistic insights that may guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation programmable, stimulus&#8208;responsive systems.

         <title>Orthogonal Control of Lattice Oxygen Activation and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Suppression via &#8220;Molecular Gates&#8221; for High&#8208;Efficiency Nitrile Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the principle of biological compartmentalization, Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), a dual&#8208;group molecule with phosphine oxide and alkylamine groups, is introduced as &#8220;molecular gates&#8221; to achieve orthogonal control over lattice oxygen activation and oxygen evolution reaction suppression, and the high&#8208;current nitrile electrosynthesis with unprecedented efficiency and stability is demonstrated.








Abstract
A fundamental barrier to industrial electrosynthesis is the inescapable trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity at high current densities, where parasitic reactions overwhelm the desired interfacial chemistry. Here, we introduce a bioinspired interfacial decoupling strategy using hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) to resolve this challenge for nitrile electrosysthesis. The activation of lattice oxygen for substrate dehydrogenation via metal&#8208;ligand charge redistribution, and the suppression of OH&#8722;&#8208;driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via electrostatic shielding by hydrophobic alkyl chains are concurrently controlled. As a result, we achieved simultaneously high activity (1.37&#160;V @300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), near&#8208;unity selectivity (93.3% Faradaic efficiency (FE)), and pharmaceutical&#8208;grade purity for propionitrile production. Further reinforced by exceptional stability (&gt;300&#160;h at industrially relevant current densities), a record production rate (143.86&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1), and &#8764;30% energy reduction, the system significantly outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks. Furthermore, this electrolyte&#8208;catalyst co&#8208;optimization strategy proves universal across primary/secondary amines, offering a blueprint for sustainable chemical manufacturing beyond fossil&#8208;fueled processes.

The activation of lattice oxygen for substrate dehydrogenation via metal-ligand charge redistribution, and the suppression of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via electrostatic shielding by hydrophobic alkyl chains are concurrently controlled. As a result, we achieved simultaneously high activity (1.37&#160;V @300&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), near-unity selectivity (93.3% Faradaic efficiency (FE)), and pharmaceutical-grade purity for propionitrile production. Further reinforced by exceptional stability (&amp;gt;300&#160;h at industrially relevant current densities), a record production rate (143.86&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and &#8764;30% energy reduction, the system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, this electrolyte-catalyst co-optimization strategy proves universal across primary/secondary amines, offering a blueprint for sustainable chemical manufacturing beyond fossil-fueled processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Transient Phenolate Enables Relaxation of Z&#8208;Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene to the Stable State in Seconds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of a tetrafluoroazobenzene subunit in a spiropyran hybrid is controlled by the rate of merocyanine formation. Rate accelerations of 102&#8211;106 were observed for changes in solvent polarity, UV light irradiation and passage through silica. Rapid azobenzene isomerization occurs via a transient phenolate formed upon spiropyran ring&#8208;opening.








Abstract
Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzenes (TFAs) exhibit several unique properties, including a large separation in the n&#8594;&#960;* absorption bands, which allows for efficient photoisomerization using green light, and exceptional thermal stability of their metastable Z&#8208;isomer. These features make them attractive for light&#8208;responsive applications, but controlling the thermal Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization has remained a challenge. In this work, we present a hybrid molecular system that couples a TFA subunit with a spiropyran photoswitch. The TFA subunit retains its ability to undergo selective photoisomerization with green light. Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization in the hybrid occurs approximately 1000 times faster than in a TFA model compound. This acceleration arises from a rate&#8208;determining step involving the formation of merocyanine&#8212;the ring&#8208;opened form of spiropyran. The transient phenolate form of merocyanine promotes rapid Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of the TFA, consistent with the known behavior of azobenzene phenolates. The thermodynamics of TFA isomerization are coupled with those of the spiropyran ring&#8208;opening, allowing the isomerization process to be regulated by external stimuli that influence the spiropyran&#8211;merocyanine equilibrium. In addition to observing a 100&#8211;1000&#8208;fold solvent&#8208;dependent rate increase, we demonstrate a 106&#8208;fold acceleration in TFA isomerization via either photochromism or adsorptiochromism.

         <title>Origin and Suppression of Intragranular Cracks for Long&#8208;Cycling High&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;Free Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiphase boundaries (APBs) are found to be widely distributed in high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free (NM) cathodes, and the relation between APBs gain boundaries and intragranular cracks has been established for the first time. Additionally, a charge self&#8208;balancing doping strategy is proposed to reduce the formation of APBs and optimize the generation/distribution of internal stresses, thereby suppressing intragranular cracks. 








Abstract
Intragranular cracks have been identified as a direct reflection of failure in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes, especially for high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes with severe electrochemical&#8211;mechanical degradation. Here we show that antiphase boundaries (APBs) are prone to form in high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes and demonstrate their crucial role in determining the formation of intragranular cracks. The results show that the APBs grain boundaries are continuously expand during the electrochemical process, and their presence promotes the formation and accumulation of heterogeneous internal stresses within the layered structure, which in turn facilitates the nucleation and expansion of intragranular cracks. We further show that an elaborate charge self&#8208;balancing doping strategy can inhibit APBs, which not only maintains the electronic equilibrium of the oxygen framework, but also the synergistic effect of double&#8208;site modification can exhibit a &#8220;lattice&#8208;locking&#8221; effect, leading to an ordered layered structure. The present work suppresses intragranular cracks by eliminating APBs grain boundaries, and this understanding provides insights for developing long&#8208;cycling high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes.

         <title>Selectively Modulating the Donor and Acceptor Aggregation Behaviors Through Solid Additive Isomerization Engineering for Organic Solar Cells Exceeding 20% Efficiency</title>

Herein, a series of bithiophene isomers solid additives (2,2&#8208;TT, 2,3&#8208;TT, and 3,3&#8208;TT) are designed for film morphology regulation in organic solar cells. Systematic analysis demonstrates that the isomerization of solid additives can selectively modulate the aggregation behavior of donor and acceptor materials. Consequently, the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices treated with 3,3&#8208;TT deliver a remarkable efficiency of 20.32%, with an excellent fill factor of 82.47%, which ranks among the best values reported so far.








Abstract
Regulating the film morphology is essential for achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Given the distinct features of donor and acceptor materials, designing solid additives to selectively control the aggregation behaviors of them represents a key strategy for further development of OSCs. Herein, a series of bithiophene isomers solid additives (2,2&#8208;TT, 2,3&#8208;TT, and 3,3&#8208;TT) are designed for film morphology regulation. Systematic analysis reveals that the addition of 2,2&#8208;TT significantly enhances the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of L8&#8208;BO, yet exerts a relatively limited effect on PM6 aggregation. Conversely, the incorporation of 3,3&#8208;TT not only facilitates the formation of compact and highly ordered molecular packing of L8&#8208;BO but also substantially promote the denser &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of PM6. Consequently, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs with 3,3&#8208;TT treatment achieve a higher efficiency of 19.34%, benefitting from the balanced charge mobility and longer carrier lifetime. More impressively, the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices treated with 3,3&#8208;TT deliver a remarkable efficiency of 20.32%, with an excellent fill factor of 82.47%, which ranks among the best values reported so far. This work highlights the critical role of the solid additive isomerization strategy in selectively regulating the aggregation characteristics of donor and acceptor materials, thereby facilitating the further advancement of OSCs field.

         <title>In Situ Exfoliation of Covalent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Three silver cyclic trinuclear units (Ag&#8208;CTUs)&#8208;based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs) are prepared and they can serve as efficient photocatalysts for synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen. Notably, as the reaction proceeded, in situ exfoliation of these CMOFs into ultrathin nanosheets remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic performance for H2O2 production.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets exhibit largely enhanced photocatalytic activities for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Conventionally, the nanosheets are fabricated through ex situ approaches (i.e., top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up) prior to catalytic applications. However, the preparation of 2D MOF nanosheets via in situ exfoliation remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of three 2D silver cyclic trinuclear unit (Ag&#8208;CTU)&#8208;based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs). Owing to their excellent light adsorption ability and suitable bandgap, these CMOFs can serve as efficient photocatalysts for synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen. Notably, the H2O2 production rates of these CMOFs were increased continuously during the photocatalytic processes, reaching 0.50, 1.40, 2.88, and 3.60&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 after 6, 18, 36, and 72&#160;h, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal that in situ exfoliation of these CMOFs into ultrathin nanosheets (&#8764;0.87&#160;nm) significantly enhances their photocatalytic activity. Moreover, these CMOFs achieve a remarkable H2O2 accumulation of 609&#160;mM over 72 h, to best of our knowledge, which surpasses the most previously reported values.

Herein, we report the synthesis of three 2D silver cyclic trinuclear unit (Ag-CTU)-based covalent metal-organic frameworks (CMOFs). Owing to their excellent light adsorption ability and suitable bandgap, these CMOFs can serve as efficient photocatalysts for synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from water and oxygen. Notably, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates of these CMOFs were increased continuously during the photocatalytic processes, reaching 0.50, 1.40, 2.88, and 3.60&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 6, 18, 36, and 72&#160;h, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal that in situ exfoliation of these CMOFs into ultrathin nanosheets (&#8764;0.87&#160;nm) significantly enhances their photocatalytic activity. Moreover, these CMOFs achieve a remarkable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accumulation of 609&#160;mM over 72 h, to best of our knowledge, which surpasses the most previously reported values.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Addition of Aryl Bromides at Palladium(I) to form Palladium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals a detailed mechanistic study of the oxidative addition of aryl bromides to a Pd(I) center to generate an isolable Pd(III) species. UV&#8211;vis and cryo stopped&#8208;flow kinetic studies, including Eyring and Hammett analyses, reveal a rapid oxidative addition step occurring at a Pd(I) center, and a zero&#8208;order dependence on the substrate.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first systematic study of the oxidative addition of aryl bromides to a PdI center to generate organometallic PdIII complexes. These isolable PdIII complexes stabilized by tetradentate macrocyclic pyridinophane ligands exhibit distinct UV&#8211;vis and EPR spectroscopic signatures that allowed for the monitoring of their generation in situ. These ligand scaffolds were sterically and electronically tuned using a modular synthetic approach to probe the kinetic properties and activation parameters of the oxidative addition reaction, and a combination of UV&#8211;vis and cryo stopped&#8208;flow spectroscopic studies reveal a rapid oxidative addition step occurring at a PdI center. In addition, these results are in strong agreement with our recent reactivity studies, which demonstrated that mononuclear PdI systems are competent catalysts in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and thus set the stage for an improved understanding of potential catalytic applications for odd&#8208;electron Pd systems.

         <title>Multifunctional Binding Interface Drives Near&#8208;Unity CO Selectivity in Acidic CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of redox&#8208;active isoindigo molecule on Ag catalyst promotes CO2 electro&#8208;reduction to CO in acid. Collective impacts are revealed by combining theoretical, in situ spectroscopic and catalytic analyses. Lewis acid&#8208;base complexation is the dominant contributor with the assistance of intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond and interfacial water network effects, augmenting stabilization and activation of CO2&#8208;bound intermediates.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is challenged by the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) especially in acidic media. Here, we elaborate that redox&#8208;active isoindigo, acting as a multifunctional co&#8208;catalyst, can pre&#8208;activate CO2&#8208;bound intermediates and suppress HER upon the synergistic effects of Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct formation, intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, and interfacial water structure modulation. Modifying a silver catalyst with isoindigo substantially decreases the energy barrier for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*COOH conversion, which is regarded as the potential&#8208;limiting step of carbon monoxide production. Accordingly, superior catalytic performances are obtained at pH 2, where Faradaic efficiencies surpass 99% at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities. Moreover, we find that assembling an additional polyamine&#8208;coated layer in front of gas flow channels improves CO2 transport to the catalyst layer, optimizing the trade&#8208;off of conversion and selectivity at low flow rates.

         <title>Sustained Release of Underpotential Deposition Initiators for Ah&#8208;Level Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wafer&#8208;scale nickel complex nanofilm sustainably releases nickel ions, precisely controlling zinc deposition to overcome electrolyte&#8208;additive depletion in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. With hydrophobic protection and dynamic underpotential deposition initiation, it delivers 30&#160;000 stable cycles, practical Ah&#8208;level pouch cells (1.5&#160;Ah) with high areal capacity (13.8&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), and efficient photovoltaically re&#8208;charged performance.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives effectively stabilize aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet their depletion during long&#8208;term cycling leads to eventual battery failure. Here, we address this common issue through sustained release of underpotential deposition initiators from an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to achieve the long&#8208;term operation. This SEI, comprising nickel hydroxide and nickel&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazole complexes embedded in a hydrophobic dodecylphosphonic acid (DPA) monolayer via ion&#8208;layer epitaxy, releases Ni2+ ions on&#8208;demand when local pH rises due to corrosion. In this way, the protection through sustained and controlled release of underpotential deposition initiator over long&#8208;term operation is achieved. Concurrently, the hydrophobic DPA layer restricts direct water contact, effectively suppressing side reactions. Consequently, the engineered Ni@DPA&#8208;coated Zn electrode demonstrates remarkable stability, enduring over 37&#160;500 cycles at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8211;I2 full cells retain exceptional cycling performance for over 30&#160;000 cycles at 45&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, achieving an unprecedented energy density of 270&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. An Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (1.5&#160;Ah) delivers a high areal capacity (13.8&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), maintaining 83% capacity after 400 cycles. Demonstrating practical application, a Zn&#8211;I2 pouch cell can be directly charged by an external solar panel with photovoltaic conversion efficiencies up to 10.8%. This approach significantly advances AZIBs toward practical, high&#8208;performance energy storage.

         <title>Dihydroxanthene&#8208;Derived Dioxetane Chemiluminophores for Activatable in Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of dihydroxanthene&#8208;derived dioxetane chemiluminophores (DhX&#8208;CLs) is developed through rational design, structural optimization, and acceptor engineering. DhX&#8208;CLs feature a novel modular core structure, tunable chemiluminescence wavelengths, high quantum yields, long near&#8208;infrared emission, biocompatibility, activatable capability, and in vivo imaging applicability.








Abstract
Chemiluminophores with optimal chemiluminescence properties and versatile structures adaptable into activatable chemiluminescent probes are of particular interest for biosensing and imaging owing to their high sensitivity and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. However, such chemiluminophores are still limited. Herein, we report dihydroxanthene&#8208;derived chemiluminophores (DhX&#8208;CLs) that integrate an adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane moiety with a rationally designed dihydroxanthene&#8208;like core skeleton featuring an extended and restricted &#960;&#8208;electron system. Structural optimization of the dihydroxanthene&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;based prototype chemiluminophore generated a bright yellow chemiluminophore DhX&#8208;CL4 with a quantum yield of 35.4% under aqueous conditions, higher than those of existing dioxetanes in the green&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range beyond 500&#160;nm. Further &#960;&#8208;electron extension and acceptor engineering resulted in NIR chemiluminophores with high brightness and biocompatibility. Notably, DhX&#8208;CL7 exhibits long&#8208;lasting chemiluminescence with a maximum NIR emission at 808&#160;nm and a quantum yield 3.17%, higher than those of most reported NIR chemiluminophores. We further demonstrated that caging of these chemiluminophores with analyte&#8208;responsive moieties afforded activatable chemiluminescent probes for in vivo imaging of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and peroxynitrite. Overall, this new family of chemiluminophores, with tunable emission wavelengths and remarkable chemiluminescence properties, serves as a versatile platform for in vivo chemiluminescence imaging.

         <title>A Water Soluble and Solid&#8208;State Molecular Solar Thermal (MOST) System as Renewable Solar Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;A new series of highly water soluble norbornadienes has been synthesized and characterized as molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems in gram scale. Particularly, concentrated solutions (1&#160;M) and solid&#8208;state heat release showed a thermal heat release of 7.5&#160;and 39.6&#160;K, respectively, with full reversibility in both cases. These systems represent a new avenue for transferring the MOST technology to real and sustainable applications.&#8221;








Abstract
Solar energy storage is key to overcome the intermittent character of sunlight. We present a sustainable solution based on norbornadiene&#8211;quadricyclane pairs for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage working in highly concentrated neutral water solutions and solid state. Photochemical preparation of high&#8208;energy, metastable isomers in previously unattainable 1.64&#160;M solutions was achieved. The best compound can be stored for 1.9 years and is stable in solid state, allowing for the preparation of up to 3&#160;M water solutions. Catalyzed back&#8208;conversion ensures efficient heat release and starting material recovery with remarkable fatigue resistance in water solution and solid state, exhibiting macroscopic heat release in both states, providing a &#916;T of 39.6&#160;K and fully recyclable use. These results highlight a promising avenue for the practical application of MOST technology.

         <title>Competitive Chirality Induction in Two&#8208;dimensional Germanium Iodide Perovskites Enabling Highly Anisotropic Nonlinear Optical Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two sets of chiral germanium iodide perovskites (R/S&#8208;BGI and P/M&#8208;BGI) were synthesized through two distinct chiral introduction mechanisms, providing new ideas for the synthesis of chiral metal halides. R&#8208;BGI and P&#8208;BGI exhibit remarkable chiral nonlinear optical properties with extremely high gSHG&#8208;CD of up to 0.71 and 0.83 and high laser damage thresholds of 697.5 and 535.2 GW&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the values of most previously reported chiral perovskites.








Abstract
Chiral metal halide perovskites (CMHPs) are a promising class of chiroptical materials with significant potential applications in chiral&#8208;optoelectronic and chiral&#8208;spintronic devices. However, their chirality induction generally stems from the incorporation of chiral ligands, which constitutes compositional diversity and functional versatility. Herein, we report a significant chiral expression resulting from two distinct mechanisms: chirality transfer induced by chiral organic cations and mirror symmetry breaking driven by stereochemically active lone pairs, both contributing to controlled chirality induction. Homochiral germanium iodide perovskites, (R/S&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 (R/S is Rectus/Sinister) can be achieved by employing chiral (R/S)&#8208;BrMBA cations to induce chirality via hydrogen bonding. In contrast, two enantiomorphous helical germanium iodide perovskites, P/M&#8208;(rac&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 (P/M is Plus/Minus&#160;and rac is racemic), are formed via the co&#8208;assembly of racemic rac&#8208;BrMBA cations and germanium iodide networks, where chirality arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the stereochemically active 4s2 electron pair. Remarkably, benefiting from the inherent chirality, both (R&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 and P&#8208;(rac&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 crystals exhibit exceptional anisotropic nonlinear optical properties with large anisotropy factors (gSHG&#8208;CD) up to 0.71 and 0.83 and laser damage thresholds of 697.5 and 535.2 GW&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most previously reported CMHPs. This study provides insight into the interplay of chiral organic ligands and inorganic ions in the chiral induction, transfer, and functions of metal halide perovskites.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Para&#8208;Substituent Control of Thermal Half&#8208;Lives in Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we provide an overview of photochromic and photophysical properties of a broad variety of arylazo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trimethylpyrazole photoswitches, including the influence of 23 different para&#8208;substituents. Measured half&#8208;lives correlated in a Hammet plot are rationalized by density functional theory calculations, revealing the underlying thermal isomerization mechanisms. The nature of the substituent controls the Z/E thermal isomerization pathway.








Abstract
Arylazopyrazoles are versatile photoswitches with excellent photochromic properties and tunable thermal half&#8208;lives, yet the mechanistic role of substituents in controlling thermal stability remains poorly understood. Here, we synthesized an extensive library of arylazo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trimethylpyrazole photoswitches and rationalized the influence of para&#8208;substituents on the thermal half&#8208;lives, finding excellent agreement between calculated and measured trends. Calculations show that the electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the substituents modulates the back&#8208;isomerization process through at least two distinct mechanisms. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups enhance delocalization at the azo moiety and thus favor a nonadiabatic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane rotational pathway via the lowest triplet state. In contrast, strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups reduce delocalization and promote a conventional ground state in&#8208;plane inversion mechanism. Intermediate substituents exhibit a gradual shift that combines both major mechanisms. These findings provide prospects for rational design of responsive photoswitches with controllable thermal stability, essential for in vivo applications.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedron&#8208;to&#8208;Coordination Polymer Transition Revealed by 3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we show that 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) is an effective technique to observe structural transformations in porous metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs), as well as for obtaining the structure of the activated phases of these materials. A MOP&#8208;to&#8208;coordination polymer transition is revealed, and explains the reduction in cooperative gas uptake by the material as it is mechanically downsized via ball milling.








Abstract
Porous metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) have strong covalent and coordinate bonds that define the intrinsic pore of the cage. The intermolecular interactions between cages tend to be weaker, such that they rearrange during the solvent exchange process preceding gas sorption measurements. The reduction in crystal size that this often causes limits the availability of structural data that could enable understanding of observed gas uptake. Herein, we use 3D electron diffraction (ED) to resolve this problem, and apply this technique to a MOP&#8208;based material that shows cooperative gas capture. 3D ED structure solution reveals both that the MOPs rearrange to form porous 1D polymers, and that these polymers are retained in the activated phase. Molecular simulations using these data suggest gas uptake is facilitated by rotation of functional groups appended to the backbone of the polymers in conjunction with structural expansion as gas is accommodated. Mechanical downsizing of the material leads to the loss of cooperative gas uptake, but a level of porosity is retained, attributed to the conservation of the 1D polymer structure. This work underscores the potential of 3D ED for probing structural transformations in functional supramolecular materials.

         <title>Convergent Electrochemical&#8211;Chemical Tandem Catalysis Synthesis of Ethylene Oxide from CO2 and Water at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem electrochemical&#8211;chemical system that couples CO2 reduction (CO2R) toward C2H4 and two&#8208;electron water electrooxidation (2e&#8208;WOR) toward H2O2 in a single electrolyzer with ambient epoxidation was reported to produce ethylene oxide (EO) from CO2 and H2O.








Abstract
Ethylene oxide (EO) is an important commodity chemical, and its production currently relies on fossil fuel&#8208;based energy&#8208;intensive thermocatalysis associated with substantial CO2 emissions or the usage of toxic/corrosive precursors (e.g., Cl2). Herein, we report a convergent electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem route for efficient synthesis of EO from CO2 and water under ambient conditions over nonprecious catalysts. Such a protype consists of cathodic CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 and simultaneous anodic two&#8208;electron water electrooxidation (2e&#8208;WOR) to H2O2 in a single electrolyzer, followed by reaction of the two products over titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst toward EO with high production rate of 422.3&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of&#160;&gt;98%. W&#8208;doped CuOx and Cu&#8208;doped SnO2 were used as cathode and anode electrodes with respective Faradaic efficiencies of 63.5% and 75.6% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Systematic characterizations, including 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), isotope&#8208;labeling mass spectrometry (MS), and operando infrared spectroscopy, along with theoretical calculations, reveal that Cu doping breaks the electronic structure symmetry of Sn to induce electron redistribution for optimal adsorption and coupling of key intermediates like *OH in 2e&#8208;WOR. This study offers a sustainable manner for efficient EO synthesis from raw materials with renewable electricity input.

         <title>Dendritic Pillar[6]Arenes with Fixed Planar Chirality for Stereoselective Inclusions in Water: A Case of Facile Differentiation of Cocaine Adulterants, Levamisole and Dexamisole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic pillar[6]arenes encompass a new class of cavitands with planar chirality, unique binding pockets, and great water solubility. These easily accessible hosts permit differentiating racemic dexamisole from levamisole as known cocaine adulterants. Dendritic pillar[6]arenes can now be used for stereoselective recognition, chemosensing, and sequestration of a broad range of chiral drugs. 








Abstract
We describe the preparation, conformational dynamics, and stereoselective recognition characteristics of water&#8208;soluble pillar[6]arenes pS&#8211;212&#8722; and pR&#8211;212&#8722;. These two novel and diastereomeric cavitands comprise a 2,5&#8208;bis(ethoxy)pillar[6]arene core with one of six phenylene ring conjugated to two hexaanionic dendrons. Each dendron includes an (S)&#8722;glutamic acid amidated with two tris&#8208;carboxylic Behera's amines. Cavitands pS&#8211;212&#8722; and pR&#8211;212&#8722; were obtained in six synthetic steps and resolved by column chromatography. The results of 1H NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements are in line with pS/pR&#8211;212&#8722; having unidirectional orientation of alkoxy substituents (i.e., planar chirality) and no observable interconversion for, at least, 2 weeks. Computational studies supported with 1H DOSY NMR measurements revealed that sufficiently bulky dendrons require high activation energy to pass through the pillararene's cylindrical cavity therefore inhibiting rotation of the phenylene holding them. With the unique and chiral binding pocket, pS&#8211;212&#8722; (pR&#8211;212&#8722;) formed inclusion complexes with cocaine adulterants levamisole and dexamisole (Kd&#160;&gt;&#160;mM), with their racemic mixture showing separate 1H NMR spectroscopic resonances. In this way, dendritic pillar[6]arenes can be used as chiral shift reagents for determining enantiopurity of pharmaceuticals but also for examining a variety of chiral recognition processes, sensing of chiral molecules, and stereoselective sequestrations in aqueous media.

         <title>Energy Dissipation Mediated by Multiple Noncovalent Interactions in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks&#8208;Based Hydrogels for Wearable Gesture&#8208;to&#8208;Recognition Translation</title>

         <dc:description>
Soft&#8208;hard multiphase hydrogels have been constructed using hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks and polymerized deep eutectic solvent, the multiple noncovalent interactions facilitate the energy dissipation and ion transport, leading to remarkable strength, toughness and ionic conductivity. They could be used as strain sensors for health monitoring and gesture&#8208;to&#8208;recognition translation.








Abstract
Hydrogels hold great promises in intelligent wearable gesture&#8208;to&#8208;recognition translation devices, but high mechanical robustness usually encounters low sensitivity and poor cycling stability, it is pivotal and challenging to balance energy dissipation and conductivity. Herein, the soft&#8208;hard multiphase hydrogels have been proposed for the first time through noncovalently threading polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Fluorine groups on HOF (HOF&#8208;F) are presented as the hydrogen bond acceptors to form multiple noncovalent interactions between HOF&#8208;F and PDES, which expedites the energy dissipation with synchronous increment of ion transport in hydrogels. The tensile strength, toughness and ionic conductivity are as high as 135.23&#160;kPa, 2.69&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and 4.33&#160;&#177;&#160;0.02 S m&#8722;1, respectively, which greatly outperforms that of H&#8208;substituted counterpart (60.04&#160;kPa, 0.75&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and 3.74&#160;&#177;&#160;0.08 S m&#8722;1) and ranks the top in the reported hydrogels. The resultant hydrogel sensor achieves high sensitivity of 2.2 and remarkable cyclic stability over 1000 cycles, thus accurately monitoring human motion and recognizing the gesture. This work provides a promising approach to develop smart flexible electronics.

         <title>Programmable Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Through Stereocontrol of Chiral Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Co&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral inducers (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;/R&#8208;2) with varying binaphthalene dihedral angles were selected with achiral liquid crystalline polymer PyP to form chiral co&#8208;assemblies. As the dihedral angle of the binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9 could emit inverted and amplified circularly polarized electroluminescence with a |gEL| value up to 0.18 compared with (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9.








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) are essential to prospective 3D displays and advanced polarized lighting systems. The rational design of programmable circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) materials with a large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (gEL) remains a great challenge and is still in its preliminary exploration phase. In this work, two aggregation induced emission active (AIE&#8208;active) chiral inducers with different dihedral angles of binaphthalene (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;/R&#8208;2) and achiral acrylate&#8208;based liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) (PyP) were chosed to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) are essential to prospective 3D displays and advanced polarized lighting systems. The rational design of programmable circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP-EL) materials with a large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;) remains a great challenge and is still in its preliminary exploration phase. In this work, two aggregation induced emission active (AIE-active) chiral inducers with different dihedral angles of binaphthalene (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-2) and achiral acrylate-based liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) (PyP) were chosed to construct chiral co-assemblies through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism. Interestingly, as the dihedral angle of the AIE-active binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co-assemblies (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-2-PyP) could emit inverted and amplified CP-EL signals compared with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-1-PyP after annealing. Significantly, the (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-2)&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;-(PyP)&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;-based CP-OLEDs displayed remarkable blue CP-EL (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Adaptive Hydration Chemistry Enables Fast and Durable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

RHM enables adaptive water capture and release in AZIBs, promoting uniform Zn deposition, fast Zn2&#8314; transport, and stable cycling.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage; however, uncontrolled interfacial water remains a major hurdle, limiting both anode stability and ion transport. In this study, 2&#8208;picolinaldehyde (2PA) was chosen as a reversible hydration modulator (RHM) that enables dynamic regulation of interfacial free water. Spectroscopic and computational analyses revealed that RHM captures excess water during plating to suppress hydrogen evolution and corrosion while releasing water during stripping to facilitate Zn2+ solvation and migration. In addition, RHM coordinates with Zn2+ and reorganizes its local coordination environment. Consequently, symmetric cells with the RHM&#8208;ZnSO4 electrolyte deliver prolonged cycling exceeding 4000&#160;h and excellent rate performance, with low voltage polarization even at a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The corresponding full cells demonstrate durable operation for over 5000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This adaptive behavior satisfies the distinct interfacial water requirements during Zn plating and stripping, enabling interfacial stability and efficient ion transport, and provides a novel strategy for electrolyte design in AZIBs.

         <title>Antiferroelectric SnO2 Network with Amorphous Surface for Electrochemical N2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study report the utilization of antiferroelectric dipole configurations to engineer oriented electric fields to synergistically couple N2 adsorption. Building on this foundation, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous SnO2 network with unsaturated amorphous surface was engineered to maximize N2 adsorption efficiency and active site accessibility. As a result, this design achieves one of the highest performance and efficiency reported to date for aqueous electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen fixation&#8208;a sustainable pathway for converting abundant N2 into NH3 using renewable energy&#8208;holds transformative potential for revolutionizing artificial nitrogen cycles. Nevertheless, even the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic systems also suffer from inadequate N2 adsorption capacity, which critically limits ammonia production rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). To overcome this bottleneck, we strategically leveraged the antiferroelectric properties of SnO2 to establish dipole&#8211;dipole interactions with N2 molecules, synergistically enhancing both N2 adsorption and activation kinetics. Building on this foundation, we construct a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous SnO2 network with unsaturated amorphous surfaces. Both experiment and first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that all the exposed antiferroelectric surfaces could effectively adsorb N2, enhancing the N2 adsorption ability and maximizing active sites accessibility. The optimized catalyst delivers exceptional performance, achieving an NH3 production rate of 57.38&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1mg&#8722;1cat and a FE of 33.26%, representing one of the highest reported values among aqueous&#8208;phase ammonia synthesis catalysts. These breakthroughs not only establish a universal design framework for gas&#8208;involving electrocatalysts but also pioneer an integrated strategy to elevate nitrogen utilization efficiency in next&#8208;generation sustainable energy infrastructures.

         <title>Unlocks Photoluminescence Quantum Efficiency Enhancement in Eu2+&#8208;Doped Phosphors via Bond Angle Variance Index</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design and quantitatively prediction of high&#8208;efficiency Eu2+&#8208;doped phosphors via crystallochemical descriptors are urgently needed. Here, we pioneered a linear equation between PLQY and Bav in apatite&#8208;type La9&#8722;xLuxBi(SiO4)6O3:Eu2+ phosphors and achieves 15.7&#8208;fold PLQY enhancement by controlling bond angle variance (Bav).








Abstract
Rational design of inorganic luminescent materials with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) has long been constrained by the absence of precise structural descriptors. Here, we realizes a giant 15.7&#8208;fold PLQY enhancement in apatite&#8208;type La9&#8722;xLuxBi(SiO4)6O3:Eu2+ phosphors and demonstrates that bond angle variance (Bav, &#948;2) can be used as a universal crystallochemical metric. By decoupling the contributions from structural rigidity, thermal quenching (TQ), and cation disorder, we identify isovalent Lu3+ substitution&#8208;driven Bav engineering, and further establish a predictive Bav&#8208;PLQY linear relationship (R2 &gt; 0.95) via a generalized distortion quantification model for irregular polyhedra (CN&#160;=&#160;7). Local structure characterization and bond valence sum (Bvs) analyses reveal that &#948;2 modulation optimizes the coordination environments for Eu2+ incorporation while enhancing radiative transitions. This work bridges lattice distortion to PLQY via the Bav descriptor, offering a predictive route toward designing inorganic phosphor and advancing material design from trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to database approaches.

         <dc:description>
Using in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy (OM), we directly observed the kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure of the Al&#8208;Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) interface in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Furthermore, a co&#8208;sintering interfacial optimization was applied to decrease the kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure and increase the cycle stability of Li&#8208;anode&#8208;less ASSBs.








Abstract
Alloy anodes with high specific capacity are extensively utilized in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, they are challenged by interfacial kinetic and mechanical issues. Real&#8208;time investigation of interfacial failure mechanisms at the nanoscale is crucial for optimizing the alloy anodes. Utilizing the high spatial resolution and real&#8208;time imaging capabilities of electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM), we discovered that Li1Al1 alloying unevenly, and the delithiated phase Al with its sluggish kinetics hinders the de&#8208;alloying processes. Combining the high mechanical modulus of Li1Al1 and Al leads to electrode fracture. This kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure diminishes the reversibility of the Al anode. To weaken the kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure, we employ a co&#8208;sintering reaction between Al and Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl), introducing Al2S3 and P2S74&#8722;, followed by Al2S3 in situ lithiation to Li9Al4. This process improved interfacial charge transfer and mitigated mechanical failure. Consequently, the Li&#8208;anode&#8208;less ASSBs maintain 90.2% retention rate after 2000&#160;h (420 cycles) and 87.4% retention rate after 3500&#160;h (750 cycles) at an areal capacity of 2.9&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and low N/P ratio of 1.8 with a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.98%. Such tracking of the alloy interfacial reaction provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupled failure and thus benefits the alloy anode optimization.

         <title>Creating Abundant Open Metal Sites in MOFs by Dual&#8208;Coordination Design for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;coordination strategy is developed to create abundant unsaturated metal sites in MOFs while preserving their crystalline framework, enabling precise structure&#8211;property studies and enhanced electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined crystalline structures offer ideal platforms to unravel structure&#8211;property relationships, but their low density of accessible metal sites limits catalytic activation. Efforts to generate open metal sites often compromise structural integrity, obstructing mechanistic investigation. In this study, we convert single&#8208;coordinated MOFs into dual&#8208;coordinated frameworks, enabling controlled creation of unsaturated metal sites to boost electrocatalytic performance while preserving crystal framework for structure&#8211;property study. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we transform Zn&#9472;N single&#8208;coordinated ZIF&#8208;L into Zn&#9472;N/O dual&#8208;coordinated MOFs (B&#8208;MOFs), where strong Zn&#9472;N bonds act as structural pillars and weaker Zn&#9472;O bonds serve as removable linkers. Upon annealing at 500&#160;&#176;C, selective cleavage of Zn&#9472;O bonds produces defective MOFs (dB&#8208;MOFs) with abundant open Zn sites and a well&#8208;retained crystal structure. The dB&#8208;MOF grown on carbon cloth (CC) exhibits high performance in hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), significantly superior to pristine B&#8208;MOF/CC. A combination of material characterizations and theoretical calculation demonstrates that the removal of Zn&#9472;O bond creates abundant electron&#8208;deficient Zn sites, which enhance the adsorption of HzOR intermediates and lower the reaction energy barriers.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Crystalline Zinc&#8211;cAAC Radical</title>

         <dc:description>
Reduction of an amidinate&#8208;stabilized zinc iodide with KC8 in the presence of cAAC affords a crystalline zinc&#8211;cAAC radical. EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculation reveal the radical's properties, and reactivity studies demonstrate its zinc&#8208;centered radical behavior toward diverse substrates. 








Abstract
Reaction of LAmZnI [LAm&#160;=&#160;tBuC(N&#8208;DIPP)2, DIPP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3] with KC8 in the presence of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) affords a stable radical complex [LAmZn(cAAC)]&#8226; (3). Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis of 3 shows a short Zn&#9472;C bond and concomitant elongation of C&#9472;N bond within the cAAC ligand, indicating a significant &#960;&#8208;backbonding from the metal to the cAAC ligand. EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal that the spin density is mainly localized on the carbenic carbon atom, with a small portion on the zinc center. Complex 3 exhibits zinc&#8208;centered radical reactivity as demonstrated by reactions with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy, iodobenzene, trimethylsilyl azide, and [FeCp(CO)2]2, all of which occur at the zinc center and yield the corresponding Zn(II) complexes.

         <title>Amino Nests Boost Pd/SiO2 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Selective Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd single atoms anchored within the amino nest on the SiO2&#8208;NH2 support (Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2) were successfully fabricated and exhibited robust catalytic performance in selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene with an amazing specific activity of 1900.36&#160;mol C2H2&#8722;1 molPd&#8722;1 min&#8722;1. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that amino nests can selectively capture and adsorb trace acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, facilitating the key acetylene adsorption step over the Pd single atoms.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is a critical industrial process for purifying ethylene feedstocks. Palladium single&#8208;atom catalysts (Pd SACs) exhibit exceptional ethylene selectivity in this hydrogenation reaction. However, their isolated active sites show limited ability to capture and adsorb trace acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, resulting in relatively low hydrogenation activity. To overcome this limitation, we designed Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst on the SiO2 surface modified with amino nests (Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2). In this architecture, Pd single atoms are embedded within amino nests on the surface of SiO2&#8208;NH2 support. Combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that amino nests selectively capture and adsorb acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, facilitating the key acetylene adsorption step. The Pd&#9472;N bonds formed between the amino nest and the Pd atom promote hydrogen activation. At 190 &#176;C, the Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2 catalyst achieves complete acetylene conversion with the ethylene selectivity of 92%. Remarkably, it delivers a specific activity of 1900.36&#160;mol C2H2&#8722;1 molPd&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, surpassing all previously reported SACs. This work establishes an amino nest&#8208;assisted design paradigm for single&#8208;atom catalysts, enabling efficient, selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene.

         <title>Mechanistically Engineered Heterojunction From Spent LFP for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;guided upcycling strategy converts spent LFP into a coronal NiO/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/LFP(III) heterostructure, achieving nanoscale surface activation for electrocatalysis. The engineered p&#8211;n interface enables lattice oxygen catalysis, while the PO43&#8722;&#8208;rich matrix ensures Cl&#8722; resistance, delivering high OER performance and a six&#8208;fold cost&#8208;efficiency gain over conventional recycling.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale retirement of LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries demands sustainable strategies for material recovery and functional repurposing. However, the inert micrometer&#8208;scale morphology and electronically stable lattice of spent LFP hinder its direct catalytic reuse. Herein, we present a structure&#8208;guided strategy that upcycles spent LFP into a high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Mild air oxidation transforms LFP into a phosphate&#8208;rich Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (LFP(III)) framework decorated with coronal &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanodots. This reconfiguration preserves the bulk structure while achieving nanoscale surface activation. Subsequent spatially selective growth of NiO on &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 yields a well&#8208;defined p&#8208;NiO/n&#8208;Fe2O3 heterojunction, driving interfacial charge redistribution and promoting formation of catalytically active NiOOH species under operational conditions. In situ Raman and XPS analyses reveal that the heterostructure facilitates lattice oxygen participation via an accelerated lattice oxygen mechanism, while the phosphate&#8208;rich LFP(III) matrix imparts strong electrostatic repulsion toward Cl&#8722;, effectively suppressing halide&#8208;induced corrosion. The resulting LFP(III)/NiO catalyst achieves low overpotentials of 268 and 292&#160;mV at 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, in chloride&#8208;containing electrolytes, along with excellent durability. Techno&#8208;economic analysis indicates a six&#8208;fold improvement in cost&#8208;efficiency over conventional recycling. This work establishes a mechanistically informed and energy&#8208;efficient upcycling strategy that bridges battery waste management with functional catalyst design, advancing both sustainable materials chemistry and water&#8208;splitting technologies.

         <title>Ligand Engineering&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Activity of Octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;Siloxane Clusters for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;PhPz nanoclusters are surgically sculpted into the octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;BiPhPz clusters (OZSBPC) configuration through ligand engineering, where each ligand in OZSBPC is adorned with an appended benzene ring. Benefitting from the electronic and molecular modulation effect of benzene rings, the reinforced electrical conductivity, sulfur loading capacity, and adsorption characteristics are endowed to the OZSBPC, ultimately achieving the optimization of lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic performance.








Abstract
Polynuclear metal clusters (PMC) with atomically defined architectures exhibit unique electrochemical catalytic behaviors in lithium&#8722;sulfur battery (LSB). Nevertheless, the precise fabrication of PMC with tailored configurations, and a comprehensive understanding of their structure&#8208;dependent property evolution, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, ligand engineering is employed to upgrade octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;PhPz clusters by grafting one more benzene ring onto azopyrazole ligand to form octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;BiPhPz clusters (OZSBPC). An integrated investigation combining kinetic analyses, in situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations reveals that the introduction of biphenyl moieties enlarges the intrinsic cavity to host more sulfur species, while the conjugation&#8208;enhanced ligand framework facilitates more efficient electron transfer. Moreover, the enhanced nucleophilicity at nitrogen sites and the upshifted d&#8208;band center synergistically strengthen the affinity toward polysulfides via &#960;&#8722;&#960; conjugation interactions. Consequently, the catalytic efficiency of OZSBPC undergoes a substantial enhancement, thereby enabling the assembled Ah&#8208;class Li&#8722;S pouch cell delivers a peak energy density of 504&#160;Wh&#160;kgtotal&#8722;1, and sustains stable cycling at 429&#160;Wh&#8201;kgtotal&#8722;1 for 40 cycles. Moreover, stable operation over 150 cycles is achieved under &#8722;33&#160;&#176;C. Our study makes a breakthrough in precisely constructing PMC and in optimizing the performance via progressive structure upgrading, which made a landmark impact on lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic chemistry.

         <title>LL&#8208;37 and Its Truncated Fragments Modulate Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Dynamics, Aggregation and Toxicity Through Hetero&#8208;Oligomer and Cluster Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

LL&#8208;37 and its truncates modulate A&#946;40 primary nucleation by forming hetero&#8208;oligomers, nanoclusters, and microclusters, which act as off&#8208;pathway aggregates inhibiting fibrillation. These transient assemblies influence fibril progression and cytotoxicity, highlighting the dynamic interplay between aggregation and toxicity. Integrating nanoscale and microscale perspectives provides mechanistic insight into A&#946;40&#8211;LL&#8208;37 interactions and informs therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
LL&#8208;37 and its variants with amphiphilic structure can modulate amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) fibril formation, but the detailed mechanism behind it is still unclear. By using four different peptides (LL&#8208;37, LL&#8208;379&#8211;32, LL&#8208;3718&#8211;29, LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28), we found these peptides affect A&#946;40 aggregation differently. Nanoscale analysis showed that all LL&#8208;37 peptides form hetero&#8208;oligomers and nanoclusters with A&#946;40, but LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28, which exhibit the strongest inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation, form more hetero&#8208;oligomers and smaller nanoclusters. This suggests that hetero&#8208;oligomers and small nanoclusters may represent an off&#8208;pathway, preventing the formation of productive aggregates. At the microscale, all LL&#8208;37 peptides were found to promote A&#946; cluster formation, but LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28 can form larger clusters with A&#946; rapidly, emphasizing that smaller nanoclusters can assemble to macroscale clusters easier, inducing more toxic aggregates. Both nanoscopic and microscopic mechanisms revealed inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation by all LL&#8208;37 peptides, impacting A&#946; primary and secondary nucleation, while only LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28 affected A&#946; elongation. Our findings highlight the role of LL&#8208;37 and its synthetic fragments in A&#946;40 aggregation across different scales, particularly focusing on cluster formation at the nanoscale and microscale to fill the knowledge gap between oligomerization and fibrillation.

         <title>Harnessing Dual Hydrogen Bonding and Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Interactions for Bio&#8208;Inspired Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Electrolytes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Bio&#8208;inspired symmetry disruption in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries: Isobutyramide simultaneously breaks hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and coordinates Zn2+ ions, tailoring solvation structure and stabilizing Zn anodes. This molecular&#8208;level electrolyte engineering suppresses dendrites, mitigates hydrogen evolution, and enables long&#8208;lasting, high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) offer a safe, cost&#8208;effective alternative for large&#8208;scale energy storage but are hindered by zinc dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), and unstable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. These challenges largely stem from strong dipole interactions between symmetric water molecules and Zn2+, which destabilize the electric double layer (EDL) and trigger parasitic reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological systems that use asymmetric molecular interactions to regulate aqueous environments, we introduce isobutyramide (IAM) as a multifunctional electrolyte additive. IAM features both carbonyl and amide groups, enabling it to act as a dual&#8208;site hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. This disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network in water, reduces water activity, and suppresses HER. Additionally, IAM's lone pairs coordinate strongly with Zn2+, restructuring the solvation sheath and mitigating uncontrolled Zn2+ migration that leads to dendrite formation. This dual&#8208;function, symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy stabilizes the EDL, enhances Zn plating/stripping reversibility, and suppresses interfacial degradation. Electrochemical tests confirm IAM's efficacy: Zn||Cu cells exhibit 99.68% Coulombic efficiency over 1,000 cycles, Zn||Zn symmetric cells remain stable for over 4,250&#160;h, and full&#8208;cell Zn||V2O5 and Zn||I2 systems show significantly enhanced cycling performance.

&lt;p&gt;Bio-inspired symmetry disruption in aqueous Zn-ion batteries: Isobutyramide simultaneously breaks hydrogen-bonding networks and coordinates Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, tailoring solvation structure and stabilizing Zn anodes. This molecular-level electrolyte engineering suppresses dendrites, mitigates hydrogen evolution, and enables long-lasting, high-performance batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) offer a safe, cost-effective alternative for large-scale energy storage but are hindered by zinc dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), and unstable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. These challenges largely stem from strong dipole interactions between symmetric water molecules and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which destabilize the electric double layer (EDL) and trigger parasitic reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological systems that use asymmetric molecular interactions to regulate aqueous environments, we introduce isobutyramide (IAM) as a multifunctional electrolyte additive. IAM features both carbonyl and amide groups, enabling it to act as a dual-site hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. This disrupts the hydrogen-bonding network in water, reduces water activity, and suppresses HER. Additionally, IAM's lone pairs coordinate strongly with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, restructuring the solvation sheath and mitigating uncontrolled Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; migration that leads to dendrite formation. This dual-function, symmetry-breaking strategy stabilizes the EDL, enhances Zn plating/stripping reversibility, and suppresses interfacial degradation. Electrochemical tests confirm IAM's efficacy: Zn||Cu cells exhibit 99.68% Coulombic efficiency over 1,000 cycles, Zn||Zn symmetric cells remain stable for over 4,250&#160;h, and full-cell Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn||I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems show significantly enhanced cycling performance. Zn||I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cells also demonstrate robust long-term operation. This bio-inspired approach offers a scalable path to high-performance, practical aqueous ZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ampere&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of 15N&#8208;Labeled Oximes by Alloy Synergy Activation and Hydroxylamine Overhydrogenation Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
BixMoy alloys are designed to electrocatalytic conversion of 15NO2&#8210; to 15N&#8208;oxime with a 76% Faradaic efficiency and 88% yield at 3.0 A. Mo serves as the H2O activation site, whereas Bi acts as the 15NO2&#8210; activation site. The synergy between Bi and Mo leads to a high 15N&#8208;oxime formation rate. Moreover, Mo introduction increases the hydrogenation energy barrier for 15NH2OH to 15NH3, suppressing 15NH2OH overhydrogenation and therefore improving 15N&#8208;oxime Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
15N&#8208;labeled molecules are essential for industrial drug development and medical imageology. However, the synthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled molecules suffers from the complex procedure of de novo synthesis and harsh conditions. Here, we propose an electrochemical strategy to synthesize 15N&#8208;labeled oximes (15N&#8208;oximes) from 15N&#8208;labeled nitrites (15NO2&#8722;) and aldehydes/ketones. Matching the adsorption and activation of H2O and 15NO2&#8722; and inhibiting 15NH2OH overhydrogenation are the keys to realizing efficient ampere&#8208;level electrosynthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled oximes. A bismuth&#8722;molybdenum (BiMo) alloy catalyst is subsequently designed, in which Bi acts as the 15NO2&#8722; activation site, whereas Mo serves as the H2O activation site. The precisely controlled atomic ratio of Mo and Bi ensures that there is sufficient but not excessive active hydrogen provided for 15NO2&#8722; hydrogenation and therefore accelerates the reaction rate. Moreover, Mo incorporation increases the energy barrier of 15NH2OH overhydrogenation and thus improves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 15N&#8208;oxime. This strategy enables scale&#8208;up electrosynthesis with a 76% FE and 88% yield at a current of 3.0 A to obtain 3.5 g of 15N&#8208;cyclohexanone oxime within 1.5 h. The application potential is highlighted by the methodological universality of diverse 15N&#8208;oximes, the extended synthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled drug molecules and their application in 2D magnetic resonance imaging visualization.

         <title>Hydroalkylation of Unactivated Alkenes with Amides via Photoredox Catalysis and Triple Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with amides are achieved under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity, along with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Its versatility is highlighted by diverse late&#8208;stage modification and synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds via a triple hydrogen atom transfer process involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular steps.








Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated hydroalkylation of alkenes offers a more direct and atom&#8208;economical route to &#945;&#8208;alkylated carbonyl compounds, enabling the construction of various drug scaffolds, natural products, and functional molecules. However, traditional protocols are generally restricted to active 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and often require oxidants, large excesses of substrates, and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we present a photoinduced, general, and practical hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with amides. Both inter&#8208; and intramolecular hydroalkylation reactions are achieved under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. This method demonstrates excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity, along with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. A range of short&#8208;chain gaseous olefins, including ethylene, can also undergo the reaction successfully. Its versatility is further highlighted by diverse late&#8208;stage modification and synthesis of structurally complex bioactive molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds via a triple hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular steps. The success of this chemistry is attributed to the controlled generation of relatively weak electrophilic &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals and the strategic application of radical polarity&#8208;match/mismatch effect to finely tune the reactivity between distinct radical species and unactivated alkenes or the HAT donor.

H&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ comproportionation serves as an effective chemical driven force for achieving the Li2+xNHFx&#8211;LiF solid electrolyte from LiH and NH4F precursor, which enables the stable cycling of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to the accelerated Li&#8208;ion migration in Li2+xNHFx, favorable in situ formed Li4NH/LiF&#8208;enriched interphase at the electrode surface and the enhanced mechanical strengths.








Abstract
Nitride family compounds are among the earliest explored materials for solid electrolytes (SEs). The main challenge lies in effectively enhancing their electrochemical stability without compromising their excellent Li&#8208;ion conductivity and Li metal compatibility. Herein, a H&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ comproportionation reaction between LiH and NH4F is employed to synthesize a Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F complex, consisting of Li2+xNHFx matrix and dispersed LiF nanoparticles. Density functional calculation results show that the incorporated F atoms in Li2NH lattice lead to structural variation and electron density redistribution, providing a more connected Li&#8208;ion network with low migration energy barriers. More importantly, the interfacial side reactions between the Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F complex and electrodes are strongly self&#8208;limited due to the blocking effect of the in situ formed Li4NH/LiF&#8208;enriched interphases. The newly identified interphase Li4NH exhibits fast Li&#8208;ion migration ability and intrinsic stability toward Li, facilitating stable Li plating/stripping. Based on the superiority in Li&#8208;ion conduction and electrode compatibility, the Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F solid electrolyte films prepared via cold pressing with 0.5 wt% binder enable stable cycling of Li||Li, Li||TiS2, and Li||LiCoO2 all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Micellar Brush&#8208;Directed Oxophilic Zr&#8208;Doped RuO2 Nanoarrays for Durable Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

Pyridine&#8208;rich micellar brushes guide the dense accumulation of Ru nanoparticles and Zr&#8308;&#8314; ions through coordination interactions and enable the homogeneous doping of Zr in the resulting RuO2 nanoarray after calcination. The oxophilic Zr stabilizes the lattice oxygen and creates electron&#8208;deficient Ru sites, which facilitate the adsorption of H2O molecules and the subsequent dissociation into *OH, thus enhancing the OER performance.








Abstract
Although being considered as a promising alternative to iridium&#8208;based catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEM&#8208;WE), cost&#8208;effective ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based anodic catalysts generally lack sufficient stability for harsh operating conditions. Here, we developed a facile method to fabricate erect nanoarrays of interweaved nanorods of zirconium&#8208;doped ruthenium oxide (ZrRuO2) for long&#8208;term industrial&#8208;level oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This is accomplished by the spontaneous and abundant accumulation of Ru nanoparticles and Zr4+ ions in pyridine&#8208;rich micellar brushes through coordination interactions, followed by direct calcination in air. The uniform dispersion of Ru and Zr precursors promotes the homogeneous doping of Zr in the resulting RuO2 nanoarray and the formation of Zr&#8208;OBRI&#8208;Ru bridging oxygen structures. The oxophilic Zr strengthens the stability of the lattice oxygen and prevents its participation in OER. Meanwhile, it also leads to electron deficiency of the bridging Ru sites and facilitates the adsorption of H2O molecules and the subsequent dissociation into *OH, thus enhancing the OER stability and activity. Notably, the nanoarray architecture synergistically restricts the voltage loss caused by electron and mass transport. Consequently, the ZrRuO2&#8208;nanoarrays enabled a remarkably low PEM&#8208;WE potential of 1.64&#160;V at 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 with a negligible degradation rate (26 &#181;V h&#8722;1, over 1000&#160;h).

&lt;p&gt;Although being considered as a promising alternative to iridium-based catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEM-WE), cost-effective ruthenium (Ru)-based anodic catalysts generally lack sufficient stability for harsh operating conditions. Here, we developed a facile method to fabricate erect nanoarrays of interweaved nanorods of zirconium-doped ruthenium oxide (ZrRuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for long-term industrial-level oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This is accomplished by the spontaneous and abundant accumulation of Ru nanoparticles and Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in pyridine-rich micellar brushes through coordination interactions, followed by direct calcination in air. The uniform dispersion of Ru and Zr precursors promotes the homogeneous doping of Zr in the resulting RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoarray and the formation of Zr-O&lt;sub&gt;BRI&lt;/sub&gt;-Ru bridging oxygen structures. The oxophilic Zr strengthens the stability of the lattice oxygen and prevents its participation in OER. Meanwhile, it also leads to electron deficiency of the bridging Ru sites and facilitates the adsorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules and the subsequent dissociation into *OH, thus enhancing the OER stability and activity.
