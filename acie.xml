         <title>Decorating Single&#8208;Atomic Mn Sites with FeMn Clusters to Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of electron distribution of single&#8208;atomic metal sites by atomic clusters is an effective strategy to boost their intrinsic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein we report the construction of single&#8208;atomic Mn sites decorated with atomic clusters by an innovative combination of post&#8208;adsorption and secondary pyrolysis. The X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the formation of Mn sites via Mn&#8208;N4 coordination bonding to FeMn atomic clusters (FeMnac/Mn&#8208;N4C), which has been demonstrated theoretically to be conducive to the adsorption of molecular O2 and the break of O&#8208;O bond during the ORR process. Benefiting from the structural features above, the FeMnac/Mn&#8208;N4C catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.79 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.90 V in 0.1 M KOH as well as preeminent Zn&#8208;air battery performance. Such synthetic strategy may open up a route to construct highly active catalysts with tunable atomic structures for diverse applications.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Powered Asymmetric Hydrogel Nanomotors for Enhanced Immunochemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomotors are appealing drug carriers, and the strength of the propelling force is important for their motion capability. Though high motion efficiency has been achieved with 808 nm light driven Janus&#8208;structured noble metal nanomotors, the NIR&#8208;I light penetration depth and material biocompatibility limit their broad application. Herein, we develop a 1064 nm NIR&#8208;II light driven asymmetric hydrogel nanomotor (AHNM) with high motion capability and load it with doxorubicin for enhanced immunochemotherapy. Magnetic field assisted photopolymerization generates an asymmetric distribution of Fe3O4@Cu9S8 nanoparticles in the AHNM, producing self&#8208;thermophoresis as driving force under NIR&#8208;II irradiation. The AHNM is also functionalized with dopamine for the capture and retention of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to boost immune activation. The as&#8208;obtained NIR&#8208;II light driven AHNM has a high tumor tissue penetration capability and enhances immunochemotherapy, providing a promising strategy for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogenization of Salen Metal Molecular Catalysts in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating a molecular catalyst with a light harvester into a photocatalyst is an effective strategy for solar light conversion. However, it is challenging to establish a crystallized framework with well&#8208;organized connections that favour charge separation and transfer. Herein, we report the heterogenization of a Salen metal complex molecular catalyst into a rigid covalent organic framework (COF) through covalent linkage with the light&#8208;harvesting unit of pyrene for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The chemically conjugated bonds between the two units contribute to fast photogenerated electron transfer and thereby promote the proton reduction reaction. The Salen cobalt&#8208;based COF showed the best hydrogen evolution activity (1378 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1), which is superior to the previously reported nonnoble metal based COF photocatalysts. This work provides a strategy to construct atom&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by the heterogenization of molecular catalysts into covalent organic frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Di&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenidecaphyrin(1.1.0.0.0.1.1.0.0.0) and Its Bis&#8208;Organopalladium Complexes: Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A non&#8208;aromatic expanded carbaporphyrinoid, incorporating two built&#8208;in 2,7&#8208;pyrenylene moieties was synthesized. The intrinsically labile topographic structure was demonstrated by proton&#8208;triggered conformational changes between the figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and quasi&#8208;M&#246;bius conformers. Upon treatment with Pd(OAc)  2  , the reaction produces two bis&#8208;Pd  II  complexes with distinct coordination modes. Metal coordination serves to fix the oligopyrrolic macrocyclic frame&#8208;works with the net result that both bis&#8208;Pd  II  complexes could be resolved by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The isolated enantiomers showed considerable configurational stability and persistent chiroptical properties as evidenced by the intense response in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra from 300&#8208;850 nm and the record high absorption dissymmetry factors (  g  abs  of up to 0.038) seen in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region. In addition, the mutual interconversion of the enantiomers was found to be stereospecific and to favor the more stable isomers in the presence of the weakly acidic solvent deuterated chloroform.</dc:description>

         <title>Medium/High&#8208;Entropy Amalgamated Core/Shell Nanoplate Achieves Efficient Formic Acid Catalysis for Direct Formic Acid Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have been attracting extensive research interests in designing advanced nanomaterials, while their precise control is still in the infancy stage. Herein, we have reported a well&#8208;defined PtBiPbNiCo hexagonal nanoplates (HEA HPs) as high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Structure analysis decodes that the HEA HP is constructed with PtBiPb medium&#8208;entropy core and PtBiNiCo high&#8208;entropy shell. Significantly, the HEA HPs can reach the specific and mass activities of 27.2 mA cm&#8722;2 and 7.1 A mgPt&#8722;1 for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), being the record catalyst ever achieved in Pt&#8208;based catalysts, and can realize the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) power density (321.2 mW cm&#8722;2) in fuel cell. Further experimental and theoretical analyses collectively evidence that the hexagonal intermetallic core/atomic layer shell structure and multi&#8208;element synergy greatly promote the direct dehydrogenation pathway of formic acid molecule and suppress the formation of CO*.</dc:description>

         <title>17O Hyperfine Spectroscopy Reveals Hydration Structure of Nitroxide Radicals in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydration structure of nitroxide radicals in aqueous solutions is elucidated by advanced 17O hyperfine (hf) spectroscopy with support of quantum chemical calculations and MD simulations. A piperidine and a pyrrolidine&#8208;based nitroxide radical are compared and show clear differences in the preferred directionality of H&#8208;bond formation. We demonstrate that these scenarios are best represented in 17O hf spectra, where in&#8208;plane coordination over &#963;&#8208;type H&#8208;bonding leads to little spin density transfer on the water oxygen and small hf couplings, whereas &#960;&#8208;type perpendicular coordination generates much larger hf couplings. Quantitative analysis of the spectra based on MD simulations and DFT predicted hf parameters is consistent with a distribution of close solvating water molecules, in which directionality is influenced by subtle steric effects of the ring and the methyl group substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Decarbonylation of Oxetanone and Azetidinone: Spectroscopy, Computational Models, and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoexcitation of cyclic ketones leads to the expulsion of carbon monoxide and a mixture of products derived from diradical intermediates. Here we show that synthetic utility of this process is improved if strained heterocyclic ketones are used. Photochemistry of 3&#8208;oxetanone and N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;azetidinone has not been previously described. Decarbonylation of these 4&#8208;membered rings proceeds through a step&#8208;wise Norrish type I cleavage of the C&#8211;C bond from the singlet excited state. Ylides derived from both compounds are high&#8208;energy species that are kinetically stable long enough to undergo [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of alkenes and produce substituted tetrahydrofurans and pyrrolidines. The reaction has a sufficiently wide scope to produce scaffolds that were either previously inaccessible or difficult to synthesize, thereby providing experimental access to new chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomer and Excimer Emission in a Conformational and Stacking&#8208;Adaptable Molecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A design strategy combining the molecular conformations, alkyl chain lengths, and charge transfer effect is developed to obtain the conformational and stacking&#8208;adaptable donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960; type molecules for precisely regulating the monomer and excimer emission in a single luminous platform under different environments. These fluorophores can exhibit bright monomer emissions when they are in the dispersed state based on their planar conformation. However, when the luminous molecules with short alkyl side chains are in the crystalline state, their molecular conformation can become distorted, further inducing strong intermolecular interactions and staggered &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking for bright excimer emission. More importantly, their dispersed and aggregated states can be reversibly regulated in a phase&#8208;change fatty acid matrix, to achieve temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence for temperature monitoring and advanced information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Visualization of Atomic Structure in Multivariate MOFs for Guiding Electrocatalysts Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct utilization of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has attracted increasing interests. Herein, we employ the low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) technique to visualize the atomic structure of multivariate MOFs (MTV&#8208;MOFs) for guiding the structural design of bulk MOFs for efficient OER. The iDPC&#8208;STEM images revealed that incorporating Fe3+ or ATA into Ni&#8208;BDC can introduce inhomogeneous lattice strain that weaken the coordination bonds, which can be selectively cleaved via a mild heat treatment to simultaneously generate coordinately unsaturated metal sites, conductive Ni@C and hierarchical porous structure. Thus, excellent OER activity with current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2 are achieved over the defective MOFs at small overpotentials of 286 mV and 365 mV, respectively, which is superior to the commercial RuO2 catalyst and most of the other MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Fluxional Ga Single Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise design and tuning of the micro&#8208;atomic structure of single atom catalysts (SACs) can help efficiently adapt complex catalytic systems. Herein, we inventively found that when the active center of the main group element gallium (Ga) is downsized to the atomic level, whose characteristic has significant differences from conventional bulk and rigid Ga catalysts. The Ga SACs with a P, S atomic coordination environment display specific flow properties, showing CO products with FE of ~92% at &#8208;0.3 V vs. RHE in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Theoretical simulations demonstrate that the adaptive dynamic transition of Ga optimizes the adsorption energy of the *COOH intermediate and renews the active sites in time, leading to excellent CO2RR selectivity and stability. This liquid single atom catalysts system with dynamic interfaces lays the foundation for future exploration of synthesis and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Mass Transport in Electrocatalysis Down to Sub&#8208;5nm Through Nanoscale Grade Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nano and single&#8208;atom catalysis open new possibilities of producing green hydrogen (H2) by water electrolysis. However, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which occurs at a characteristic reaction rate proportional to the potential, the fast generation of H2 nanobubbles at atomic&#8208;scale interfaces often leads to the blockage of active sites. Herein, a nanoscale grade&#8208;separation strategy is proposed to tackle mass&#8208;transport problem by utilizing ordered three&#8208;dimensional (3d) interconnected sub&#8208;5 nm pores. The results reveal that 3d criss&#8208;crossing mesopores with grade separation allow efficient diffusion of H2 bubbles along the interconnected channels. After the support of ultrafine ruthenium (Ru), the 3d mesopores are on a superior level to two&#8208;dimensional system at maximizing the catalyst performance and the obtained Ru catalyst outperforms most of the other HER catalysts. This work provides a potential route to fine&#8208;tuning few&#8208;nanometer mass transport during water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Cascade Reactions by a Cobalt&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Synergistic Nanocatalytic Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozyme, with Co&#8722;N coordination on N&#8208;doped porous carbon (Co&#8208;SAs@NC), displayed tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive cascade enzymatic activities with both catalase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like properties, specifically generating cytotoxic superoxide radicals from overexpressed H2O2. The nanocatalytic therapy led to a remarkably enhanced antitumor effect in vivo by further integration with doxorubicin.







Abstract
Nanocatalytic therapy, involving the nanozyme&#8208;triggered production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), has demonstrated potential in tumor therapy, but nanozymes still face challenges of activity and specificity that compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a strategy based on a single&#8208;atom nanozyme to initiate cascade enzymatic reactions in the TME for tumor&#8208;specific treatment. The cobalt&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozyme, with Co&#8722;N coordination on N&#8208;doped porous carbon (Co&#8208;SAs@NC), displays catalase&#8208;like activity that decomposes cellular endogenous H2O2 to produce O2, and subsequent oxidase&#8208;like activity that converts O2 into cytotoxic superoxide radicals to efficiently kill tumor cells. By incorporation with doxorubicin, the therapy achieves a significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vivo. Our findings show that cascade TME&#8208;specific catalytic therapy combined with chemotherapy is a promising strategy for efficient tumor therapy.

         <title>Alkaline Tolerant Antifreezing Additive Enabling Aqueous Zn||Ni Battery Operating at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a stable electrolyte by using alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive to realize the antifreezing property and the stable Zn anode in alkaline condition. Leveraging the high reversibility and good antifreezing property, the fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with good electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Alkaline aqueous batteries such as the Zn||Ni batteries have attracted substantial interests due to their merits of high energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolyte and the poor cycling stability in alkaline condition have hindered their operation in subzero conditions. Herein, we construct a stable aqueous electrolyte with lowest freezing point down to &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive into 1&#8197;M KOH solution.

&lt;p&gt;This work develops a stable electrolyte by using alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive to realize the antifreezing property and the stable Zn anode in alkaline condition. Leveraging the high reversibility and good antifreezing property, the fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with good electrochemical performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkaline aqueous batteries such as the Zn||Ni batteries have attracted substantial interests due to their merits of high energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolyte and the poor cycling stability in alkaline condition have hindered their operation in subzero conditions. Herein, we construct a stable aqueous electrolyte with lowest freezing point down to &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive into 1&#8197;M KOH solution. Meanwhile, we find the DMSO can also retard Zn anode corrosion and prevent Zn dendrite formation in alkaline condition, which enables the Zn plating/stripping over 700&#8197;h cycle at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and its dischage capacity retains 84.1&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, 60.6&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C at 0.5&#8197;C. Meanwhile, it can maintain 600 cycles with a specific capacity retention of 86.5&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C at 2&#8197;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The rSAM enzymes are known to catalyze diverse crosslink formation in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Here, we develop a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO) to reveal the untapped biosynthetic landscape of rSAM&#8208;modified RiPPs and characterize cyclophane&#8208;forming enzymes that catalyze various tyrosine/histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain crosslinks.







Abstract
Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent one of the largest but primarily underexplored natural product families in bacteria. The genetically encoded nature of RiPPs simplifies the prediction and prioritization of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). We report a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO), which allowed us to identify 32&#8201;220 prospective rSAM&#8208;catalyzed RiPP BGCs from 161&#8201;954 bacterial genomes and prioritize 25 families with new biosynthetic architectures or precursor patterns. We characterized three new enzymes that respectively catalyze cysteine&#8208;glycine (BlaB), histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain (ScaB), and tyrosine/histidine&#8208;arginine (VguB) cross&#8208;links. The cyclophane&#8208;forming enzyme ScaB exhibits broad substrate selectivity, allowing it to catalyze diverse triceptide formation. These results demonstrate the strength of the SPECO workflow in discovering new enzymes for peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Parent Core Engineering for Six&#8208;Level System Lasing Toward 900 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A six&#8208;level system lasing toward 900&#8197;nm was achieved with a low lasing threshold of 27.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 through engineering of the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of the parent core. This work demonstrates that extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the ESIPT parent core can effectively enhance the second proton transfer process in a cascaded double ESIPT system.







Abstract
Organic molecules which can undergo excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process have been considered as ideal gain materials for near&#8208;infrared organic lasers owing to their effective four&#8208;level systems. However, extending lasing wavelength beyond 800&#8197;nm with present ESIPT&#8208;active gain materials is still in challenge. Herein, we established a molecular design strategy that operates via extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the ESIPT parent core to enhance the cascaded double ESIPT process and thus to achieve the red&#8208;shifted six&#8208;level system lasing. Concretely, a model molecule with 1,9&#8208;dihydroxyanthracene as the ESIPT parent core was designed and synthesized, which was proved to undergo twice cascaded ESIPT processes while the 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene&#8208;based analogue can only undergo once ESIPT process based on DFT calculations and ultrafast dynamics analyses. Finally, a six&#8208;level system lasing toward 900&#8197;nm was achieved with a low threshold of 27.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Gold Alloy Catalyzes the Aerobic Oxidation of Formic Acid for Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the catalytic mechanism of formate oxidase, a platinum&#8208;gold alloy simulating the catalytic function of formic acid oxidase was designed. Hydrogen peroxide can be directly synthesized by aerobic oxidation of formic acid without complex equipment and an additional energy supply.







Abstract
On&#8208;site hydrogen peroxide production through electrocatalytic and photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions has recently attracted broad research interest. However, practical applications have thus far been plagued by the low activity and the requirement of complex equipment. Here, inspired by the process of biological hydrogen peroxide synthesis catalyzed by enzymes, we report a Pt&#8208;Au alloy to mimic the catalytic function of natural formate oxidase for hydrogen peroxide synthesis through aerobic oxidation of formic acid. The mass activity of the Pt&#8208;Au alloy is three times higher than that of formate oxidase. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the efficient dehydrogenation of formic acid and the high selectivity of the subsequent reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide account for the high hydrogen peroxide productivity. In addition, the formic acid aqueous solution provides an acidic environment, which is conducive to the utilization of the in situ generated hydrogen peroxide for oxidation reactions, including C&#8722;H bond oxidation and sterilization.

         <title>Spontaneous Assembly and Three&#8208;Dimensional Stacking of Antiaromatic 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin on HOPG</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous assembly of antiaromatic meso&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin (DOP&#8208;1) has been studied at the liquid&#8208;solid interface to elucidate its polymorphism in a monolayer and the facile formation of the stacked layer. The study of the intrinsic electronic structures of the stacked bilayer by scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed a narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap compared to the monolayer, thus suggesting significant molecular orbital interactions.







Abstract
Antiaromatic compounds have recently received considerable attention because of their novel properties such as narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and facile formation of mutual stacking. Here, the spontaneous assembly of antiaromatic meso&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin (DOP&#8208;1) is scrutinized at the liquid&#8208;solid interface by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Polymorphism in monolayers characterized by the orthogonal and parallel assemblies is found at the low concentration of 0.05&#8197;mM. The parallel assembly is more stable and dominantly formed at higher concentrations. Aggregation was observed at concentrations &gt;0.2&#8197;mM, and the STM images of the aggregates implied the formation of stacked layers. The intrinsic electronic structures of the mutually stacked bilayer generated by applying an electric pulse to the monolayer were probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy to reveal the narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap by about 20&#8201;% compared with the monolayer, thus suggesting significant molecular orbital interactions.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirosilabicyclohexenes by Asymmetric Dual Ring Expansion of Spirosilabicyclobutane with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirosilabicyclobutanes undergo asymmetric dual ring expansion with alkynes to provide homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;disubstituted spirosilabicyclohexenes, possessing axially chiral 6/6&#8208;silaspirane framework, in good yields with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Silaspiranes have attracted particular attention due to their chiral spiro&#8208;silicon center, which serves as an ideal carbon isostere and can endow spiro&#8208;analogs with distinct properties. Distinct from previously reported cyclization or cycloaddition strategies to form 5/5&#8208;silaspiranes, we report herein the asymmetric dual ring expansion of spirosilabicyclobutanes with alkynes to synthesize axially chiral spirosilabicyclohexenes bearing a novel 6/6&#8208;silaspirane framework. DFT (density functional theory) calculations provide the deep insight into the origin of the high enantioselectivity controlled by the sterically demanding binaphthyl phosphoramidite ligand. Preliminary studies of chiroptical properties indicate that one of the spirosilabicyclohexene analogs exhibit fluorescence emission, Cotton effects and CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) activity.

         <title>Constructing Stable Anion&#8208;Tuned Electrode/Electrolyte Interphase on High&#8208;Voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 Cathode for Thermally&#8208;Modulated Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable anion&#8208;tuned and solvent&#8208;derived electrode/electrolyte interphase with faster interfacial Na+ transport kinetics is established by tuning the ion&#8208;solvent configuration of electrolyte solvation structure, which contributes to thermally&#8208;modulated fast&#8208;charging batteries having longer cycle life.







Abstract
Constructing stable electrode/electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics is vital for fast&#8208;charging batteries. Herein, we investigate the interphase that forms between a high&#8208;voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode and the electrolytes consisting of 3.0, 1.0, or 0.3&#8197;M NaClO4 in an organic carbonate solvent (47.5&#8201;:&#8201;47.5&#8201;:&#8201;5 mixture of EC: PC: FEC) during charging up to 4.5&#8197;V at 55&#8201;&#176;C. It is found that a higher anion/solvent ratio in electrolyte solvation structure induces anion&#8208;dominated interphase containing more inorganic species and more anion derivatives (CxClOy), which leads to a larger interfacial Na+ transport resistance and more unfavorable gas evolution. In comparison, a low anion/solvent ratio derives stable anion&#8208;tuned interphase that enables better interfacial kinetics and cycle ability. Importantly, the performance of a failed cathode is restored by triggering the decomposition of CxClOy species. This work elucidates the role of tuning interphase in fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <title>Direct TEM Observation of Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Heteroatom Incorporation into a Zeolite Framework: Towards Microscopic Design of Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In zeolite YNU&#8208;2, point vacancies and titanium active sites at specific framework positions act as cooperative binding sites. Titanium&#8208;substituted YNU&#8208;2 (Ti&#8208;YNU&#8208;2) with a pre&#8208;designed titanium distribution, was synthesized from YNU&#8208;2 by vacancy&#8208;mediated heteroatom incorporation. Transmission electron microscopy enables direct imaging at atomic scale and provided precise structural information to understand the post&#8208;synthesis process.







Abstract
Incorporating hetero&#8208;metal&#8208;atom, e.g., titanium, into zeolite frameworks can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidation reactions. However, the rational design of zeolites containing titanium at specific sites is difficult because the precise atomic structure during synthesis process remained unclear. Here, a titanosilicate with predictable titanium distribution was synthesized by mediating vacancies in a defective MSE&#8208;type zeolite precursor, based on a pre&#8208;designed synthetic route including modification of vacancies followed by titanium insertion, where electron microscopy (EM) plays a key role at each step resolving the atomic structure. Point defects including vacancies in the precursor and titanium incorporated into the vacancy&#8208;related positions have been directly observed. The results provide insights into the role of point defects in zeolites towards the rational synthesis of zeolites with desired microscopic arrangement of catalytically active sites.

         <title>Boosting Ethane/Ethylene Separation by MOFs through the Amino&#8208;Functionalization of Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By virtue of a pore engineering strategy based on isoreticular chemistry, an amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with suitable pore confinement and more binding sites improved the ethane/ethylene separation performance compared to the parent MOF.







Abstract
Adsorption technology based on ethane&#8208;selective materials is a promising alternative to energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation for separating ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4). We employed a pore engineering strategy to tune the pore environment of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) through organic functional groups and boosted the C2H6/C2H4 separation of the MOF. Introduction of amino (&#8722;NH2) groups into Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76 not only decreased pore sizes but also facilitated multiple guest&#8208;host interactions in confined pores. The NH2&#8208;functionalized Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76(NH2) has increased C2H6 and C2H4 uptakes and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. The results of experimental and simulated transient breakthroughs reveal that Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76(NH2) has significantly improved one&#8208;step separation performance for C2H6/C2H4 mixtures with a high C2H4 (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) productivity of 17.66&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 compared to 7.53&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 by Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76, resulting from the suitable pore confinement and accessible &#8722;NH2 groups on pore surfaces.

         <title>Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 (Ln=Sm, Dy, Yb): A Mixed&#8208;Ligand Pathway to New Lanthanide(III) Multifunctional Materials Featuring Nonlinear Optical and Magnetic Anisotropy Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;ligand gateway gives new lanthanide materials with multiple functionalities which often do not coexist. Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 materials are capable of generating coherent light through the second&#8208;harmonic generation and exhibiting magnetic anisotropy facilitated by large spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This result shares new ideas for harmonizing optical and magnetic properties in single systems at the atomic level.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up assembly of optically nonlinear and magnetically anisotropic lanthanide materials involving precisely placed spin carriers and optimized metal&#8208;ligand coordination offers a potential route to developing electronic architectures for coherent radiation generation and spin&#8208;based technologies, but the chemical design historically has been extremely hard to achieve. To address this, we developed a worthwhile avenue for creating new noncentrosymmetric chiral Ln3+ materials Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 (Ln=Sm, Dy, Yb) by mixed&#8208;ligand design. The materials exhibit phase&#8208;matching nonlinear optical responses, elucidating the feasibility of the heteroanionic strategy. Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 displays paramagnetic property with strong magnetic anisotropy facilitated by large spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This study demonstrates a new chemical pathway for creating previously unknown polar chiral magnets with multiple functionalities.

         <title>The Essential Role of Water Molecules in the Reaction Mechanism of Protein O&#8208;Fucosyltransferase 2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PoFUT2 is an inverting glycosyltransferase that fucosylates TSR repeats of group 1 and 2. By applying computational methodologies, it has been found that PoFUT2 follows a pure SN2 mechanism in which water molecules play an essential role in the catalysis. Recognition of the TSR repeats by direct and water&#8208;mediated interactions, together with the role of water molecules around the catalytic center, constitute the driving force of the process.







Abstract
Protein O&#8208;fucosyltransferase 2 (PoFUT2) is an inverting glycosyltransferase (GT) that fucosylates thrombospondin repeats (TSRs) from group 1 and 2. PoFUT2 recognizes a large and diverse number of TSRs through a dynamic network of water&#8208;mediated interactions. By X&#8208;ray structural studies of C. elegans PoFUT2 complexed to a TSR of group 2, we demonstrate that this GT recognizes similarly the 3D structure of TSRs from both groups 1 and 2. Its active site is highly exposed to the solvent, suggesting that water molecules might also play an essential role in the fucosylation mechanism. We applied QM/MM methods using human PoFUT2 as a model, and found that HsPoFUT2 follows a classical SN2 reaction mechanism in which water molecules contribute to a great extent in facilitating the release of the leaving pyrophosphate unit, causing the H transfer from the acceptor nucleophile (Thr/Ser) to the catalytic base, which is the last event in the reaction. This demonstrates the importance of water molecules not only in recognition of the ligands but also in catalysis.

         <title>The Dynamic Formation from Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks of High&#8208;Density Platinum Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of metal cations in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) via a cation exchange process is governed by the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base (HSAB) principle. During pyrolysis, the evolution of first&#8208;shell Pt&#8208;ligand coordination determines the formation of the Pt&#8722;Pt second&#8208;shell coordination, which promotes the immobilization of Pt atoms as high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts in the Co3O4 host.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis, yet the practical applications require the development of high&#8208;density active sites with flexible geometric structures. The lack of understanding in the dynamic formation process of single atoms in the host framework has been plaguing the controllable synthesis of next generation SACs. Here using Co&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a starting substrate, we fully elucidated the formation of high&#8208;density Pt single atoms with inter&#8208;site interactions in derived Co3O4 host. The cation exchange process and dynamic evolution of Pt&#8722;Pt interactions, organic ligand cleavage and Pt&#8208;oxygen coordination formation during the pyrolysis process have been unambiguously interpreted by a series of in situ/ex situ spectroscopic measurements and theoretical computation. These findings would direct the synthesis of high&#8208;density SACs with metal&#8208;metal interactions, which demonstrate significantly enhanced structural flexibility and catalytic properties.

         <title>Next Generation Opto&#8208;Jasplakinolides Enable Local Remodeling of Actin Networks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of actin dynamics in biology requires tools that can be controlled with high spatial and temporal resolution. A new photoresponsive and fast&#8208;relaxing jasplakinolide (neo&#8208;optojasp) allows for the stabilization of F&#8208;actin upon irradiation with blue&#8208;green light and provides excellent spatiotemporal control. neo&#8208;Optojasp can be useful for studying actin dynamics with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
The natural product jasplakinolide is widely used to stabilize F&#8208;actin. Based on extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, we have developed a new generation of photoswitchable jasplakinolides that feature rationally designed red&#8208;shifted azobenzene photoswitches. Our lead compound, nOJ, can be activated with longer wavelengths in the visible range (e.g. 440&#8211;475&#8197;nm) and rapidly returns to its inactive state through thermal relaxation. nOJ enables the reversible control of F&#8208;actin dynamics, as shown through live&#8208;cell imaging, cell migration, and cell proliferation assays. Short, local irradiation with blue light resulted in highly localized and reversible actin aggregation with subcellular precision. Our optical tool can be useful in diverse fields to study actin dynamics with excellent spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Regulated Multi&#8208;State Long&#8208;Lived Emission from Star&#8208;Shaped Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;state long&#8208;lived emission has been obtained by regulating the molecular motions of star&#8208;shaped molecules. Reverse intersystem crossing assisted by the T2 state of the star&#8208;shaped molecules leads to thermally activated delayed fluorescence in solution and the solid state. Suppressing the molecular motions of the dye in a polymer leads to ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
How to utilize molecular vibration to tune triplet&#8208;involved emissions in multiple states is highly challenging. Here, star&#8208;shaped triphenylamine derivatives have been employed as model systems to understand how molecular vibration affects thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions in multiple states. Nonplanar, star&#8208;shaped conformations allow molecules to generate appropriate vibrations in the solution state, facilitating vibronic coupling between their T1 and T2 states to generate effective TADF. More importantly, a relatively dispersed state can allow the molecules to efficiently vibrate in the solid state, and a crystalline environment further promotes a more efficient TADF. Lastly, by suppressing molecular vibration to inhibit the TADF, ultra&#8208;long RTP was observed upon doping these molecules into polymers. These molecules can be used in information encryption and storage as well as bioimaging.

These molecules can be used in information encryption and storage as well as bioimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stable Orange&#8208;Red Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent CsCdCl3:Mn2+ Perovskite Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+&#8208;doped CsCdCl3 perovskite luminescent crystals with tunable afterglow time, high efficiency and stability were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn2+ shows the longest afterglow time of 1480&#8197;s and the highest PLQY of 91.4&#8201;%. CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn2+ maintained over 90&#8201;% of the PL intensity at 423&#8197;K, and the PL remains about 80&#8201;% after soaking in water for 55&#8197;days.







Abstract
Halide perovskite has been widely studied as a new generation of photoelectronic materials. However, their thermal and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a hexagonal Mn2+&#8208;doped CsCdCl3 perovskite crystal that possesses stable photoluminescence (PL) at both high temperature and humidity. The room temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of the single crystals lasts up to 1480&#8197;s and can be adjusted by changing the concentration of Mn2+ ion doping. The characteristic emission of d&#8208;d transition of Mn2+ is realized, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is up to 91.4&#8201;%, it can maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial PL spectral integral area at 150&#8201;&#176;C (423&#8197;K). High humid stability PL can be achieved more than 75&#8201;% of the initial PL intensity after 55&#8197;days of immersion in water. These excellent properties show the application prospect of the LPL material in lighting indication and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening of an Artificial Metalloenzyme using Double Emulsions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial metalloenzyme was screened in vivo using a high&#8208;throughput microfluidics&#8208;based assay. Single E. coli cells expressing streptavidin were encapsulated in double emulsion droplets together with a fluorogenic substrate and a cofactor catalyzing the reaction to yield a fluorescent product. Using this method, a 400&#8208;member library was screened, and the same hits found previously in a 96&#8208;well plate assay were identified.







Abstract
The potential for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput compartmentalization renders droplet microfluidics an attractive tool for the directed evolution of enzymes. Importantly, it ensures maintenance of the phenotype&#8208;genotype linkage, enabling reliable identification of improved mutants. Herein, we report an approach for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening of an artificial metalloenzyme in double emulsion droplets (DEs) using commercially available fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorters (FACS). This protocol was validated by screening a 400 double&#8208;mutant streptavidin library for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed deallylation of an alloc&#8208;protected aminocoumarin. The most active variants, identified by next&#8208;generation sequencing, were in good agreement with hits obtained using a 96&#8208;well plate procedure. These findings pave the way for the systematic implementation of FACS for the directed evolution of (artificial) enzymes and will significantly expand the accessibility of ultrahigh&#8208;throughput DE screening protocols.

         <title>Biosynthetic Elucidation and Structural Revision of Brevione&#8197;E: Characterization of the Key Dioxygenase for Pathway Branching from Setosusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthetic elucidation and structural revision of the fungal meroterpenoid brevione&#8197;E were achieved. The brevione&#8197;E pathway involves dihydrotropone synthesis via the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase BrvJ. BrvJ is also the key enzyme responsible for the pathway branching from setosusin biosynthesis, which involves a BrvJ homologue, SetK. Amino acid residues that account for their product selectivity were also identified.







Abstract
Brevione&#8197;E (1) is a fungal hexacyclic meroditerpenoid with unique oxepane and cycloheptenone moieties. In this study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 and elucidated its biosynthetic pathway via heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes and in vitro enzymatic reactions. Surprisingly, reexamination of the structure of 1 revealed a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring instead of the previously proposed oxepane system. Moreover, we determined that cycloheptenone synthesis involves skeletal rearrangement catalyzed by the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase BrvJ. BrvJ is highly homologous to SetK, which engages in the biosynthesis of another fungal metabolite, setosusin, and accepts the same substrate as BrvJ but performs only simple hydroxylation. Finally, we identified the key amino acid residues critical for product selectivity of BrvJ and SetK, providing insight into how the biosynthesis pathways of 1 and setosusin diverge and how fungi diversify natural products.

         <title>Quantifying Reductive Amination in Nonenzymatic Amino Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why does biochemical amino acid synthesis proceed the way it does? Kinetic and mechanistic experiments with a model hydride donor were used to determine the intrinsic electrophilic reactivities of keto acids in reduction and reductive amination reactions. Comparing the nonenzymatic reactivity trends with those found in biology provides new insight into the structure of amino acid metabolism.







Abstract
Amino acid biosynthesis initiates with the reductive amination of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate with ammonia to produce glutamate. However, the other &#945;&#8208;keto acids derived from the glyoxylate and Krebs cycles are converted into amino acids by transamination, rather than by reductive amination. Why is only one amino acid synthesized by reductive amination and not the others? To explore this question, we quantified the inherent reactivities of keto acids in nonenzymatic reduction and reductive amination by using BH3CN&#8722; as a model nucleophile. Biological &#945;&#8208;keto acids were found to show pronounced nonenzymatic reactivity differences for the formation of amino acids (&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&lt;oxaloacetate&#8776;pyruvate&#8810;glyoxylate). Accordingly, the flow of ammonia passes through the least reactive &#945;&#8208;keto acid of the Krebs cycle. One possible explanation for this choice is the position of the corresponding amino acid, glutamate, at the top of the thermodynamic landscape for subsequent transamination reactions.

         <title>Overcoming Hypoxia&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis Resistance via a 19F/1H&#8208;MRI Traceable Core&#8208;Shell Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorocarbon@MnOx core&#8208;shell nanostructure for overcoming the tumor microenvironment hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance via direct delivery of oxygen into the tumor is presented. Using this nanoplatform, activatable 19F&#8208;MRI/1H&#8208;MRI imaging of ferroptosis initiation is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Lipid peroxides accumulation induced ferroptosis is an effective cell death pathway for cancer therapy. However, the hypoxic condition of tumor microenvironment significantly suppresses the efficacy of ferroptosis. Here, we design a novel nanoplatform to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance. Specifically, we synthesize a novel kind of perfluorocarbon (PFOB)@manganese oxide (MnOx) core&#8208;shell nanoparticles (PM&#8208;CS NPs). Owing to the good carrier of O2 as fuel, PM&#8208;CS NPs can induce higher level of ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion, as well as lower activity of GPX4, compared with MnOx NPs alone. Moreover, the supplement of O2 can relieve tumor hypoxia to break down the storage of intracellular lipid droplets and increase expression of ACSL4 (a symbol for ferroptosis sensitivity). Furthermore, upon stimulus of GSH or acidity, PM&#8208;CS NPs exhibit the &#8220;turn on&#8221; 19F&#8208;MRI signal and activatable T1/T2&#8208;MRI contrast for correlating with the release of Mn. Finally, PM&#8208;CS NPs exert high cancer inhibition rate for ferroptosis based therapy via synergetic combination of O2&#8208;mediated enhancement of key pathways of ferroptosis.

&lt;p&gt;A perfluorocarbon@MnOx core-shell nanostructure for overcoming the tumor microenvironment hypoxia-induced ferroptosis resistance via direct delivery of oxygen into the tumor is presented. Using this nanoplatform, activatable &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-MRI/&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRI imaging of ferroptosis initiation is also demonstrated.

         <title>Switchable Metal Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework MFM&#8208;300(Sc): Lewis Acid Catalysis Driven by Metal&#8211;Hemilabile Linker Bond Dynamics</title>

         <dc:description>
An unconventional catalytic activity was demonstrated for the Strecker reaction using a saturated ScIII&#8208;based MOF known as MFM&#8208;300(Sc). This activity was possible due to metal&#8208;hemilabile linker bond to create an intermittent free ScIII site.







Abstract
Uncommon reversible guest&#8208;induced metal&#8208;hemilabile linker bond dynamics in MOF MFM&#8208;300(Sc) was unraveled to switch on/switch off catalytic open metal sites. The catalytic activity of this MOF with non&#8208;permanent open metal sites was demonstrated using a model Strecker hydrocyanation reaction as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Conclusively, the catalytic activity was evidenced to be fully reversible, preserving the conversion performance and structure integrity of MFM&#8208;300(Sc) over multiple cycles. These experimental findings were corroborated by quantum&#8208;calculations that revealed a reaction mechanism driven by the Sc&#8208;open metal sites. This discovery paves the way towards the design of new effective and easily regenerable heterogeneous MOF catalysts integrating switchable metal sites.

         <title>Surface Degradation of Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Cathode and Regulation Mechanism by Atomic Layer Deposition in Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the surface mechanism on the single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (SC&#8208;NCM) cathode are disclosed by in situ atomic force microscopy in solid&#8208;state batteries. Via atomic layer deposition, the Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM, leading to the uniform formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase and suppression of undesired side reaction, which endows batteries with enhanced interfacial stability, durability and dynamics.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode (SC&#8208;NCM) has attracted increasing interest owing to its greater capacity retention in advanced solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), while suffers from severe interfacial instability during cycling. Here, via atomic layer deposition, Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM (L&#8208;NCM), to suppress undesired side reaction and enhance interfacial stability. The dynamic degradation and surface regulation of SC&#8208;NCM are investigated inside a working SSLB by in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). We directly observe the uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and surface defects on pristine SC&#8208;NCM particle. Remarkably, the formed amorphous LiF&#8208;rich CEI on L&#8208;NCM maintains its initial structure upon cycling, and thus endows the battery with improved cycling stability and excellent rate capability. Such on&#8208;site tracking provides deep insights into surface mechanism and structure&#8211;reactivity correlation of SC&#8208;NCM, and thus benefits the optimizations of SSLBs.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Atomic Pairs with a Distal Fe3+&#8208;Site Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co&#8722;Fe hetero&#8208;atomic pair, bound to a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Lewis acidic Fe center is distal to the surface, boosted water oxidation. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulated the order of hydroxide transfer. The system offers insights into bimetallic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic systems and provides a model of in situ/operando investigations on the mechanistic understanding as well as future catalysts design.







Abstract
The hetero&#8208;atomic interaction has been the subject of many investigations, due to their heterogeneity, the individual roles of the atoms are still difficult to realize. Herein, an electrocatalyst with a hetero&#8208;atomic pair confined on a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Fe3+&#8208;site of the pair is distal to the surface is shown to deliver an extremely low overpotential of 192&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and one of the highest oxygen production turnover frequencies (TOF) of 2.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mV under alkaline environment for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Operando characterization shows the Lewis acidic Fe3+ site boosts a large population of Co4+/3+ and the deprotonation of coordinated water, allowing simultaneously enhanced electron&#8208;transfer as well as the proton&#8208;transfer. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulates the order of hydroxide transfer in the pre&#8208;equilibrium step (PES) and rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS), leading to a remarkable OER performance.

         <title>Dual Activation of Molecular Oxygen and Surface Lattice Oxygen in Single Atom Cu1/TiO2 Catalyst for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolated Cu1+ on Cu1/TiO2 single atom catalysts (SACs) facilitated the simultaneous activation of chemisorbed O2 and 2&#8208;coordinated surface lattice O2&#8722;, which triggered the CO oxidation through E&#8208;R (80&#8201;&#176;C) and MvK (200&#8201;&#176;C) routes synergistically with elevated temperature. This finding provides insights and strategy for the rational design of efficient oxidation catalysts with sufficient reactive oxygen species for practical application.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth mechanism on the simultaneous activation of O2 and surface lattice O2&#8722; on one active metallic site has not been elucidated yet. Herein, we report a strategy for the construction of abundant oxygen activation sites by rational design of Cu1/TiO2 single atom catalysts (SACs). The charge transfer between isolated Cu and TiO2 support generates abundant CuI and 2&#8208;coordinated Olat sites in Cu1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti hybridization structure, which facilitates the chemisorption and activation of O2 molecules. Simultaneously, the Cu1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti induced TiO2 lattice distortion activate the adjacent surface lattice O2&#8722;, achieving the dual activation of O2 and surface lattice O2&#8722;. The Cu1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti active site switches the CO oxidation mechanism from Eley&#8208;Rideal (80&#8201;&#176;C) to Mars&#8211;van Krevelen route (200&#8201;&#176;C) with the increase of reaction temperature. The dual activation of O2 and surface lattice O2&#8722; can by modulating the electron properties of SACs can boost the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation activity.

The charge transfer between isolated Cu and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support generates abundant Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and 2-coordinated O&lt;sub&gt;lat&lt;/sub&gt; sites in Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Ti hybridization structure, which facilitates the chemisorption and activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Simultaneously, the Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Ti induced TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lattice distortion activate the adjacent surface lattice O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, achieving the dual activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and surface lattice O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Ti active site switches the CO oxidation mechanism from Eley-Rideal (80&#8201;&#176;C) to Mars&#8211;van Krevelen route (200&#8201;&#176;C) with the increase of reaction temperature. The dual activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and surface lattice O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can by modulating the electron properties of SACs can boost the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>FRET Monitoring of a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Elongation Module Reveals Carrier Protein Shuttling between Catalytic Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Translocation of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) between two catalytic domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) has been studied for the first time. Monitoring PCP interaction with A and C domains during catalysis using two FRET sensors of an elongation module revealed conformational population shifts that correlate with the directionality of synthesis. The first light&#8208;controlled NRPS was created to further probe and support this model.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) employ multiple domains, specifically arranged in modules, for the assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis of a plethora of bioactive peptides. It is poorly understood how catalysis is correlated with the domain interplay and associated conformational changes. We developed FRET sensors of an elongation module to study in solution the intramodular interactions of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) with adenylation (A) and condensation (C) domains. Backed by HDX&#8208;MS analysis, we discovered dynamic mixtures of conformations that undergo distinct population changes in favor of the PCP&#8208;A and PCP&#8208;C interactions upon completion of the adenylation and thiolation reactions, respectively. To probe this model we blocked PCP binding to the C domain by photocaging and triggered peptide bond formation with light. Changing intramodular domain affinities of the PCP appear to result in conformational shifts according to the logic of the templated assembly process.

         <title>From a Metal&#8211;Organic Square to a Robust and Regenerable Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly for Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a metal&#8211;organic square, a robust and renewable polyhedron&#8208;based framework material is assembled with potential for CH4 purification from natural gas and CO2 capture from industrial off&#8208;gas.







Abstract
Porous supramolecular assemblies constructed by noncovalent interactions are promising for adsorptive purification of methane because of their easy regeneration. However, the poor stability arising from the weak noncovalent interactions has obstructed their practical applications. Here, we report a robust and easily regenerated polyhedron&#8208;based cationic framework assembled from a metal&#8211;organic square. This material exhibits a very low affinity for CH4 and N2, but captures other competing gases (e.g. C2H6, C3H8, and CO2) with a moderate affinity. These results underpin highly selective separation of a range of gas mixtures that are relevant to natural gas and industrial off&#8208;gas. Dynamic breakthrough studies demonstrate its practical separation for C2H6/CH4, C3H8/CH4, CO2/N2, and CO2/CH4. Particularly, the separation time is &#8776;11&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C2H6/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture and &#8776;49&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C3H8/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture (under a flow of 2.0&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1), respectively, enabling its capability for CH4 purification from light alkanes.

         <title>Remote Editing of Stacked Aromatic Assemblies for Heteroannular C&#8722;H Functionalization by a Palladium Switch between Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient ligand&#8208;enabled palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination and allylation of stacked aromatic assemblies has been developed, in which the remote heteroannular site over the proximal homoannular site is functionalized. Mechanistic investigations support an olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
An approach allowing remote editing of stacked aromatic assemblies for heteroannular C&#8722;H functionalization would represent a transformative chemical toolbox that may make the diversification of complex molecules in a straightforward manner. However, such a C&#8722;H activation is usually less kinetically and thermodynamically favorable than homoannular ortho C&#8722;H activation and remains a fundamental challenge. Herein we disclose an engineer's approach, using a transient ligand as an interim bridge between two aryl rings (analogues to mountaintops) to anchor the metal center on the remote heteroannular C&#8722;H bond. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination of stacked aromatic assemblies with olefins and allylation with vinyl acetates using L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine acid as a transient ligand. Mechanistic investigations suggest an unusual olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Directed Conformational Switching of a Zinc Finger Analogue Regulates the Mechanosensing and Differentiation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>

Conformational switching of rationally designed secondary&#8208;structure mimics of extracellular matrix proteins can be controlled via the formation a polymer&#8211;cation complex enabling the control of bio&#8208;ligand presentation for the study of cellular development.







Abstract
The dynamic conformational changes in the secondary structures of proteins are essential to their functions and can regulate diverse cellular events. Herein we report the design of a synthetic polymer&#8208;based secondary structure analogue of a zinc finger (ZnF) by introducing a zinc coordination motif to overcome the free energy barrier predicted by theoretical calculations and fold&#8208;free polymer chains. The conformational switching between unfolded and folded state of the ZnF analogue can be triggered in situ to drastically manipulate the accessibility of conjugated cell adhesive ligands to the cell membrane receptors, thereby effectively controlling the adhesion, spreading, mechanosensing, and differentiation of stem cells. We believe that emulating the dynamic secondary structures of proteins via rational design of a folded synthetic polymer&#8211;cation complex is a promising strategy for developing bioactive materials to mediate desired cellular functions.

         <title>Squarephaneic Tetraanhydride: A Conjugated Square&#8208;Shaped Cyclophane for the Synthesis of Porous Organic Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique new member of the family of aromatic carboxylic anhydride building blocks&#8212;a conjugated square&#8208;shaped cyclophane with four anhydride groups&#8212;is presented. The building block can be obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis and functionalised efficiently to give materials with highly interesting properties ranging from high degrees of porosity to excellent electrochemical properties, as shown by the conversion into imides and carboxylates.







Abstract
Aromatic carboxylic anhydrides are ubiquitous building blocks in organic materials chemistry and have received considerable attention in the synthesis of organic semiconductors, pigments, and battery electrode materials. Here we extend the family of aromatic carboxylic anhydrides with a unique new member, a conjugated cyclophane with four anhydride groups. The cyclophane is obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis and can be functionalised efficiently, as shown by the conversion into tetraimides and an octacarboxylate. Crystal structures reveal the high degree of porosity achievable with the new building block. Excellent electrochemical properties and reversible reduction to the tetraanions are shown for the imides; NMR and EPR measurements confirm the global aromaticity of the dianions and evidence the global Baird aromaticity of the tetraanions. Considering the short synthesis and unique properties, we expect widespread use of the new building block in the development of organic materials.

         <title>Taming Heavier Group 14 Imine Analogues: Accessing Tin Nitrogen [Sn=N] Double Bonds and their Cycloaddition/Metathesis Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study on taming stannaimines (R2Sn=NR) is reported by identifying a suitable supporting ligand framework for stannylenes in combination with organic azides. The nitrogen substituent of these compounds was crucial for allowing a broad range of subsequent reactivity ranging from cycloadditions to multiple bond metathesis reactions, thus highlighting the necessary balance of rendering challenging systems isolable but still reactive.







Abstract
A systematic study to access stable stannaimines is reported, by combining different heteroleptic stannylenes with a range of organic azides. The reactions of terphenyl&#8208;/hypersilyl&#8208;substituted stannylenes yield the putative tin nitrogen double bond, but is directly followed by 1,2&#8208;silyl migration to give SnII systems featuring bulky silylamido ligands. By contrast, the transition from a two &#963; donor ligand set to a mixed &#963;&#8208;donor/&#960;&#8208;donor scaffold allows access to three new stannaimines which can be handled at room temperature. The reactivity profile of these Sn=N bonded species is crucially dependent on the substituent at the nitrogen atom. As such, the Sn=NMes (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) system is capable of activating a broad range of substrates under ambient conditions via 1,2&#8208;addition reactions, [2+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Most interestingly, very rare examples of main group multiple bond metathesis reactions are also found to be viable.

         <title>Condensed Osmaquinolines with NIR&#8208;II Absorption Synthesized by Aryl C&#8722;H Annulation and Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of condensed metallaquinolines capable of NIR&#8208;II absorption involves an unconventional C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling through the combined effects of Ag and Os. This work demonstrates an unusual reactivity pattern of anthranil and contributes a new approach to N&#8208;doped condensed metallacycles. It also illustrates a new cyclic d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; conjugation strategy for the design of NIR&#8208;II absorbing molecules.







Abstract
The structural design and tuning of properties of metallaaromatics are crucial in materials and energy science. Herein, we describe the rapid synthesis of tetracyclic metallaaromatics containing quinoline and pentalene motifs fused by a metal&#8208;bridged fragment. These unique compounds display remarkably broad absorption, enabling for the first time the absorption of metallaaromatics to reach the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) bio&#8208;window. The formation of osmaquinoline unit involves an unconventional C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling promoted by AgBF4 to achieve [3+3] cycloaddition. The introduction of cyclic d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; conjugation and extension of the aromatic &#960;&#8208;framework can effectively shrink the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, thus broadening the absorption window. The considerable photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) in both the NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II windows, the high photothermal stability and the excellent electrochemical behavior suggest many potential applications of these condensed metallaquinolines.

         <title>A Sonication&#8208;Activated Valence&#8208;Variable Sono&#8208;Sensitizer/Catalyst for Autography Inhibition/Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the tumor microenvironment, we developed a versatile sono&#8208;sensitizer/catalyst that can realize ultrasound&#8208;responsive spatiotemporal chemodynamic therapy coupled with sonodynamic therapy. The presented nanoplatform thereby provides a feasible and efficient tumor theranostic modality with remarkable outcome and biosafety.







Abstract
The effective deployment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated oncotherapy in practice remains challenging, mired by uncontrollable catalytic processes, stern reaction conditions and safety concerns. Herein, we develop a copper nanodot integrating sonodynamic and catalytic effects within one active center, which responds to exogenous ultrasound (US) and endogenous H2O2 stimuli. US irradiation induces the valence conversion from CuII to CuI catalyzing H2O2 into &#8901;OH for chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, valence transformation results in electron&#8208;hole pairs separation, promoting ROS generation for sonodynamic therapy. Notably, copper nanodots not only block lysosome fusion and degradation leading to autophagy flux blockage, but also interfere with the glutathione peroxidase 4 and cystine&#8208;glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 function achieving ferroptosis. Furthermore, reversible valence changes, inherent hydrophilicity and renal clearance ultrasmall size guarantee biosafety.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Pentafluorosulfanylation and Tetrafluoro(aryl)sulfanylation of [1.1.1]Propellane: Reactivity and Structural Insight
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging SF5 and Ar&#8722;SF4 chemistry with strain&#8208;release functionalization of [1.1.1]propellane enables us to explore uncharted chemical space associated with C(sp3)&#8722;SF5 and C(sp3)&#8722;SF4Ar motifs. X&#8208;ray analyses of the resultant &#8220;hybrid isosteres&#8221; reveal remarkably short transannular nonbonding C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C contacts&#8212;among the shortest distances reported to date. DFT and SC&#8208;XRD data provide evidence that the wing C&#8722;C bonds play a key role in stabilization.







Abstract
We leveraged the recent increase in synthetic accessibility of SF5Cl and Ar&#8722;SF4Cl compounds to combine chemistry of the SF5 and SF4Ar groups with strain&#8208;release functionalization. By effectively adding SF5 and SF4Ar radicals across [1.1.1]propellane, we accessed structurally unique bicyclopentanes, bearing two distinct elements of bioisosterism. Upon evaluating these &#8220;hybrid isostere&#8221; motifs in the solid state, we measured exceptionally short transannular distances; in one case, the distance rivals the shortest nonbonding C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C contact reported to date. This prompted SC&#8208;XRD and DFT analyses that support the notion that a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction involving the &#8220;wing&#8221; C&#8722;C bonds is playing an important role in stabilization. Thus, these heretofore unknown structures expand the palette for highly coveted three&#8208;dimensional fluorinated building blocks and provide insight to a more general effect observed in bicyclopentanes.

&lt;p&gt;Merging SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and Ar&#8722;SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; chemistry with strain-release functionalization of [1.1.1]propellane enables us to explore uncharted chemical space associated with C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ar motifs. X-ray analyses of the resultant &#8220;hybrid isosteres&#8221; reveal remarkably short transannular nonbonding C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C contacts&#8212;among the shortest distances reported to date. DFT and SC-XRD data provide evidence that the wing C&#8722;C bonds play a key role in stabilization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We leveraged the recent increase in synthetic accessibility of SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and Ar&#8722;SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl compounds to combine chemistry of the SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ar groups with strain-release functionalization. By effectively adding SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ar radicals across [1.1.1]propellane, we accessed structurally unique bicyclopentanes, bearing two distinct elements of bioisosterism. Upon evaluating these &#8220;hybrid isostere&#8221; motifs in the solid state, we measured exceptionally short transannular distances; in one case, &lt;i&gt;the distance rivals the shortest nonbonding C&lt;/i&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;i&gt;C contact reported to date&lt;/i&gt;. This prompted SC-XRD and DFT analyses that support the notion that a donor-acceptor interaction involving the &#8220;wing&#8221; C&#8722;C bonds is playing an important role in stabilization. Thus, these heretofore unknown structures expand the palette for highly coveted three-dimensional fluorinated building blocks and provide insight to a more general effect observed in bicyclopentanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of a Library of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Like &#8220;Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail&#8221; Linked Multimers for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies

New heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized where the disaccharide modules were connected from the reducing end to the non&#8208;reducing end to mimic the structures of native polysaccharides more closely. A library of 27 such &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides was prepared, which was found to exhibit similar structure&#8208;activity relationship trends as HS hexasaccharides in the binding to fibroblast growth factor 2.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) plays important roles in many biological processes. The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;activity relationship. To facilitate biological studies, a new strategy has been developed to synthesize a HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharide library, where HS disaccharides were linked in a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; fashion from the reducing end of a disaccharide module to the non&#8208;reducing end of a neighboring module. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides were achieved. This new class of compounds bound with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF&#8208;2) with similar structure&#8208;activity trends as HS oligosaccharides bearing native glycosyl linkages. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mirror natural HS activity trends suggest that the new head&#8208;to&#8208;tail linked pseudo&#8208;oligosaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Performance Lithium/Sodium&#8208;Iodine Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked with Ti3C2Tx MXene was designed and adopted as electrodes with excellent cyclic stability and rate&#8208;performances in Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries.







Abstract
The rechargeable lithium/sodium&#8208;iodine battery (Li/Na&#8208;I2) is a promising candidate for meeting the growing energy demand. Herein, a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked to the Ti3C2Tx MXene complex (HOF@Ti3C2Tx) has been presented for iodine loading. HOF is self&#8208;assembled by organic monomers through hydrogen bonding interactions between each monomer. It leads to numerous cavities in HOF structure, which can encapsulate iodine through various adsorptive sites and intermolecular interactions. The unique structure of complex can accelerate the nucleation of iodine, achieve fast reaction kinetics, stabilize iodide and retard the shuttle effect, thus improving the cycling stability of I2&#8208;based batteries. The I2/HOF@Ti3C2Tx exhibits large reversible capacities of 260.2 and 207.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C after repeated cycling for Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries, respectively. This work can gain insights into the HOF&#8208;related energy storage application with reversible iodine encapsulation and its related redox reaction mechanisms with Li and Na metal ions.

         <title>Operando Laboratory&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Edge X&#8208;Ray Absorption Near&#8208;Edge Spectroscopy of Solid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando laboratory&#8208;based multi&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES) offers possibilities for advanced catalyst characterization, as demonstrated for mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic CO2 hydrogenation catalysts consisting of Ni, Cu, and Fe. Synergistic effects during catalyst reduction and their influence on catalytic performance were unraveled, guiding rational design of multielement solid catalysts for various applications.







Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and especially X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) offers new opportunities in catalyst characterization and presents not only an alternative, but also a complementary approach to precious beamtime at synchrotron facilities. We successfully designed a laboratory&#8208;based setup for performing operando, quasi&#8208;simultaneous XANES analysis at multiple K&#8208;edges, more specifically, operando XANES of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic CO2 hydrogenation catalysts containing Ni, Fe, and Cu. Detailed operando XANES studies of the multielement solid catalysts revealed metal&#8208;dependent differences in the reducibility and re&#8208;oxidation behavior and their influence on the catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation. The applicability of operando laboratory&#8208;based XANES at multiple K&#8208;edges paves the way for advanced multielement catalyst characterization complementing detailed studies at synchrotron facilities.

         <title>Cyanine Dye Coupling Mediates Self&#8208;assembly of a pH Sensitive Peptide into Novel 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated Cy5 dye&#8208;peptide system reveals the formation of two novel and structurally distinct supramolecular assemblies with photo&#8208;physical characteristics of H&#8208;type dimers or tetramers, respectively. The molecular ultrastructures are triggered by the complementary interplay of mutual chromophore coupling and pH induced changes in the peptide charge pattern.







Abstract
Synthetic multichromophore systems are of great importance in artificial light harvesting devices, organic optoelectronics, tumor imaging and therapy. Here, we introduce a promising strategy for the construction of self&#8208;assembled peptide templated dye stacks based on coupling of a de novo designed pH sensitive peptide with a cyanine dye Cy5 at its N&#8208;terminus. Microscopic techniques, in particular cryogenic TEM (cryo&#8208;TEM) and cryo&#8208;electron tomography technique (cryo&#8208;ET), reveal two types of highly ordered three&#8208;dimensional assembly structures on the micrometer scale. Unbranched compact layered rods are observed at pH&#8197;7.4 and two&#8208;dimensional membrane&#8208;like assemblies at pH&#8197;3.4, both species displaying spectral features of H&#8208;aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the coupling of Cy5 moieties promotes the formation of both ultrastructures, whereas the protonation states of acidic and basic amino acid side chains dictates their ultimate three&#8208;dimensional organization.

         <title>Maximized Green Photoluminescence in Tb&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Pressure&#8208;Treated Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pressure&#8208;treated Tb(BTC)(H2O)6 exhibits unprecedentedly enhanced PLQY of 90.4&#8201;% comparing to the initial state (50.6&#8201;%). This pressure&#8208;treated process can optimize the ligand singlet and triplet states close to the Tb3+ energy level, which boosts ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer in Tb(BTC)(H2O)6.







Abstract
Lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks are of great interest in the development of photoluminescence (PL) materials owing to their structural tunability and intrinsic features of lanthanide elements. However, there exists some limitations arising from poor matching with metal ions, thereby exhibiting a weak ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer (LMET) process. Here we demonstrate a pressure&#8208;treated strategy for achieving high PL performance in green&#8208;emitting Tb(BTC)(H2O)6. The PL quantum yield of pressure&#8208;treated sample increased from 50.6&#8201;% to 90.4&#8201;%. We found that the enhanced hydrogen bonds locked the conjugated configuration formed by two planes of carboxyl group and benzene ring, enabling the promoted intersystem crossing to effectively drive LMET. Moreover, the optimized singlet and triplet states also validated the facilitated LMET process. This work opens the opportunity of structure optimization to improve PL performance in MOFs by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Magnetic Dendrite&#8208;Shaped Microrobots for Photodynamic Prostate Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;shaped hematite microrobots have been developed as an effective GSH depletion agent for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of prostate cancer cells. These single&#8208;component microrobots with dual light/magnetic field actuation can induce GSH depletion, greatly enhancing in vitro PDT performance and accomplishing the non&#8208;contact transportation of micro&#8208;sized objects.







Abstract
Photocatalytic micromotors that exhibit wireless and controllable motion by light have been extensively explored for cancer treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment can down&#8208;regulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level for cancer therapy. Herein, we present dendrite&#8208;shaped light&#8208;powered hematite microrobots as an effective GSH depletion agent for PDT of prostate cancer cells. These hematite microrobots can display negative phototactic motion under light irradiation and flexible actuation in a defined path controlled by an external magnetic field. Non&#8208;contact transportation of micro&#8208;sized cells can be achieved by manipulating the microrobot's motion. In addition, the biocompatible microrobots induce GSH depletion and greatly enhance PDT performance. The proposed dendrite&#8208;shaped hematite microrobots contribute to developing dual light/magnetic field&#8208;powered micromachines for the biomedical field.

         <title>The Role of Heme Peroxo Oxidants in the Rational Mechanistic Modeling of Nitric Oxide Synthase: Characterization of Key Intermediates and Elucidation of the Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mid&#8208;valent heme peroxo mimics have been evaluated in the modeling of a pathogenically significant enzyme, nitric oxide synthase. The key mechanistic details closely resemble one of the most widely reproduced enzymatic proposals. In&#8208;detail characterization of reaction intermediates is presented, and the overall mechanism is elucidated.







Abstract
Mammalian nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mediates the two&#8208;step O2&#8208;dependent oxidative degradation of arginine, and has been linked to a medley of disease situations in humans. Nonetheless, its exact mechanism of action still remains unclear. This work presents the first NOS model system where biologically proposed heme superoxo and peroxo intermediates are assessed as active oxidants against oxime substrates. Markedly, heme peroxo intermediates engaged in a bioinspired oxime oxidation reaction pathway, converting oximes to ketones and nitroxyl anions (NO&#8722;). Detailed thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanistic interrogations all evince a rate&#8208;limiting step primarily driven by the nucleophilicity of the heme peroxo moiety. Coherent with other findings, 18O and 15N isotope substitution experiments herein suffice compelling evidence toward a detailed mechanism, which draw close parallels to one of the enzymatic proposals. Intriguingly, recent enzymatic studies also lend credence to these findings, and several relevant reaction intermediates have been observed during NOS turnover.

         <title>Electrochemical Double&#8208;Layer Capacitor based on Carbon@ Covalent Organic Framework Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COFs) aerogels are shaped into flexible electrode composite by a simple compression method. It shows permanent porosity and great ion diffusion pathways appropriated for electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitors (EDLC). These EDLC devices demonstrated a significant areal capacitance (11.2&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with the lowest &#964;0 reported in COF&#8208;based capacitors, 50&#8197;ms, and a 98&#8201;% capacitance retention over 10&#8201;000 charge/discharge cycles.







Abstract
High energy demand results in comprehensive research of novel materials for energy sources and storage applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess appropriate features such as long&#8208;range order, permanent porosity, tunable pore size, and ion diffusion pathways to be competitive electrode materials. Herein, we present a deep electrochemical study of two COF&#8208;aerogels shaped into flexible COF&#8208;electrodes (ECOFs) by a simple compression method to fabricate an electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitor (EDLC). This energy storage system has considerable interest owing to its high&#8208;power density and long cycle life compared with batteries. Our result confirmed the outstanding behavior of ECOFs as EDLC devices with a capacity retention of almost 100&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000 charge/discharge cycles and, to our knowledge, the highest areal capacitance (9.55&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in aqueous electrolytes at higher scan rates (1000&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1) for COFs. More importantly, the hierarchical porosity observed in the ECOFs increases ion transport, which permits a fast interface polarization (low &#964;0 values). The complete sheds light on using ECOFs as novel electrode material to fabricate EDLC devices.

         <title>Modular Construction of Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Derivatives by Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a highly selective radical cascade&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reaction for the modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAA) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal the excited state of an in situ&#8208;generated oxazolone enolate as a key intermediate, which functions both as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs) has been extensively studied, the development of an inexpensive and facile methodology to incorporate multifunctionality on ATAAs remains challenging. In this article, we present a single&#8208;step radical approach for the modular synthesis of functionally diverse ATAAs.

&lt;p&gt;Reported herein is a highly selective radical cascade-cross-coupling reaction for the modular synthesis of &#945;-tertiary amino acids (ATAA) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal the excited state of an in situ-generated oxazolone enolate as a key intermediate, which functions both as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the synthesis of &#945;-tertiary amino acids (ATAAs) has been extensively studied, the development of an inexpensive and facile methodology to incorporate multifunctionality on ATAAs remains challenging. In this article, we present a single-step radical approach for the modular synthesis of functionally diverse ATAAs. This synthesis takes place under mild conditions with an absence of metals, photocatalysts, and all other additives. We demonstrate the broad applications of this approach on a variety of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, alkenes, 1,3-enynes, and oxazolones. The results prove that our method provides excellent functional group tolerance and late-stage applicability, as well as gram-scale synthesis via flow chemistry. Additionally, we include mechanistic studies which reveal that the excited state of oxazolone enolate upon light excitation is a key intermediate that acts as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CO2 Hydrogenation over Copper/ZnO Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Water&#8208;Promoted Transient Synthesis of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acting as a bridge for hydrogen atoms during CO2 hydrogenation, water facilitates the transformation of relatively stable intermediates for enhancing the activity which in turn produces more water to react with CO via the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. As a result, the yield of methanol is promoted by a suitable amount of water over Cu single atoms on ZnO supports.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of CO2 by renewable power&#8208;generated hydrogen offers a promising approach to a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the role of water during CO2 hydrogenation is still under debate. Herein, we demonstrated that either too low or too high contents of water hampered the methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO based catalysts. For Cu single atoms on ZnO supports, the optimal content of water was 0.11&#8197;vol.&#8201;% under 30&#8197;bar (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;H2=1&#8201;:&#8201;3) at 170&#8201;&#176;C. Upon the introduction of optimal&#8208;content water, the methanol selectivity immediately became 99.1&#8201;%, meanwhile the conversion of CO2 underwent a volcano&#8208;type trend with the maximum of 4.9&#8201;%. According to mechanistic studies, water acted as a bridge between H atoms and CO2/intermediates, facilitating the transformation of COOH* and CH2O*. The enhanced activity induced the generation of more water to react with CO via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, resulting in the increase in methanol selectivity.

The 10H,10&#8242;H&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[acridine] core including moieties featuring two non&#8208;equivalent N&#8208;substituted&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine subunits with different structural and electronic characteristics were designed as HTMs of PSCs. The planar 3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole units based HTM (BSA50) not only exhibits better electronic properties, but also results in better passivating capability for the perovskite trap states via stronger donor ability.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) based on the 10H, 10&#8242;H&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi [acridine] core (BSA50 and BSA51) were synthesized, and their electronic properties were explored. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the presence of rigid 3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in BSA 50 brings about improved hole mobility and higher work function compared to bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amine units in BSA51, which increase interfacial hole transportation from perovskite to HTM. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on BSA50 boost power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 22.65&#8201;%, and a PSC module using BSA50 HTM exhibits a PCE of 21.35&#8201;% (6.5&#215;7&#8197;cm) with a Voc of 8.761&#8197;V and FF of 79.1&#8201;%. The unencapsulated PSCs exhibit superior stability to devices employing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, retaining nearly 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;h operation output. This work demonstrates the high potential of molecularly engineered spirobi[acridine] derivatives as HTMs as replacements for spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.

         <title>Untangling Degradation Chemistries of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Through Interpretable Hybrid Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpretable hybrid machine learning framework is designed for post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion battery (e.g. lithium&#8208;sulfur battery) forecast using lab&#8208;scale battery dataset with compromised quality and tremendous variables. Key knowledge about the complex and dynamic degradation chemistries is extracted to illuminate future battery design and optimization.







Abstract
The development of emerging rechargeable batteries is often hindered by limited chemical understanding composing of entangled patterns in an enormous space. Herein, we propose an interpretable hybrid machine learning framework to untangle intractable degradation chemistries of conversion&#8208;type batteries. Rather than being a black box, this framework not only demonstrates an ability to accurately forecast lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (with a test mean absolute error of 8.9&#8201;% for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life prediction) but also generate useful physical understandings that illuminate future battery design and optimization. The framework also enables the discovery of a previously unknown performance indicator, the ratio of electrolyte amount to high&#8208;voltage&#8208;region capacity at the first discharge, for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries complying practical merits. The present data&#8208;driven approach is readily applicable to other energy storage systems due to its versatility and flexibility in modules and inputs.

         <title>Discovery of a Thioxanthone&#8211;TfOH Complex as a Photoredox Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Alkenes Using p&#8208;Xylene as both Electron and Hydrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic photoredox catalyst was discovered by simply adding a catalytic amount of TfOH as a co&#8208;catalyst to readily available thioxanthone. The new catalyst, 9&#8208;HTXTF, shows a sufficiently long singlet lifetime and adequately strong oxidation potential, as well as relatively facile photoexcitation, with applications in the hydrogenation and deuteration of carbonylated alkenes.







Abstract
Hydrogenation of alkenes is one of the most fundamental transformations in organic synthesis, and widely used in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Although numerous hydrogenation methods have been developed, novel types of catalysis with new mechanisms and new hydrogen sources are still desirable. Thioxanthone (TX) is widely used in energy&#8208;transfer photoreactions, but rarely in photoredox processes. Herein we show that a catalytic amount of TfOH as a co&#8208;catalyst can tune the properties of TX to make it a photoredox catalyst with highly enhanced oxidative capability in the hydrogenation of carbonylated alkenes with the cheap petroleum industrial product p&#8208;xylene serving as the hydrogen source. Deuterium can also be introduced by this method by using D2O as the D source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of using p&#8208;xylene as a hydrogen source.

         <title>Electronic Materials: An Antiaromatic Propeller Made from the Four&#8208;Fold Fusion of Tetraoxa[8]circulene and Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annelating the antiaromatic tetraoxa[8]circulene with four perylenediimide units yields an intensely absorbing and emissive charge&#8208;transfer molecule. The aromatic/antiaromatic character of neutral and charged species and the incorporation in bulk hetero junction solar cell (power conversion efficiency of 6.4&#8201;%) is described.







Abstract
The synthesis of an antiaromatic tetraoxa[8]circulene annulated with four perylene diimides (PDI), giving a dynamic non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, is described. The molecule contains 32 aromatic rings surrounding one formally antiaromatic planarized cyclooctatetraene (COT). The intense absorption (&#1013;=3.35&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in CH2Cl2) and emission bands are assigned to internal charge&#8208;transfer transitions in the combined PDI&#8208;circulene &#960;&#8208;system. The spectroscopic data is supported by density functional theory calculations, and nuclear independent chemical shift calculation indicate that the antiaromatic COT has increased aromaticity in the reduced state. Electrochemical studies show that the compound can reversibly reach the tetra&#8208; and octa&#8208;anionic states by reduction of the four PDI units, and the deca&#8208;anionic state by reduction of the central COT ring. The material functions effectively in bulk hetero junction solar cells as a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, reaching a power conversion efficiency of 6.4&#8201;%.

A pressure&#8208;treatment strategy for achieving high photoluminescence performance in a green&#8208;emitting Tb&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework is reported by Xinyi Yang, Qianrong Fang, Banglin Chen, Bo Zou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202210836). The enhanced hydrogen bonds lock the conjugated configuration, promoting intersystem crossing to effectively drive ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer. The photoluminescence quantum yield increased from 50.6&#8201;% to 90.4&#8201;% for the pressure&#8208;treated MOF.

The arginine degradation pathway of pathogenically crucial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) heme enzyme has been efficiently modeled utilizing synthetic analogs of corresponding reaction components. This model reaction between oxime substrates and heme peroxo intermediates essentially reflects the second mechanistic step of NOS. As reported by Gayan&#8197;B. Wijeratne and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202211521), in&#8208;depth thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanistic interrogations unveil key attributes that closely parallel the enzymatic system, shedding light on some impactful unknowns.

Like a bow , PoFUT2 arms a peptide (arrow) and launches it once glycosylated with the help of a water environment. In their Research Article (e202213610), Ram&#243;n Hurtado&#8208;Guerrero, Pedro Merino, and co&#8208;workers show using QM/MM methods how the enzyme takes advantage of a high exposure of the active site, allowing water molecules to facilitate a pure SN2 mechanism. The synergistic effect of an arginine residue and water molecules facilitates a smooth leaving of the pyrophosphate group.

An antiaromatic molecular propeller acts as a strong electron acceptor, fluorophore, and dye in bulk heterojunction solar cells. In their Research Article (e202212293), Glib&#8197;V. Baryshnikov, Colin Nuckolls, Michael Pittelkow, and co&#8208;workers report how annulation of four perylene diimides to a tetraoxa[8]circulene gives a dynamic non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule with 32 aromatic rings surrounding a central planarized cycloctatetraene. The molecule accepts up to ten electrons, which induces a significant gain of aromaticity.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Free C&#8722;H Activation: Strategic Approaches towards Realizing the Full Potential of C&#8722;H Activation in Sustainable Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of silver additives has enabled many highly valuable synthetic methods in the field of C&#8722;H activation. However, such additives are disadvantageous with respect to sustainability, scalability, and economic considerations. This Review provides a systematic overview of strategic approaches towards developing silver&#8208;free protocols based on the mechanistic role of silver.







Abstract
The activation of carbon&#8722;hydrogen bonds is considered as one of the most attractive techniques in synthetic organic chemistry because it bears the potential to shorten synthetic routes as well as to produce complementary product scopes compared to traditional synthetic strategies. However, many current methods employ silver salts as additives, leading to stoichiometric metal waste and thereby preventing the full potential of C&#8722;H activation to be exploited. Therefore, the development of silver&#8208;free protocols has recently received increasing attention. Mechanistically, silver can serve various roles in C&#8722;H activation and thus, avoiding the use of silver requires different approaches based on the role it serves in a given process. In this Review, we present the comparison of silver&#8208;based and silver&#8208;free methods. Focusing on the strategic approaches to develop silver&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation, we provide the reader with the means to develop sustainable methods for C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>A Highly Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network without Creep: Mission Impossible?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the largest challenges in the design of dynamic covalent networks is to balance reactivity during reprocessing with stability during use. In this Minireview several strategies are highlighted that combine high processability and creep resistance such as latent catalysis, availability of reactive groups, substituents and intrinsic stability of the dynamic bond.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks provide an interesting solution to the challenging recyclability of thermosets and elastomers. One of the remaining design constraints, however, is balancing thermal reprocessability in the form of material flow with dimensional stability during use. As a result, many chemistries are being investigated in order to improve bond reactivity control and material robustness. This Minireview highlights a number of promising concepts, with a particular emphasis on disconnecting chemical reactivity in low and high temperature regimes to obtain creep resistant, yet highly dynamic polymer networks. In addition, we will highlight the impact of sharp reactivity changes when applying extrapolation&#8208;based approaches during rheological analysis. As a result, we are confident that abandoning the myth of &#8220;permanent&#8221; reactivity will aid in the development of sustainable polymeric materials that can truly combine the benefits of thermoplastic and thermoset behaviour.

         <title>Strain Control to Stabilize Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;uniformly distributed tensile strain is likely to present in solution&#8208;processed perovskite thin films, which severely undermines the operational stability of resultant perovskite solar cells. A fundamental understanding and cautious control of residual strain within the perovskites is indispensable to derive stable perovskite materials with designed properties.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are rivaling most commercial photovoltaics in the aspect of efficiency and cost, while their intrinsic instability remains a major concern for their practical deployment. The presence of undesirable strain in PSCs during device fabrication and operation refers to the extension/narrowing of chemical bonds and expansion/shrinkage of lattice volume, which largely affects device stability due to promoted phase transition, chemical decomposition, and mechanical fragility. Pioneering investigations and remarkable achievements have revealed that strain control is indispensable in the design of stable PSCs. Herein, the evolution of strain in perovskite thin films and its effect on device performance is elucidated, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies of strain modulation are systematically reviewed. A thorough understanding and cautious control of the strain&#8208;related phenomenon pave the pathway to derive perovskite materials with desired properties.

         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;element nanoparticles (NPs) consisting of five or more elements often exhibit superior properties, including catalysis, compared with conventional NPs. Therefore, a variety of synthesis methods have recently been studied. In this review, we focus on chemical synthesis of multi&#8208;element NPs based on solution reactions, and discuss synthesis techniques as well as NP characterization and properties.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;element nanoparticles (NPs) consisting of five or more elements have been increasingly studied in the past five years. Their emergence is taking materials science one step further because they exhibit superior properties to those of conventional NPs in a range of respects, including catalysis. This Review focuses on the recent progress in multi&#8208;element NPs regarding synthesis, especially with regard to chemical synthesis, characterization, and properties. We begin with a brief introduction of multi&#8208;element NPs and an overview of their synthesis methods. Then, we present representative examples of multi&#8208;element alloy NPs and ceramic NPs, including oxide NPs prepared by chemical syntheses. This Review intends to provide useful insights into the chemical methods that are used to synthesize multi&#8208;element NPs, and includes a discussion on the possibilities arising from their use in new functional materials.

         <title>Selective Biocatalytic N&#8208;Methylation of Unsaturated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Methylated and &#8208;alkylated unsaturated heterocycles are privileged scaffolds in pharmaceuticals that are often tedious to synthesize. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes can be used to access such molecules through alkylation with high regioselectivity, high yield and on a preparative scale using simple starting materials.







Abstract
Methods for regioselective N&#8208;methylation and &#8208;alkylation of unsaturated heterocycles with &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; reagents are highly sought&#8208;after. This reaction could drastically simplify synthesis of privileged bioactive molecules. Here we report engineered and natural methyltransferases for challenging N&#8208;(m)ethylation of heterocycles, including benzimidazoles, benzotriazoles, imidazoles and indazoles. The reactions are performed through a cyclic enzyme cascade that consists of two methyltransferases using only iodoalkanes or methyl tosylate as simple reagents. This method enables the selective synthesis of important molecules that are otherwise difficult to access, proceeds with high regioselectivity (r.r. up to &gt;99&#8201;%), yield (up to 99&#8201;%), on a preparative scale, and with nearly equimolar concentrations of simple starting materials.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Addition of N&#8208;unprotected Propargylic Amines to Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>

Despite the very low acidity of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds (pKa&#8776;42.6), direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones has been achieved by using a chiral pyridoxal as the carbonyl catalyst, producing a broad variety of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Direct asymmetric functionalization of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines is a big challenge in organic chemistry, due to the low acidity (pKa&#8776;42.6) of the &#945; C&#8722;H bonds and interruption of the nucleophilic NH2 group. By using a chiral pyridoxal as carbonyl catalyst, we have successfully realized direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones, producing a broad range of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in 54&#8211;84&#8201;% yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee). The &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of propargylic amines are greatly activated by the pyridoxal catalyst via the formation of an imine intermediate, resulting in the increase of acidity by up to 1022&#8197;times (from pKa&#8197;42.6 to pKa&#8197;20.1), which become acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions for the asymmetric addition. This work presented an impressive example for asymmetric functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds enabled by an organocatalyst.

         <title>Cross &#946; Amyloid Nanotubes Demonstrate Promiscuous Catalysis in a Chemical Reaction Network via Co&#8208;option</title>

The promiscuous competencies of cross &#946; nanotubes were shown towards a reaction network with three orthogonal transformations that are connected via co&#8208;option, underpinning the important roles of short amyloids as earliest enzymatic folds.







Abstract
In Darwin's warm pond rich with nutrients, lesser number of early catalytic machineries with modest capabilities were able to demonstrate promiscuity by catalyzing diverse biochemical transformations important for protometabolism. Herein, we report catalytically promiscuous amyloid&#8208;based short peptide assemblies that could concomitantly catalyse three metabolically important yet orthogonal reactions. The surface exposed catalytic dyads featuring lysines and imidazoles were utilized for C=N condensation via dynamic covalent linkages and modulation of protonation events, respectively. Further, the peptide assemblies could promiscuously catalyse hydrolysis as well as retro&#8208;aldol reactions, that could be co&#8208;opted to facilitate C=N bond formation, either by a feedforward&#8208;driven reaction network or by replenishing depleted substrates. The catalytic diversity of short peptide based promiscuous &#946;&#8208;sheet folds suggests their possible role in promoting the protometabolic network in early earth.

         <title>Expansion of the Catalytic Repertoire of Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Plant Metabolism
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medium chain alcohol dehydrogenases usually perform a reversible 1,2&#8208;reduction of aldehydes to form the corresponding alcohols. Here we show how the active site of these dehydrogenases can be modified to perform 1,2&#8208;reduction of iminium moieties, as well 1,4&#8208;reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminium groups and 1,4&#8208;reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) comprise a highly conserved enzyme family that catalyse the reversible reduction of aldehydes. However, recent discoveries in plant natural product biosynthesis suggest that the catalytic repertoire of ADHs has been expanded. Here we report the crystal structure of dihydroprecondylocarpine acetate synthase (DPAS), an ADH that catalyses the non&#8208;canonical 1,4&#8208;reduction of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminium moiety. Comparison with structures of plant&#8208;derived ADHs suggest the 1,4&#8208;iminium reduction does not require a proton relay or the presence of a catalytic zinc ion in contrast to canonical 1,2&#8208;aldehyde reducing ADHs that require the catalytic zinc and a proton relay. Furthermore, ADHs that catalysed 1,2&#8208;iminium reduction required the presence of the catalytic zinc and the loss of the proton relay. This suggests how the ADH active site can be modified to perform atypical carbonyl reductions, providing insight into how chemical reactions are diversified in plant metabolism.

The speed synchronization of two slider&#8208;on&#8208;deck systems, each activating a catalytic unit through circular motion, leads to synergistic effects in the catalytic turnover of a double catalysis.







Abstract
The heteroleptic multi&#8208;component double slider&#8208;on&#8208;deck system DS3 exhibits tight coupling of motional speed of two distinct nano&#8208;circular sliders (k298=77 and 41&#8197;kHz) despite a 2.2&#8197;nm separation. In comparison, the single sliders in DS1 and DS2 move at vastly different speed (k298=1.1 vs. 350&#8197;kHz). Synchronization of the motions in DS3 remains even when one slows the movement of the faster slider using small molecular brake pads. In contrast to the individual DS1 and DS2 systems, DS3 is a powerful catalyst for a two&#8208;step reaction by using the motion of both sliders to drive two catalytic processes.

         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic benzylation with 2&#8208;methylbenzophenone derivatives under light irradiation is described. The corresponding nucleophilic photoenols generated under light irradiation, enabled the reaction to take place in reasonable yields (up to 77&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, without the need for strong bases, or pre&#8208;decoration of the substrates.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic benzylation of aryl vinyl carbinols under light irradiation is described. 2&#8208;Methylbenzophenone derivatives are employed and activated to hydroxy&#8208;o&#8208;quinodimethanes by an ultraviolet (UV) light. This approach enables asymmetric allylic benzylation with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) from readily available 2&#8208;methylbenzophenones without the utilization of strong bases, and pre&#8208;activation or pre&#8208;functionalization of the substrates. Moreover, deuterium experiments reveal the generation of nucleophilic benzyl species from 2&#8208;methylbenzophenone under UV irradiation.

&lt;p&gt;An iridium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic benzylation of aryl vinyl carbinols under light irradiation is described. 2-Methylbenzophenone derivatives are employed and activated to hydroxy-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-quinodimethanes by an ultraviolet (UV) light. This approach enables asymmetric allylic benzylation with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) from readily available 2-methylbenzophenones without the utilization of strong bases, and pre-activation or pre-functionalization of the substrates. Moreover, deuterium experiments reveal the generation of nucleophilic benzyl species from 2-methylbenzophenone under UV irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of CuMn Prussian Blue Analog Double&#8208;Shelled Nanoboxes Toward Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;PBA double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs) are rationally designed and fabricated through efficient tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches. Benefiting from the distinctive hollow structures, Cu substitution, and Mn vacancies, the CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs electrode shows improved Zn ion storage properties with high reversible capacity, impressive rate capability, and superior cycling stability.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising candidates for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to their unique open&#8208;framework structures. However, they suffer from limited capacity and severe capacity decay originating from insufficient redox sites and structural instability. Herein, Cu&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;PBA double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs) prepared by tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches are demonstrated for efficient Zn ion storage. The unique hollow structures can expose abundant active sites and alleviate the volume change during the cycling test. Moreover, partial Cu substitution and induced Mn vacancies might inhibit the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions of Mn&#8208;N6 octahedra, thus contributing to the prolonged lifespan. As a result, CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs exhibit high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage mechanism of CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs mainly involves the reversible redox reactions of transition metals and Zn2+ ion insertion/extraction processes.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, 2&#8208;chlorothioxanthone (2&#8208;CTX) triplet energy sensitization of simple acrylamides enables facile access to a diverse range of &#946;&#8208;lactam products. The reaction proceeds through triplet sensitization of the C&#8722;C olefin moiety and features a C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization through a biradical carbon&#8208;to&#8208;carbon 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. The proposed mechanism is supported by deuterium labelling experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>An Ultraviolet Fluorophore with Narrowed Emission via Coplanar Molecular Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coplanar strategy using indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ) simultaneously achieves narrowed emission and ultraviolet (UV) emission in fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and a synthetic shortcut is carried out to efficiently obtain the target coplanar ICZ derivatives. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) shows UV emission with peaks below 400&#8197;nm and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) both in photoluminescence and electroluminescence, achieving best results among fluorescent UV&#8208;OLEDs.







Abstract
Narrowband emitting fluorophores exhibit immense potentials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, it's still hard to simultaneously realize short&#8208;wavelength ultraviolet (UV) or near ultraviolet emission (NUV) while maintaining a narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) value, and rare work focus on such challenging pursuit. Herein, an ingenious synthetic method was devised to achieve emitters with coplanar structure. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) was designed to realize narrowed UV emission both in photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) which benefited from the suppression of vibronic coupling. UV/NUV OLEDs based on ICZ&#8208;TAZ achieve external quantum efficiency (EQE) maximums of 3.26&#8201;% peaks @ 388&#8197;nm and 4.02&#8201;% peaks @ 406&#8197;nm with small FWHM of 32&#8197;nm and 46&#8197;nm, respectively, corresponding with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off at luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Photoresponsive Dissipative Macrocycles Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of fluorinated, visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable azobenzenes in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, enabled the creation of a library of macrocyclic compounds that include highly strained, metastable, and dissipative systems. These studies give a detailed insight into photoresponsive dissipative systems and the vast potential of using azobenzenes in dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium. We studied a fluorinated azobenzene building block that reliably undergoes geometric isomerism upon irradiation. The building block was used in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, to create a library of imine macrocycles. Whereas the simple amine can be used to access a polymeric state and a defined bowl&#8208;shaped macrocycle, the chiral amine gives access to a rich network of macrocycles that undergo both isomerisation as well as interconversion between different macrocyclic species, thereby allowing for control over the number of monomers involved in the cyclo&#8208;oligomerization; 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy were used to study the processes.

Radical addition to the dehydroalanine (Dha) residue of a peptide could diversify the peptide sequence with noncanonical residues, but this strategy is currently limited by the lack of control over the stereochemistry. This work addresses this important challenge by applying chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselective radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides.







Abstract
Radical addition to dehydroalanine (Dha) represents an appealing, modular strategy to access non&#8208;canonical peptide analogues for drug discovery. Prior studies on radical addition to the Dha residue of peptides and proteins have demonstrated outstanding functional group compatibility, but the lack of stereoselectivity has limited the synthetic utility of this approach. Herein, we address this challenge by employing chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselectivity of radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides. The conditions accommodate a variety of primary and secondary electrophiles to introduce polyethylene glycol, biotin, halo&#8208;tag, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains to the peptide. The reaction features catalyst control to largely override substrate&#8208;based control of stereochemical outcome for modification of short peptides. We anticipate that the discovery of chiral nickel complexes that confer catalyst control will allow rapid, late&#8208;stage modification of peptides featuring nonnatural sidechains.

         <title>Transient Stabilization Effect of CO2 in the Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Azo Compounds and the Reductive Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new transient stabilization effect (TSE) of CO2 is identified and applied to the electrochemical hydrogenation of azo compounds and the reductive coupling of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. The TSE influence of CO2 means that overactive intermediates can be captured by CO2 to prevent their decomposition or side reaction to complete the synthesis that is difficult to achieve by direct means. The CO2 can be released later through a decarboxylation process.







Abstract
The carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and utilization has attracted a great attention in organic synthesis. Herein, an unpresented transient stabilization effect (TSE) of CO2 is disclosed and well applied to the electrochemical hydrogenation of azo compounds to hydrazine derivatives. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies imply that CO2 can capture azo radical anion intermediates to protect the hydrogenation from potential degradation reactions, and is finally released through decarboxylation. The promotion effect of CO2 was further demonstrated to work in the preliminary study of electrochemical reductive coupling of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters to vicinal diol derivatives. For the electrochemical reductive reactions mentioned above, CO2 is indispensable. The presented results shed light on a different usage of CO2 and could inspire novel experimental design by using CO2 as a transient protecting group.

         <title>A Broadband, Multiplexed&#8208;Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Transport in Composite Flexible&#8208;Organic&#8208;Crystal Waveguide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical integration of three optically different flexible crystal waveguides produces a compact organic wavelength division multiplexer (WDM). This WDM merges three narrow&#8208;band optical signals (blue, cyan, and yellow) to transmit a broadband visible light signal. Such wide bandwidth signal multiplexers open the doors to visible light communication (VLC) technologies.







Abstract
We report the construction of an organic crystal multiplexer using three chemically and optically different acicular, flexible organic crystals for a broadband, visible light signal transportation. The mechanical integration of a highly flexible crystal waveguide of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(7&#8208;methoxybenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acrylonitrile (BTD2CF3) displaying bright yellow (&#955;1) fluorescence with blue&#8208;emitting (&#955;2) BPP and cyan emitting (&#955;3) DBA crystals using AFM&#8208;tip provides a composite organic crystal multiplexer. The constructed hybrid single crystal multiplexer effectively transduces three optical signals (&#955;1+&#955;2+&#955;3) covering the 420&#8211;750&#8197;nm region as a composite output signal. The presented proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle experiment demonstrates the real potential of organic flexible crystal waveguides for visible light communication technologies.

         <title>Nitrene&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Oxygenation: Catalytic Enantioselective Formation of Five&#8208;Membered Cyclic Organic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the synthesis of non&#8208;racemic cyclic carbonates from abundant alcohol feedstocks is presented. The method exploits an unusual nitrene&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H oxygenation via a proposed 1,7&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT).







Abstract
The synthesis of non&#8208;racemic 5&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates from abundant alcohols is reported. Conversion of the alcohol into an azanyl carbonate is followed by a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalyzed cyclization to provide chiral cyclic carbonates in yields of up to 95&#8201;% and with up to 99&#8201;% ee. This new synthetic method is proposed to proceed through a nitrene&#8208;mediated intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H oxygenation which includes an unusual 1,7&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer within a ruthenium nitrene intermediate. The method is applicable to the synthesis of non&#8208;racemic chiral mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted cyclic alkylene carbonates.

         <title>Fluorinated Tetraarylethenes: Universal Tags for the Synthesis of Solid State Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method for the coupling of fluorinated tetraarylethens to a wide range of substrates is described. The approach allows converting amino acids, bioactive compounds, carbohydrates, steroids, and polymers in one step into solid state luminogens.







Abstract
The aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties of tetraarylethenes (TAEs) have led to numerous applications in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Herein, we describe two fluorinated tetraarylethenes, which can be employed as universal tags for the synthesis of solid state luminogens. The tags are accessible in one or two steps from commercially available starting materials. Facile coupling reactions with ubiquitous substrates such as thiols, alcohols, amines, phosphines, aldehydes, and enamines allow preparing a wide range of TAE conjugates, including tagged amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, steroids, and commercial polymers.

         <title>pH Dependence of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Assembly Kinetics: Unravelling the Microscopic Molecular Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Globally fitting different kinetic models of fibril formation, over a range of pHs, reveals the key microscopic molecular processes of amyloid assembly. Primary nucleation is driven by a loss of net charge, while surprisingly, both secondary nucleation and elongation rates are independent of pH.







Abstract
Central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the assembly of the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide (A&#946;) into fibrils. A reduction in pH accompanying inflammation or subcellular compartments, may accelerate fibril formation as the pH approaches A&#946;&#8217;s isoelectric point (pI). Using global fitting of fibril formation kinetics over a range of pHs, we identify the impact net charge has on individual fibril assembly microscopic rate constants. We show that the primary nucleation has a strong pH dependence. The titration behaviour exhibits a mid&#8208;point or pKa of 7.0, close to the pKa of A&#946; histidine imidazoles. Surprisingly, both the secondary nucleation and elongation rate constants are pH independent. This indicates the charge of A&#946;, in particular histidine protonation, has little impact on this stage of A&#946; assembly. These fundamental processes are key to understanding the forces that drive the assembly of A&#946; into toxic oligomers and fibrils.

&lt;p&gt;Globally fitting different kinetic models of fibril formation, over a range of pHs, reveals the key microscopic molecular processes of amyloid assembly. Primary nucleation is driven by a loss of net charge, while surprisingly, both secondary nucleation and elongation rates are independent of pH.

         <dc:description>Allylamines are important building blocks in the synthesis of bioactive compounds. The direct coupling of allylic C&#8722;H bonds and commonly available amines is a major synthetic challenge. An allylic C&#8208;H amination of 1,4&#8208;dienes has been accomplished by palladium catalysis. With aromatic amines, branch&#8208;selective allylic aminations are favored to generate thermodynamically unstable Z&#8208;allylamines. In addition, more basic aliphatic cyclic amines can also engage in the reaction, but linear dienyl allylic amines are the major products.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Aerobic Nitrogen Photooxidation on Titania through In Situ Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic characterization and computational simulations were employed to elucidate the role of O2 in promoting N2 dissociation through a low&#8208;energy pathway evolving from *OxNy to an *ON intermediate. A TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited outstanding N2 photofixation performance with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;nitrate energy conversion efficiency up to 0.13&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nitrate is an important raw material for chemical fertilizers, but it is industrially manufactured in multiple steps at high temperature and pressure, urgently motivating the design of a green and sustainable strategy for nitrate production. We report the photosynthesis of nitrate from N2 and O2 on commercial TiO2 in a flow reactor under ambient conditions. The TiO2 photocatalyst offered a high nitrate yield of 1.85&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 as well as a solar&#8208;to&#8208;nitrate energy conversion efficiency up to 0.13&#8201;%. We combined reactivity and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to elucidate the mechanism of nitrate formation and unveil the special role of O2 in N&#8801;N bond dissociation. The mechanistic insight into charge&#8208;involved N2 oxidation was further demonstrated by in situ transient absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance. This work exhibits the mechanistic origin of N2 photooxidation and initiates a potential method for triggering inert catalytic reactions.

         <title>Durable Nickel&#8208;Iron (Oxy)hydroxide Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts through Surface Functionalization with Tetraphenylporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe dissolution is the major deactivation mechanism of Nickel&#8208;Iron (oxy)hydroxide in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. The water molecule hydrates eluted Fe that easily escape from the double layer. Surface immobilization of tetraphenylporphyrin forms a nonpolar layer that suppresses the penetration of Fe without interrupting the activity. This increases the fraction of Fe redeposition onto the electrode and maintains an active site population.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;based oxides are one of the best&#8208;known active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Unfortunately, they rapidly lost performance in Fe&#8208;purified KOH during the reaction. Herein, tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) was loaded on a catalyst/electrolyte interface to alleviate the destabilization of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide. We propose that the degradation occurs primarily due to the release of thermodynamically unstable Fe. TPP acts as a protective layer and suppresses the dissolution of hydrated metal at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. In the electric double layer, the nonpolar TPP layer on the NiFe surface also invigorates the redeposition of the active site, Fe, which leads to prolonging the lifetime of NiFe. The TPP&#8208;coated NiFe was demonstrated in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, where hydrogen was generated at a rate of 126&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1 for 115&#8197;h at a 1.41&#8197;mV&#8201;h&#8722;1 degradation rate. Consequently, TPP is a promising protective layer that could stabilize oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.

     alt="Durable Nickel-Iron (Oxy)hydroxide Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts through Surface Functionalization with Tetraphenylporphyrin"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fe dissolution is the major deactivation mechanism of Nickel-Iron (oxy)hydroxide in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. The water molecule hydrates eluted Fe that easily escape from the double layer. Surface immobilization of tetraphenylporphyrin forms a nonpolar layer that suppresses the penetration of Fe without interrupting the activity. This increases the fraction of Fe redeposition onto the electrode and maintains an active site population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NiFe-based oxides are one of the best-known active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Unfortunately, they rapidly lost performance in Fe-purified KOH during the reaction. Herein, tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) was loaded on a catalyst/electrolyte interface to alleviate the destabilization of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide. We propose that the degradation occurs primarily due to the release of thermodynamically unstable Fe. TPP acts as a protective layer and suppresses the dissolution of hydrated metal at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. In the electric double layer, the nonpolar TPP layer on the NiFe surface also invigorates the redeposition of the active site, Fe, which leads to prolonging the lifetime of NiFe. The TPP-coated NiFe was demonstrated in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, where hydrogen was generated at a rate of 126&#8197;L&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for 115&#8197;h at a 1.41&#8197;mV&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; degradation rate. Consequently, TPP is a promising protective layer that could stabilize oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioconjugation via Hetero&#8208;Selective Clamping of Two Different Amines with ortho&#8208;Phthalaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino groups are common in both natural and synthetic compounds and offer a very attractive class of endogenous handles for bioconjugation. However, the ability to differentiate two types of amino groups and join them with high hetero&#8208;selectivity and efficiency in a complex setting remains elusive. Herein, we report a new method for bioconjugation via one&#8208;pot chemoselective clamping of two different amine nucleophiles using a simple ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent. Various &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl amines, and secondary amines can be crosslinked to the &#949;&#8208;amino side chain of lysine on peptides or proteins with high efficiency and hetero&#8208;selectivity. This method offers a simple and powerful means to crosslink small molecule drugs, imaging probes, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, and even virus particles without any pre&#8208;functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB Upconversion, Solvent Sensitization and Challenging Bond Activation Enabled by a Benzene&#8208;Based Annihilator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several energy&#8208;demanding photoreactions require harsh UV light from inefficient light sources. The conversion of low&#8208;energy visible light to high&#8208;energy singlet states via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) could offer a solution for driving such reactions under mild conditions. We present the first annihilator with an emission maximum in the UVB region that, combined with an organic sensitizer, is suitable for blue&#8208;to&#8208;UV upconversion. The annihilator singlet was successfully employed as an energy donor in subsequent FRET activations of aliphatic carbonyls. This hitherto unreported UC&#8208;FRET reaction sequence was directly monitored using laser spectroscopy and applied to mechanistic irradiation experiments demonstrating the feasibility of Norrish chemistry. Our results provide clear evidence for a novel blue light&#8208;driven substrate or solvent activation strategy, which is important in the context of developing more sustainable light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutralizing the Impact of the Virulence Factor LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa on Human Cells with New Glycomimetic Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation and host cell invasion of the ESKAPE pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa require the tetravalent lectins LecA and LecB, which are therefore drug targets to fight these infections. Recently, we have reported highly potent divalent galactosides as specific LecA inhibitors. However, they suffered from very low solubility and an intrinsic chemical instability due to two acylhydrazone motifs, which precluded further biological evaluation. Here, we isosterically substituted the acylhydrazones and systematically varied linker identity and length between the two galactosides necessary for LecA binding. The optimized divalent LecA ligands showed improved stability and were up to 5000&#8208;fold more soluble. Importantly, these properties now enabled their biological characterization. The lead compound L2 potently inhibited LecA binding to lung epithelial cells, restored wound closure in a scratch assay and reduced the invasiveness of P. aeruginosa into host cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Reshaping the 2&#8208;Pyrone Synthase Active Site for Chemoselective Biosynthesis of Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering enzymes with novel reactivity and applying them in metabolic pathways to produce valuable products are quite challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of metabolic networks and the need for high in vivo catalytic efficiency. Triacetic acid lactone (TAL), naturally generated by 2&#8208;pyrone synthase (2PS), is a platform molecule that can be produced via microbial fermentation and further converted into value&#8208;added products. However, these conversions require extra synthetic steps under harsh conditions. We herein report a biocatalytic system for direct generation of TAL derivatives under mild conditions with controlled chemoselectivity by rationally engineering the 2PS active site and then rewiring the biocatalytic pathway in the metabolic network of E. coli to produce high&#8208;value products, such as kavalactone precursors, with yields up to 17 mg/L culture. Computer modeling indicates sterics and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions play key roles in tuning the selectivity, efficiency and yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Inlaying Bismuth Nanoparticles on Graphene Nanosheets by Chemical Bond for Ultralong&#8208;lifespan Aqueous Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) are rising as an important alternative to lithium ion batteries, owing to their safety and low cost. Metal anodes show a high theoretical capacity and nonselective hydrated ion insertion for ASIBs, yet their large volume expansion and sluggish reaction kinetics resulted in poor electrochemical stability. Herein, we demonstrate an electrode cyclability enhancement mechanism by inlaying bismuth (Bi) nanoparticles on graphene nanosheets through chemical bond, which is achieved by a unique laser induced compounding method. This anchored metal&#8208;graphene heterostructure can effectively mitigate volume variation, and accelerate the kinetic capability as the active Bi can be exposed to the electrolyte. Our method can achieve a reversible capacity of 122 mAh g&#8208;1 at a large current density of 4 A g&#8208;1 for over 9500 cycles. This finding offers a desirable structural design of other metal anodes for aqueous energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interactions characteristic of the encapsulation of metal particles by oxide overlayers have been widely observed on large metal nanoparticles, but scarcely occur on small nanoclusters (&#706;2 nm) for which the metal&#8208;support interactions remain elusive.

The Pt nanoclusters start to partially evolve into a CsCl&#8208;type PtTi intermetallic compound when the reduction temperature reaches 400 &#8451;. Upon 700 &#176;C reduction, the PtTi nanoparticles are exclusively formed and grow epitaxially&#160;along the TiO2 (101) crystal faces. The thermodynamics of the formation of PtTi via migration of reduced Ti atoms into Pt cluster is unraveled by theoretical calculations. The thermally stable PtTi intermetallic compound, with single&#8208;atom Pt isolated by Ti, exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and promoted catalytic durability for CO oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Charged Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with High Volume Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework nanosheets (COF&#8208;NSs) are emerging building blocks for functional materials, and their scalable fabrication is highly desirable. Current synthetic methods suffer from low volume yields resulting from confined on&#8208;surface/at&#8208;interface growth space and complex multiple&#8208;phase synthesis systems. Herein, we report the synthesis of charged COF&#8208;NSs in open space using a single&#8208;phase organic solution system, achieving magnitudes higher volume yields of up to 18.7 mg mL  &#8208;1  . Charge&#8208;induced electrostatic repulsion forces enable in&#8208;plane anisotropic secondary growth from initial discrete and disordered polymers into large and crystalline COF&#8208;NSs. The charged COF&#8208;NS colloidal suspensions are cast into thin and compact proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with lamellar morphology and oriented crystallinity, displaying outstanding proton conductivity, negligible dimensional swelling, and good H  2  /O  2  fuel cell performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanoredox Catalysis Enables a Sustainable and Versatile Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable synthesis of macromolecules with control over sequence and molar mass remains a challenge in polymer chemistry. By coupling mechanochemistry and electron&#8208;transfer processes (i.e., mechanoredox catalysis), an energy&#8208;conscious controlled radical polymerization methodology is realized. This work explores an efficient mechanoredox reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization process using mechanical stimuli by implementing piezoelectric barium titanate and a diaryliodonium initiator with minimal solvent usage. This mechanoredox RAFT process demonstrates exquisite control over poly(meth)acrylate dispersity and chain length while also showcasing an alternative to the solution&#8208;state synthesis of semifluorinated polymers that typically utilize exotic solvents and/or reagents. This chemistry will find utility in the sustainable development of materials across the energy, biomedical, and engineering communities.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Upcycling of Conventional Polyureas into Dynamic Covalent Poly(aminoketoenamide)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical upcycling of polymers is an emerging strategy to transform post&#8208;consumer waste into higher&#8208;value chemicals and materials. However, on account of the high stability of the chemical bonds that constitute their main chains, the chemical modification of many polymers proves to be difficult. Here, we report a versatile approach for the upcycling of linear and cross&#8208;linked polyureas, which are widely used because of their high chemical stability. The treatment of&#160; these polymers or their composites with acetylacetone affords di&#8208;vinylogous amide&#8208;terminated compounds in good yield. These products can be reacted with aromatic isocyanates, and the resulting aminoketoenamide bonds are highly dynamic at elevated temperatures. We show here that this conversion scheme can be exploited for the preparation of dynamic covalent poly(amino&#173;keto&#173;en&#173;amide) networks, which are healable and reprocessable through thermal treatment without any catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Synthesis of Pyridyl Ethers by BiV&#8208;Mediated O&#8208;Arylation of Pyridones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that sterically&#8208; and electronically&#8208;diverse pyridyl ethers can be accessed via BiV&#8208;mediated C&#8722;O coupling of 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;pyridones with arylboronic acids. Use of a bismacyclic reagent not only confers modularity on our methodology, but also results in highly regioselective O&#8208;arylation that is unprecedented for BiV.







Abstract
We report that O&#8208;selective arylation of 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;pyridones with arylboronic acids is affected by a modular, bismacycle&#8208;based system. The utility of this umpolung approach to pyridyl ethers, which is complementary to conventional methods based on SNAr or cross&#8208;coupling, is demonstrated through the concise synthesis of Ki6783 and picolinafen, and the formal synthesis of cabozantib and golvatinib. Computational investigations reveal that arylation proceeds in a concerted fashion via a 5&#8208;membered transition state. The kinetically&#8208;controlled regioselectivity for O&#8208;arylation&#8212;which is reversed relative to previous BiV&#8208;mediated pyridone arylations&#8212;is attributed primarily to the geometric constraints imposed by the bismacyclic scaffold.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Hofmeister Anion Selectivity via a Mechanical Bond Effect in Neutral Halogen&#8208;Bonding [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral XB [2]rotaxanes containing remarkably potent XB axle components including a novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif are constructed via a discrete chloride anion template directed synthesis. Quantitative 1H NMR halide anion titration studies in competitive aqueous&#8208;organic solvent mixtures reveal the XB [2]rotaxanes display pronounced anti&#8208;Hofmeister halide anion recognition selectivity for chloride over iodide.







Abstract
Exceptionally strong halogen bonding (XB) donor&#8208;chloride interactions are exploited for the chloride anion template synthesis of neutral XB [2]rotaxane host systems which contain perfluoroaryl&#8208;functionalised axle components, including a remarkably potent novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif. Halide anion recognition properties in aqueous&#8208;organic media, determined via extensive 1H NMR halide anion titration experiments, reveal the rotaxane host systems exhibit dramatically enhanced affinities for hydrophilic Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, but conversely diminished affinities for hydrophobic I&#8722;, relative to their non&#8208;interlocked axle counterparts. Crucially, this mechanical bond effect induces a binding selectivity which directly opposes Hofmeister bias. Free&#8208;energy analysis of this mechanical bond enhancement demonstrates anion recognition by neutral XB interlocked host systems as a rare and general strategy to engineer anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias anion selectivity in synthetic receptor design.

         <title>Organic Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery: Planar, &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Quinone&#8208;Based Polymer Endows Ultrafast Ion Diffusion Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) with large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system has been successfully designed and synthesized via a condensation polymerization strategy. Its high molecular planarity originated from &#960;&#8208;conjugated PPPA chains results in ultrafast Zn2+ ion diffusion kinetics. Such a planar configuration with reducing energy gap also effectively accelerates intramolecular electron transfer during charge/discharge process.







Abstract
A novel poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) has been successfully designed and synthesized via a condensation polymerization strategy as promising cathode material in organic zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), FTIR and XPS characterizations verify a reversible Zn2+&#8208;coordination mechanism in our PPPA cathode. Intriguingly, an ultrahigh Zn2+ diffusion coefficient of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 was found in this large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, which is the highest one among all organic cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Theoretical calculations reveal the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated plane in our PPPA sample results in a significant reduction on energy gap, effectively accelerating intramolecular electron transfer during charge/discharge process. Our finding provides insights to achieve high zinc&#8208;ion transport kinetics by a design strategy on planar polymer system.

         <title>Increasing the Distance of Adjacent Palladium Atoms for Configuration Matching in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance of adjacent Pd atoms is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated to be significant for defining the reaction pathways for selective hydrogenation processes exemplified by acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation here. Increasing the distance favors the formation of ethylene while restrains those of byproducts due to the simultaneously promoted C2H4 desorption and destabilized transition state of C2H3* coupling.







Abstract
Precisely tailoring the distance between adjacent metal sites to match adsorption configurations of key species for the targeted reaction pathway is a great challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on the atomically sites&#8208;tailored pathway in Pd&#8208;catalyzed acetylene hydrogenation, i.e., increasing the distance of adjacent Pd atoms (dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd) for configuration matching in acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation against coupling. dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd is identified as a structural descriptor for describing the competitiveness for reaction pathways, and the increased dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd prefers the semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway due to simultaneously promoted C2H4 desorption and the destabilized transition state of the C2H3* coupling. Spectroscopic, kinetics and electronic structure studies reveal that increasing dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd to 3.31&#8197;&#197; delivers superior selectivity and stability due to energy matching and appropriate hybridization of Pd 4d with In 2s and, especially, 2p orbitals.

         <title>Photochemical Mechanisms of Fluorophores Employed in Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single molecule localization microscopy has revolutionized our ability to investigate cellular structures and processes at the nanometer scale. This Review discusses the photochemical mechanisms harnessed to develop small&#8208;molecule probes that exhibit photoswitching properties necessary for application in imaging methods based on single&#8208;molecule localization. Strategies to develop improved photoswitchable probes and future directions are also discussed.







Abstract
Decoding cellular processes requires visualization of the spatial distribution and dynamic interactions of biomolecules. It is therefore not surprising that innovations in imaging technologies have facilitated advances in biomedical research. The advent of super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies has empowered biomedical researchers with the ability to answer long&#8208;standing questions about cellular processes at an entirely new level. Fluorescent probes greatly enhance the specificity and resolution of super&#8208;resolution imaging experiments. Here, we introduce key super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies, with a brief discussion on single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We evaluate the chemistry and photochemical mechanisms of fluorescent probes employed in SMLM. This Review provides guidance on the identification and adoption of fluorescent probes in single molecule localization microscopy to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation fluorescent probes amenable to single&#8208;molecule imaging.

         <title>Optimal Dihedral Angle in Twisted Donor&#8211;Acceptor Organic Emitters for Maximized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physical origin of the optimal dihedral angle of &#8776;80&#176; in twisted donor&#8211;acceptor organic emitters for maximized TADF is deduced and an effective design strategy for efficient TADF emitters is proposed, which provides help for the molecular design and screening of high&#8208;efficiency TADF materials.







Abstract
The twisted donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) organic formwork with a large dihedral angle (&#952;DA) is usually adopted to narrow the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap for obtaining excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, the dependence of overall TADF properties on &#952;DA has not been systematically investigated to this day. Taking new designed CzBP, CzBP&#8208;1M and CzBP&#8208;2M via introducing methyl as investigated models, it is found that (i) with increasing &#952;DA, the charge transfer component in S1 is larger than that in T1 in varying degrees, leading to non&#8208;monotonic spin&#8208;orbit couplings; (ii) the electron&#8208;vibration couplings between S1 and T1 states become the largest when &#952;DA approaching 80&#176;, facilitating phonon&#8208;driven up&#8208;conversion; (iii) the overall TADF rate reaches a peak at &#952;DA&#8776;80&#176;. By this, the TADF on/off switching is realized via methyl moiety for regulating &#952;DA from theoretical prediction to experimental confirmation. Importantly, the &#952;DA near 80&#176; would be a good descriptor for screening excellent D&#8208;A type TADF emitters.

&lt;sub&gt;DA&lt;/sub&gt; approaching 80&#176;, facilitating phonon-driven up-conversion; (iii) the overall TADF rate reaches a peak at &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;80&#176;. By this, the TADF on/off switching is realized via methyl moiety for regulating &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DA&lt;/sub&gt; from theoretical prediction to experimental confirmation. Importantly, the &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DA&lt;/sub&gt; near 80&#176; would be a good descriptor for screening excellent D-A type TADF emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imines as Super Nucleophiles in Catalytic Couplings of Amides with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (mNHI) based superbases are introduced in this work. The mNHIs were utilized as metal&#8208;free catalysts in transformations using CO2 for the coupling of amides.







Abstract
An extended class of stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (mNHIs), containing a highly polarized exocyclic imine moiety, were synthesized. The calculated proton affinities (PA) and experimentally determined Tolman electronic parameters (TEPs) reveal that these synthesized mNHIs have the highest basicity and donor ability among NHIs reported so far. The superior nucleophilicity of newly designed mNHIs was utilized in devising a strategy to incorporate CO2 as a bridging unit under reductive conditions to couple inert primary amides. This strategy was further extended to hetero&#8208;couplings between amide and amine using CO2. These hitherto unknown catalytic transformations were introduced in the diversification of various biologically active drug molecules under metal&#8208;free conditions. The underlying mechanism was explored by performing a series of control experiments, characterizing key intermediates using spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough and Recyclable Ionogels Constructed by Coordinated Supramolecular Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;tough and recyclable ionogels are constructed by physical cross&#8208;linking of coordinated supramolecular solvents and linear polymer segments. The solvents in ionogels function as 3D supramolecular networks, which provide strong mechanical support for ionogels.







Abstract
The mechanical properties of most hydrogels (ionogels) are considerably affected by covalently cross&#8208;linked networks. However, the interactions between solvent/solvent molecules and solvent/polymer chains are usually ignored. Herein, a series of ultra&#8208;tough ionogels were prepared via a supramolecular solvent, halometallate ionic liquid, in which cations and coordinating anions form a 3D supramolecular network. The linear polymer chains are physically cross&#8208;linked with supramolecular solvents synergistically enhancing the strength (14.3&#8197;MPa), toughness (78&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), and Young's modulus (55&#8197;MPa) of ionogels, effectively dispersing the stress concentration under load, and obtaining better fatigue resistance and higher fracture energy (198&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2). Furthermore, the reversible cross&#8208;linking enables green recovery and recycling of ionogels, simply by water. This strategy shows broad applicability based on a variety of supramolecular solvents and coordinatable polymers.

         <title>Thermally Stable Polymer&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Safe Lithium Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high reactivity of lithium metal against electrolytes is tamed by introducing polymer&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase in situ upon lithium anode. The fluorine&#8208;rich and hydrogen&#8208;free polymer provides both high thermal and electrochemical stability, enhancing the safety and lifespan of lithium&#8208;LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch. The &#8220;ignition&#8221; temperature of the battery can be increased to 338.0&#8201;&#176;C benefiting from excellent electrolyte design.







Abstract
Serious safety risks caused by the high reactivity of lithium metal against electrolytes severely hamper the practicability of lithium metal batteries. By introducing unique polymerization site and more fluoride substitution, we built an in situ formed polymer&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase upon lithium anode to improve battery safety. The fluorine&#8208;rich and hydrogen&#8208;free polymer exhibits high thermal stability, which effectively reduces the continuous exothermic reaction between electrolyte and anode/cathode. As a result, the critical temperature for thermal safety of 1.0&#8197;Ah lithium&#8208;LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cell can be increased from 143.2&#8201;&#176;C to 174.2&#8201;&#176;C. The more dangerous &#8220;ignition&#8221; point of lithium metal batteries, the starting temperature of battery thermal runaway, has been dramatically raised from 240.0&#8201;&#176;C to 338.0&#8201;&#176;C. This work affords novel strategies upon electrolyte design, aiming to pave the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Unexpected Formation and Potent Antioxidant Activity of Macrocyclic Dimers Containing Disulfide and Selenide Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation and hydrolysis of selenides containing alkyl or benzylic bis(thioacetoxy) groups resulted in the unexpected formation of macrocyclic dimers, each containing two selenide and two disulfide bonds. These compounds exhibited potent catalytic antioxidant activity. Kinetic experiments indicated an autocatalytic mechanism involving the corresponding selenoxide and hydroxy perhydroxy selenurane intermediates.







Abstract
During attempts to prepare spirodithiaselenuranes as GPx mimetics, a series of unexpected dimeric macrocycles was obtained, each containing two selenide and two disulfide moieties in rings ranging from 18&#8208; to 26&#8208;membered. The products showed potent GPx&#8208;like activity in an NMR assay based on their ability to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with benzyl thiol. The high catalytic activity was attributed to transannular effects during selenide to selenoxide oxidation. This redox process was also characterized by an induction period that indicated autocatalysis in the formation of an intermediate selenoxide from the oxidation of the corresponding selenide.

         <title>A Carboranyl Electrolyte Enabling Highly Reversible Sodium Metal Anodes via a &#8220;Fluorine&#8208;Free&#8221; SEI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the pairing of a novel non&#8208;fluorine containing carboranyl electrolyte with pure sodium metal anodes which yields highly reversible, dendrite&#8208;free cell cycling. Solid electrolyte interphase characterization and investigation of sodium metal deposition/stripping processes suggests the electrolyte presented herein is a reliable candidate to enable anode&#8208;free cells.







Abstract
Realization of practical sodium metal batteries (SMBs) is hindered due to lack of compatible electrolyte components, dendrite propagation, and poor understanding of anodic interphasial chemistries. Chemically robust liquid electrolytes that facilitate both favorable sodium metal deposition and a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) are ideal to enable sodium metal and anode&#8208;free cells. Herein we present advanced characterization of a novel fluorine&#8208;free electrolyte utilizing the [HCB11H11]1&#8722; anion. Symmetrical Na cells operated with this electrolyte exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of 0.032&#8197;V at a current density of 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high coulombic efficiency of 99.5&#8201;% in half&#8208;cell configurations. Surface characterization of electrodes post&#8208;operation reveals the absence of dendritic sodium nucleation and a surprisingly stable fluorine&#8208;free SEI. Furthermore, weak ion&#8208;pairing is identified as key towards the successful development of fluorine&#8208;free sodium electrolytes.

Furthermore, weak ion-pairing is identified as key towards the successful development of fluorine-free sodium electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activating Nitrogen&#8208;doped Graphene Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts in Acidic Electrolytes using Hydrophobic Cavities and Proton&#8208;conductive Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on how to overcome the deactivation of N&#8208;doped graphene catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media based on the mechanistic understanding. Compatible suppression of the hydration of protonated pyridinic&#8208;N (pyri&#8208;NH+) by hydrophobic cavity and the introduction of proton conductivity by proton&#8208;conductive particles made N&#8208;doped graphenes close to Pt catalysts under acidic conditions.







Abstract
Although pyridinic&#8208;nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N) doped graphene is highly active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells in alkaline media, the activity critically decreases under acidic conditions. We report on how to prevent the deactivation based on the mechanistic understanding that 
 governs the ORR kinetics. First, we considered that the deactivation is due to the hydration of pyri&#8208;NH+, leading to a lower shift of the redox potential. Introducing the hydrophobic cavity prevented the hydration of pyri&#8208;NH+ but inhibited the proton transport. We then increased proton conductivity in the hydrophobic cavity by introducing SiO2 particles coated with ionic liquid polymer/Nafion&#174; which kept the high onset potentials with an increased current density even in acidic media.

         <title>Biocatalytic Synthesis Using Self&#8208;Assembled Polymeric Nano&#8208; and Microreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of polymeric systems for bioconversion is an efficient and recyclable technology for the future industry due to its zero&#8208;pollution features. This Review focuses on self&#8208;assembled polymeric nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;sized structures and their application as biocatalytic reactors for chemical synthesis, including polymersomes, reverse micelles, polymer emulsions, Pickering emulsions, and static emulsions.







Abstract
Biocatalysis is increasingly being explored for the sustainable development of green industry. Though enzymes show great industrial potential with their high efficiency, specificity, and selectivity, they suffer from poor usability and stability under abiological conditions. To solve these problems, researchers have fabricated nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;sized biocatalytic reactors based on the self&#8208;assembly of various polymers, leading to highly stable, functional, and reusable biocatalytic systems. This Review highlights recent progress in self&#8208;assembled polymeric nano&#8208; and microreactors for biocatalytic synthesis, including polymersomes, reverse micelles, polymer emulsions, Pickering emulsions, and static emulsions. We categorize these reactors into monophasic and biphasic systems and discuss their structural characteristics and latest successes with representative examples. We also consider the challenges and potential solutions associated with the future development of this field.

         <title>Edge&#8208;hosted Atomic Co&#8722;N4 Sites on Hierarchical Porous Carbon for Highly Selective Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The edge&#8208;hosted Co&#8722;N4 sites in the carbon matrix are more efficient and selective than basal plane&#8208;hosted ones in catalyzing 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR, achieving a remarkable selectivity of &#8776;95&#8201;% in the electrochemical production of H2O2.







Abstract
Not only high efficiency but also high selectivity of the electrocatalysts is crucial for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable energy storage applications. Herein, we systematically investigate the edge effect of carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathways (two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) or four&#8208;electron (4&#8201;e&#8722;)) and conclude that the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR proceeding over the edge&#8208;hosted atomic Co&#8722;N4 sites is more favorable than the basal&#8208;plane&#8208;hosted ones. As such, we have successfully synthesized and tuned Co&#8208;SACs with different edge&#8208;to&#8208;bulk ratios. The as&#8208;prepared edge&#8208;rich Co&#8722;N/HPC catalyst exhibits excellent 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR performance with a remarkable selectivity of &#8776;95&#8201;% in a wide potential range. Furthermore, we also find that oxygen functional groups could saturate the graphitic carbon edges under the ORR operation and further promote electrocatalytic performance. These findings on the structure&#8211;property relationship in SACs offer a promising direction for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost electrochemical H2O2 production via the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR.

         <title>Synthesis of Alternating Polyisocyanate Copolymers by Anionic Polymerization for Mimicking Amphiphilic Helical Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural similarity is demonstrated (see picture) between amphiphilic helical peptides (left) and amphiphilic alternating polyisocyanate copolymer (right). Phase segregation along the long axis is shown in orange and blue, represented by a Janus portrait. Hydrophobic moieties are denoted by orange while hydrophilic cations are denoted by blue with a plus sign.







Abstract
The amphiphilic conformation of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides has important biological functions, such as ion transport, antifreeze, and innate immunity, which can be mimicked by alternating polyisocyanate copolymers. We synthesized poly(allyl isocyanate&#8208;alt&#8208;(S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl isocyanate (P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)) and ammonium&#8208;containing P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC) (N&#8208;P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)), ensuring the amphiphilic helical conformation. The benzyl group of SMBIC plays an important role in alternating copolymerization with its steric and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects, while AIC provides an alkene group capable of introducing a customized functional group. The P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC) with predominantly alternating sequence was acquired at fSMBIC/fAIC=8 with a controlled molecular weight and narrow dispersity. N&#8208;P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)s were synthesized from thiol&#8208;ene radical addition with P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC).

         <title>A Photoresponsive Battery Based on a Redox&#8208;Coupled Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Hybrid Photoelectrochemical Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous&#8208;shell/core hybrid (TN&#8208;COF@CNT) enables a long&#8208;range charge transfer relay and a high&#8208;rate dual&#8208;redox for the realization of efficient photo coupled ions transfer process. Equipped with such a photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery achieves reliable photoresponses, enhanced battery efficiency, stability and a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage efficiency of 1.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photoresponsive batteries promise flexible and low&#8208;cost solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage (SES), but suffer from a limited SES efficiency due to rapid charge recombination and sluggish redox. Here, we present a porous&#8208;shell/core hybrid of covalent organic framework@carbon nanotube. This hybrid ensures long&#8208;lived separated charges (&#964;ave=3.0&#8197;ns) by an electron transfer relay starting from the donor&#8208;acceptor molecules to the nanoscale heterojunction. These charges are further allowed to drive high&#8208;rate redox of &#8722;C=O/&#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722; and &#8722;C&#8722;N/&#8722;C=N+ with facile kinetics. Equipped with this photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery shows a 5&#8208;fold enhancement in SES efficiency (1.1&#8201;% at 1&#8197;sun) over their counterparts. It is unveiled that the electron relay favors the formation of electron&#8208;enriching &#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722; and hole&#8208;enriching &#8722;C=N+ groups responsible for photoelectrochemical Zn2+ and OTf&#8722; storage cascade; and further, the general photo coupled ions transfer (PCIT) process is proposed.

     alt="A Photoresponsive Battery Based on a Redox-Coupled Covalent-Organic-Framework Hybrid Photoelectrochemical Cathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A porous-shell/core hybrid (TN-COF@CNT) enables a long-range charge transfer relay and a high-rate dual-redox for the realization of efficient photo coupled ions transfer process. Equipped with such a photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery achieves reliable photoresponses, enhanced battery efficiency, stability and a remarkable solar-to-electrochemical energy storage efficiency of 1.1&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoresponsive batteries promise flexible and low-cost solar-to-electrochemical energy storage (SES), but suffer from a limited SES efficiency due to rapid charge recombination and sluggish redox. Here, we present a porous-shell/core hybrid of covalent organic framework@carbon nanotube. This hybrid ensures long-lived separated charges (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;ave&lt;/sub&gt;=3.0&#8197;ns) by an electron transfer relay starting from the donor-acceptor molecules to the nanoscale heterojunction. These charges are further allowed to drive high-rate redox of &#8722;C=O/&#8722;C&#8722;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8722;C&#8722;N/&#8722;C=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with facile kinetics. Equipped with this photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery shows a 5-fold enhancement in SES efficiency (1.1&#8201;% at 1&#8197;sun) over their counterparts. It is unveiled that the electron relay favors the formation of electron-enriching &#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722; and hole-enriching &#8722;C=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups responsible for photoelectrochemical Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and OTf&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; storage cascade; and further, the general photo coupled ions transfer (PCIT) process is proposed. This work presents an inspiring photoelectrochemical cathode design and theoretical insight for photoresponsive batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Competitive Non&#8208;Radical Nucleophilic Attack Pathways for NH3 Oxidation and H2O Oxidation on Hematite Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 is found to be a highly effective and stable catalyst for driving photoelectrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction via a novel non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack mechanism under near&#8208;neutral pH. The selectivity of the ammonia oxidation reaction can be precisely tuned by manipulating the proportion of two surface species including Fe&#8722;O species and Fe&#8722;N species on &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3.







Abstract
The sluggish H2O oxidation kinetics on photoanodes severely obstructs the overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;energy efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Herein, we find a 10 to 55&#8208;fold increase of photocurrent by conducting ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) on hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3) photoanodes under near&#8208;neutral pH (9&#8211;11) and moderate applied potentials (1.0&#8211;1.4&#8197;VRHE) compared to H2O oxidation. By rate law analysis and operando spectroscopic studies, we confirm the non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack of NH3 molecules on high&#8208;valent surface Fe&#8722;O species (e.g., FeIV=O) and Fe&#8722;N species that produces NOx&#8722; and N2, respectively, which overwhelms the nucleophilic attack of H2O on surface FeIV=O and contributes to a high Faradaic efficiency of above 80&#8201;% for AOR. This work reveals a novel non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack strategy, which is significantly different from the conventional indirect radical&#8208;mediated AOR mechanism, for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AOR photoelectrocatalysts.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Michael Acceptors to Penetrate Cells: Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake with Tetrel&#8208;Centered Exchange Cascades, Assisted by Halogen&#8208;Bonding Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduced as the first explicitly tetrel&#8208;centered cascade exchangers, Michael acceptors are shown to enable and inhibit thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, generate distinct patterns in heatmaps to decode uptake circuitry, integrate novel halogen&#8208;bonding switches, deliver proteins to the cytosol, and break, as dimers, records for uptake inhibition related to drug discovery.







Abstract
Chalcogen&#8208;centered cascade exchange chemistry is increasingly understood to account for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, that is, the ability of reversibly thiol&#8208;reactive agents to penetrate cells. Here, reversible Michael acceptors are shown to enable and inhibit thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, including the cytosolic delivery of proteins. Dynamic cyano&#8208;cinnamate dimers rival the best chalcogen&#8208;centered inhibitors. Patterns generated in inhibition heatmaps reveal contributions from halogen&#8208;bonding switches that occur independent from the thyroid transporter MCT8. The uniqueness of these patterns supports that the entry of tetrel&#8208;centered exchangers into cells differs from chalcogen&#8208;centered systems. These results expand the chemical space of thiol&#8208;mediated uptake and support the existence of a universal exchange network to bring matter into cells, abiding to be decoded for drug delivery and drug discovery in the broadest sense.

         <title>In Vivo Nitroreductase Imaging via Fluorescence and Chemical Shift Dependent 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a bimodal probe to detect the hypoxic tumor by both fluorescence and chemical shift dependent 19F NMR imaging under the catalysis of nitroreductase. Specifically, the concentration of nitroreductase can be detected in a broad range by fluorescence and 19F MR, which is &#8804;1.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 and 10&#8211;50&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Nitroreductase (NTR) is an important biomarker widely used to evaluate the degree of tumor hypoxia. Although a few optical methods have been reported for detecting nitroreductase at low concentration ranges, an effective strategy for nitroreductase monitoring in vivo without limits to the imaging depth is still lacking. Herein, a novel dual&#8208;mode NIR fluorescence and 19F MRI agent, FCy7&#8208;NO2, is proposed for imaging tumor hypoxia. We show that FCy7&#8208;NO2 serves as not only a rapid NIR fluorescence enhanced probe for monitoring and bioimaging of nitroreductase in tumors, but also a novel 19F MR chemical shift&#8208;sensitive contrast agent for selectively detecting nitroreductase catalyzed reduction. Notably, integrating two complementary imaging technologies into FCy7&#8208;NO2 enables sensitive detection of nitroreductase in a broad concentration range without tissue&#8208;depth limit. In general, this agent has a remarkable response to nitroreductase, which provides a promising method for understanding tumor evolution and its physiological role in the hypoxic microenvironment.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in the Presence of Impurities: Influences and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power plants release CO2 and gaseous impurities into the atmosphere. In recent years, the effect of gaseous impurities on CO2 electrolysis has emerged as an important research topic, with an emphasis placed on understanding the catalytic reaction and developing mitigation strategies to lessen the negative effects of gaseous impurities.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of waste CO2 into useful fuels and chemical products is a promising approach to reduce CO2 emissions; however, several challenges still remain to be addressed. Thus far, most CO2 reduction studies use pure CO2 as the gas reactant, but CO2 emissions typically contain a number of gas impurities, such as nitrogen oxides, oxygen gas, and sulfur oxides. Gas impurities in CO2 can pose a significant obstacle for efficient CO2 electrolysis because they can influence the reaction and catalyst. This Minireview highlights early examples of CO2 reduction studies using mixed&#8208;gas feeds, explores strategies to sustain CO2 reduction in the presence of gas impurities, and discusses their implications for future progress in this emerging field.

         <title>Dynamic B/N Lewis Pairs: Insights into the Structural Variations and Photochromism via Light&#8208;Induced Fluorescence to Phosphorescence Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a series of ring&#8208;constrained B/N Lewis pairs (LPs) as modular systems, we have engineered the electronic interactions between B Lewis acid and N Lewis base sites by systematically tuning the steric effects, culminating in the discovery of a unique method to achieve rarely accessible room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials via photochemical activation of fluorescent heavy atom&#8208;free organic materials.

Ultralong afterglow emissions due to room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are of paramount importance in the advancement of smart sensors, bioimaging and light&#8208;emitting devices. We herein present an efficient approach to achieve rarely accessible phosphorescence of heavy atom&#8208;free organoboranes via photochemical switching of sterically tunable fluorescent Lewis pairs (LPs). LPs are widely applied in and well&#8208;known for their outstanding performance in catalysis and supramolecular soft materials but have not thus far been exploited to develop photo&#8208;responsive RTP materials. The intramolecular LP M1BNM not only shows a dynamic response to thermal treatment due to reversible N&#8594;B coordination but crystals of M1BNM also undergo rapid photochromic switching. As a result, unusual emission switching from short&#8208;lived fluorescence to long&#8208;lived phosphorescence (rad&#8208;M1BNM, &#964;RTP=232&#8197;ms) is observed. The reported discoveries in the field of Lewis pairs chemistry offer important insights into their structural dynamics, while also pointing to new opportunities for photoactive materials with implications for fast responsive detectors.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dissolution of Precious Metals by TiO2 through Photogenerated Free Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on experimental and theoretical results, this work explores the mechanism of photocatalytic precious metal dissolution. It is clear that photogenerated radicals and ligand molecules are the keys to precious metal dissolution, and the process has potential significance for enhancing photocatalytic selective recovery of precious metals.







Abstract
Exploring the pathways for photocatalytic dissolution of precious metals (PMs) is crucial for optimizing recovery. In this work, we systematically investigated the selectivity and solvation effects observed for dissolution by focusing on photocatalysis, precious metals and solvents. By combining transient characterization, reaction kinetics, and density functional theory, we determined that the radicals generated in photocatalysis were the key active species in the entire reaction. The cyano functional group in the solvent was the driving factor for dissolution of gold, and the importance of chlorine radicals for dissolution of platinum group precious metals was further confirmed. In addition, the catalytic properties of different precious metals can promote different transformations of functional groups, leading to selective dissolution. The structures of photocatalytic precious metal leaches also precisely explains the special coordination forms of precious metals and functional group ligands.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reconstructed Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Heterojunction for Switchable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reconstructed metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) heterojunction is constructed via redox electrochemistry and topology&#8208;guided strategy, and it exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and robust durability.







Abstract
Designing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based catalysts with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and robust durability simultaneously is highly required yet very challenging due to the limited intrinsic activity and their elusive evolution under harsh OER conditions. Herein, a steady self&#8208;reconstructed MOF heterojunction is constructed via redox electrochemistry and topology&#8208;guided strategy. Thanks to the inhibiting effect from hydrogen bonds of Ni&#8208;BDC&#8208;1 (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid), the obatained MOF heterojunction shows greatly improved OER activity with low overpotential of 225&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, relative to the totally reconstructed Ni&#8208;BDC&#8208;3 (332&#8197;mV). Density function theory calculations reveal that the formed built&#8208;in electric field in the MOF heterojunction remarkably optimizes the ad/desorption free energy of active Ni sites. Moreover, such MOF heterojunction shows superior durability attributed to the shielding effect of the surface&#8208;evolved NiOOH coating.

         <title>Upgrading Kolbe Electrolysis&#8212;Highly Efficient Production of Green Fuels and Solvents by Coupling Biosynthesis and Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linking Kolbe electrolysis that converts biobased acids with microbial fermentation of gaseous electrolysis products in a paired electrolyser creates a highly efficient production route for fuel additives and solvents.







Abstract
The chemical industry is transitioning to more sustainable and biobased processes. One key element of this transition is coupling energy fluxes and feedstock utilization for optimizing processes, routes and efficiencies. Here, we show for the first time the coupling of the Kolbe electrolysis at the anode with a subsequent microbial conversion of the cathodically produced co&#8208;product hydrogen. Kolbe electrolysis of valeric acid yields the liquid drop&#8208;in fuel additive n&#8208;octane. Subsequently, the solvent isopropanol is produced by resting Cupriavidus necator cells using gaseous electrolysis products (esp. CO2 and H2). The resting microbial cells show carbon efficiencies of up to 41&#8201;% and Coulombic/Faradaic efficiencies of 60&#8201;% and 80&#8201;% for anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively. The implementation of a paired electrolyser resulted in superior process performances with overall efficiencies of up to 64.4&#8201;%.

         <title>A 2.75&#8197;V ammonium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We bypassed the reduction susceptibility of NH4+ and promoted the NH4+ ion battery toward a record&#8208;breaking operation voltage of 2.75&#8197;V by co&#8208;utilizing the storage of the other significant charge carrier in electrolytes, viz, anions, realizing a high&#8208;voltage metal&#8208;free battery.







Abstract
The popular metal&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) suffer from environmental and economic issues because of their heavy dependency on nonrenewable metals. Here, we propose a metal&#8208;free ammonium (NH4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery with a record&#8208;breaking operation voltage of 2.75&#8197;V. The working mechanism of this sustainable battery involves the reversible anion (PF6&#8722;) intercalation chemistry in graphite cathode and NH4+ intercalation behavior in PTCDI (3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide) anode. This new battery configuration successfully circumvented the reduction susceptibility of NH4+ and the lack of mature NH4+&#8208;rich cathodes for NH4+ ion batteries (AIBs). The customized organic NH4+ electrolyte endows the graphite||PTCDI full battery with durable longevity (over 1000&#8197;cycles) and a high energy density (200&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). We show that the development of AIBs should be high&#8208;voltage&#8208;oriented while circumventing low operation potential to avoid NH4+ reduction.

         <title>Electrical Pulse Induced One&#8208;step Formation of Atomically Dispersed Pt on Oxide Clusters for Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrical pulse approach is employed to obtain dispersed Pt on diverse oxide clusters in one step with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon being the support. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, Pt1&#8722;FeOx/CN enable the Zinc&#8208;Air batteries to achieve an excellent electrochemical performance at ultralow temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed sites anchored on small oxide clusters are attractive new catalytic materials.

         <title>Multiple Roles of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Ligands in Direct Formation of H2O2 over Pd Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the reaction conditions of direct H2O2 formation over alkylthiolate(RS) decorated Pd, we find that the RS are oxidized yielding RSO2 as the effective ligand. The RSO2 ligand shows superior ability for proton transfer to the intermediate surface species OOH, which accelerates the formation of H2O2. The superior selectivity and yield by thiolate&#8208;decorated Pd as compared to uncoated Pd nanoparticles are confirmed by experiments.







Abstract
Coadsorbed organic species including thiolates can promote direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from H2 and O2 over Pd particles. Here, density functional theory based kinetic modeling, augmented with activity measurements and vibrational spectroscopy are used to provide atomistic understanding of direct H2O2 formation over alkylthiolate(RS) Pd. We find that the RS species are oxidized during reaction conditions yielding RSO2 as the effective ligand. The RSO2 ligand shows superior ability for proton transfer to the intermediate surface species OOH, which accelerates the formation of H2O2. The ligands promote the selectivity also by blocking sites for unselective water formation and by modifying the electronic structure of Pd. The work rationalizes observations of enhanced selectivity of direct H2O2 formation over ligand&#8208;funtionalized Pd nanoparticles and shows that engineering of organic surface modifiers can be used to promote desired hydrogen transfer routes.

         <title>The Function of Two Radical&#8208;SAM Enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, in the Biosynthesis of the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeGP cofactor is the prosthetic group of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, which catalyzes reversible hydride transfer from H2 to an organic substrate. HcgA and HcgG are involved in the biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor. In vitro biosynthesis experiments indicated the functions of these two radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes. HcgA biosynthesizes the initial pyridinol precursor, and HcgG contributes to the formation of the CO and acyl ligands.







Abstract
In the biosynthesis of the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol (1) is 3&#8208;methylated to form 2, then 4&#8208;guanylylated to form 3, and converted into the full cofactor. HcgA&#8208;G proteins catalyze the biosynthetic reactions. Herein, we report the function of two radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, as uncovered by in vitro complementation experiments and the use of purified enzymes. In vitro biosynthesis using the cell extract from the Methanococcus maripaludis &#916;hcgA strain was complemented with HcgA or precursors 1, 2 or 3. The results suggested that HcgA catalyzes the biosynthetic reaction that forms 1. We demonstrated the formation of 1 by HcgA using the 3&#8197;kDa cell extract filtrate as the substrate. Biosynthesis in the &#916;hcgG system was recovered by HcgG but not by 3, which indicated that HcgG catalyzes the reactions after the biosynthesis of 3. The data indicated that HcgG contributes to the formation of CO and completes biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor.

         <title>Bimetallic Aluminum&#8208; and Niobium&#8208;Doped MCM&#8208;41 for Efficient Conversion of Biomass&#8208;Derived 2&#8208;Methyltetrahydrofuran to Pentadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective conversion of biomass&#8208;derived 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MTHF) into pentadienes has been achieved over an aluminum and niobium bimetallic atomically doped MCM&#8208;41. The NbV sites enhance the catalytic performance by binding 2&#8208;MTHF.







Abstract
The production of conjugated C4&#8211;C5 dienes from biomass can enable the sustainable synthesis of many important polymers and liquid fuels. Here, we report the first example of bimetallic (Nb, Al)&#8208;atomically doped mesoporous silica, denoted as AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41, which affords quantitative conversion of 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MTHF) to pentadienes with a high selectivity of 91&#8201;%. The incorporation of AlIII and NbV sites into the framework of AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41 has effectively tuned the nature and distribution of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites within the structure. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption, diffuse reflectance infrared and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy collectively reveal the molecular mechanism of the conversion of adsorbed 2&#8208;MTHF over AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41. Specifically, the atomically&#8208;dispersed NbV sites play an important role in binding 2&#8208;MTHF to drive the conversion. Overall, this study highlights the potential of hetero&#8208;atomic mesoporous solids for the manufacture of renewable materials.

         <title>Stepwise Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization Enabled Mimetic Synthesis of Axially Chiral B,N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of stepwise asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (AASI) strategy, diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles bearing B&#8722;C and C&#8722;N axes that are related to the moieties of axially chiral enamines and arylborons were obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions played a unique effect on the promotion of stereospecific isomerization.







Abstract
Axially chiral molecules bearing multiple stereogenic axes are of great importance in the field of organic chemistry. However, the efficient construction of atropisomers featuring two different types of stereogenic axes has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the novel atroposelective synthesis of configurationally stable axially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles. By using stepwise asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (AASI) strategy, diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles bearing B&#8722;C and C&#8722;N axes that are related to the moieties of axially chiral enamines and arylborons were also obtained. In this case, all four stereoisomers of diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles were stereodivergently afforded in high enantioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions played a unique role in the promotion of stereospecific isomerization, thereby leading to the highly efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.

However, the efficient construction of atropisomers featuring two different types of stereogenic axes has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the novel atroposelective synthesis of configurationally stable axially chiral B,N-heterocycles. By using stepwise asymmetric allylic substitution-isomerization (&lt;i&gt;AASI&lt;/i&gt;) strategy, diaxially chiral B,N-heterocycles bearing B&#8722;C and C&#8722;N axes that are related to the moieties of axially chiral enamines and arylborons were also obtained. In this case, all four stereoisomers of diaxially chiral B,N-heterocycles were stereodivergently afforded in high enantioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions played a unique role in the promotion of stereospecific isomerization, thereby leading to the highly efficient central-to-axial chirality transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Host Spin&#8208;Crossover Thermodynamics Indicate Guest Fit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of fit between the binding partners within a host&#8211;guest complex is crucial for a highly selective interaction, yet difficult to separate from non&#8208;covalent interactions between the partners. The spin&#8208;crossover of a metallo&#8208;supramolecular host can be used to quantify guest fit, providing a new tool to describe host&#8211;guest binding that is complementary to binding constant determination.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) metal&#8208;organic cages capable of switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states have the potential to be used as magnetic sensors and switches. Variation of the donor strength of heterocyclic aldehyde subcomponents in imine&#8208;based ligands can tune the ligand field for a FeII center, which results in both homoleptic and heteroleptic cages with diverse SCO behaviors. The tetrahedral SCO cage built from 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde is capable of encapsulating various guests, which stabilize different cage spin states depending on guest size. Conversely, the SCO tetrahedron exhibits different affinities for guests in different spin states, which is inferred to result from subtle structural differences of the cavity caused by the change in metal center spin state. Examination of SCO thermodynamics across a series of host&#8211;guest complexes enabled sensitive probing of guest fit to the host cavity, providing information complementary to binding&#8208;constant determination.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Cyanoboration of Internal Allenes by Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent cyanoboration of internal allenes with B2pin2 and NCTS derivatives has been developed. MeOH was identified as the necessary additive for the regeneration of LCu&#8208;Bpin species. Computational studies revealed that the copper&#8208;mediated allylic cyanation is the regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, while the MeOH&#8208;assisted transmetalation with B2pin2 is the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent cyanoboration of internal allenes with B2pin2 (bis(pinacolato)diboron) and NCTS (N&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide) derivatives is reported. The &#946;,&#947;&#8208; and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;cyanoborylated products were synthesized with high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Computational studies revealed that nucleophilic addition of allylcopper or related intermediates on cyanation reagent is the regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, while transmetalation with B2pin2 is the rate&#8208;determining step. The nucleophilic addition step proceeds via inner&#8208;sphere mechanism in the CuI/P(o&#8208;tol)3 and CuI/Xantphos (P(o&#8208;tol)3=tris(o&#8208;methylphenyl)phosphine, Xantphos=4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) catalytic systems and via outer&#8208;sphere mechanism in the CuII/Xantphos catalytic system, respectively.

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Alkene Metathesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of alkene metathesis to catalytically control stereogenic axes by traceless arene formation is reported. Key to the process is a selective conversion of stereodynamic trienes by a chiral molybdenum catalyst, providing configurationally&#8208;stable atropisomers under mild conditions in excellent yields with of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r.







Abstract
Alkene metathesis catalyzed by enantiopure metal alkylidene complexes enables exceptionally versatile strategies to products with configurationally&#8208;defined stereocenters. Desymmetrization processes thereby provide reliable stereoselective routes to aliphatic structures, while the differentiation of aromatic stereogenic units remained an outstanding challenge. Herein, we describe the feasibility of alkene metathesis to catalytically control stereogenic axes by traceless arene formation. Stereodynamic trienes are selectively converted into corresponding binaphthalene atropisomers upon exposure to a chiral molybdenum catalyst. Remarkably, stereoselective arene&#8208;forming metathesis allows enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r. and excellent yields. As the disconnection of each bond of an aromatic target is retrosynthetically conceivable, it is anticipated that forging arenes by means of stereoselective metathesis will enable versatile approaches for the synthesis of a broad range of molecular topologies with precisely defined configuration.

         <title>Unveiling the Protonation Kinetics&#8208;Dependent Selectivity in Nitrogen Electroreduction: Achieving 75.05&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the key intermediates&#8242; behaviors on the catalyst&#8216;s surface through modifying the electronic interplay among active sites can realize the adjusting of protonation kinetics. This work unravels the crucial factors of protonation kinetics to obtain superior alkaline nitrogen electroreduction selectivity and describes the protonation kinetics&#8208;independent selectivity relation, giving a deep understanding of the complicated and elusive nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) mechanisms.







Abstract
While higher selectivity of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia (NH3) is always achieved in alkali, the selectivity dependence on nitrogen (N2) protonation and mechanisms therein are unrevealed. Herein, we profile how the NRR selectivity theoretically relies upon the first protonation that is collectively regulated by proton (H) abundance and adsorption&#8208;desorption, along with intermediate&#8208;*NNH formation. By incorporating electronic metal modulators (M=Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) in nitrogenase&#8208;imitated model&#8208;iron polysulfide (FeSx), a series of FeMSx catalysts with tailorable protonation kinetics are obtained. The key intermediates behaviors traced by in situ FT&#8208;IR and Raman spectroscopy and operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrate the strong protonation kinetics&#8208;dependent selectivity that mathematically follows a log&#8208;linear Bradley curve. Strikingly, FeCuSx exhibits a record&#8208;high selectivity of 75.05&#8201;% at &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (vs. RHE) for NH3 production in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte.

         <title>Genome Mining Enabled by Biosynthetic Characterization Uncovers a Class of Benzoxazolinate&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Diverse Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA. It was found that a putative acyl AMP&#8208;ligase mediates the last cyclization step to afford benzoxazolinate. The enzyme was then used as a probe for genome mining, which led to the discovery of a new class of benzoxazolinate&#8208;containing compounds in diverse bacteria.







Abstract
Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA and confers extraordinary bioactivities on natural products, such as C&#8208;1027. However, the biosynthetic gene responsible for the key cyclization step of benzoxazolinate remains unclear. Herein, we show a putative acyl AMP&#8208;ligase responsible for the last cyclization step. We used the enzyme as a probe for genome mining and discovered that the orphan benzobactin gene cluster in entomopathogenic bacteria prevails across Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. It turns out that Pseudomonas chlororaphis produces various benzobactins, whose biosynthesis is highlighted by a synergistic effect of two unclustered genes encoding enzymes on boosting benzobactin production; the formation of non&#8208;proteinogenic 2&#8208;hydroxymethylserine by a serine hydroxymethyltransferase; and the types I and II NRPS architecture for structural diversity. Our findings reveal the biosynthetic potential of a widespread benzobactin gene cluster.

&lt;p&gt;Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis-heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA and confers extraordinary bioactivities on natural products, such as C-1027. However, the biosynthetic gene responsible for the key cyclization step of benzoxazolinate remains unclear. Herein, we show a putative acyl AMP-ligase responsible for the last cyclization step. We used the enzyme as a probe for genome mining and discovered that the orphan benzobactin gene cluster in entomopathogenic bacteria prevails across Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. It turns out that &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas chlororaphis&lt;/i&gt; produces various benzobactins, whose biosynthesis is highlighted by a synergistic effect of two unclustered genes encoding enzymes on boosting benzobactin production; the formation of non-proteinogenic 2-hydroxymethylserine by a serine hydroxymethyltransferase; and the types I and II NRPS architecture for structural diversity. Our findings reveal the biosynthetic potential of a widespread benzobactin gene cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Ultralong Afterglow Emission with Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching from CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution processed CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn perovskite exhibit highly efficient (81.5&#8201;%) afterglow emission (150&#8197;s) with anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 300 to 400&#8197;K. We further demonstrate the application of the developed materials for optical storage and logic operation applications.







Abstract
Triplet exciton&#8208;based long&#8208;lived phosphorescence is severely limited by the thermal quenching at high temperature. Herein, we propose a novel strategy based on the energy transfer from triplet self&#8208;trapped excitons to Mn2+ dopants in solution&#8208;processed perovskite CsCdCl3. It is found the Mn2+ doped hexagonal phase CsCdCl3 could simultaneously exhibit high emission efficiency (81.5&#8201;%) and long afterglow duration time (150&#8197;s). Besides, the afterglow emission exhibits anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 300 to 400&#8197;K. In&#8208;depth charge&#8208;carrier dynamics studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculation provide unambiguous evidence that carrier detrapping from trap states (mainly induced by Cl vacancy) to localized emission centers ([MnCl6]4&#8722;) is responsible for the afterglow emission with anti&#8208;thermal quenching. Enlightened by the present results, we demonstrate the application of the developed materials for optical storage and logic operation applications.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Blown Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethane Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is utilized to prepare self&#8208;blown non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane foams by in situ generating the blowing agent (CO2) during the polymer network formation. The partial hydrolysis of one of the comonomers, the cyclic carbonate, generates the blowing agent. The process is facile, versatile, up scalable, uses low cost readily available reagents, can be complete in 30&#8197;minutes and is compatible to existing infrastructures for polymer foaming.







Abstract
For 80&#8197;years, polyisocyanates and polyols were central building blocks for the industrial fabrication of polyurethane (PU) foams. By their partial hydrolysis, isocyanates release CO2 that expands the PU network. Substituting this toxic isocyanate&#8208;based chemistry by a more sustainable variant&#8212;that in situ forms CO2 by hydrolysis of a comonomer&#8212;is urgently needed for producing greener cellular materials. Herein, we report a facile, up&#8208;scalable process, potentially compatible to existing infrastructures, to rapidly prepare water&#8208;induced self&#8208;blown non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) foams. We show that formulations composed of poly(cyclic carbonate)s and polyamines furnish rigid or flexible NIPU foams by partial hydrolysis of cyclic carbonates in the presence of a catalyst. By utilizing readily available low cost starting materials, this simple but robust process gives access to greener PU foams, expectedly responding to the sustainability demands of many sectors.

         <title>Tailored Cross&#8208;&#946; Assemblies Establish Peptide &#8220;Dominos&#8221; Structures for Anchoring Undruggable Pharmacophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of the peptide chain, the tilt angle of the &#946;&#8208;sheets in the self&#8208;assembly could be manipulated to form a collapsed&#8208;domino&#8208;like structure, resulting in a controllable display of the active sites for PD&#8208;L1 recognition.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;sheets have the ability to hierarchically stack into assemblies, and much effort has been spent on designing different peptides to regulate their assembly behaviors. Although the progress is remarkable, it remains challenging to manipulate them in a controllable way for achieving both tailored structures and specific functions. In this study, we obtained bola&#8208;like peptides using de novo design and combinatorial chemical screening. By regulating the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of the peptide chain, a series of assemblies with different tilt angles and active sites of the &#946;&#8208;sheet were obtained, resembling collapsed dominos. The structure&#8208;activity relationship of the optimized peptide NQ40 system was established and its ability to target the PD&#8208;L1 was demonstrated. This study successfully established the structure&#8208;function relationship of &#946;&#8208;sheets assemblies and has positive implications on the rational design of peptide assemblies that possess recognition abilities.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Uranium Complexes with a Pendant Borane Lewis Acid and 1,2&#8208;Insertion of CO into a U&#8722;N Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions between the highly strained uranacycle I with various boranes afford unprecedented uranium complexes bearing either a pendant borate or a pendant borane Lewis acid. The latter promotes the 1,2&#8208;insertion of CO into a UIV&#8208;N bond.







Abstract
In this contribution, we illustrate uranium complexes bearing a pendant borate (i.e. 1 and 2) or a pendant borane (i.e. 3 and 4) moiety via reaction of the highly strained uranacycle I with various 3&#8208;coordinate boranes. Complexes 3 and 4 represent the first examples of uranium complexes with a pendant borane Lewis acid. Moreover, complex 3 was capable of activation of CO, delivering a new CO activation mode, and an abnormal CO 1,2&#8208;insertion pathway into a U&#8722;N bond. The importance of the pendant borane moiety was confirmed by the controlled experiments.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Lead&#8208;Tin Bromide with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid lead&#8208;tin bromides, (RR/SS&#8208;C6N2H16)2Pb0.968Sn0.032Br6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, shows not only strong self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) but also intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals with a dissymmetry factor glum of &#177;3.0&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with perfect host&#8208;guest structures are promising candidates to construct circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. However, it still remains challenging to obtain 0D chiral metal halides with simultaneously strong CPL and high photoluminescence quantum yield. Here, a new enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid lead&#8208;tin bromides, (RR/SS&#8208;C6N2H16)2Pb0.968Sn0.032Br6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O), is reported. The R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O compounds not only show intriguing self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions with near&#8208;unity quantum yield, but also present intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor glum of &#177;3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. Such CPL activities originate from the asymmetric [SnBr6]4&#8722; luminophores in R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, due to the induced structural chirality by the organic ligands via N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, CPL emissions with tunable colors from R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and dehydrated compounds are reversibly observed, which extends their chiroptical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A new enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid lead-tin bromides, (&lt;i&gt;RR&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;SS&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.968&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.032&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, shows not only strong self-trapped exciton emissions with near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) but also intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals with a dissymmetry factor &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; of &#177;3.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero-dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with perfect host-guest structures are promising candidates to construct circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)-active materials. However, it still remains challenging to obtain 0D chiral metal halides with simultaneously strong CPL and high photoluminescence quantum yield. Here, a new enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid lead-tin bromides, (&lt;i&gt;RR&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;SS&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.968&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.032&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), is reported. The &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O compounds not only show intriguing self-trapped exciton emissions with near-unity quantum yield, but also present intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; of &#177;3.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Such CPL activities originate from the asymmetric [SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; luminophores in &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, due to the induced structural chirality by the organic ligands via N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, CPL emissions with tunable colors from &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and dehydrated compounds are reversibly observed, which extends their chiroptical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Alkylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds Using Sulfonylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to construct C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bonds from easily accessible reagents is a crucial, yet challenging endeavor for synthetic organic chemists. Herein, we report the realization of such a cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which combines N&#8208;sulfonyl hydrazones and C(sp3)&#8211;H donors through a diarylketone&#8208;enabled photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer and a subsequent fragmentation of the obtained alkylated hydrazide. This mild and metal&#8208;free protocol was employed to prepare a wide array of alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupled products and is tolerant of a variety of functional groups. The application of this chemistry further provides a preparatively useful route to various medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds, such as homobenzylic ethers, aryl ethyl amines, &#946;&#8208;amino acids and other moieties which are commonly encountered in approved pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and natural products</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Mechanical and Optical Properties of Polymer&#8208;based Nanocomposites by Sub&#8208;Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;nanowires (SNWs) exhibit great potential applications in nanocomposites owing to their high specific surface area, high flexibility, and similarity to polymer chains in dimension, which are a good entry point to bridge inorganic materials and polymer materials. Herein, we synthesized hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires (HAP SNWs) and engineered hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires/polyimide (HSP) gels and films by simple mixing of HAP SNWs and polyimide (PI). Benefiting from the interactions between HAP SNWs and PI, these nanocomposites were a continuous hybrid network. As the increase of HAP SNWs contents, the viscosity and modulus of HSP gels were greatly improved by one or two orders of magnitude compared with PI gel. HSP films not only maintained high transparency but also gained high haze, as well as exhibited enhanced Young's modulus. Thus, both HSP gels and films developed in this work are promising for various applications in coatings and high&#8208;performance films.</dc:description>

Thus, irradiation of 1&#8208;(OCH2F)&#8208;3&#8208;Me&#8208;6&#8208;(CF3)benzotriazolium triflate with blue LED light in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2] promotes the synthesis of diversely functionalized aryl monofluoromethyl ethers.

         <title>Energy Transport in Dichromic Metallo&#8208;organic Crystals Selective Inclusion of Spatially Resolved Arrays of Donor and Acceptor Dyes in Different Nanochannels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the precise positioning and alignment of arrays of two different guest molecules in a crystalline host matrix has been engineered resulting in new optically&#8208;active materials. Sub&#8208;nm differences in the diameters of two types of 1D channels is sufficient for size&#8208;selective inclusion of dyes. Energy transport occurs between the arrays of different dyes that are included in parallel&#8208;positioned nanochannels by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Dichromism and diattenuation of individual micro&#8208;sized crystals are dependent on their relative position under polarized light. This angular&#8208;dependent behavior is a result of the geometricallyconstrained orientation of the dyes by the crystallographic packing of the host matrix and is concentration dependent.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated and Efficient Generation of General Molecular Aggregate Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modeling intermolecular interactions of complex non&#8208;covalent structures is important in many areas of chemistry. To facilitate the generation of reasonable dimer, oligomer, and general aggregate geometries, we introduce an automated computational interaction site screening (aISS) workflow. This easy&#8208;to&#8208;use tool combines a genetic algorithm employing the intermolecular force&#8208;field xTB&#8208;IFF for initial search steps with the general force&#8208;field GFN&#8208;FF and the semi&#8208;empirical GFN2&#8208;xTB method for geometry optimizations. Compared with the alternative CREST program, aISS yields similar results but with computer time savings of 1&#8208;3 orders of magnitude. This allows for the treatment of systems with thousands of atoms composed of elements up to radon, e.g., metalorganic complexes, or even polyhedra and zeolite cut&#8208;outs which were not accessible before. Moreover, aISS can identify reactive sites and provides options like site&#8208;directed (user&#8208;guided) screening.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amphiphilic block copolymer of polyphosphinoborane&#160;has been prepared by a mechanism&#8208;led strategy of the sequential catalytic dehydropolymerization of precursor monomers, H3B&#183;PRH2 (R = Ph, n&#8208;hexyl), using the simple pre&#8208;catalyst [Rh(Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2)2]Cl. Speciation, mechanism and polymer chain growth studies support a step&#8208;growth process where reversible chain transfer occurs, i.e. H3B&#183;PRH2/oligomer/polymer can all coordinate with, and be activated by, the catalyst. Block copolymer [H2BPPhH]110&#8211;b&#8211;[H2BP(n&#8208;hexyl)H]11 can be synthesized and self&#8208;assembles in solution to form either rod&#8208;like micelles or vesicles depending on solvent polarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Off&#8208;center Mechanophore Activation in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Block copolymers (BCPs) are used in numerous applications in modern materials science. Yet, like homopolymers, BCPs can undergo covalent bond scission when mechanically stressed (mechanochemistry), which could lead to unexpected consequences in such applications. BCPs' heterogeneity may affect force transduction, perhaps changing force distribution and localization. To verify this, a gem&#8208;dichlorocyclopropane (gDCC) embedded linear chain is prepared and extended with a poly(methyl methacrylate) block. When stressed in solution, the mechanochemical ring&#8208;opening of gDCC is accelerated compared to homopolymers, even though the mechanophores are at the chain ends. Moreover, a higher mechanophore activation selectivity is obtained. These results indicate that mechanochemical response outside, and even far from the chain center is quite prominent in BCPs, and that forces along the polymer chain can efficiently activate multi&#8208;mechanophores regions, even when far from the polymer midchain.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Deuterium Atom Transfer Deuteration of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes with High Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to its mild reaction conditions and unique chemoselectivity, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) hydrogenation represents an indispensable method for the synthesis of complex molecules. Its analog using deuterium, deuterium atom transfer (DAT) deuteration, is expected to enable access to complex deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds. However, DAT deuteration has been scarcely studied for synthetic purposes, and a method that possesses the favorable characteristics of HAT hydrogenations has remained elusive. Herein, we report a protocol for the photocatalytic DAT deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. In contrast to the previous DAT deuteration, this method tolerates a variety of synthetically useful functional groups including haloarenes. The late&#8208;stage deuteration also allows access to deuterated amino acids as well as donepezil&#8208;d2. Thus, this work demonstrates the potential of DAT chemistry to become the alternative method of choice for preparing deuterium&#8208;containing molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Apparent 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig Carbofluorination of Alkenes Enabled by Palladium&#8208;Based Dyotropic Rearrangement</title>

Reversing the intrinsic cyclization mode. Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkylallyloxy)phenyl boronic acid derivatives in the presence of Selectfluor 2 provides chromanes 3 with concurrent generation of a tertiary alkyl fluoride function. A 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation affords PdII intermediate A whose oxidation to PdIV followed by 1,2&#8208;aryl/PdIV dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8722;F bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination affords chromane 3.







Abstract
Alkene difunctionalization featuring an intramolecular carbometallation step has been developed into a powerful transformation in organic synthesis. The 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbometallation is in general highly favored over the alternative 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. We report herein a formal 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig carbofluorination protocol by combining the conventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation with a chemoselective 1,2&#8208;aryl/Pd dyotropic rearrangement. Treatment of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkylallyloxy)phenyl boronic acid derivatives in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(dba)2, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and Selectfluor affords chromanes with concurrent generation of a tertiary alkyl fluoride function. A &#963;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PdII species resulting from the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation process is isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Its oxidation to PdIV complex triggers the chemoselective dyotropic rearrangement leading to the ring expansion product.

         <title>Cu Single Atom Nanozyme Based High&#8208;Efficiency Mild Photothermal Therapy through Cellular Metabolic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu single atom nanozyme achieves mild photothermal cancer therapy by a two&#8208;pronged strategy, where the delivered clinical medicine licogliflozin closes a sodium&#8208;dependent glucose transporter valve for blocking the energy required for the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Meanwhile, the nanozyme forms a reactive oxygen species storm to damage existing HSPs.







Abstract
Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) drastically compromises the treatment effect of mild photothermal therapy (PTT). Herein, we designed a polyporous Cu single atom nanozyme (Cu SAzyme) loaded with licogliflozin (LIK066) for HSP&#8208;silencing induced mild PTT. On one hand, LIK066 inhibits glucose uptake by shutting sodium&#8208;dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) &#8220;valve&#8221;, effectively blocking the energy source for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Without sufficient energy, cancer cells cannot synthesize HSPs. On the other hand, Cu SAzyme presents extraordinary multienzyme activities to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm formation, which can damage the existing HSPs in cancer cells. Through a two&#8208;pronged strategy of SGLT inhibitor and ROS storm, LIK066&#8208;loaded Cu SAzyme shows high efficiency for comprehensive removal of HSPs to realize mild PTT.

         <title>Actinide Pnictinidene Chemistry: A Terminal Thorium Parent&#8208;Arsinidene Complex Stabilised by a Super&#8208;Bulky Triamidoamine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a new super&#8208;bulky triamidoamine ligand to actinide chemistry has enabled the previously elusive terminal parent thorium&#8208;arsinidene linkage, that is the first terminal thorium&#8208;arsinidene, to be synthesised and isolated. Quantum chemical calculations reveal a surprisingly large change to the Th=AsH linkage compared to an electrostatically&#8208;bound potassium&#8208;capped analogue.







Abstract
We report the direct synthesis of the terminal pnictidenes [An(TrenTCHS)(PnH)][M(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)] (TrenTCHS={N(CH2CH2NSiCy3)3}3&#8722;; An/Pn/M=Th/P/Na 5, Th/As/K 6, U/P/Na 7, U/As/K 8) and their conversion to the pnictides [An(TrenTCHS)(PnH2)] (An/Pn=Th/P 9, Th/As 10, U/P 11, U/As 12). Use of the super&#8208;bulky TrenTCHS ligand was essential to accessing complete families, and 6 is an unprecedented example of a terminal thorium&#8208;arsinidene complex and only the second structurally authenticated parent terminal arsinidene complex of any metal. Comparison of the terminal Th=AsH unit of 6 to the bridging ThAs(H)K linkage in structurally analogous [Th(TrenTIPS){&#956;&#8208;As(H)K(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)}] (TrenTIPS={N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)3}3&#8722;) reveals a stronger Th&#8722;As bond in the former compared to the latter, and a large response overall to the nature of the Th=AsH bonding upon removal of the electrostatically&#8208;bound K&#8208;ion; the &#963;&#8208;bond changes little but the &#960;&#8208;bond is significantly perturbed.

         <title>Photoinduced Promiscuity of Cyclohexanone Monooxygenase for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoroketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced reductive dehalogenation promiscuity of cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) with a novel mechanism of ET/PT distinct from the photoinduced promiscuity of natural reductases is reported. Various highly enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones were synthesized by photoinduced reductive dehalogenation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;halofluoroketones in a process catalyzed by the rationally designed CHMO mutants.







Abstract
The development of mild, efficient, and enantioselective methods for preparing chiral fluorinated compounds has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a promiscuous cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) for the photoinduced synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones via enantioselective reductive dehalogenation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;halofluoroketones. Wild&#8208;type CHMO from Acinetobacter sp. possesses this promiscuous ability innately; however, the yield and stereoselectivity are low. A structure&#8208;guided rational design of CHMO improved the yield and stereoselectivity remarkably. Mechanistic studies and molecular simulations demonstrated that this photoinduced CHMO catalyzes the reductive dehalogenation via a novel electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) mechanism, distinct from that of previously reported reductases with similar promiscuity. This methodology was expanded to various substrates, and desirable chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones were obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and e.r. values (up to 99:1).

         <title>Design of a Protein with Improved Thermal Stability by an Evolution&#8208;Based Generative Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein design bears great interest in both research and industry. Evolutionary&#8208;based methods have been promising in designing new sequences based on the concept that the evolutionary fitness of a sequence is closely related to folding stability. Here we present a computational pipeline that thanks to a combination of sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;based methods can design new sequences translating in functional proteins with enhanced thermal stability.







Abstract
Efficient design of functional proteins with higher thermal stability remains challenging especially for highly diverse sequence variants. Considering the evolutionary pressure on protein folds, sequence design optimizing evolutionary fitness could help designing folds with higher stability. Using a generative evolution fitness model trained to capture variation patterns in natural sequences, we designed artificial sequences of a proteinaceous inhibitor of pectin methylesterase enzymes. These inhibitors have considerable industrial interest to avoid phase separation in fruit juice manufacturing or reduce methanol in distillates, averting chromatographic passages triggering unwanted aroma loss. Six out of seven designs with up to 30&#8201;% divergence to other inhibitor sequences are functional and two have improved thermal stability. This method can improve protein stability expanding functional protein sequence space, with traits valuable for industrial applications and scientific research.

         <title>Modified Intramolecular&#8208;Lock Strategy Enables Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Non&#8208;Doped OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;medium ring&#8221;&#8208;lock strategy is presented for the construction of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, high photoluminescence quantum yield and large horizontal orientation factor, which enables to assemble non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with high external quantum efficiency of 26.2&#8201;% and power efficiency of 76.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy is an appealing task for designing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, but only limited examples have been reported so far. Herein we present a &#8220;medium ring&#8221;&#8208;lock strategy to develop TADF emitters for improving the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The installation of an electron&#8208;deficient heptagonal diimide lock onto a highly rotatable biphenyl&#8208;based emitter not only enhances electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of acceptor that decreases singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), but also endows the skeleton with modest rigidity and flexibility that increases photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in neat film. In particular, the integration of the diimide lock also leads to an increase in horizontal orientation factor (&#920;//) from 69&#8201;% to 83&#8201;%. Consequently, this modified intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy enables an efficient TADF emitter to assemble high&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a high external quantum efficiency of 26.2&#8201;% and a power efficiency of 76.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Nanoradiosensitizers Enhance Radiotherapy by Combining ROS Generation and CO Gas Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional X&#8208;ray reactor, ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem, was developed to enhance radiotherapy by combining ROS generation and CO gas release. The well&#8208;designed nanostructures can increase the direct absorption of radiation doses (primary radiation) and promote the deposition of photons and electrons (secondary radiation). Furthermore, the coating of the targeting cell membrane improved this radiosensitizer with a certain degree of targeting and biocompatibility.







Abstract
A lack of targeting accuracy and radiosensitivity severely limits clinical radiotherapy. In this study, we developed a radiosensitizer comprised of Ru&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic nanostructures (ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem) to optimize irradiation by maximizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and CO release in X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced dynamic therapy (XDT). The well&#8208;designed nanostructures increase the direct absorption of radiation doses (primary radiation) and promote the deposition of photons and electrons (secondary radiation). The secondary electrons were trapped and transferred in the constrained MONs where they induce a cascade of reactions to increase the therapeutic efficiency. Meanwhile, the full&#8208;length antiglypican 3 (GPC3) antibody (hGC33) expressed a cell membrane coating enabling active targeting of tumor sites with optimized biocompatibility. The ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem represents a starting point for advancing an all&#8208;around radiosensitizer that operates efficiently in clinical XDT.

         <title>Unveiling the &#8220;Proton Lubricant&#8221; Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;MoS2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MoS2/PEDOT hybrid featuring enlarged interlayers (from 0.62 to 1.29&#8197;nm), good hydrophilicity and high electronic conductivity was prepared, demonstrating highly reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction behaviors in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The co&#8208;inserted protons induced by PEDOT effectively shield the electrostatic interactions between MoS2/PEDOT and Zn2+, providing a new concept of &#8220;proton lubricant&#8221; to facilitate the Zn2+ diffusion.







Abstract
Proton insertion chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is becoming a research hotspot owing to its fast kinetics and additional capacities. However, H+ storage mechanism has not been deciphered in the popular MoS2&#8208;based AZIBs. Herein, we innovatively prepared a MoS2/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (MoS2/PEDOT) hybrid, where the intercalated PEDOT not only increases the interlayer spacing (from 0.62 to 1.29&#8197;nm) and electronic conductivity of MoS2, but also activates the proton insertion chemistry. Thus, highly efficient and reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction behaviors are demonstrated for the first time in aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries. More intriguingly, the co&#8208;inserted protons can act as lubricants to effectively shield the electrostatic interactions between MoS2/PEDOT host and divalent Zn2+, enabling the accelerated ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics and exceptional rate performance. This work proposes a new concept of &#8220;proton lubricant&#8221; driving Zn2+ transport and broadens the horizons of Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries.

         <title>An Enzymatically Gated Catalytic Hairpin Assembly Delivered by Lipid Nanoparticles for the Tumor&#8208;Specific Activation of Signal Amplification in miRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lipid nanoparticles&#8208;mediated, enzyme&#8208;triggered signal amplification strategy was proposed for precise miRNA imaging both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of switchable catalytic hairpin assembly with controlled in vivo delivery enables tumor&#8208;specific signal amplification with reduced off&#8208;tumor signal.







Abstract
MicroRNA (miRNA) imaging in disease sites is vital to elucidate their role in cancer progression. However, limited tumor specificity remains a major barrier for traditional amplification approaches due to associated background signal leakage. Here, we report a generalizable approach via the combination of enzymatically triggered catalytic hairpin assembly with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)&#8208;based delivery strategy for tumor&#8208;specific activation of signal amplification and therefore sensitive miRNA imaging. The signal amplification is established via engineering of traditional catalytic hairpin assembly with enzymatically activated motifs to achieve triggable miRNA imaging in cancer cells. Furthermore, by the introduction of LNPs to combat biological barriers, we demonstrate that the system enables amplified miRNA imaging in vivo with reduced off&#8208;tumor signal, leading to enhanced tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background contrast compared with traditional methods. This approach that relies on specific triggers and controlled delivery to distinguish miRNA in cancer cells from normal cells should be useful in tumor diagnosis.

         <title>Electrifying Adipic Acid Production: Copper&#8208;Promoted Oxidation and C&#8722;C Cleavage of Cyclohexanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipate was achieved by incorporating copper into a nickel hydroxide electrode. Cu2+ plays a key role in weakening the interaction between the surface&#8208;adsorbed O&#8208;centered radical and the NiOOH surface, thereby facilitating C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
Adipic acid is a central platform molecule for the polymer industry. Production of adipic acid with electroreforming technology is more sustainable compared to the thermochemical synthesis route. We discovered that incorporation of Cu2+ into a Ni hydroxide lattice significantly improved the electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipate with a high yield (84&#8201;%) and selectivity (87&#8201;%). This Cu promotion effect serves as a mechanistic probe that can be combined with product analysis, steady&#8208;state kinetics, and in situ spectroscopy. A two&#8208;electron oxidation into cyclohexanone first occurs, followed by consecutive hydroxylation and C&#8722;C cleavage before dione formation. The central role of Cu2+ is to weaken the interaction between the NiOOH and surface&#8208;adsorbed O&#8208;centered radical that facilitates subsequent C&#8722;C cleavage. This enables a highly efficient two&#8208;electrode system capable of electroreforming KA oil into adipate and pure H2.

         <title>{Mo126W30}: Polyoxometalate Cages Shaped by &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resembling the stacked orientation of nucleobases in DNA, arrays of aromatic carboxylates provide multiple &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in directing the formation of giant {Mo126W30} polyoxometalate cages. The interior aromatic units can be postsynthetically replaced by a selection of functionalized aliphatic dicarboxylates, offering options to fine&#8208;tune the microenvironment within the cage cavity.







Abstract
Here we report the formation of giant {Mo126W30} polyoxometalate cages templated by &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar ligands. Their inorganic shells incorporate arrays of 18 stacked aromatic carboxylates, such as 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate or 5&#8208;nitroisophthalate, and the assembly is stabilized by multiple &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. NMR data confirmed that the cages are stable in solution and the inner aromatic templates can be postsynthetically replaced by selected aliphatic dicarboxylates, paving the way for endo&#8208;functionalization and exploration of the reactivities within the cage cavities.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of the Homoleptic Nickel(I) and Nickel(II) Bis&#8208;benzene Sandwich Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metalloradical [Ni(C6H6)2]+, hitherto unknown in the condensed phase, was synthesized from [Ni(CO)4]+[WCA]&#8722; and benzene ([WCA]&#8722;=[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). The [Ni(C6H6)2]+ cation exhibits an asymmetric slipped sandwich structure. Its magnetic properties were determined in solution and in the gas phase. Further oxidation with the Ag+/0.5&#8197;l2 system led to the salt [Ni(C6H6)2]2+([WCA]&#8722;)2.







Abstract
A stable salt of the metalloradical [Ni(C6H6)2]+ hitherto unknown in the condensed phase was synthesized from [Ni(CO)4]+[WCA]&#8722; and benzene ([WCA]&#8722;=[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). Single crystal XRD reveals a remarkable asymmetrically &#951;3,&#951;6&#8208;slipped sandwich structure. The magnetic properties of the [Ni(C6H6)2]+ cation were determined in solution and in the gas phase. Oxidation with the synergistic Ag+/0.5&#8197;l2 system led to the salt [Ni(C6H6)2]2+([WCA]&#8722;)2. All products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Tellurium&#8208;Based Chalcogen Bonding: Photocontrolled Anion Binding and Anion Abstraction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new noncovalent bonding motifs with reversibly tunable binding affinity is of fundamental importance in manipulating the properties and functions of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly systems and materials. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a unique visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable telluro&#8208;triazole/triazolium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding (ChB) system in which the Te moieties are connected by azobenzene cores. The binding strengths between these azo&#8208;derived ChB receptors and the halide anions (Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;) could be reversibly regulated upon irradiation by different visible lights. The cis&#8208;bidentate ChB receptors can exhibit enhanced halide anion binding abilities comparing to the trans&#8208;monodentate ones. Particularly, the telluro&#8208;triazolium&#8208;based ChB receptor can achieve both high and significantly photoswitchable binding affinities for halide anions, which enable it to serve as an efficient photocontrolled organocatalyst for the ChB assisted halide&#160;abstraction&#160;in a Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation benchmark reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation of Electrochemically Active Conjugated Organic Molecules and Its Impact on Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecule aggregation in solution is acknowledged to be universal and can regulate the molecule's physiochemical properties, which however has been rarely investigated in electrochemistry. Herein, an electrochemical method is developed to quantitatively study the aggregation behavior of the target molecule methyl viologen dichloride. It is found that the oxidation state dicationic ions stay discrete, while the singly&#8208;reduced state monoradicals yield a concentration&#8208;dependent aggregation behavior. As a result, the molecule's energy level and its redox potential can be effectively regulated. This work does not only provide a method to investigate the molecular aggregation, but also demonstrates the feasibility to tune redox flow battery's performance by regulating the aggregation behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>(SCp)Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Satoh&#8211;Miura Reaction for Buildingup Axial Chirality: Counteranion&#8208;Directed Switching of Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction is an important method for extending &#960;&#8208;systems by forging multi&#8208;substituted benzene rings via double aryl C&#8211;H activation and annulation with alkynes. However, the development of highly enantioselective Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction remains rather challenging. Herein, we report an asymmetric Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction between 1&#8208;aryl benzo[h]isoquinolines and internal alkynes enabled by a SCpRh&#8208;catalyst. Judiciously choosing the counteranion of the Rh&#8208;catalyst is crucial for the desired reactivity over the competitive formation of azoniahelicenes. Detailed mechanistic studies support the proposal of counteranion&#8208;directed switching of reaction pathways in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8211;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Charge Transfer Limitations for Extreme Fast Charging of Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extreme fast charging (XFC) of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries is a key enabler of electrified transportation. While previous studies mainly focused on improving Li ion mass transport in electrodes and electrolytes, the limitations of charge transfer across electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces remain underexplored. Here we unravel how charge transfer kinetics dictates the fast rechargeability of Li&#8208;ion cells. Li ion transfer across the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface is found to be rate&#8208;limiting during XFC, but the charge transfer energy barrier at both the cathode and anode have to be reduced simultaneously to prevent Li plating, which is made possible by tuning the type of Li salts and solvents. By unlocking charge transfer limitations, we show that 184 Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells realize stable XFC (10&#8208;min charge to 80%) which is otherwise unachievable, and that the lifetime of 245 Wh kg&#8722;1 21700 cells is quintupled during fast charging (25&#8208;min charge to 80%), outperforming commercial technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Monosaccharide Channels: Size&#8208;Selective Transmembrane Transport of Glucose and Fructose Mediated by Porphyrin Boxes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report synthetic monosaccharide channels built with shape&#8208;persistent organic cages, porphyrin boxes (  PB  s), that allow facile transmembrane transport of glucose and fructose through their windows.  PB  s show a much higher transport rate for glucose and fructose over disaccharides such as sucrose, as evidenced by intravesicular enzyme assays and molecular dynamics simulations. The transport rate can be modulated by changing the length of the alkyl chains decorating the cage windows. Insertion of a linear pillar ligand into the cavity of  PB  s blocks the monosaccharide transport. In&#8208;vitro cell experiment shows that  PB  s transport glucose across the living cell membrane and enhance cell viability when natural glucose transporter GLUT1 is blocked. Time&#8208;dependent live&#8208;cell imaging and MTT assay confirm the cyto&#8208;compatibility of  PB  s. Monosaccharide selective transport ability of  PB  s is reminiscent of natural glucose transporters (GLUTs), which are crucial for numerous biological functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Electrochemical C&#8722;H Carboxylation of Arenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a direct, metal&#8208;free, and site&#8208;selective electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes by reductive activation using CO2 as the economic and abundant carboxylic source was reported. The electrocarboxylation was carried out in an operationally simple manner with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, setting the stage for the challenging site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of unactivated (hetero)arenes. The robust nature of the electrochemical strategy was reflected by a broad scope of substrates with excellent atom economy and unique selectivity. Notably, the direct and selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of various challenging arenes worked well in this approach, including electron&#8208;deficient naphthalenes, pyridines, simple phenyl derivatives, and substituted quinolines. The method benefits from being externally catalyst&#8208;free, metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free, which makes it extremely attractive for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction of Na+ within a {Mg2Na2} Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic compounds containing sodium cations are notable for their stability and resistance to redox reactivity unless highly reducing electrical potentials are applied. Here we report that treatment of a low oxidation state {Mg  2  Na  2  } species with non&#8208;reducible organic bases induces the spontaneous and completely selective extrusion of sodium metal and oxidation of the Mg(I) centers to the more conventional Mg(II) state. Although these processes are also characterized by a structural reorganisation of the initially chelated diamide spectator ligand, computational quantum chemical studies indicate that intramolecular electron transfer is abetted by the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) of the {Mg  2  Na  2  } ensemble, which arise exclusively from the 3  s  valence atomic orbitals of the constituent sodium and magnesium atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Modulation of Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Activities of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts through p&#8211;n Junction Rectification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fine&#8208;tuning single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to surpass their activity limit remains challenging at such an atomic scale. Herein, we exploit p&#8208;type semiconducting character of the SACs having metal center coordinated to nitrogen donors (MeN x ) and rectify their local charge density by an n&#8208;type semiconductor support. With iron phthalocyanine (FePc) as model SAC, introducing an n&#8208;type gallium monosulfide that features low work function generates a space&#8208;charged region across the junction interface, and causes distortion of the FeN4 moiety and spin state transition in the Fe(II) center. This catalyst shows an over two&#8208;fold higher specific oxygen&#8208;reduction activity than that of pristine FePc. We further employ other three n&#8208;type metal chalcogenides of varying work function as support, and discover a linear correlation between the activities of the supported FeN4 and the rectification degrees, which clearly indicates that SACs can be continuously tuned by this rectification strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of Csp3&#8211;Csp3 Bonds Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters by Synergistic Palladium and Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic catalysis has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for stereodivergent formation of Csp3&#8211;Csp3 bonds bearing vicinal stereocenters. Despite the many successes that have been achieved in this field, stereodivergent Csp3&#8211;Csp3 coupling reactions involving stabilized nucleophiles remain challenging because of the competing single&#8208;catalysis pathway. Herein, we report a synergistic palladium/phase&#8208;transfer catalyst system that enables diastereodivergent Csp3&#8211;Csp3 coupling reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes with stabilized nucleophile oxindoles. Both the syn and anti coupling products, bearing quaternary and tertiary vicinal stereocenters, could be selectively produced in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Non&#8208;covalent activation of the stabilized nucleophile via chiral ion pair in a biphasic system is a crucial success factor in achieving diastereodivergence.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Electrolyte Design for Rechargeable Batteries: From Lithium to Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental physical and electrochemical properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are scrutinized with particular attention paid to the similarity and difference between Mg&#8208;ion and the popular Li&#8208;ion based electrolytes. The Review was written with the intension of accelerating the development of sustainable and high&#8208;performance battery technologies.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as one of the most viable battery chemistries amongst the &#8220;post&#8221; lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technologies owing to their high volumetric capacity and the natural abundance of their key elements. The fundamental properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are of essence to regulate the overall performance of RMBs. In this Review, the basic electrochemistry of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes batteries is discussed and compared to that of the Li&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes, and a comprehensive overview of the development of different Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is provided. In addition, the remaining challenges and possible solutions for future research are intensively discussed. The present work is expected to give an impetus to inspire the discovery of key electrolytes and thereby improve the electrochemical performances of RMBs and other related emerging battery technologies.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tight Host&#8208;Guest Binding with Exceptionally Strong Positive Cooperativity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complexation of DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests with a rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle exhibits remarkably high binding affinities with positive cooperativity that is among the strongest for synthetic host&#8211;guest systems. The ultra&#8208;tight binding and extraordinary positive cooperativity are driven by size/shape host&#8211;guest matching, guest&#8208;activated stacking of macrocycles, and multiple charge&#8208;dipole and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions.







Abstract
Cooperativity plays a critical role in self&#8208;assembly and molecular recognition. A rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle with a cyclodirectional backbone binds with DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio in high affinities (Ktotal &#8776;1013&#8197;M&#8722;2) in the highly polar DMF. The host&#8211;guest binding also exhibits exceptionally strong positive cooperativity quantified by interaction factors &#945; that are among the largest for synthetic host&#8211;guest systems. The unusually strong positive cooperativity, revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fully corroborated by mass spectrometry, NMR and computational studies, is driven by guest&#8208;induced stacking of the macrocycles and stabilization from the alkyl end chains of the guests, interactions that appear upon binding the second macrocycle. With its tight binding driven by extraordinary positive cooperativity, this host&#8211;guest system provides a tunable platform for studying molecular interactions and for constructing stable supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Porous Liquids Responsive to Light
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type&#8197;II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) with permanent cavities is formed by dissolving Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) in bulky ionic liquid .The MOP carries azobenzene moieties as pendant groups which undergo trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;isomerization under visible and UV light irradiation and thus, a controlled CO2 uptake and release is realized.







Abstract
A porous liquid is a unique liquid medium that combines the cavity of porous solids with the fluidity of liquids. This special characteristic offers potential in various applications. Here we report a type&#8197;II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) from dissolving a photoresponsive metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (PMOP, constructed from dicopper and azobenzene&#8208;containing carboxylate) in a polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;functionalized bulky ionic liquid (IL). Owing to favorable ion interactions, bulky IL molecules encircle outside PMOP, and the inter cavities are maintained. The azobenzene moieties can be isomerized freely in the PPILs to expose and shelter active sites upon visible and UV light irradiation. Hence, the adsorption capacity of PPILs is controllable by light irradiation, and the change in CO2 uptake is up to 30&#8201;% compared to neat IL. This study may inspire the development of new adsorption process regulated by light instead of pressure and temperature swing adsorption.

         <title>Facet&#8208;specific Active Surface Regulation of BixMOy (M=Mo, V, W) Nanosheets for Boosted Photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports (010) specific surface&#8208;regulated Bi2MoO6 nanosheets. The modified surface exhibits boosted CO2 photoreduction because of increased activation/adsorption of CO2 molecules. A combination of advanced characterizations and theoretical simulation confirmed performance and mechanism.







Abstract
Photocatalytic performance can be optimized via introduction of reactive sites. However, it is practically difficult to engineer these on specific photocatalyst surfaces, because of limited understanding of atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity. Here we report a facile sonication&#8208;assisted chemical reduction for specific facets regulation via oxygen deprivation on Bi&#8208;based photocatalysts. The modified Bi2MoO6 nanosheets exhibit 61.5 and 12.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO and CH4 production respectively, &#8776;3 times greater than for pristine catalyst, together with excellent stability/reproducibility of &#8776;20&#8197;h. By combining advanced characterizations and simulation, we confirm the reaction mechanism on surface&#8208;regulated photocatalysts, namely, induced defects on highly&#8208;active surface accelerate charge separation/transfer and lower the energy barrier for surface CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction. Promisingly, this method appears generalizable to a wider range of materials.

         <title>Correlation between Electrolyte Chemistry and Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Reversible Ca Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unravel the unique electrolyte chemistry in Ca metal anodes to tailor the solid electrolyte interphases characteristics, leading to the design of several promising electrolyte formulations for the reversible Ca deposition/stripping under a commercially available salt calcium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. In particular, 1&#8208;methylimidazole (MeIm)&#8208; and dimethylacetamide (DMAc)&#8208; based electrolytes allow stable cycling with low overpotentials.







Abstract
The development of rechargeable Ca metal batteries (RCMBs) is hindered by the Ca2+ passivating solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). The cation solvation structure dictated by electrolyte chemistry plays a critical role in the SEIs properties. While a relatively weak cation&#8208;solvent binding is preferred in Li metal anodes to promote anion&#8208;derived SEIs, we demonstrate an enhanced Ca deposition/stripping reversibility under a strong cation&#8208;solvent interaction, which is materialized in strongly&#8208;solvating solvent and highly&#8208;dissociated salt combinations. Such electrolyte formulations benefit the formation of solvent&#8208;occupied solvation structure and minimize the anion reduction, resulting in organic&#8208;rich/CaF2&#8208;poor SEIs for reversible Ca metal anodes. Furthermore, RCMBs paired with an organic cathode using the optimized electrolytes are demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Our work reveals the paradigm shift in SEIs design for Ca metal anodes, opening up new opportunities for emerging RCMBs.

         <title>Triflylpyridinium Enables Rapid and Scalable Controlled Reduction of Carboxylic Acids to Aldehydes using Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Building up new and efficient method for the controlled conversion of carboxylic acids to aldehydes is important. Herein, we report a rapid, modular and scalable method for the conversion of carboxylic acids to aldehydes using pinacolborane at ambient temperature, in which a triflylpyridinium reagent is used. The conversion of carboxylic acid to intermediate acylpyridinium by triflylpyridinium is new. A binary pyridine&#8208;coordinated boronium complex is generated after reduction. The unprecedented reduction of the acylpyridinium by HBpin opens up a practically direct synthesis of aldehydes from carboxylic acids. Theoretical studies indicate that the reduction of acylpyridinium requires a lower activation free energy than that of the product aldehyde. The synthetic advantage of this protocol is further highlighted by the scalable synthesis of aldehyde via continuous flow process.&#160;Configuration retention for chiral acids are presented in those syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Supramolecular H&#8208;bonding Network with Orthogonally Tunable Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enabling dynamically tunable emissive systems offers opportunities for constructing smart materials. Clusteroluminescence, as unconventional luminescence, has attracted increasing attention in both fundamental and applied sciences. Herein, we report a supramolecular poly(disulfides) network with tunable clusteroluminescence. The reticular H&#8208;bonds synergize the rigidity and mobility of dynamic networks, and endow the resulting materials with mechanical adaptivity and robustness, simultaneously enabling efficient clusteroluminescence and phosphorescence at 77 K. Orthogonally tunable luminescence are achieved in two manners, i.e., slow backbone disulfide exchange and fast side&#8208;chain metal coordination. Further exploration of the reprocessability and chemical closed&#8208;loop recycling of intrinsic dynamic networks for sustainable materials is feasible. We foresee that the synergistic strategy of dynamic chemistry offers a novel pathway and potential opportunities for smart emissive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Compatible Phototrophic Community for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 sequestration engineering is promising for carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis, and the artificial communities can solve more complex problems than monocultures. However, obtaining an ideal photosynthetic community is still a great challenging. Here, we developed a highly&#8208;compatible photosynthetic community (HCPC) by integrating a sucrose&#8208;producing CO2 sequestration module and a super&#8208;coupled module. The cyanobacteria CO2 sequestration module was obtained using stepwise metabolic engineering and then coupled with the efficient sucrose utilization module, Vibrio natriegens. Integrated omics analysis indicated enhanced photosynthetic electron transport and extracellular vesicles promote intercellular communication. Additionally, the HCPC was used to channel CO2 into valuable chemicals, enabling an overall release of &#8722;22.27 to &#8722;606.59 kgCO2e/kg in the end products. This novel light&#8208;driven community could facilitate circular economic implementation in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming Chiral Quaternary Stereocenters via Remote H&#8208;Bonding Stereoinduction in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;opening transformations of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes enable the rapid assembly of complex molecules. However, the enantioselective formation of chiral quaternary stereocenters using substrates bearing two different acceptors remains a challenge. Herein, we describe the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (3+2) cycloaddition of vinyl cyclopropanes bearing two different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, a subset of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. The key to the success of this reaction is the remote stereoinduction through hydrogen bond from chiral ligands, which thereby addressed the aforementioned challenge. A variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocycles were produced in good yields and with high stereoselectivity (up to 99% yields, 99:1 er and &gt;19:1 dr). In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and theoretical calculations, revealed the origin of the stereoselectivity and the importance of H&#8208;bonding in stereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Phonon Energies in Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Potassium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Enhanced Nonlinearity and Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical applications of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles require materials with low phonon energies to minimize nonradiative relaxation and promote nonlinear processes like upconversion. Heavy halide hosts offer low phonon energies but are challenging to synthesize as nanocrystals. Here, we demonstrate the size&#8208;controlled synthesis of low&#8208;phonon&#8208;energy KPb2X5 (X = Cl, Br) nanoparticles and the ability to tune nanocrystal phonon energies as low as 128 cm&#8208;1. KPb2Cl5 nanoparticles are moisture resistant and can be efficiently doped with lighter lanthanides. The low phonon energies of KPb2X5 nanoparticles promote upconversion luminescence from higher lanthanide excited states and enable highly nonlinear, avalanche&#8208;like emission from KPb2Cl5:Nd3+ nanoparticles. The realization of nanoparticles with tunable, ultra&#8208;low phonon energies facilitates the discovery of nanomaterials with phonon&#8208;dependent properties, precisely engineered for applications in nanoscale imaging, sensing, luminescence thermometry and energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Pore&#8208;Structure Engineering by Ligand Conformational Control of Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Based Semiconducting Porous Coordination Polymers for Efficient Chemiresistive Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with tunable structure and conductivity is attractive but remains challenging. Herein, fine pore structure engineering by ligand conformation control of naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;based semiconducting PCPs with &#960; stacking&#8208;dependent conductivity tunability was achieved. The &#960; stacking distances and ligand conformation in these isoreticular PCPs were modulated by altering the metal center with different coordination geometry. As a result, three conjugated PCPs (Co&#8208;pyNDI, Ni&#8208;pyNDI, and Zn&#8208;pyNDI) with varying pore structure and conductivity were obtained, whose crystal structures were determined by the three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction technique. The through&#8208;space charge transfer and tunable pore structure in these PCPs endow modulated selectivity and sensitivity in gas sensing. Remarkably, Zn&#8208;pyNDI can serve as a room&#8208;temperature operable chemiresitive sensor selective to acetone.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that axially chiral biaryl boronic esters can be generated with control of atropselectivity by a Binol&#8208;mediated dynamic thermodynamic resolution process. These intermediates can be progressed to enantioenriched products via stereoretentive functionalization of the carbon&#8208;boron bond. Finally, we have exploited this method in the first highly stereoselective total synthesis of  P  streptonigrin.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Structure and Dynamics Landscape of Proteins in Mammalian Cells Revealed by In&#8208;Cell NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Governing function, half life and subcellular localization, the 3D structure and dynamics of proteins are in nature constantly changing in a tightly regulated manner to fulfill the physiological and adaptive requirements of the cells. To find evidence for this hypothesis, we applied in&#8208;cell NMR to three folded model proteins and propose that the splitting of cross peaks constitutes an atomic fingerprint of distinct structural states that arise from multiple target binding co&#8208;existing inside mammalian cells. These structural states change upon protein loss of function or subcellular localisation into distinct cell compartments. In addition to peak splitting, we observed NMR signal intensity attenuations indicative of transient interactions with other molecules and dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR and DFT Studies with a Doubly Labelled 15N/6Li S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Sulfoximine Reveal Why a Directed ortho&#8208;Lithiation Requires an Excess of n&#8208;BuLi.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work shows why it is imperious to use an excess of butyllithium for a directed ortho&#8208;lithiation of a trifluoromethyl sulfoximine. The analysis of mixtures of n&#8208;BuLi and sulfoximine 1 in THF&#8208;d8 using {1H, 6Li, 13C, 15N, 19F} NMR experiments at low temperatures reveal that a first deprotonation occurs that leads to dimeric and tetrameric N&#8208;lithiated sulfoximine (93:7). Using an excess n&#8208;BuLi (5 equivalents), the second deprotonation on the ortho&#8208;position of the aromatic occurs. Six species were observed and characterized on the way. It includes three aggregates involving a sulfoximine: i) a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)] dimer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg2, 39%); ii) a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)3] tetramer solvated by six molecules of THF (Agg3, 39%); iii) a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuOLi)3] tetramer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg1, 22%). A DFT study afforded optimized solvated structures for all these aggregates, fully consistent with the NMR data.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In many metalloenzymes sulfur&#8208;containing ligands participate in catalytic processes, mainly via the involvement in electron transfer reactions. In a biomimetic approach, we now demonstrate the implication of S&#8722;ligation in cobalt mediated Oxygen Reduction Reactions (ORR). A comparative study between the catalytic ORR capabilities of the four&#8208;nitrogen bound [Co(cyclam)]2+ (cyclam = 1,5,8,11&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) (1) and the S&#8722;containing analog [Co(S2N2&#8208;cyclam)]2+ (S2N2&#8208;cyclam = 1,8&#8208;dithia&#8208;5,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane, (2) reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the intermediates formed upon dioxygen activation at the Co(II) centers in 1 and 2 point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic ORR capabilities of 2.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Double perovskites (DPs) are one of the most promising candidates for developing white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) owing to their intrinsic broadband emission from self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). Translation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DPs to one&#8208;dimensional (1D) analogues, which could break the octahedral tolerance factor limit, is so far remaining unexplored. Herein, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a series of highly luminescent 1D DP&#8208;inspired materials, (DFPD)2MIInBr6 (DFPD = 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium, MI = K+ and Rb+). Highly efficient warm&#8208;white photoluminescence quantum yield of 92 % is achieved by doping 0.3% Sb3+ in (DFPD)2KInBr6. Furthermore, single&#8208;component warm&#8208;WLEDs fabricated with (DFPD)2KInBr6:Sb&#160;yield a luminance of 300 cd/m2, which is one of the best&#8208;performing lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halides WLEDs reported so far. Our study expands the scope of In&#8208;based metal&#8208;halides from 3D to 1D, which exhibit superior optical performances and broad application prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>A Shuttle&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Cu&#8211;Li Battery based on a Sandwich&#8208;Structured Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;Li batteries leveraging the two&#8208;electron redox property of Cu can offer high energy density and low cost. However, Cu&#8208;Li batteries are plagued by limited solubility and a shuttle effect of Cu ions in traditional electrolytes, which leads to low energy density and poor cycling stability. In this work, we rationally design a solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte for solid&#8208;state Cu&#8208;Li batteries, in which a deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent gel with high Cu&#8208;ion solubility is devised as a Cu&#8208;ion reservoir while a ceramic Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 interlayer is used to block Cu&#8208;ion crossover. Because of the high ionic conductivity (0.55 mS.cm&#8208;1 at 25 oC), wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.5 V vs. Li+/Li), and high Cu ion solubility of solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte, a solid&#8208;state Cu&#8208;Li battery demonstrates a high energy density of 1,485 Wh kgCu&#8208;1and long&#8208;term cyclability with 97% capacity retention over 120 cycles. The present study lays the groundwork for future research into low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state Cu&#8208;Li batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Precise Antitumoral Photodynamic Therapy Using a Dual Receptor&#8208;Mediated Bioorthogonal Activation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted delivery and specific activation of photosensitizers can greatly improve the treatment outcome of photodynamic therapy. To this end, we report herein a novel dual receptor&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal activation approach to enhance the tumor specificity of the photodynamic action. It involves the targeted delivery of a biotinylated boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizer, which is quenched in the native form by the attached 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine unit, and an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide conjugated with a bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne moiety. Only for cancer cells that overexpress both the biotin receptor and EGFR, the two components can be internalized preferentially where they undergo an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, leading to restoration of the photodynamic activity of the BODIPY core. By using a range of cell lines with different expression levels of these two receptors, we have demonstrated that this stepwise &#8220;deliver&#8208;and&#8208;click&#8221; approach can confine the photodynamic action on a specific type of cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Economical Access to Diverse Enantiopure Tetrahydropyridines and Piperidines Enabled by Catalytic Borrowing Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a catalytic borrowing hydrogen method that enables an unprecedented, economical one&#8208;pot access to enantiopure tetrahydropyridines with minimal reagent use or waste formation. This method couples a few classes of readily available substrates with commercially available 1,3&#8208;amino alcohols, and delivers the valuable tetrahydropyridines of different substitution patterns free of  N  &#8208;protection. Such transformations are highly challenging to achieve, as multiple redox steps need to be realized in a cascade and numerous side reactions including a facile aromatization have to be overcome. Highly diastereoselective functionalizations of tetrahydropyridines also result in a general access to enantiopure di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted piperidines, which ranks the topmost frequent  N  &#8208;heterocycle in commercial drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Laser Emission from Homochiral Superstructures based on Achiral Molecules with Conformal Flexibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Without external chiral intervention, it is a challenge to form homochirality from achiral molecules with conformational flexibility. We here report on a rational strategy that uses multivalent noncovalent interactions to clamp the molecular conformational of achiral D&#8208;A molecules. These interactions overcome the otherwise dominant dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and thus disfavor their symmetric antiparallel stacking. It in turn facilitates parallel packing, leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking during crystallization and thus the formation of homochiral conglomerates. When this emergent homochirality is coupled with optical gain characteristics of the molecules, the homochiral crystals are explored as excellent circularly polarized micro&#8208;lasers with low lasing threshold (16.4 &#956;J/cm2) and high dissymmetry factor glum (0.9). This study therefore provides a facile design strategy for supramolecular chiral materials and active laser ones without the necessity of intrinsic chiral element.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Asymmetric 1,5&#8208;Conjugate Addition via Palladium Hydride&#160;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronically matched nucleophilic 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition has been well studied and widely applied in synthetic areas. In contrast, nucleophilic 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition represents an electronically forbidden process and is considered unfeasible. Here, we describe modular protocols for 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition reactions via palladium hydride catalysis. Both palladium and synergistic Pd/organocatalyst systems are developed to catalyze 1,5&#8208;conjugate reaction, followed by inter&#8208; or intramolecular [3+2] cyclization. A migratory 1,5&#8208;addition protocol is established to corroborate the feasibility of this umpolung concept. The 1,5&#8208;addition products are conveniently transformed into a series of privileged enantioenriched motifs, including polysubstituted tetrahydrofuran, dihydrofuran, cyclopropane, cyclobutane, azetidine, oxetane, thietane, spirocycle and bridged rings. Preliminary mechanistic studies corroborate the involvement of palladium hydride catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Matrix Membrane with Penetrating Subnanochannels: A Versatile Nanofluidic Platform for Selective Metal Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological ion channels penetrated through cell membrane form unique transport pathways for selective ionic conductance. Replicating the success of ion selectivity with mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) will enable new separation technologies but remains challenging. Herein, we report a soft substrate&#8208;assisted solution casting method to develop MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels for selective metal ion conduction. The MMMs are composed of penetrating Prussian white (PW) microcubes with subnanochannels in dense polyimide (PI) matrices, achieving selective monovalent metal ion conduction. The ion selectivity of K+/Mg2+ is up to 14.0, and the ion conductance of K+ can reach 45.5 &#181;S with the testing diameter of 5 mm, which can be further improved by increasing the testing area. Given the diversity of nanoporous materials and polymer matrices, we expect that the MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels could be developed into a versatile nanofluidic platform for various emerging applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming Non&#8208;Nucleic Acid Molecules into Computational Nucleic Acid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acid (NA) computation has been widely developed in the past years to solve kinds of logic and mathematic issues in both information technologies and biomedical analysis. However, the difficulty to integrate non&#8208;NA molecules limits its power as a universal platform for molecular computation. Here, we report a versatile prototype of hybridized computation integrated with both nucleic acids and non&#8208;NA molecules. Employing the conformationally controlled ligand converters, we demonstrate that non&#8208;NA molecules, including both small molecules and proteins, can be computed as nucleic acid strands to construct the circuitry with increased complexity and scalability, and can be even programmed to solve arithmetical calculations within the computational nucleic acid system. This study opens a new door for molecular computation in which all&#8208;NA circuits can be expanded with integration of various ligands, and meanwhile, ligands can be precisely programmed by the nuclei acid computation.</dc:description>
