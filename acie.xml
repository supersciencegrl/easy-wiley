         <title>On&#8208;demand Ligate and Release Strategy based on Photoclick Reaction in Tandem with Pd&#8208;mediated Deallylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chemoselective tools that can conjugate, modify and decouple chemical groups from biomacromolecules has enabled the study of biological processes at increasing levels of fidelity. Until recently, these tools can either couple chemical entities to biomacromolecules or decouple them, but not both. A method that can perform these functions in distinct steps on demand would be highly useful. To that end, we devised a new&#8208;to&#8208;nature strategy by bringing together and modifying two biocompatible transformations. In this new strategy, ligation is accomplished via the photoclick reaction between an allenyl motif with 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone which installs an allyl group at the site of conjugation. This allyl group can then be selectively utilized as a handle for phenolic release via Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated its utility in the selective labelling and delabelling of model protein scaffolds and cellular matrix. This multifunctional method paves the way for controllable &#8220;ligate and release&#8221; strategy that enables on&#8208;demand visualization of biological entities but with an in&#8208;built release mechanism to restore their original state.</dc:description>

         <title>The ATM Kinase Inhibitor AZD0156 is a Potent Inhibitor of Plasmodium Phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;Kinase (PI4K&#946;) and is an Attractive Candidate for Medicinal Chemistry Optimisation Ag&#8230;</title>

         <dc:description>New compounds targeting human malaria parasites are critical for effective malaria control and elimination. Here, we pursued the imidazoquinolinone AZD0156 (MMV1580483), a human ataxia&#8208;telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitor that completed Phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent. We validated its in vitro activity against the two main forms of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the human host, viz. the asexual blood (symptomatic) stage and sexual gametocyte (transmission) stage. Resistance selection, cross&#8208;resistance, biochemical and conditional knockdown studies revealed that AZD0156 inhibits P. falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase type III beta&#160;(PfPI4K&#946;), a clinically&#8208;validated target for the treatment of malaria. Metabolic perturbations, fixed&#8208;ratio isobolograms, killing kinetics and morphological evaluation correlated AZD0156 inhibition with other known PI4K&#946; inhibitors. The compound showed favourable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and 81% antimalarial efficacy (4 x 50 mg/kg) in a P. berghei mouse malaria infection model. Importantly, a cleaner biochemical profile was measured against human kinases (MAP4K4, MINK1) implicated in embryofoetal developmental toxicity associated with the PfPI4K&#946; inhibitor MMV390048. This improved kinase selectivity profile and structural differentiation from other PI4K&#946; inhibitors, together with its multistage antiplasmodial activity and favourable pharmacokinetic properties, makes AZD0156 an attractive candidate for target&#8208;based drug repositioning against malaria via a medicinal chemistry optimisation approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Approach for Tunable and Efficient Circularly Polarized Delayed Fluorescence and Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) in purely organic systems is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of research. Recently, the growing interest in ambient organic phosphors has offered a promising alternative for achieving CPL with remarkable quantum yields by utilizing triplet states. While supramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions are well&#8208;established to improve |glum| by enhancing magnetic transition dipole components, their application to triplet&#8208;harvesting organic systems remains unexplored. In this context, our current work introduces a supramolecular strategy to achieve highly efficient and tunable circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence by the involvement of intermolecular triplet CT states. Through&#8208;space intermolecular CT interactions between heavy atom&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (acceptors) and achiral phenyl carbazole derivatives (donors) enable one of the most efficient circularly polarized delayed luminescent systems, characterized by a high quantum yield (~46%) and a significant |glum| ~ 3.6 &#215; 10&#8315;&#178;. Additionally, the modularity of this non&#8208;covalent design allows for the tuning of emission from the orange to deep&#8208;red regions by incorporating various donors. The strategy presented here opens new avenues for designing efficient CPL&#8208;active organic phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Desulfurizative Fluorination of N&#8208;CF3 Thioformamides for the Efficient Synthesis of N(CF3)(CF2H) Amines with Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF3)(CF2H) amines, which display a 2000&#8208;fold increase in stability over N&#8208;CF3 amines. The compounds are synthesized through a desulfurization&#8211;fluorination of N&#8208;CF3 thioformamides. 








Abstract
With poor metabolic stability being a major cause of failure in drug development, there is a pressing need for strategic molecular modifications to optimize for desired properties and function. N&#8208;substitution has emerged as a powerful approach, with N&#8208;CF3 amines previously demonstrating enhanced lipophilicity and reduced susceptibility to oxidation, albeit inherent instability to hydrolysis. This report discloses the further evolution of this motif&#8212;the introduction of an additional N&#8208;difluoromethyl unit, resulting in an extraordinary 2000&#8208;fold increase in stability. We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF3)(CF2H) amines. The method relies on an operationally simple desulfurization&#8211;fluorination strategy of N&#8208;CF3 thioformamides and is characterized by broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dactyloquinone A and Spiroetherone A via a Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT) Process and a Quinol&#8211;Enedione Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of the meroterpenoid quinones dactyloquinone A and spiroetherone A were achieved from a common intermediate through the following original key steps: a metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) process with a quinone monoacetal in the case of dactyloquinone A, and a quinol&#8211;enedione rearrangement in the case of spiroetherone A.








Abstract
We report the total synthesis of dactyloquinone A and spiroetherone A from a meroterpenoid scaffold obtained by the deconjugative alkylation of a Wieland&#8211;Miescher type ketone. For dactyloquinone A, we employed an intramolecular hydrofunctionalisation of the internal trisubstituted alkene with a quinone monoacetal via a metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) process to form the key C&#9472;O bond. For spiroetherone A, we relied on a stereospecific quinol&#8211;spiroenedione rearrangement. The initially postulated structure of spiroetherone A was first synthesized, but was found to be different from the natural product. Finally, spiroetherone A was shown to be epimeric at the spirocyclic carbon. This finding was confirmed by total synthesis involving epimerization of the spirocycle via a late&#8208;stage singlet oxygen [4+2] cycloaddition to a cyclohexadiene derived from the initial enedione.

         <title>Catching Fullerenes: Synthesis of Molecular Nanogloves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we disclose the synthesis of curved cavitands. The efficient and straightforward hybridization of resorcin[4]arene and [12]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene results in well&#8208;defined rigid receptors capable of capturing fullerenes with high affinity. 








Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a new series of rigid, all meta&#8208;phenylene, conjugated deep&#8208;cavity molecules, displaying high binding affinity towards buckyballs. A facile synthetic approach with an overall combined yield of approximately 53% in the last two steps has been developed using a templating strategy that combines the general structure of resorcin[4]arene and [12]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene. These two moieties are covalently linked via four acetal bonds, resulting in a glove&#8208;like architecture. 1H NMR titration experiments reveal fullerene binding affinities (Ka) exceeding &#8805;106&#160;M&#8722;1. The size complementarity between fullerenes and these scaffolds maximizes CH&#8943;&#960; and &#960;&#8943;&#960; interactions, and their host:guest adduct resembles a ball in a glove, hence their name as nanogloves. Fullerene recognition is tested by suspending carbon soot in a solution of nanoglove in 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrachloroethane, where more than a dozen fullerenes are observed, ranging from C60 to C96.

         <title>Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Photoinitiators for High&#8208;Efficiency Visible LED and Sunlight Polymerization and High&#8208;Precision 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structured dyes enable efficient electron transfer with additives, thanks to their tailored architecture, making them ideal for high&#8208;performance photoinitiating systems. They allow the fabrication of high&#8208;precision 3D printed objects and exhibit outstanding performance under sunlight.








Abstract
This study presents the development and evaluation of five dyes with varying conjugated energy levels and donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structures as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Their photoinitiation efficiencies are systematically assessed under both visible&#8208;light LED and sunlight. Notably, the conversions reach up to 81% within just&#160;30&#160;s under sunlight, demonstrating the ultrafast and efficient polymerization capabilities of the dyes. The efficient electron transfer is facilitated by the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, where the conjugation is reduced or interrupted by the high distortion between the electron&#8208;withdrawing and the electron&#8208;releasing units. This distortion can prevent the overlap of frontier molecular orbitals, decreasing the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of dyes, thereby enhancing the electron transfer reactivity with additives. Additionally,&#160;we propose a chemical mechanism for the electron transfer reaction in the three&#8208;component systems. The study also explores the application of naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]thiazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione&#8208;based dyes as donors in additive manufacturing demonstrating their effectiveness in three different 3D printing technologies, i.e., direct laser writing (DLW), digital light processing (DLP), and liquid crystal display (LCD). These three&#8208;component formulations achieve high&#8208;precision 3D printed objects, with detailed characterization and comparison of the resulting structures.

         <title>A Programmable Nanoparticle Conversion Pathway to Monodisperse Polyelemental High Entropy Alloy, Intermetallic, and Multiphase Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelemental nanoparticles, composed of four or more elements, encompass high&#8208;entropy alloys, high&#8208;entropy intermetallics, and multiphase structures such as Janus and core&#8208;shell architectures. These nanoparticles were obtained through the thermal transformation of colloidally synthesized core&#8208;shell nanoparticles. Systematic variations in stoichiometry and metal identity of the precursor nanoparticles, combined with atomistic simulations evaluating phase stability, reveal that the final mixing states of these nanoparticles are dictated by the interplay between enthalpy and entropy of mixing.








Abstract
Polyelemental nanoparticles (PE NPs), those consisting of four or more elements, exhibit unique properties from synergistic compositional effects. Examples include high entropy alloys, high entropy intermetallics, and multiphase types, including Janus and core&#8208;shell architectures. Although colloidal syntheses offer excellent structural control for mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;elemental compositions, achieving the same control for PE NPs remains challenging. Here, this challenge is addressed with a NP conversion strategy wherein different types of PE NPs &#8211; including high entropy alloy, high entropy intermetallic, and multiphase Janus nanoparticles &#8211; are achieved through thermal transformation of readily synthesized colloidal core&#8208;shell NPs. Through systematic variations in stoichiometry and metal identity to the core&#8208;shell precursor NPs, along with atomistic simulations that probe phase stabilities, we deduce that the final mixing states of the various NPs are governed by the balance between the enthalpy and entropy of mixing. Moreover, our annealing method allows us to trap NPs at intermediate states of mixing, creating distinct surface ensembles that were evaluated as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report colloidally derived precursor NPs enabling the synthesis of all types of PE NPs in a single process. This NP conversion strategy offers a general route to diverse PE NPs.

         <title>LC&#8208;MS and High&#8208;Throughput Data Processing Solutions for Lipid Metabolic Tracing Using Bioorthogonal Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an integrated analytical and bioinformatics platform for high&#8208;throughput tracing of lipid metabolism using bioorthogonal alkyne fatty acids and optimized LC&#8208;MS workflow. Applied to human fibrosarcoma cells, the method traced fatty acid metabolism, revealing nuances in sphingolipid routing and metabolic bottlenecks, highlighting its potential for lipidomics research.








Abstract
Tracing lipid metabolism in mammalian cells presents a significant technological challenge due to the vast structural diversity of lipids involved in multiple metabolic routes. Bioorthogonal approaches based on click chemistry have revolutionized analytical performance in lipid tracing. When adapted for mass spectrometry (MS), they enable highly specific and sensitive analyses of lipid transformations at the lipidome scale. Here, we advance this approach by integrating liquid chromatography (LC) prior to MS detection and developing a software&#8208;assisted workflow for high&#8208;throughput data processing. LC separation resolved labeled and unmodified lipids, enabling qualitative and quantitative analysis of both lipidome fractions, as well as isomeric lipid species. Using synthetic standards and endogenously produced alkyne lipids, we characterized LC&#8208;MS behavior, including preferential adduct formation and the extent of in&#8208;source fragmentation. Specific fragmentation rules, derived from tandem MS experiments for 23 lipid subclasses, were implemented in Lipostar2 software for high&#8208;throughput annotation and quantification of labeled lipids. Applying this platform, we traced metabolic pathways of palmitic and oleic acid alkynes, revealing distinct lipid incorporation patterns and metabolic bottlenecks. Altogether, here we provide an integrated analytical and bioinformatics platform for high&#8208;throughput tracing of lipid metabolism using LC&#8208;MS workflow.

         <title>Hyperpolarization Modulation of the T&#8208;Type hCav3.2 Channel by Human Synenkephalin [1&#8211;53], a Shrew Neurotoxin Analogue without Paralytic Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human synenkephalin [1&#8211;53] (hSYN), an analogue peptide of shrew saliva neurotoxins, was synthesized and its structural characteristics studied. Synthetic hSYN potently activated the T&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated Ca channel hCav3.2 but did not paralyze mealworms. These findings offer new insight into neurological disorder treatment and evolutionary mechanisms of venom peptides in mammals.








Abstract
Mammalian secreted venoms mainly consist of peptides and proteases used for defense or predation. Blarina paralytic peptides (BPPs), mealworm&#8208;targeting neurotoxins from shrew, are very similar to human synenkephalin. This peptide is released from proenkephalin in the brain along with opioid peptides that mediate analgesic and antidepressant effects, though its physiological function is unclear. Here, we synthesized and characterized human synenkephalin [1&#8211;53] (hSYN) and reveal its disulfide bond connectivity. Similar to BPP2, hSYN caused a hyperpolarizing shift in the human T&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated calcium channel (hCav3.2) at 0.74&#160;&#181;M, but did not paralyze mealworms. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that hSYN and BPP2 interact with hCav3.2 channel differently, due to differences in polar residues. Since Cav3.2 channel regulates neuronal excitability and is implicated in conditions like autism and epilepsy, our findings on hSYN could provide insight into the channel gating and agonistic mechanisms, along with potential pathways for developing treatments for neurological disorders.

         <title>Plasmonic Ion Diode Membrane (PIDM) for Enhanced Nanofluidic Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a plasmonic ion diode membrane (PIDM) using COFs and 3D AuNPs to overcome permselectivity and ion concentration polarization (ICP) limitations in nanofluidic ion transport and osmotic energy harvesting. The optimized PIDM achieves 65.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 power density, demonstrating a synergistic plasmonics&#8208;ion diode strategy for efficient energy conversion.









Abstract
Efficient applications of nanofluidic devices are often limited by the insufficient ion permselectivity and inherent ion concentration polarization (ICP) phenomenon. In this work, a bio&#8208;inspired plasmonic ion diode membrane (PIDM) was designed and fabricated for enhanced ion transport and osmotic energy harvesting by integrating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and three&#8208;dimensional Au nanoparticles (3D AuNPs) into anode aluminum oxide (AAO). Under light irradiation, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation of 3D AuNPs can release huge plasmonic heat and produce abundant hot charge carriers (hot electrons and holes) simultaneously. The former heats the solution and generates a thermal gradient for boosting ion flux, while the latter transfers to the COFs layer, increasing charge density for promoting ion permselectivity. Importantly, it has been found that different COFs with varied pore sizes and charges have an obvious influence on energy harvesting efficiency. Under the optimum condition, a high output power density of 65.7&#160;W m&#8722;2 in a 500&#8208;fold concentration gradient could be achieved. This work provides a practical and efficient way to boost ion transport and enhance osmotic energy conversion by utilizing the synergistic effect of plasmonics and ion diode (ID) property.

         <title>On&#8208;Membrane Supramolecular Assemblies Serving as Bioorthogonal Gating for Melphalan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent drugs have experienced a revival for anticancer therapies. The balance among selectivity, reactivity, and potency is indispensable for safe and effective drugs. On&#8208;membrane assemblies synergize a bioorthogonal cleavage reaction to regulate the influx of a classical covalent inhibitor, Melphalan, confirming that targeted Ebioorthogonal prodrugs confer cell selectivity to covalent inhibitors without compromising the reactivity and potency.








Abstract
Covalent drugs have experienced a revival in recent decades due to their advantageous pharmacodynamic profiles and targeting of &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins. However, balancing selectivity, reactivity, and potency is essential for safe and effective drugs. Here, we employ a cell&#8208;selective bioorthogonal prodrug design to enhance the selectivity for covalent inhibitors without compromising the reactivity and potency. The upregulation of phosphatase and integrin facilitates the formation of enzyme&#8208;instructed supramolecular assemblies (EISA) on the cancer cell membrane. These assemblies localize bioorthogonal reaction handles tetrazine (Tz), which liberate Melphalan from its bioorthogonal prodrug TCO&#8208;Mel. The TCO modification disrupts the LAT1&#8208;mediated transportation, reducing cellular permeability of TCO&#8208;Mel and the corresponding cytotoxicity to normal cells. Although the cell&#8208;selective on&#8208;membrane assemblies directed prodrug activation restores Melphalan influx to inhibit cancer cell growth. This prodrug activation strategy further demonstrates potent tumor suppression with satisfactory biocompatibility in vivo. Overall, we extend the scope of bioorthogonal prodrug design for covalent drugs via regulating cellular influx of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

         <title>Pangenome Analysis of the Plant Pathogen Pseudomonas syringae&#160;Reveals Unique Natural Products for Niche Adaptation</title>

         <dc:description>
A pangenome analysis of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae reveals two novel natural product families that facilitate niche adaptation. Comprehensive genomic and chemical analyses uncover unique biosynthetic gene clusters linked to host specificity and environmental fitness.








Abstract
Pseudomonas syringae is a soil&#8208;dwelling bacterium that exhibits remarkable niche adaptability, and it is known for its devastating impact as a plant pathogen. This bacterium has an outstanding capability to produce a wide array of biologically active natural products. P. syringae coexists with amoebal predators and fungal strains, which drives the production of secondary metabolites for predator evasion in addition to niche adaptation. In this study, we conducted a broad pangenomic analysis of 18 taxonomically distinct P. syringae strains, leading to the identification of 231 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Among these, nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) were particularly abundant, indicating their potential significance within this ecological context. We discovered and elucidated the structures of two novel classes of bioactive compounds, the syrilipamides and chlorosecimides. Furthermore, a bioinformatic analysis enabled the identification of an undescribed halogenase, SecA, essential for the chlorination of secimide A. We observed that syrilipamides and secimides and in particular mixtures thereof, exhibit amoebicidal activities. Additionally, secimides showed selective antifungal activity. These findings provide valuable insights into the ecological roles of P. syringae natural products and highlight their potential for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Divergent Reaction of Bicyclo[1.1.0]Butanes With Quinones for the Synthesis of Diverse Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions between bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) and quinones yield diverse polycyclic molecules. Specifically, pyrazole&#8208;substituted BCBs afford bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, monosubstituted variants undergo cascade transformations to benzoxepines, disubstituted BCBs enable the stereoselective assembly of tetrahydrocyclobuta[b]benzofurans, while strong Lewis acids induce the formation of halogenated cyclobutane derivatives through a ring&#8208;opening reaction.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) are highly strained hydrocarbons with unique structural properties and intrinsic reactivity, making them valuable building blocks for constructing complex molecular architectures. Herein, we report the Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed divergent reactions of BCBs with quinones, yielding a diverse array of polycyclic molecules. Using Sc(OTf)&#8323; as a catalyst, pyrazole&#8208;substituted BCBs efficiently undergo formal (3&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition reactions with quinones, producing highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes featuring a caged framework. Monosubstituted BCB ketones undergo a sequential cascade involving Alder&#8208;ene reaction, 4&#960; electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening, and [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction, yielding fused benzoxepines efficiently. Disubstituted BCB esters, ketones, and amides undergo a tandem isomerization and (3&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition process, stereoselectively yielding tetrahydrocyclobuta[b]benzofuran products. Notably, strong Lewis acids such as SnCl&#8324; and BiBr&#8323; directly participate in the ring&#8208;opening reactions of monosubstituted BCB ketones, generating halogenated cyclobutane derivatives. Additionally, the synthetic potential of these approaches has been further highlighted through scale&#8208;up experiments and a range of transformations. This study demonstrates the tunability of reaction pathways based on the diverse substitution patterns of BCBs, providing efficient methods for the synthesis of a range of polycyclic compounds.

         <title>Building Ultrathin MOL/MOL S&#8208;Scheme Heterostructures toward Boosted Photocatalytic Charge Kinetics for Efficient H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin 2D morphologies, S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, and abundant open metal sites have been integrated into an advanced MOL/MOL heterostructure built from porphyrinic and pyrene&#8208;based MOLs via an accessible pH&#8208;adjusted electrostatic assembling. The thoroughly optimized charge kinetics in this architecture result in synergistically enhanced photocatalysis, achieving a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art H2 evolution activity among all&#8208;MOF systems.








Abstract
Photocatalytic efficiencies highly depend on the kinetic behaviors of photogenerated electrons in catalysts. Herein, based on the promising metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), we design and build an advantageous architecture of ultrathin MOF&#8208;layer (metal&#8208;organic layers [MOL]) heterojunctions by a facile pH&#8208;adjusted electrostatic assembling of pre&#8208;exfoliated porphyrinic and pyrene&#8208;based MOLs. Such an architecture constitutes an S&#8208;scheme junction to drive interfacial charge separation, features ultrathin structures to shorten charge transfer distances, and maximizes accessible metal sites to facilitate terminal charge reaction, thoroughly promoting the charge kinetics in materials. The resulting MOL/MOL composites perform a significantly enhanced catalytic activity for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution, 8.5 and 106 times that of individual MOLs. Further fine&#8208;tuning into more reactive metal nodes achieves an optimal H2 production (2027&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) with a high apparent quantum yield of 2.75% without additional cocatalysts, ranking among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activities from all&#8208;MOF photocatalysts. This work demonstrates an accessible and universal methodology to realize a superior ultrathin MOL/MOL heterojunction architecture toward accelerated charge kinetics, providing valuable insights for the development of efficient photocatalyst systems for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions.

         <title>P&#8208;type Cathode Material Design Guided by Material Descriptors for High&#8208;energy Density Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;type organic electrode materials (OEMs) face considerable challenges in constructing high&#8208;energy density sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to the low capacity. To preserve their voltage advantage, developing effective structural design strategies is essential. However, the lack of material descriptors hampers the efficiency of material design and screening. Herein, two material descriptors: the benzene ring/active nitrogen (R/N) ratio and energy density factor (Ef) are established to guide high&#8208;energy density SMB design. As proof of concept, triphenylamine (TPA, 3 R/N ratio and 573.6 Ef value) and a porous organic polymer condensation of triiodotriphenylamine and dihydrophenazine named p&#8208;PZA POP (1.5 R/N ratio and 907.5 Ef value) are chosen. As a result, the p&#8208;PZA POP achieves a high energy density of 524.6 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, nearly double that of TPA (273.3 Wh kg&#8208;1). Remarkably, p&#8208;PZA POP demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance from 50 &#176;C (166.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1) to &#8208;20 &#176;C (141.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1). This work establishes a theoretical framework for the rational design and screening of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OEMs through predictive material descriptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Shamrock&#8208;Shaped Giant Molecule Acceptors for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptor materials has breathed new development in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it has also introduced the issue of insufficient device stability. Enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of materials by connecting small molecules into giant molecules, thereby improving morphological stability, represents an effective material design strategy to address this issue. In this work, we have synthesized the shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecule materials T&#8208;Qx based on high efficiency Qx&#8208;series small molecule materials. Through systematically modulating the terminal and the central halogen atoms, precise control of the molecular conformation can be achieved. Notably, the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted giant molecule T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl exhibits the largest torsion angle of approximately 40&#176; and achieves the highest Tg (up to 188&#176;C) among these new materials. Photovoltaic devices based on these giant molecules demonstrate a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of approximately 0.21 eV, which results in a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) above 0.93 V. T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl presents the strongest interaction with the polymer donor PM6, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 20%. This remarkable performance is attributed to the large twisting angle that effectively prevents the excessive aggregation of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Ionic Transport Network via Supramolecular Composite Binder in Cathode for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binders play a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and stability of electrodes. However, conventional polyvinylidene fluoride binder with low ionic conductivity could not meet the ionic transport requirements of the cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, a composite binder (PPCL) derived from the cross&#8208;linking of linear molecules and mechanically interlocked molecules with typical supramolecular channel structure is designed. The supramolecular channel structure is afforded through &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin rings crosslinked polyethylene oxide chains by hydrogen bond interaction. Through the coordination of supramolecular with linear polymer, the PPCL binder provides multiple and synergistic Li+ transport channels to achieve stable Li+ transport inside the cathode. As a result, the obtained PPCL binder not only maintains exceptional adhesive strength which could achieve robust electrode structural stability but also helps to construct multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels. Therefore, with PPCL binder, the LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLBs show an excellent rate capability and long cyclic stability over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Notably, a pouch ASSLB shows excellent cycling stability over 250 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides guidance on designing high&#8208;loading cathodes for advanced ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Relocation Enables a Modular and Diastereoselective Synthesis of cis&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydrofurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diastereoselective construction of organic scaffolds from simple and commercial materials is a powerful strategy in contemporary organic synthesis. Herein, we report a novel disconnection for the direct preparation of tetrahydrofurans (THF) and corresponding derivatives from acyl chlorides and alkenes using charge relocation. Newly synthesised Hantzsch ester derivatives, functioning both as hydride sources and selectivity modulators, enabled exceptional diastereoselectivity. The wide range of alkenes tolerated is a highlight of the method, enabling the construction of structurally distinct THF&#8208;containing skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction via Metalloid Boron&#8208;Modified Zn3In2S6 for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The indirect two&#8208;step two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) dominates photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis but suffers form sluggish kinetics, &#8226;O2&#8722;&#8208;induced catalyst degradation, and spatiotemporal carrier&#8208;intermediate mismatch. Herein, we pioneer a metal&#8208;metalloid dual&#8208;site strategy to unlock the direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR pathway, demonstrated through boron&#8208;engineered Zn3In2S6 (B&#8208;ZnInS) photocatalyst with In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites. The In&#8208;B dual&#8208;site configuration creates a charge&#8208;balanced electron reservoir by charge complementation, which achieves moderate O2 adsorption via bidentate coordination and dual&#8208;channel electron transfer, preventing excessive O&#8722;O bond activation. Simultaneously, boron doping induces lattice polarization to establish a built&#8208;in electric field, quintupling photogenerated carrier lifetimes versus pristine ZnInS. These synergies redirect the O2 activation pathway from indirect to direct 2e&#8722; ORR process, delivering an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 3121 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm&#8722;2)&#8212;an 11&#8208;fold enhancement over ZnInS. The system achieves an unprecedented apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365 nm for H2O2 photosynthesis among inorganic semiconducting photocatalysts, and can continuously produce medical&#8208;grade H2O2 (3 wt%). This work provides insights for designing efficient H2O2 photocatalysts and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Ion Transport through Direct Coordination in Composite Gel Polymer Electrolytes towards High&#8208;voltage and High&#8208;loading Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte is widely used in lithium metal batteries to address dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the low oxidative decomposition potential (&lt; 4 V) of poly(ethylene oxide) limits the cyclic stability with Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes. What&#8217;s more, poor interface compatibility between fillers and polymer severely deteriorates lithium&#8208;ion pathways, which cannot achieve lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;load cathode. Herein, polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in&#8208;situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes and dendrite&#8208;free deposition on the lithium anode. In addition, a robust solid electrolyte interphase containing aluminum&#8208;based species enhances the interfacial stability of lithium anode. Meanwhile, the good compatibility between the electrolyte and the cathode effectively suppresses side reactions and contributes to the structural stabilization of the cycled cathode. The delicate design allows the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells to present excellent cycling stability from &#8722;20 oC to 60 oC. Specially, cells with 8.8 mg cm&#8722;2 cathode cycle stably for over 120 cycles. This molecular structure engineering will greatly promote the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation with Low&#8208;Valent Strontium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DFT calculations on b&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) complexes with the full series of alkaline&#8208;earth (Ae) metals show that (BDI)AeAe(BDI) complexes of the heavier Ae metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) have long weak Ae&#8208;Ae bonds that are prone to homolytic bond cleavage. They also show that isolation of (BDI)Sr(m&#8208;N2)Sr(BDI) with a side&#8208;on bridging N22&#713; dianion should be feasible. Attempts to stabilize such a complex with the superbulky BDI* ligand failed (BDI* = HC[(Me)C=N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP = 2,6&#8208;Et2CH&#8208;phenyl). A heterobimetallic approach enabled first N2 fixation with a Sr complex stabilized with a bulky bis&#8208;amide ligand DIPePNN: DIPePN&#8208;Si(Me)2CH2CH2Si(Me)2&#8208;NDIPeP. Reduction of (DIPePNN)Sr with K/KI gave (DIPePNN)2Sr2K2(N2) (6&#8208;Sr); a similar Ca product was also isolated (6&#8208;Ca). Crystal structures reveal a N22&#713; anion with side&#8208;on bonding to Ae2+ and end&#8208;on coordination to K+. DFT calculations and Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules analyses show mainly ionic bonding. Both 6&#8208;Ae complexes are synthons for hitherto unknown (BDI*)AeAe(BDI*) (Ae = Ca, Sr) and react by releasing N2 and two electrons. Although surprisingly stable in benzene, the reduction of I2 and H2 is facile. Fast reaction with Teflon led to isolation of crystalline [(DIPePNN)SrKF]2 (7) which is labile and decomposed to KF and (DIPePNN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of 6&#8208;Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble reducing agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Modification of Formate Zr&#8208;MOF (ZrFA) toward Scalable and Cost&#8208;Cutting Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mass production of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with affordable cost is highly demanding yet limited for commercial applications, e.g., purification of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (C2H4) via acetylene (C2H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) removal faces the challenge of developing low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale physisorbents with efficiency and recyclability. Herein, we developed a viable synthetic protocol to scale&#8208;up a series of ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs (ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I)) with the simplest monocarboxylate, formate (FA), through consecutive production by recycling solvent/modulator. Besides a size&#8208;exclusion effect disfavoring C2H4 adsorption, introduction of defective and Cu(I) sites was found to enhance gas affinity and uptake capacity. A comprehensive evaluation of C2H4 separation and economic efficiency has been proposed, suggesting the improvement of C2H2 uptake capacity is effective for the binary C2H2/C2H4 separation, while the separation process of the ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures depends on subtle tradeoff of complex factors and limited by challenging CO2/C2H4 separating. Notably, the large&#8208;scale separation has been testified to significantly improve separation efficiency, and the low&#8208;cost preparation benefits high economic efficiency. The distinct C2H2/C2H4/CO2 adsorption mechanism in ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I) has been elucidated by the theoretical calculations. This work may shed a light on the future C2H4 purification technology by pushing MOF&#8208;syntheses towards low&#8208;cost, scale&#8208;up, and recyclable production.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenacetin[3]arenes: Mannich&#8208;type Macrocyclization, Unique Structure, Versatile Functionalization, and Strong Allosteric Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work introduces a novel NAm&#8208;CH&#8322;&#8208;CAr&#160;macrocyclization pathway, diverging from the conventional CAr&#8208;CH&#8322;&#8208;CAr&#160;linkages prevalent in macrocyclic arenes.

         <title>Effective Hole Utilization for Atomically Dispersed Low&#8208;coordination Molybdenum Accelerating Photocatalytic C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols offers a promising strategy to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds and clean fuel H2. However, the sluggish kinetics of the alkoxy C&#8211;H bond cleavage attributes to the inefficiency utilization of photogenerated holes greatly restricts the photocatalytic activity. Here we develop atomically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets, that can greatly accelerate photocatalytic C&#8211;H activation. An internal quantum efficiency of 45.2% at 400 nm together with 99% benzaldehyde (BAD) selectivity is achieved using benzyl alcohol (BA) as a model substrate. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculation reveal that the low&#8208;coordination Mo tunes the local atomic configuration of highest occupied molecular orbital to trap holes produced under photoexcitation within picosecond. Moreover, the incorporated site&#8208;specific Mo greatly improves the lifetime and diffusion length of photogenerated holes and optimizes the driving force of alkoxy C&#8211;H activation, which are responsible for the excellent performance. This work marks a significant stride to enhance the utilization efficiency of holes for promoting photocatalytic C&#8211;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Engineering the Internal Microstructure of a Single Crystal via Nanoparticle Occlusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals are characterized by their continuous, highly ordered atomic lattices. Therefore, introducing impurities or structural defects into their matrices presents a major challenge, particularly in spatially&#8208;controlled manner. Herein, we demonstrate a nanoparticle occlusion approach that enables the microstructure of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) single crystals to be engineered in a tunable way. This is achieved by directly incorporating poly(glycerol monomethacrylate)51&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)100 [G51&#8208;B100] diblock copolymer nanoparticles into growing Cu2O crystals, leading to the formation of G51&#8208;B100@Cu2O composite crystals with structural defects localized at the G51&#8208;B100/Cu2O interfaces. The spatial distribution of these defects can be systematically engineered, ranging from surface region to the entire crystal. Remarkably, the G51&#8208;B100 occlusion endows the resulting composite crystals with excellent catalytic performance in dye degradation under dark conditions, with activity correlated to the extent of nanoparticle occlusion. This study offers a unique strategy to create interfacial defects in single crystals, imparting emerging functionalities to the resulting composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Polymer&#8208;Zeolite Imidazolate Framework Membranes for Aperture&#8208;Matched C4 Hydrocarbon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanosynthesis of polyZIF overcomes MOF&#8208;polymer phase incompatibility via in&#8208;situ polymer&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;Im coordination networks. Pore architecture engineering yielded molecular&#8208;sieving membrane transport channels that enhanced butadiene permeance to 332 GPU while maintaining outstanding selectivities against C4 hydrocarbons through the size&#8208;exclusion mechanisms. Scalable manufacturing of polyZIF membranes (&#8764;80 cm2) was realized.








Abstract
The integration of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with polymers for efficient C4 hydrocarbon separation membranes remains challenging, primarily due to inherent phase incompatibility. This work presents an in&#8208;situ synthesis strategy for polymer&#8208;zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (polyZIF), utilizing polymer&#8208;metal&#8208;ligand coordination bonds combined with structural directing agents to produce crystalline microporous frameworks. With an accessible BET surface area of 261 m2 g&#8722;1 and a permanent porosity of ca. 4.42&#160;&#197;, polyZIF membrane demonstrates butadiene permeance (&#8764;332 GPU) and the selectivity over n&#8208;butene, n&#8208;butane, iso&#8208;butene, and iso&#8208;butane (17.2, 28.1, 21.5, and 34.8) under mixed gas conditions, respectively. Demonstrating practical scalability, the improved dispersibility and reduced interfacial defects in polyZIF facilitates fabrication of large&#8208;area defect&#8208;free membranes (up to 80 cm2) while maintaining robust C4 separation performance. This advancement not only establishes a novel preparation for constructing polyZIF membranes with C4 hydrocarbon molecular&#8208;sieving capability but also provides critical insights into industrial application of ZIF&#8208;based polymer membranes.

         <title>Thionated Perylenebisimides as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers: Intersystem Crossing, Electron Spin Dynamics, and Application in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found the triplet state lifetime becomes shorter (ca. 0.12&#8211;0.78 &#181;s) with thionation of the carbonyl groups in the PBI chromophore (ca. 127 &#181;s). Both theoretical computation and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra demonstrate the enhanced spin orbit coupling (SOC) upon thionation. Intersystem crossing was observed for dianion of the thionated PBIs, and the triplet state lifetime (18&#8211;85 &#181;s) are long, thus the photoexcited dianions with ISC ability can be used as strong electron donor (the oxidation potential is &#8722;1.47 to &#8722;1.77&#160;V versus Fc/Fc+) in photocatalytic redox organic reactions.








Abstract
The thionation induced intersystem crossing (ISC) in perylenebisimide (PBI) derivatives was studied. The triplet state lifetimes of the thionated PBIs are substantially shortened (0.12&#8211;0.78 &#181;s) as compared to the unsubstituted PBI (ca. 130 &#181;s). Moreover, there is a clear trend of shortening of the triplet excited state lifetimes and the degree of thionation of the carbonyl groups in PBI. These findings rationalize the previous report of the contradictory lower 1O2 quantum yields for the PBI derivatives with more carbonyl groups thionated. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectral study shows that the zero field splitting parameters D (1625&#8211;1992&#160;MHz) of the lowest triplet states of thionated PBI are larger than that of the pristine PBI chromophore (D&#160;=&#160;1166&#160;MHz), which is attributed to the influence of sulfur atoms. Interestingly, the electron spin polarization (ESP) pattern of the TREPR spectra is inverted at longer delay time. Importantly we observed ISC for the dianion of the thionated PBI derivatives, and photoexcited dianion species can be used as super strong reductant for photocatalysis with the advantage of long excited state lifetimes (18&#8211;85 &#181;s), and the excited state oxidation potentials are &#8722;1.47 to &#8722;1.77&#160;V (versus Fc/Fc+).

By leveraging the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) sensitized lanthanide strategy, these glasses exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yield and efficient optical waveguiding in the NIR region, thus offering potential advanced NIR&#8208;II photonic applications.








Abstract
The increasing demands for modern information communication and storage necessitate the development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) active optical waveguides. However, achieving efficient NIR emission with minimal optical loss remains a critical challenge. Herein, we present a new class of rare earth single&#8208;atomic hybrid glasses, synthesized via bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly, as a solution to these limitations. By harnessing the ultralong phosphorescence of Nd3+&#8208;doped complex glasses, these materials achieve NIR&#8208;II emission extending to 1.32&#160;&#181;m with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8764;5.7%, setting a new record among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based complexes in the NIR&#8208;II region. This exceptional performance stems from the efficient sensitization of Nd3+ ions in hybrid glass, with a phosphorescence energy transfer efficiency of 93.55%. Furthermore, these transparent and flexible hybrid glasses trigger optical waveguiding in Eu3+&#8208; and Nd3+&#8208;doped microstructures, enabling ultralow&#8208;loss coefficients of 0.978&#160;dB mm&#8722;1 at 819&#160;nm and 5.1&#160;dB mm&#8722;1 at 1048&#160;nm, respectively. Therefore, this work not only demonstrates that metal&#8211;organic complex glasses with ultralong phosphorescence can effectively serve as sensitizer matrices for boosting NIR&#8208;II emission, but also supports the fabrication of 1D and 2D glassy microstructures with ultralow&#8208;loss optical waveguiding for advanced NIR&#8208;II photonic applications.

         <title>A Ketone&#8208;Accepting Pictet&#8211;Spenglerase for the Asymmetric Construction of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrahydro&#8208;&#223;&#8208;carboline Alkaloids</title>

We explore KslB, a Pictet&#8211;Spenglerase (PSase) capable of accepting ketones, in preparing 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;&#223;&#8208;carbolines. Biocatalytic optimizations show its broad promiscuity, excellent stereoselectivity, stability (TTN&#160;&gt;&#160;4&#160;38&#160;000), and application in an enzyme&#8208;cascade with tryptophan synthase. X&#8208;ray characterization demonstrate conserved features among bacterial PSases like McbB and KslB and offered insights into KslB's ability to accept ketones.








Abstract
In light of the ubiquity of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#223;&#8208;carboline (THBC) motif in alkaloid natural products, developing asymmetric methodology for its preparation is highly valuable. Despite the immense progress toward achieving stereoselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with aldehydes, the analogous reaction with ketones is still underdeveloped. Exploiting KslB, a Pictet&#8211;Spenglerase from the biosynthesis of kitasetaline, we develop a general, diastereoselective, and protecting&#8208;group free method for the construction of densely functionalized THBCs with &#945;&#8208;quaternary center by coupling tryptophan derivatives and &#945;&#8208;keto acids. We determine the stereochemistry of kitasetalic acid, KslB's physiological product and a key biosynthetic intermediate toward kitasetaline, and established that KslB's selectivity is opposite to what is achieved chemically. Our investigations of KslB show its high activity (total turnover number &gt;438000), substrate promiscuity, and tolerance for high substrate concentrations (0.1&#160;M). Additionally, a TrpB&#8208;KslB cascade enables the construction of complex tricyclic products from simple indoles in one&#8208;pot. X&#8208;ray structural characterization of KslB sheds light on potential active site interactions to account for its stereoselectivity and ability to accept ketone substrates.

         <title>Unnatural Triggers Converted From Tetrazine&#8208;Attached Sialic Acid for Activation of Optoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazine precursors (SiaTz) based on a nonO&#8208;acetylated sialic acid scaffold are rationally designed and synthesized, which can be efficiently converted into unnatural tetrazine (Tz) triggers on cancer cell surfaces via metabolic glycoengineering. These Tz triggers activate theranostic agents for multispectral optoacoustic tomographic (MSOT) imaging, enabling localization and image&#8208;guided therapy of orthotopic and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Constructing chemical groups on cell membranes through metabolic glycoengineering of unnatural sugars is an effective means to solve the issue of insufficient or even lack of targets in cancer theranostics. Herein, we address the limitations by developing a tetrazine precursor (SiaTz) based on a nonO&#8208;acetylated sialic acid scaffold and then utilizing it to create unnatural tetrazine triggers on the surface of cancer cells. SiaTz exhibits a good balance between the stability and reaction kinetics under physiological conditions and can be efficiently converted into corresponding tetrazine trigger through bypassing several size&#8208;limiting steps in metabolic glycoengineering process. We also prepare a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept theranostic combination of a trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivative (CyTCO) and a thermal&#8208;sensitive drug 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane]&#8208;dihydrochloride (AIPH) to verify the activation function of tetrazine triggers in theranostics of orthotopic and metastatic tumors. In the presence of tetrazine triggers, CyTCO can be activated via bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction to induce optoacoustic signal enhancement, enabling high&#8208;contrast diagnostic imaging and precise tumor localization to guide subsequent treatments. Tetrazine trigger&#8208;activated CyTCO displays high photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, which can cause an obvious increase in temperature under laser irradiation and then initiate AIPH decomposition to produce toxic radicals for combined therapy.

         <title>Restoring Cell&#8211;Cell Communication to Elicit Bystander Effect Using a DNA&#8208;Based Nanocomplex for Robust Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based nanocomplex, which could restore cell&#8211;cell communication to elicit bystander effect for enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING responses, was constructed. It promoted gap junctional intercellular communication for cGAMP transfer and induced bioorthogonal reaction&#8208;mediated immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, thereby enhancing STING activation and amplifying antitumor immunity. The work provided a new perspective for antitumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
The activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway has shown promise in enhancing antitumor immunity. However, the pathway involved de novo transcription and translation processes, which delays immune responses. Besides, the rapid clearance of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) by extracellular hydrolase limits its availability, attenuating STING signaling and resulting in insufficient therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we constructed a DNA&#8208;based nanocomplex, which could restore cell&#8208;cell communication to elicit bystander effect for enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING responses. By virtue of its capabilities to promote gap junctional intercellular communication for cGAMP transfer and to trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells through bioorthogonal reaction&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis, the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in tumor cells was activated and amplified in a transcription&#8208;independent, horizontal manner. The nanocomplex presented safe and robust antitumor effects against not only primary tumors but also distant and metastatic tumors via abscopal effects. The work highlighted the effects of restoring cell&#8211;cell communication on cGAS&#8208;STING activation and provided a new perspective for antitumor immunotherapy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enantiodivergent rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto oxime ethers was enabled by a chiral cobalt complex and a chiral iron complex coordinated with the same ligand. The protocol delivered various chiral 2H&#8208;azirines and its derivatives under thermal or photolytic conditions with excellent efficiency (0.05 mol% catalyst loading). Detailed mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the conformational change of intermediates regulates the lateness of the transition states.








Abstract
A metal&#8208;controlled enantiodivergent rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto oxime ethers has been developed. Switching the metal catalyst from Co(II) to Fe(II) with an identical ligand completely reverses the asymmetric induction. Both enantiomers of chiral 2H&#8208;azirines and its derivatives are accessible under thermal or photolytic conditions. The cobalt&#8208;based reaction is highly efficient even at 0.05 mol% catalyst loading. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments and density functional theory calculations, reveal that distinct electronic properties of cobalt and iron modulate intermediate conformations, thereby altering the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Boosting Current Density of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction using Metal&#8211;Enzyme Hybrid Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;enzyme (M&#8208;bCA) hybrid platform integrates highly stabilized and densely loaded bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA) immobilized on CNTs with Sn and Bi catalysts. The enzyme dynamically catalyzes the reversible interconversion between CO2 and bicarbonate, enabling rapid local CO2 regeneration at the catalyst surface. This enhanced CO2 supply boosts CO2RR current densities beyond mass transfer limits.








Abstract
As a promising solution to global warming, electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to liquid fuel has attracted great attention. A primary challenge in industrializing CO2RR technologies for producing liquid fuel is the mass transfer limitation of CO2, which significantly reduces the current density of CO2RR. This study proposes a new enzyme&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis platform for boosting CO2RR current density. This platform integrates an enzyme of bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA), stabilized on carbon nanotubes (bCA@CNT), into formate/formic acid selective metal catalysts such as tin (Sn) and bismuth (Bi) to prepare Metal&#8208;bCA (M&#8208;bCA) hybrid cathodes. The incorporation of bCA enhances both the CO2 hydration and the reversible dehydration of bicarbonate to CO2 in the cathode. This dynamic catalysis of bCA facilitates rapid local regeneration of dissolved CO2 from bicarbonate at the catalyst surface, thereby boosting the current density of CO2RR. Consequently, the formate current density of the Sn&#8208;bCA cathode was 3.3 times higher than that of the bare Sn cathode in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA)&#8208;type cell. Furthermore, the Bi&#8208;bCA cathode achieved an excellent&#160;current density of&#160;442&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 1.5 times higher than the bare Bi cathode, for direct production of highly concentrated (3.4&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1) formic acid&#160;in a 3&#8208;compartment cell.

         <title>Integrating Multifunctionalities into a 3D Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating nitrogen&#8208;rich supramolecular cages and porphyrin moieties as well as single&#8208;atomic metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) together, two metalated photoactive covalent organic frameworks are constructed for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion is still challenging. Herein, integrating nitrogen&#8208;rich organic cages and the photoactive porphyrin moieties together, a 3D covalent organic framework (COF), Cage&#8208;PorCOF, is successfully synthesized. After incorporating metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) into the cage&#8208;based COF, Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni) are subsequently constructed for the CO2 photoreduction. Catalytic experiments show impressive performance in CO2 photoreduction with CO generation rates of up to 48&#160;748 and 28&#160;446&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the first initiating hour for Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni), respectively, which is attributed to the synergistic effects from CO2&#8208;affinity of the porous frameworks and incorporated metal atoms, the light&#8208;absorption and charge separation ability of metalloporphyrin groups as well as the fully exposed single&#8208;atomic catalytic sites confirmed by both experimental and theoretical analyses. This study demonstrates that by the integration of multiple functionalities into 3D porous solids, highly effective photocatalysts for CO2 conversion can be achieved.

         <title>Mesoporous Enhanced Heterostructured Halide Solid Electrolytes with High Air Stability and High Abundance for Sustainable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NaCl&#8208;based solid electrolyte reinforced by mesoporous &#945;&#8208;AlF3 is introduced. This heterostructure halide electrolyte effectively balances the ion conductivity and air stability, with a high ionic conductivity approaching 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. The raw material cost of this Na&#8208;based electrolyte is less than $10 USD kg&#8722;1 when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding conversion&#8208;type Na//FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Chlorides and fluorides solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) exhibit contrasting extremes in ionic conductivity and moisture sensitivity. In light of these conflicting factors, we introduce a NaCl&#8208;based SE reinforced by mesoporous &#945;&#8208;AlF3 (denoted as HS&#8208;AlF3), leading to a heterostructure halide architecture, designated as NHxy (where x/y represents the mass ratio of NaCl to HS&#8208;AlF3). The high dispersion of NaCl and HS&#8208;AlF3 during mechanochemical process enables the generation of defective and amorphous structures and nanodomains in NHxy along with F&#8208;Cl anion substitution effect at grain boundaries. These factors collectively promote Na ion transport in NHxy, especially along the NaCl based heterostructures with AlF3 and NaF. This class of SEs achieves the high ionic conductivity approaching 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. Specifically, NH54 exhibits excellent long&#8208;term air stability at 35% relative humidity, maintaining high ion conductivity without degradation. The raw material cost of this Na&#8208;based electrolyte is less than $10 USD kg&#8722;1 when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding Na//Na symmetric cells demonstrate the stable cycling for at least 1000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 cells assembled with the NH54 after air exposure exhibit the remarkable longevity, sustaining over 400 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. The conversion&#8208;type Na/NH54/FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh g&#8722;1. This work opens the new pathways for inorganic SEs with enhanced economic value, ion conductivity, air stability and suitability for energy&#8208;dense conversion reaction batteries.

         <title>Mn2+&#8208;Activated Alkali Lithooxidosilicate Phosphors as Sustainable Alternative White&#8208;Light Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu2+&#8208;activated alkali lithooxidosilicates are celebrated phosphor materials. We showed for the first time that the alternative, more abundant transition metal ion Mn2+ can also be incorporated into those compounds. The phosphors show two emission bands (green and red), making them interesting candidates for pc&#8208;wLEDs with only one converting phosphor. The ratio of the two bands can be tailored by the composition of the host compound.








Abstract
Eu2+&#8208;activated alkali lithooxidosilicates have emerged as promising candidates for narrow&#8208;band cyan and green&#8208;emitting phosphors for human&#8208;centered lighting. Despite the vivid research on Eu2+&#8208;activated alkali lithooxidosilicates, little to nothing is known about the possible luminescence with other activator ions than Eu2+. The more abundant transition metal ion Mn2+ is a potential alternative emitter with tunable emission over the visible spectral range. Mn2+&#8208;activated alkali lithooxidosilicates show two emission bands in the green and red spectral range, respectively, making them intriguing candidates for one&#8208;component phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes. A total of seven Mn2+ activated compounds were prepared to elucidate possible trends. The results show that the ratio between green and red emission correlates to the size of the available activator sites and is easily controlled by the composition of the alkali lithooxidosilicate host compounds. Temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence studies reveal that thermal quenching occurs slightly above room temperature for those compounds, which may be connected to the comparably low band gaps for silicates (Eg &lt; 6&#160;eV) and a consequent thermal ionization of excited electrons into the conduction band. Overall, this study comprises the first class of compounds with efficient tailored white&#8208;light emission based on Mn2+ within one host compound.

&lt;p&gt;Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated alkali lithooxidosilicates are celebrated phosphor materials. We showed for the first time that the alternative, more abundant transition metal ion Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can also be incorporated into those compounds. The phosphors show two emission bands (green and red), making them interesting candidates for pc-wLEDs with only one converting phosphor. The ratio of the two bands can be tailored by the composition of the host compound.

         <title>Enhancing Waste Plastic Hydrogenolysis on Ru/CeO2 Through Concurrent Incorporation of Fe Single Atoms and FeOx Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We construct a high&#8208;performance low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) hydrogenolysis catalyst by selectively anchoring Fe single atoms (SAs) and FeOx nanoclusters (NCs) on Ru NCs&#8208;decorated CeO2. The interaction between FeOx NCs and Ru NCs enhances Ru&#176; content, thereby optimizing C&#9472;C cleavage kinetics, while Fe SAs act as hydrogen storage to regulate surface hydrogen coverage and suppress cascade hydrogenation, ultimately boosting liquid product yield.








Abstract
Ru&#8208;based catalysts have exhibited significant promise in converting waste plastics into valuable long&#8208;carbon chain products. However, their efficiency is hindered by the uncontrollable cascade hydrogenation, which stems from their exceptional reactivity for C&#9472;C cleavage. Herein, we reported a multi&#8208;scale regulation strategy by selectively anchoring Fe single atoms (SAs) and FeOx nanoclusters (NCs) by Ru NCs&#8208;decorated CeO2 substrates. This catalyst demonstrates an extraordinary performance, achieving nearly 100% low density polyethylene (LDPE) conversion under the conditions of 250 &#176;C and 2&#160;MPa hydrogen after 1 h, along with remarkably&#8208;improved liquid product selectivity of 86.4% compared to that of bare Ru/CeO2 (59.8%). Through a variety of spectroscopic studies, we revealed the unique interactions between FeOx NCs and Ru NCs, which leads to an increased Ru&#176; content. More significantly, we also confirmed the crucial role of Fe SAs in adsorbing active hydrogen species, thereby increasing the hydrogen coverage. Such precise regulations towards both the intrinsic surface state of Ru and its adjacent chemical environment successfully inhibited the cascade hydrogenation, ultimately resulting in a significant enhancement in the selectivity of liquid products.

         <title>Nanochanneling and Local Crystallization Engineering Accelerate Multiphase Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for Rapid Water Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallinity engineering is applied to carbon microspheres for fabricating transition metal single atoms confined in hydrophilic graphitic nanochannels by precisely etching the amorphous carbon realm. This fine&#8208;tuned nanoenvironment enhances tri&#8208;phase mass transfer and optimizes O3 nonradical activation thermodynamics by inducing the bidental &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; O3 adsorption, which reduces O3 activation barrier and accelerates reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Precise engineering of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with optimal hierarchical structures and favorable local chemical environments remains a significant challenge to cater for multiphase heterogeneous processes. Here, we develop a universal strategy for synthesizing channel&#8208;digging microspherical SACs that markedly enhance gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid mass transfer and fine&#8208;tune the thermodynamics of catalytic ozonation. By catalytically graphitizing carbon microspheres and selectively etching amorphous carbon domains via mild combustion, we fabricate cross&#8208;linked hierarchical graphitic nanochannels confining transition metal (e.g., Co, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) single atoms (TMCSs&#8208;Air). This nanoenvironment engineering increases interfacial ozone (O3) mass transfer by 3.2&#8208;fold and directs O3 adsorption from a conventional &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a bidental &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; configuration. The enhanced inter&#8208;orbital electronic interactions lower the O3 activation barrier and form highly oxidizing surface&#8208;confined O3 (*O3). Consequently, the CoCSs&#8208;Air catalyst achieves a 3.6&#8208;fold higher ozone utilization efficiency and a 4.2&#8208;fold greater turnover frequency (TOF&#160;=&#160;1580&#160;min&#8722;1) compared with pristine Co&#8208;doped carbon microspheres (CoCSs). Technical and economic evaluations further confirm the feasibility of TMCSs&#8208;Air nanoreactors in treating real&#8208;world petrochemical wastewater, highlighting its broader potential in overcoming gas diffusion barriers and tuning reaction pathways for multiphase heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Bayesian Meta&#8208;Learning for Few&#8208;Shot Reaction Outcome Prediction of Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bayesian meta&#8208;learning framework is proposed for reaction outcome prediction in low&#8208;data settings. It utilizes a literature&#8208;mined dataset on asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins to build a pre&#8208;trained model. This meta&#8208;model is shown to return better predictions as compared to single&#8208;tasks methods, such as random forest and graph neural networks, given minimal training data.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the increasing application of machine learning (ML) in chemical reaction development. These ML methods, in general, require huge training set examples. The published literature has large amounts of data, but there are modelling challenges due to the sparse nature of these datasets. Herein, we report a meta&#8208;learning workflow that can utilize the literature&#8208;mined data and return accurate predictions with limited data. A literature dataset comprising of over 12&#160;000 transition metal catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins (AHO) is chosen to demonstrate the utility of our protocol. A meta&#8208;model is trained in a binary classification setting to identify highly enantioselective AHO reactions. Two Bayesian meta&#8208;learning approaches are considered, namely, deep kernel transfer (DKT) and adaptive deep kernel fitting (ADKF). Both these methods returned better predictions compared to prototypical network, which is another popular meta&#8208;learning approach. Single&#8208;task methods, such as random forest, graph neural network, and deep kernel learning, performed worse than meta&#8208;learning methods even when trained on full training data. Additionally, we propose another meta&#8208;learning approach called ADKF&#8208;prior that is shown to further improve the performance in low&#8208;data settings. The generalizability of our meta&#8208;model is also evaluated on substrate&#8208; and time&#8208;based splits. Our meta&#8208;learning workflow can be utilized to build a pretrained meta&#8208;model for any reaction of interest, which can then be useful to predict the outcome of new but related reactions in a few&#8208;shot manners.

A strategy to construct pulse guidance ion&#8208;accelerator by ordered co&#8208;assembly of block copolymer and metal&#8208;organic framework is proposed to sequentially combine zincophilic and zincophobic properties. Multi&#8208;tiered soft&#8208;in&#8208;hard hetero&#8208;structure accelerates zinc migration and desolvation processes, resulting in significantly enhanced cycling stability to 1900 h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 5200 cycles.








Abstract
Constructing a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer to suppress dendrite growth is an effective approach in Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries. Traditional SEI layers are limited by their simple structure and composition, enabling only one functionality of either providing nucleation sites or facilitating desolvation. In this study, a pulse guidance ion&#8208;accelerator is constructed by kinetics&#8208;controlled co&#8208;assembly of zincophilic micelles and zincophobic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). The closely packed soft micelles, in conjunction with the hard MOF host particles, form a multi&#8208;tiered soft&#8208;in&#8208;hard hetero&#8208;structure that accelerates adsorption, pre&#8208;desolvation, and subsequent desolvation processes, facilitating the (002) crystal plane dendrite&#8208;free deposition. As a result, stable cycling over 1900 h (31&#160;mV polarization) in symmetric cell and 5200 cycles in the Zn//Cu battery (99.8% coulombic efficiency) can be achieved. These findings will effectively promote the development of stable and long&#8208;cycling aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer to suppress dendrite growth is an effective approach in Zn-based aqueous batteries. Traditional SEI layers are limited by their simple structure and composition, enabling only one functionality of either providing nucleation sites or facilitating desolvation. In this study, a pulse guidance ion-accelerator is constructed by kinetics-controlled co-assembly of zincophilic micelles and zincophobic metal-organic framework (MOF). The closely packed soft micelles, in conjunction with the hard MOF host particles, form a multi-tiered soft-in-hard hetero-structure that accelerates adsorption, pre-desolvation, and subsequent desolvation processes, facilitating the (002) crystal plane dendrite-free deposition. As a result, stable cycling over 1900 h (31&#160;mV polarization) in symmetric cell and 5200 cycles in the Zn//Cu battery (99.8% coulombic efficiency) can be achieved. These findings will effectively promote the development of stable and long-cycling aqueous zinc-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evaluation of Intermolecular Weak Binding Through the Zero&#8208;Field Splitting of an Endofullerene High&#8208;Spin Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron paramagnetic resonance approach was reported to reveal the weak binding in different types of supramolecular co&#8208;crystals of fullerene and porphyrin. The zero&#8208;field splitting effect of the high spin center turned out to be very sensitive to the small oblate and prolate distortion of the fullerene cage, showing that interaction between fullerenes and porphyrins followed the order of PtTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;PdTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;NiTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;ZnTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;H2TPP.








Abstract
Weak binding between molecules is becoming a renowned aspect of molecular engineering, offering an alternative to the tuning of conventional chemical bonds. However, the subtle nature of these interactions poses challenges for characterization using standard techniques. Herein, an efficient method of weak binding characterization based on the zero&#8208;field splitting of a high&#8208;spin probe by electron paramagnetic resonance is presented. Using endofullerene as the high spin center, we achieved direct comparison of the weak binding strengths in F&#8208;MTPP (M&#160;=&#160;H2, Zn, Ni, and Pd) and 2F&#8208;3MTPP (M&#160;=&#160;H2, Ni, Pd, and Pt) through the zero&#8208;field splitting parameters. The high&#8208;spin resonance spectrum is sensitive to the small variation in the supramolecular structure. By examining fullerene&#8211;porphyrin co&#8208;crystals with various metal centers and packing arrangements, the relation between intermolecular weak binding and microstructural strain on the fullerene cage is elucidated.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dearomative Epoxidation of Naphthalenes with Aqueous Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective epoxidation of naphthalenes into their corresponding arene oxides with aqueous hydrogen peroxide is described. The reaction combines dearomatization with installation of chemically versatile functionality in an enantioselective manner. Chemo and enantioselectivity relies in the synergy of a novel e&#8208;rich and sterically encumbered manganese catalyst and amino acids featuring tert&#8208;butyl leucine moiety as coligands. 








Abstract
Arenes are abundantly occurring molecules of significant interest as versatile starting materials in organic reactions. Typically, oxidation of arenes yields planar molecules such as phenols and quinones. However, several iron dependent oxygenases can disrupt the aromaticity of arenes through oxidation and introduce C(sp3)&#9472;O stereogenic centers, resulting in precious enantioenriched epoxide or diol products. Emulating this enzymatic behavior with synthetic catalysts has met little success until now. Herein we describe a catalytic chemo&#8208; and enantioselective dearomative epoxidation of naphthalenes. The singular chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity features of the reaction critically rely on a manganese catalyst that combines electron donating groups and steric demand on the ligand and activates hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions and short reaction times. Assisted with an N&#8208;protected amino acid, this catalyst epoxidizes a range of naphthalenes providing chemically versatile diepoxides in moderate to good yields and high levels of enantioselectivity. Straightforward elaboration gives diverse access to densely functionalized 3D structurally rich oxygenated molecules. The reaction constitutes a paradigmatical example of expedient access to stereochemically rich, valuable oxygenated molecules from readily available feedstocks, enabled by highly reactive yet selective biologically inspired oxidation catalysts.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Hyperbranched Polymers via Catalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent linkage of a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) monomer and a chain transfer agent (together transfer&#8208;mer) forms an ABB&#8242;&#8208;type hyperbranching agent. Slow addition of the transfer&#8208;mer to a Grubbs ruthenium complex yields hyperbranched polymers. Further chain extension creates core&#8208;shell unimolecular micelles with hydrophilic cores, enabling fast dye encapsulation. Depending on the monomer, the dye can also be released on demand.








Abstract
This work explores the synthesis, characterization, and applications of hyperbranched polymers (HBP) using a divergent ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) approach. An ABB&#8242;&#8208;type hyperbranching monomer, formed by covalently linking a traditional ROMP monomer to a chain transfer agent, was diluted with a linear comonomer to produce branched polymers with controlled molar mass and dispersity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and X&#8208;ray scattering confirmed their globular shape in solution. Additionally, we functionalized HBPs to create core&#8208;shell materials capable of encapsulating organic dyes efficiently. The study also highlights their role in sustainable polymer design, demonstrating degradation under mild acidic conditions. Core&#8208;shell particles synthesized via this approach enabled efficient capture and rapid, on&#8208;demand release of guest molecules, emphasizing their potential in drug delivery and advanced materials science.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Disruption of 1D Wire&#8208;Like Arrays of Monoatomic Ag(I) Ions: Single&#8208;Crystal Reaction with Crystal Softening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Ag(I)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic crystal featuring 1D wire&#8208;like assemblies undergoes UV&#8208;induced single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photodimerization, transforming periodic metal arrays into dimers, creating voids, and decreasing crystal stiffness.








Abstract
The exploitation of noncovalent bonding in the solid state is attractive to generate one&#8208;dimensional (1D) wire&#8208;like assemblies of metals and uncover dynamic and physical properties of such intriguing structures. Herein, we describe a metal&#8208;organic crystal based on Ag(I) ions that assemble to be organized into 1D wire&#8208;like assemblies maintained by argentophilic interactions. UV&#8208;light irradiation of the crystal composed of the 1D structures results in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization that transforms the 1D periodic metal arrays to isolated metal dimers. The structural reconfiguration creates small voids in the crystal and the resulting solids exhibit a substantial increase in softness up to 60%.

         <title>Enantioselective Abiotic Synthesis of Ribose on Chiral Mesostructured Hydroxyapatite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective abiotic synthesis of ribose was found to be catalyzed by hydroxyapatite endowed with helically lattice&#8208;distorted chiral mesostructure. Ribose with a significant d&#8208;enantiomeric excess was synthesized on the right&#8208;handed hydroxyapatite nanorods due to its enantiomeric adsorption selectivity, which provides new insights and potential evidence supporting the &#8220;RNA world&#8221; hypothesis on the origin of life.








Abstract
The prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose are crucial processes in the origin of life. However, the prebiotic emergence of enantiomerically enriched ribose on primitive Earth remains an unresolved challenge. Herein, we propose that the prebiotic enantioselective synthesis of ribose from glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde can be catalyzed by minerals naturally endowed with chiral structure. The chiral mesostructured hydroxyapatite films (CMHAPFs), which consist of lattice&#8208;distorted helical nanorods, can be formed under a hydrothermal condition in the presence of l/d&#8208;malic acid (MA), a compound that may have been present during the early stages of life's emergence. An enantiomeric excess (ee) of 22.5% for d&#8208;ribose was achieved on the d&#8208;CMHAPFs formed by d&#8208;MA. The adsorption conformation of d&#8208;ribose on the surface of right&#8208;handed hydroxyapatite is more stable than that of l&#8208;ribose. The different energy barriers for the transition states of ribose enantiomers result in the enantioselective synthesis of ribose, which is attributed to the similar conformation between ribose and the corresponding transition state. Our findings provide valuable insights into the possible role of chiral inorganics in the prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose.

         <title>Cooperative Dinuclear Gold Catalysis Unlocking 1,2&#8208;Reductive Elimination Elementary Reaction in Oxidative C&#9472;C Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#160;dinuclear PNP&#8208;Au2 catalyst has been synthesized according to ligand micro&#8208;environmental regulation, which positions two gold centers in close proximity, facilitating favorable geometric and electronic interactions for the synergistic activation of alkynes and vinyl boron reagents. Computational studies reveal a unique 1,2&#8208;cooperative activation mode for 1,2&#8208;reductive elimination process, significantly reducing the free energy barrier and stabilizing key intermediates, and provide new opportunities for cooperative catalysis.








Abstract
Cooperative catalysis enabled by dinuclear metal complexes can integrate the catalytic properties of each metal center, thus opening new avenues to achieve challenging reaction selectivity that are difficult to accomplish with mononuclear metal catalysts. Here, we present a cooperative catalysis strategy using a newly synthesized dinuclear PNP&#8208;Au2 catalyst, which positions two gold centers in close proximity, facilitating favorable geometric and electronic interactions for the synergistic activation of both coupling partners (alkynes and vinyl boron reagents) in the oxidative C&#9472;C coupling. It demonstrates a broad substrate tolerance for both terminal and internal alkynes, providing a versatile platform for the synthesis of enynes and dienes. Mechanistic and computational studies reveal a unique 1,2&#8208;cooperative activation mode, significantly reducing the free energy barrier and stabilizing the key intermediates, thus promoting C&#9472;C bond formation in an efficient manner. The DFT calculations indicate a less explored 1,2&#8208;reductive elimination elementary step. Interestingly, the use of B(OiPr)3 as an additive can effectively prevent the decomposition of dinuclear gold catalyst under oxidative fluoride&#8208;containing conditions.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Assembled From {Ni6} Nodes for Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;organic cages including MOC&#8208;18N, MOC&#8208;24N, and MOC&#8208;36N utilizing the novel hexa&#8208;nuclear {Ni6} unit as three or four connected nodes were successfully isolated, displaying superior photocatalytic activity and selectivity in converting CO2 into CO.








Abstract
Constructing cluster&#8208;based nodes and using them as catalytic sites can bring new structure and function for metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs). However, successful examples are very limited. Herein, we found that a 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (Hmmt) based {Ni6} subunit is robust in building such MOCs. The {Ni6} node is based on the central Ni4 cubane and two wing Ni(II) ions with virtually three or four connected features. When various carboxylate ligands are incorporated the triangular prismatic [Ni18(Hmmt)3(mmt)12(BPDC)6(CH3O)12(H2O)6(DMF)6] (4/MOC&#8208;18N, H2BPDC&#160;=&#160;biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid), tetrahedral&#8208;like [Ni24(Hmmt)4(mmt)16(BTC)4(CH3O)16Cl4(H2O)4(DMF)5(CH3OH)3] (5/MOC&#8208;24N, H3BTC&#160;=&#160;1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid) and the octahedral [Ni36(Hmmt)6(mmt)24(BTC)8(CH3O)24(H2O)12(DMF)12] (6/MOC&#8208;36N) can be isolated. Interestingly, MOCs 4&#8211;6 can uptake CO2 in solid states. Moreover, they can effectively and selectively convert CO2 into CO under visible light owing to the active wing Ni(II) ions, which are ancillarily coordinated with solvent molecules. All of them show turnover frequencies larger than 3500&#160;&#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and selectivity higher than 90%. This is a much higher performance compared to the usage of cage space for CO2 reduction in previously reported MOCs and competitive to most Ni(II)&#8208;based simple coordination complexes. As such, this work may open a new paradigm for designing node based catalytic function for MOCs.

         <title>Meticulous Design of High&#8208;Polarity Interface Material for FACsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency of 26.47%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a high polarity interface material, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;trimethylammonium bromide (CNCB), was synthesized to engineer the buried interface between SnO2 and perovskite of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). CNCB exhibits the multifunctions of upper film crystallization control, interfacial defects passivation, and interfacial energy level regulation. The CNCB&#8208;modified FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.47% with exceptional operational stability.








Abstract
Designing new interface materials with the multifunctions of upper film crystallization control, interfacial defects passivation, and interfacial energy level regulation is crucial for developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a high polarity interfacial material, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;trimethylammonium bromide (CNCB), was synthesized to engineer the buried interface between SnO2 and perovskite of the PSCs. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that CNCB interacts with perovskite precursors (PbI2 and FAI) to regulate crystallization kinetics, yielding perovskite films with preferred orientation and reduced defects. Simultaneously, CNCB chemically interacts with both SnO2 and perovskite surfaces, effectively passivating oxygen vacancies in SnO2 and undercoordinated Pb2&#8314; defects at the perovskite buried surface. Furthermore, the high dipole moment of CNCB induces beneficial interfacial polarization, optimizing energy level alignment and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. The CNCB&#8208;modified FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.47% with exceptional operational stability, retaining 87.14% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination. This work establishes a molecular design paradigm for multifunctional interfacial materials in perovskite optoelectronics, highlighting the synergistic roles of crystallization control, defect passivation, and dipole engineering in high&#8208;performance devices.

         <title>Gallium&#8208;Based Eutectic Alloys as Liquid Electron Donors to Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of Vanillin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that gallium&#8208;based eutectic alloys enhance catalytic performance by facilitating electron spillover to atomically dispersed ruthenium sites. The as&#8208;obtained Ru1@m&#8208;tube(GaInSn) achieved nearly 100% vanillin conversion within 5&#160;h and exhibited an impressive 93.8% selectivity for vanillyl alcohol. The electron transfer shifts the catalytic pathway, improving desorption of vanillyl alcohol and inducing a performance reversal between hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Our approach offers a novel strategy for optimizing SAC in fine chemical industries.








Abstract
Tuning the catalytic pathways of atomically dispersed single&#8208;atom catalysts (SAC) has emerged as an effective strategy to optimize their overall catalytic activity. Herein, we present Ru1@m&#8208;tube, a hollow carbon nitride&#8208;supported Ru SAC, coated with eutectic galinstan (GaInSn), as a model catalyst, we demonstrate a performance inversion in vanillin conversion. Vanillin, as a biomass&#8208;derived compound with industrial relevance, presents challenges in catalytic hydrogenation, making it an ideal model reaction to test and compare the catalyst's selectivity and efficiency. The as&#8208;obtained Ru1@m&#8208;tube(GaInSn) achieved nearly 100% vanillin conversion within 5&#160;h and exhibited an impressive 93.8% selectivity for vanillyl alcohol. Electron spillover from gallium&#8208;based eutectic alloys to highly diluted ruthenium sites enhances the desorption of vanillyl alcohol, resulting in an exceptional performance shift between hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Our findings not only offer a novel approach for modulating SAC performance via liquid&#8211;metal interfaces but also expand the understanding of promoter screening for various challenging reactions.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an efficient method to synthesize enantiomerically enriched propargyl nitriles via copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyanation of propargylic radicals, which are generated from silyl&#8208;substituted allenes or alkynes. These reactions proceeded through a highly site&#8208;selective hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) with Cu(II)&#8208;bound nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs). Notably, silyl&#8208;substituted allenes demonstrate exceptional allenic sp2 C&#9472;H bond activation selectivity, outcompeting alternative reactive sp3 C&#9472;H bonds in HAA processes.

         <title>Helical Columnar Liquid Crystal Exhibiting Both Polarization Retention and Ferroelectric Switching at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A star&#8208;shaped liquid crystal containing a polar 1,2,3&#8208;triazole group demonstrates a helical columnar assembly formed through triazolyl hydrogen bonding, resulting in stable axial macrodipoles. These macrodipoles can be ferroelectrically switched and consistently maintain a parallel arrangement even after the field is removed. The ferroelectric properties are operable at room temperature.








Abstract
Ferroelectric columnar liquid crystals (FCLCs) with switchable bistable axial polarizations are promising candidates for high&#8208;density ferroelectric random&#8208;access memory (FeRAM). However, FCLCs simultaneously exhibiting uniform polarization arrangement and ferroelectric switching at room temperature (RT) remain elusive. Herein, we report an RT&#8208;operable FCLC based on C3&#8208;symmetric star&#8208;shaped mesogen with polar linkers. Two CLCs, 1 and 2, were synthesized incorporating 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and amide linkers, respectively. 1 undergoes a ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric transition accompanied by a structural change from helical to a nonhelical columnar phase. Notably, the ferroelectric switching is operable down to RT, with complete retention of its axial macrodipole after removal of the electric field. In contrast, 2 forms only a nonhelical columnar LC phase, displaying paraelectric behavior. The contrasting self&#8208;assembly and dielectric properties are attributed to the differences in the polar unit size. This study demonstrates that the mesogen extension with a bulky 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linker enables the realization of an&#160;FCLC operable at RT, offering significant potential for high&#8208;density FeRAM applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ &#8220;confocal&#8221; electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging method with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) resolution was developed by in situ regulating the homogeneous reaction fluxes on electrode interface, in which the axial position of the ECL focal plane can be regulated from 0 to 63&#160;&#181;m, and even extends to 400&#160;&#181;m. The spatial imaging capability of the 3D ECL imaging method has been validated by the ECL sectioning imaging the topographies of single cells, cell clusters, and tissue sections.








Abstract
Endowing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging technique with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) resolution to investigate specimens at varying axial depths poses a challenging yet significant objective. Herein, a &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging method was developed using luminol as ECL probe, in which excited luminophore was formed in the vicinity of electrode surface through homogeneous chemical reactions between oppositely diffusing ECL precursors, luminol diazaquinone intermediate (L), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), confining the ECL emission in a thin plane (ECL focal plane) parallel to electrode surface at their intersection. The regulating ability of electrochemical method on the reaction fluxes of L and H2O2 was validated, regulating the axial location of the ECL focal plane from 0 to 63 &#181;m, which can even extend to 400 &#181;m by using the stable coreactant of ClO&#8722;. Leveraging the optical sectioning capability of the ECL focal plane, the &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging method was applied to bioimaging, from cells to tissue sections. It revealed cellular morphology changes during cell polarity establishment and the heterogeneous distribution of complex tubule structure in kidney tissue sections. The optical sectioning capability of &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging makes it a powerful tool for studying complex biological samples.

         <title>Deciphering the Crystallographic Effect in Radially Architectured Polycrystalline Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we reveal the crucial role of crystallography in high&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes. Unlike the belief that radial architecture's preferential texture enhances performance, we show it alters misorientation distribution by increasing low&#8208;angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries. This reduces chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation, improving Li+ diffusion and ultimately enhancing rate capability and long&#8208;term stability of the cathodes.








Abstract
Layered oxide cathode materials with primary&#8211;secondary architecture face challenges of inhomogeneous Li+ diffusion and chemomechanical degradation due to misorientations between equiaxed primary particles. Although a radial architecture, featuring elongated grains, is widely believed to enhance diffusion, it does not address the root cause of chemomechanical failure&#8212;crystallographic misorientation. The impact of crystallography on the electrochemical performance of radially architectured secondary particles, compared to conventional designs, remains poorly understood. Here, by combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we decipher the crucial role of crystallography in the performance and stability of polycrystalline high&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathode materials. Contrary to the conventional belief that a preferential texture induced by the radial architecture is the key to performance enhancement, we uncover that the radial architecture primarily alters the misorientation distribution by introducing substantially increased low&#8208;angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries that significantly mitigate chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation. This crystallographic refinement facilitates enhanced Li+ diffusion between primary particles, ultimately boosting the rate capability and long&#8208;term stability of the cathodes. By quantitatively uncovering the crystallographic influence on performance, this work provides a new avenue for optimizing Li+ diffusion kinetics and chemomechanical resilience in polycrystalline cathode materials through crystallographic engineering.

     alt="Deciphering the Crystallographic Effect in Radially Architectured Polycrystalline Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we reveal the crucial role of crystallography in high-Ni layered oxide cathodes. Unlike the belief that radial architecture's preferential texture enhances performance, we show it alters misorientation distribution by increasing low-angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries. This reduces chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation, improving Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and ultimately enhancing rate capability and long-term stability of the cathodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered oxide cathode materials with primary&#8211;secondary architecture face challenges of inhomogeneous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and chemomechanical degradation due to misorientations between equiaxed primary particles. Although a radial architecture, featuring elongated grains, is widely believed to enhance diffusion, it does not address the root cause of chemomechanical failure&#8212;crystallographic misorientation. The impact of crystallography on the electrochemical performance of radially architectured secondary particles, compared to conventional designs, remains poorly understood. Here, by combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we decipher the crucial role of crystallography in the performance and stability of polycrystalline high-Ni layered oxide cathode materials. Contrary to the conventional belief that a preferential texture induced by the radial architecture is the key to performance enhancement, we uncover that the radial architecture primarily alters the misorientation distribution by introducing substantially increased low-angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries that significantly mitigate chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation. This crystallographic refinement facilitates enhanced Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion between primary particles, ultimately boosting the rate capability and long-term stability of the cathodes. By quantitatively uncovering the crystallographic influence on performance, this work provides a new avenue for optimizing Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics and chemomechanical resilience in polycrystalline cathode materials through crystallographic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uncovering the Photochemical Conversion of Atmospheric Chlorinated Organics on Mineral Dust: In&#8208;Field Evidence of a New Source of Dioxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining in&#8208;field experiment, laboratory simulations, and theoretical calculations, this work identifies a new pathway of photochemical conversion of atmospheric chlorinated organics into polychlorinated dibenzo&#8208;p&#8208;dioxins and dibenzofurans on mineral dust particulates, underscoring the need to reassess the toxicity of commercial chlorinated organics and their secondary transformation particulates in the atmosphere.








Abstract
Hazardous chemicals are typically assessed based on their inherent toxicity, often neglecting the fact that their atmospheric secondary transformation products may exhibit increased toxicity and persistence, potentially exceeding the risks associated with the parent chemicals. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) are a significant class of commercial chemicals, but their secondary conversion in the atmosphere remains largely unknown. Herein, by combining laboratory and in&#8208;field experiments, we have identified a new conversion pathway that the CVOCs can be photochemically transformed into polychlorinated dibenzo&#8208;p&#8208;dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) on mineral dust particulates under atmospheric conditions. We showed that mineral components, particularly Fe&#8208; and Al&#8208;related oxides, can efficiently convert monochlorobenzene, dichloromethane, and perchloroethylene into PCDD/Fs under light irradiation. By combing reaction product measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that the &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 exhibited much higher propensity for dioxin formation than &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, as evidenced by its lower reaction energy barriers for both the initial phenol formation and subsequent chlorination processes. In particular, histopathological assays showed the photochemically&#8208;reacted &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 can cause severe damage to the lung and brain tissues of mice, underscoring the need to reassess the toxicity of commercial CVOCs and their secondary transformation products.

         <title>A Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Two&#8208;Dimensional Poly(Arylene Vinylene) for Efficient Electron Transport and Sensitive Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional poly(arylene vinylene) has been developed, exhibiting a narrow optical band gap and a unique electron&#8208;dominating transport with high charge carrier mobility toward ultrasensitive chemiresistors.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers and their layer&#8208;stacked 2D conjugated covalent organic frameworks, such as 2D poly(arylene vinylene)s (2D PAVs), are emerging as promising polymer semiconductors for electronics and photocatalysis. However, achieving narrow optical band gaps and efficient electron transport remains a significant challenge for this class of materials to enhance the device's performance. Here, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type 2D PAV (2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, where TBDT&#160;=&#160;thienyl&#8208;benzodithiophene and IT&#160;=&#160;s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetraone) synthesized via an Aldol&#8208;type 2D polycondensation approach. Notably, 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT benefits from an effective intralayer donor&#8211;acceptor effect, exhibiting an optical band gap of 1.15&#160;eV, the smallest among the reported 2D conjugated polymers. Density functional theory calculations reveal a unique electron&#8208;dominating transport for 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, with a strongly dispersive conduction band minimum and, thus, a small effective mass for electrons half that for holes. Additionally, terahertz spectroscopy measurements indicate a high charge mobility of 26&#160;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at room temperature for the powder sample. Given the high electron&#8208;deficiency of 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT for facile electron injection from hazardous gases and the high&#8208;mobility electron&#8208;dominating transport in the material, we further fabricate chemiresistors from 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, showing ultrasensitive SO2 analyte detection with limit of detection of 0.088&#160;ppb, significantly surpassing the reported chemiresistive SO2 sensors.

         <title>Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C with High&#8208;Density Atomically Dispersed Mn Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;step incorporation of manganese into the nitrogen&#8211;carbon materials results in an atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst with a high Mn density. This strategy promotes Mn content and anti&#8208;demetallization, enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability. After 30&#160;000 square&#8208;wave potential cycles, the fuel cell retains 81.6% of its initial peak power density.








Abstract
The utilization of transition metal&#8211;based catalysts as alternatives presents an attractive solution for enhancing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and reducing costly platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts in hydrogen fuel cells. Manganese&#8208;based nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C) is anticipated to exhibit durability due to its weaker Fenton reaction propensity. However, a key obstacle lies in boosting intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and increasing the density of Mn active sites, crucial for practical integration into fuel cell operations. Herein, a three&#8208;step method is developed to synthesize atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C materials with a rich mesoporous structure as highly effective ORR catalysts. The high Mn loading (3.42 wt%) promotes the generation of Duo&#8208;MnN4 active sites, demonstrating outstanding performance and durability for fuel cells. Specifically, the exceptional performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) reaches 649&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC) achieves 770&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Notably, the durability of the Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst in PEMFC is reported for the first time, showing only 18.4% decay after 30&#160;000 square&#8208;wave cycles. This work provides a unique perspective and a systematic design strategy for building feasible nonprecious metal catalysts with a high active site density, addressing the challenges of inefficiency and performance limitations across various electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones Enabled by a Carboxylic Acid Additive Promotion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to ligand acceleration and substrate direction strategies, this work introduces a third method to improve the efficiency of asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation, namely additive promotion. The carboxylic acid additive not only improves the reductive activity of the carbonyl group on the substrate but also improves the coordination of the hydroxyl group on the substrate and optimizes the stereocontrol environment of the key transition state so as to realize the highly efficient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl ketones.








Abstract
Highly enantioselective hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones was achieved by applying the catalytic combination of cobalt acetate and chiral Ph&#8208;BPE ligand, supplemented by a carboxylic acid additive promotion strategy. The carboxylic acid additive significantly increases both reactivity and enantioselectivity, allowing for the highly efficient generation of chiral 1,2&#8208;diols with up to 99% ee. The application utility is proved through derivations and a total synthesis of (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;eliprodil. Mechanistic studies, including control experiments and DFT calculations, support the proposed catalytic mechanism and explain the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction on Cobalt&#8208;Based Perovskite via Regulating Reaction Pathway Through Donation&#8208;Back&#8208;Donation Modulation</title>

         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (eNRR) offers environmental benefits but lacks understanding of its reaction pathways, limiting efficient, low&#8208;cost catalyst design. This study raises the strategy of enhancing eNRR by tuning the reaction pathway through a &#8220;donation&#8208;back&#8208;donation&#8221; mechanism. By controlling the spin state of cobalt, perovskite SrCoO3 with a low&#8208;spin state shows 18 times higher ammonia yield than Co3O4, demonstrating the potential of low&#8208;cost catalysts for efficient ammonia production. 








Abstract
The electrocatalytic approach of combining N2 and H2O to produce ammonia, known as the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (eNRR), has garnered significant attention due to its environmental benefits and potential for supporting a decentralized agricultural economy. However, the underlying chemistry governing the reaction pathways remains poorly understood, hindering the design of low&#8208;cost and efficient eNRR catalysts. Here we report the enhancement of the electrocatalytic eNRR activity of perovskite oxides by tuning the reaction pathway through a &#8220;donation&#8208;back&#8208;donation&#8221; mechanism. This is achieved by controlling the spin state via adjusting the distribution of d orbital electrons in low&#8208;cost transition metals, such as cobalt. Specifically, the cobalt in perovskite SrCoO3 (SC) with a low&#8208;spin state demonstrates an 18 times higher ammonia yield rate compared to that in Co3O4 and 1.5 times higher than cobalt in perovskite LaCoO3 (LC). The low spin states of cobalt in SC enable better control of the eNRR reaction pathway over the transformation of *N2H to *NHNH or *NNH2, resulting in alternating hydrogenation in SC rather than distal hydrogenation in LC with a high spin state. The unprecedented improvement in eNRR by regulating the spin state of Co demonstrates the bright of low&#8208;cost Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts for ammonia production.

         <title>Constructions of Biaryl&#8208;Bridged Macrocycles Through Phosphine&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Controlled Switch of Selectivity Between Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discloses phosphine&#8208;ligand&#8208;controlled switch of the chemoselectivity between Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular and intermolecular cyclizations. Easily dissociating P(tBu)3 ligand promotes intramolecular macrocyclization due to favorable interaction of Pd&#8208;catalyst with coordinating groups of substrates to construct strained and strain&#8208;free 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles, and PPh3 ligand affords strained&#8208;free macrocycles via intermolecular coupling pathway.








Abstract
The rigid biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles serve as core scaffolds in numerous bioactive molecules. However, constructing biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles smaller than 14&#8208;membered ring remains challenging, partially due to the strain present in the cyclic intermediates formed during their synthesis. Here, we report that a Pd catalyst supported by P(tBu)3 effectively promotes the intramolecular ortho C&#9472;H arylation of phenols with aryl bromides, leading to the efficient synthesis of both strained 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles and strain&#8208;free bimolecular counterparts. The success of this Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization in generating strained macrocycles originates from the dissociation of the P(tBu)3 ligand from the Pd center, which facilitates dual chelation of functional groups of substrates to the Pd center of palladacycle intermediate for alleviating its strain. Additionally, Pd catalysts supported by PPh3 promote intermolecular cyclization of the same substrates, enabling formation of larger macrocycles bridged by two 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl motifs. These two distinct cyclization modes illustrate how phosphine ligands control the switch of chemoselectivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugation&#8208;Promoted Electrochemiluminescence of Halogenated Covalent Organic Framework Nanoemitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a kind of promising electrochemiluminescence (ECL) crystalline nanoemitters due to their rapid intrareticular charge transfer and predesigned structures. However, the high polarization of heteroatom&#8208;containing linkages impedes the charge transfer within reticular structures. In this study, we construct a series of halogenated COFs nanoemitters composed of terephthalaldehyde ortho&#8208;substitutions and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene ligands via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The incorporation of covalently bonded halogen atoms promotes a dense electron population in carbon&#8208;carbon antibonding molecular orbitals, thereby facilitating efficient p&#8208;&#960; conjugation within the COF structure. Based on the improved intrareticular charge transfer along carbon skeleton, as evidenced by the Hall effect and terahertz spectroscopy, the brominated COF demonstrates a 49&#8208;fold enhancement in ECL intensity compared to non&#8208;halogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity. Beyond the corresponding model compounds, the conjugated frameworks of COFs significantly amplify the halogenation&#8208;induced enhancement effect. This halogenation&#8208;promoted p&#8208;&#960; conjugation in reticular skeleton provides a universal strategy to sensitize crystalline nanoemitters for decoding ECL enhancement mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have developed the first family of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable pentafluorosulfanylation (SF&#8325;) reagents. Although the SF&#8325; group is a bioisostere of the trifluoromethyl group (CF&#8323;)&#8212;exhibiting even greater electronegativity and lipophilicity, attributes that have earned it the nickname "super trifluoromethyl group"&#8212;the development of shelf&#8208;stable, non&#8208;toxic, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle SF&#8325;&#8208;incorporating reagents had remained elusive for over 70 years since its discovery. Our discovery enables the synthesis of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8208;free fluorinated compounds, offering significant advantages over traditional CF&#8323; analogs. These new reagents exhibit promising reactivity under photochemical conditions, efficiently facilitating the formation of novel SF&#8325;&#8208;containing molecules. Moreover, our approach is compatible with the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies have provided valuable insights into the underlying reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials have attracted intensive attention for their potential applications in real&#8208;time stress sensing and structural damage monitoring. To avoid interference from daylight or artificial lighting sources, the ML&#8208;based sensors can be only used in dark&#8208;field scenarios, which becomes the most serious limitation for their development. Herein, we proposed a new strategy that adjusts the ML spectra to the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region to address this challenge. By strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode, a series of diphenylphosphine oxide derivatives were successfully designed. To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293 nm (in solar&#8208;blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar&#8208;blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 nm to 741 nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar&#8208;blind UV ML materials and makes bright&#8208;field environment ML sensors possible.</dc:description>

         <title>Why Does the Performance of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalysts Decrease in Acidic Conditions?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon has emerged as a promising low&#8208;cost and durable alternative to platinum catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, its catalytic activity decreases significantly in acidic electrolytes, limiting the practical applications. Here, we report the degradation mechanisms of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts, focusing the acid&#8208;base equilibrium of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N), which serves the primary active site. We found that the electrochemical hydrogenation of pyri&#8208;N to pyri&#8208;NH, coupled with oxygen adsorption, is a critical process. While this reaction occurs at higher potentials in basic electrolytes, it shifts to lower potentials in acidic environments due to the protonation and stabilization of pyri&#8208;N. These results demonstrate that the decrease of the catalytic activity in acidic electrolytes is tied to the basicity of pyri&#8208;N. By controlling the basicity of pyri&#8208;N, specifically its pKa, a guideline for enhancing the ORR and other electrode reactions has been established.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Luminescent Nematic Liquid Crystals Enabling High&#8208;Brightness Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Chiral Co&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with simultaneous high dissymmetry factor (glum) and brightness are pivotal for advanced photonic applications but remain challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs betwwen glum value and photoluminescenc quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we report a supramolecular engineering strategy to construct intrinsically luminescent chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films via co&#8208;assembly of luminescent liquid crystals (LLCs) and chiral dopant. Firstly, five intrinsic LLCs molecules (2PFQ, 2PFBQ, 2PFB, 2PFSe, 2PFS) were synthesized by combining the biphenyl framework with dioctyl&#8208;functionalized fluorene, achieving exceptional nematic phases and high brightness with PLQY up to 99%. Then, Chiral co&#8208;assembly of the obtained LLCs with chiral dopants (P/M&#8208;THH) followed by rapid thermal quenching yielded Bragg reflection&#8208;free N*&#8208;LC films exhibiting high&#8208;brightness CPL with recorded glum values (up to 0.75) and PLQY (up to 71%). Full&#8208;color tunability and white CPL (CIE: 0.33, 0.33) were realized through precise compositional control. The simultaneous optimization of glum and PLQY enables high&#8208;brightness CPL with advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting capabilities, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;brighness CPL materials for polarized photonic and optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanism of Soft Self&#8208;assembly from Melt: The ubiquitous Heat Capacity Hump and Spontaneous Melt Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate two unusual phenomena in self&#8208;assembly of anisotropic molecules from isotropic (Iso) melt: a heat&#8208;capacity (Cp) maximum, and spontaneous formation of the recently discovered chiral liquid (Iso*). Based on experiments on new non&#8208;chiral monomers, dimers and polymers, we construct a statistical theory that shows why many complex mesostructures form in two stages: continuous equilibrium growth of nano&#8208;clusters in melt through strong interactions, causing the Cp&#8208;maximum, followed by establishment of positional long&#8208;range order (LRO) through a weak first&#8208;order transition. We also show why many achiral compounds additionally form an intermediate chiral Iso* liquid through what we find is a second&#8208;order transition. We propose that the first process is equivalent to &#8220;supramolecular polymerization&#8221; &#160;in solutions, where the lack of inter&#8208;cluster interaction rules out LRO. Furthermore, we argue that separation into a broad and a sharp transition is universal in condensed matter where strong interactions by themselves cannot lead to LRO, either because the clusters are 1D or due to strong frustration. Clusters must first grow to critical size when, at Tc, the combined weak interactions reach ~kBTc, prompting LRO formation. A situation similar to that in soft self&#8208;assembly is seen in spin ordering in magnetic crystals, but only near 0 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Negative Photochromism in Styryl Cyanines for Light&#8208;Modulated Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient photoswitches capable of complete conversion to their metastable isomer are not so common, yet highly desirable for applications in smart materials and devices. Here, we report the photochromic behavior of a series of styryl cyanine photoswitches, all demonstrating high switching efficiency, with some achieving full conversion to the metastable form. Despite structural similarities to spiropyran photoswitches, we demonstrate that the photochemistry of styryl cyanines is fundamentally different. Unlike classical photoswitches that rely on double&#8208;bond rotation, these molecules undergo substantial geometric changes via the formation of a spiro carbon. This transformation disrupts conjugation, causing a desirable blue shift in absorbance ideal for creating responsive materials and devices. We further show that the switching kinetics can be finely tuned through electronic effects of various substituents or the choice of surrounding medium. These photoswitches exhibit excellent fatigue resistance and can be easily shifted into the visible region via their acidochromic properties. Taking advantage of their high switching efficiency and affinity for acidic polymers, we finally propose their use as smart dopants to develop light&#8208;responsive materials with tunable proton transport properties under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrate Reduction for Deaminative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a deaminative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura&#8208;type coupling (SMC) of anilines with nitrate as a diazotization reagent, which integrates transition&#8208;metal catalysis with nitrate&#8208;based diazonium chemistry for the first time. The synergistic reduction of nitrate by bisulfite and boronic acids allows for both oxidative diazotization with low&#8208;valent transition metal redox transformations simultaneously. The reaction utilizes low&#8208;hazard, readily available starting materials and reagents. In comparison to previous diazonium&#8208;based Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura&#8208;couplings, the in&#8208;situ oxidation of anilines by reduction of nitrate allows larger functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Lysine&#8208;targeting, Covalent Inhibitors of Bromodomain BD1 of BET Proteins&#160;in Live Cells and Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bromodomain extra&#8208;terminal (BET) family of proteins are valuable therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. The adverse events of current pan&#8208;BET inhibitors (BETi) make the development of BET BD1&#8208; or BD2&#8208;selective inhibitors as a fresh avenue to overcome safety challenges. On the basis of various lysine&#8208;reactive covalent warheads, herein we report a set of activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; P3&#8208;P7) capable of global profiling of ligandable lysines within bromodomains (BRDs) in live cells and animals. Chemoproteomic experiments with P7 which utilizes 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA) identified 16 endogenous BRDs, thus giving a global landscape of ligandable lysines in BRDs. By further introducing EBA and salicylaldehyde into PLX51107 (a noncovalent BETi), we generated lysine&#8208;reactive, irreversible (BDS1&#8208;4) and reversible (BDS5&#8208;6) BD1 covalent inhibitors. Mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the successful covalent engagement between EBA and K91 near the acetylated lysine (Kac)&#8208;binding site of BD1 in BRD4. BDS4 showed 104&#8208;fold selectivity for BD1 over BD2 with prolonged anticancer effects. Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to RVX&#8208;208 (a reported BD2&#8208;selective noncovalent inhibitor) which showed only marginal effects. Our work serves as a useful tool to delineate distinct functions of BD1 and BD2 in future studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced Chirality and Vibrational Optical Activity in an Ionic&#8208;Liquid Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we show that the four conformers of the regularly used ionic liquid anion bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [NTf2]&#8208; are true enantiomeric pairs by analyzing their calculated vibrational circular dichroism spectra.
The significant modes involve those atoms of the anion that form specific hydrogen bond patterns with the chiral probe molecule propylene oxide.
Adding this probe molecule to the ionic liquid 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl&#8208;sulfonyl)imide, the experimental and simulated spectra indicate intermolecular interaction between the chiral molecule and the liquid and thus the induction of chirality in the anion.
This emergence of chirality in the ionic liquid takes place via the hydrogen bonding between the anion of the ionic liquid and the solute, which results in a redistribution of the symmetric occurrence of conformers to an asymmetric one.
Altogether this study reveals the mechanism of chiral induction from the propylene oxide molecule to the ionic liquid anion, while pointing out the importance of rational over a random choice of the ionic liquid building units.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Desolventization and Lithium&#8208;Rich Sites for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effectively managing Li+ migration behaviors and addressing the issues of side reactions at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface is crucial for advancing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work introduces a two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding and lithiophilic sites for the first time to tailor the electronic structure and solvation chemistry in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) based electrolyte and stabilize the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) interface. Initially, the abundant lithiophilic sites (C=O, C=N) in the HOF coordinate with Li+, acting as key electron donors to optimize the electronic structure while also reducing the desolvation energy barrier when Li+ dissociates from the solvent sheath. Moreover, the multifunctional hydrogen bonding not only acts as the &#8220;appended manipulator&#8221; to anchor &#8208;NH2 to LiTFSI and reduces the adverse reactions at the LMAs interface but also mitigates the mechanical stress during lithium deposition. As evidenced by various in/ex situ characterizations, the HOF&#8208;modified lithium&#8208;metal symmetric batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycling performance (11000 h) and low voltage fluctuations at 3 mA cm&#8208;2. This unique strategy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded synergistic lithiophilic sites provides a new perspective on the design of artificial interfacial layers for stabilizing lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine learning&#8208;augmented molecular dynamics simulations (MD) reveal insights into the disconnect between affinity and activation of ZTP riboswitch ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The challenge of targeting RNA with small molecules necessitates a better understanding of RNA&#8208;ligand interaction mechanisms. However, the dynamic nature of nucleic acids,
their ligand&#8208;induced stabilization, and how conformational changes influence gene expression pose significant difficulties for experimental investigation. This work employs a combination of computational and experimental methods to address these challenges. By integrating structure&#8208;informed design, crystallography, and machine learning&#8208;augmented all&#160;atom molecular dynamics simulations (MD) we synthesized, biophysically and biochemically characterized, and studied the dissociation of a library of small molecule activators of the ZTP riboswitch, a ligand&#8208;binding RNA motif that regulates bacterial gene expression. We uncovered key interaction mechanisms, revealing valuable insights into the role of ligand binding kinetics on riboswitch activation. Further, we established that ligand on&#8208;rates determine activation potency as opposed to binding affinity and elucidated RNA structural differences, which provide mechanistic insights into the interplay of RNA structure on riboswitch activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Thioamides Adjacent to the Ionizable Amine Headgroup in Ionizable Lipids Reduce the pKa of Lipid Nanoparticles and Enhance mRNA transfection efficiency In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most clinically advanced mRNA delivery vectors. However, optimizing LNPs for in vivo applications remains largely empirical. The apparent pKa of LNPs is a predictive factor for in vivo performance, with pKa values between 6 and 7 showing the highest efficacy. Despite this critical role of ionizable lipids in LNPs, the relationship between lipid structure and its influence on LNP pKa remains poorly studied. In this study, we report the design and the synthesis of a novel class of ionizable lipids featuring a thioamide moiety, enabling direct comparison between thioamide&#8208;containing (SAM) LNPs and amide&#8208;containing (OAM) LNPs. We find that substituting oxygen with sulfur in the amide group significantly decreases the apparent pKa of LNPs, increasing the likelihood of identifying lipids in combinatorial libraries that yield LNPs with a pKa in the desired 6&#8211;7 range. The reduction in pKa in LNPs containing SAM lipids, compared with OAM lipids, is attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the thioamide group. Furthermore, by synthesizing multiple libraries of SAM lipids and varying the ionizable head group, alkyl chains, and linker length, we discovered thioamide lipids with distinct tissue tropism, including lipids that mediate splenic targeting by LNPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Zn&#8208;ion Solvation Structures for Enhanced Durability and Efficiency in Zinc&#8208;Bromine Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) are among the most appealing technologies for large&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their scalability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, safety and sustainability. However, their long&#8208;term durability is challenged by issues like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendritic zinc electroplating. Herein, we address these challenges by reshaping the Zn2+ ion solvation structures in zinc bromide (ZnBr2) aqueous electrolytes using a robust hydrogen bond acceptor as a co&#8208;solvent additive. Our findings highlight the critical role of interactions within the first and second Zn2+ solvation shells in determining electrochemical performance. By selectively incorporating a low volume percentage of organic additive into the second coordination shell, we achieve effective proton capture, electrolyte pH stabilisation during the Zn0 electroplating, and mitigation of ion transport resistance. This approach prevents the formation of a passivation interphase layer on the electrode surface, which typically occurs with higher additive concentrations, leading to increased interphase resistance, viscosity and cell polarization. This work opens a new avenue in modulating Zn2+ reactivity and stability through precise solvation structure design, enabling efficient and reversible Zn0/2+ cycling in aqueous electrolytes without H2 evolution. These findings pave the way for the development of commercially viable, high&#8208;performance ZBFBs for energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Organocatalysis with Bidentate Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the employment of &#8221;non&#8208;classical&#8221; non&#8208;covalent interactions like halogen bonding (XB) in asymmetric catalysis is still at a very early stage, there are significant challenges to overcome. In some reported cases, the relevance of halogen bonding to the catalytic action is unclear, while in others, catalyst activity is limited. Herein, we present the second generation of a bidentate iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen bond donor as a modifiable and highly active chiral halogen bonding catalyst. With these modified derivatives, high stereocontrol of up to 98% ee could be achieved in a model Mukaiyama aldol reaction for a range of different substrates. Importantly, the crucial role of halogen bonding in this catalytic process was demonstrated by the low performance of the non&#8208;iodinated variants and by DFT calculations. The latter also indicate that the stereoinduction is based on the imposed orientation of the substrates towards each other.</dc:description>

         <title>Photodriven Aquatic Locomotion in Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Composites with Tunable Wettability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) composites with thiol&#8208;functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets are introduced as a versatile material system for achieving controlled locomotion. By incorporating superhydrophobic or&#160;superhydrophilic coatings, these composites demonstrate distinct modalities at the air&#8211;water interface and underwater. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the LCE nanocomposites is enhanced through the homogeneous dispersion of MXene platelets within the LCE matrix, facilitated by thiol&#8208;functionalization. Superhydrophobic coatings increase buoyancy and reduce drag, enabling locomotion akin to water striders at the air&#8211;water interface. Conversely, superhydrophilic coatings submerse the composites, allowing photomechanical actuation to drive underwater locomotion against gravity. By combining tunable wettability with robust photothermal performance, these MXene&#8208;LCE composites open new opportunities for designing and integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in aquatic actuation systems.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8203;&#8203;Bromide as Non&#8208;innocent Ligand to Iron Tames Fenton Chemistry for Chemoselective Non&#8208;degrading Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has long been the chemistry dogma that the nitrogen&#8208;based ligand of iron complexes determines the redox reactivity: tetra&#8208; and/or pentadentate nitrogen&#8208;based ligand (N&#8208;ligand: PDP, porphyrin, N4Py) enables chemo&#8208;selective oxidation through high&#8208;valent iron species (FeIV/V=O), while bi&#8208; and/or tridentate N&#8208;ligand leads to the generation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) (i.e., hydroxyl radical) via a Fenton chemistry pathway. The effect of inorganic anionic ligand (i.e., halides, pseudohalides, triflate, nitrate, sulfate, etc) of these iron complexes has rarely been examined and overlooked as an &#8220;innocent&#8221; anion. Herein, we report our discovery that bromide (Br&#8722;) is not an innocent ligand to the iron&#8208;BPMA complexes but a decisive factor for taming the Fenton chemistry (ROS) into a mild [HOBr] oxidant, which allows for chemo&#8208; and regioselective oxidation of furans, indoles, and sulfides without noticeable degradation. In contrast to the conventional Fenton chemistry pathway by many tridentate N&#8208;ligand iron complexes, our Fe(BMPA)Br3 mimics haloperoxidases to generate HOBr by oxidation of bromide ion with hydrogen peroxide. The discovery of the bromide effect on iron complexes bridges the gap of Fenton chemistry and haloperoxidase&#8208;catalyzed halogenation and might stimulate interest in reinvestigating the &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligand of iron complexes for discovery of new reactivity and new applications.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Nanographenes Through Domino Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis has emerged as a powerful method to synthesize nanographenes that are difficult to obtain through the solution chemistry, but the number of available reactions is still highly limited. In this study, we demonstrate an unprecedented on&#8208;surface domino cyclization of bis{2&#8208;(7&#8208;formylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl}diacetylene, leading to dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene and peryleno[2,1,12,11&#8208;fghij]pentaphene through a sequence of 1) cycloisomerization of diaryldiacetylene moieties, 2) oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, and 3) reductive cyclization of formyl groups. The structures of these nanographenes and other cyclized products were unambiguously elucidated by using scanning tunneling microscopy directly on Au(111). Moreover, their electronic properties were investigated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. Our findings offer new insights into the on&#8208;surface cyclization reactions, providing an effective strategy for synthesizing a wider variety of carbon nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous improvement of mechanical strength, toughness, and self&#8208;healability of elastomers enabled by F&#8211;H&#8208;bond&#8208;based nanoconfinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are often trade&#8208;offs among high mechanical strength, high toughness, and efficient self&#8208;healing. Herein, we present a biomimetic strategy utilizing F&#8211;H bonds for nanoconfinement to achieve the simultaneous enhancement of these conflicting properties. The mechanical strength, toughness, and self&#8208;healing efficiency of a fluorinated crosslinked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) (CPUU&#8208;FA) elastomer are improved 1.3&#8208;, 1.5&#8208;, and 1.2&#8208;fold, respectively, compared with those of its non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart. Notably, the CPUU&#8208;FA has the highest recorded puncture energy (887 mJ) among polymeric elastomers and the highest fracture energy (117 kJ m&#8211;2) among reported thermoset elastomers. Moreover, it exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing efficiency (99%), remarkable reprocessability, and a low surface energy (56 MJ m&#8211;2). The application of self&#8208;healing elastomers in the fabrication of soft electronics is further demonstrated. The molecular design strategy is anticipated to inspire new developments in high&#8208;performance materials for cutting&#8208;edge applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Position Effects of Monoatom Doping in Silver Nanoclusters on Oxygen Reduction by Single Entity Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying nanoclusters (NCs) with monoatom doping represent an effective strategy to enhance catalytic performances due to the synergistic interactions between the dopant and host atoms. However, in&#8208;depth understanding the position effects of monoatom doping within alloying NCs, particularly at the atomic level, remains elusive. Here, we employed single entity collision electrochemistry method to investigate the electrocatalytic behaviors of individual monoatom&#8208;doped bimetallic M1Ag24 (M= Ag, Au, Pt, Cu) NCs toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By relying on high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput electrochemical measurements, we successfully discriminated the effects of monoatom variation in M1Ag24 NCs on ORR activity at the single atom resolution and identified different M1Ag24 NCs across characteristic populations. Our experimental findings and theoretical calculations reveal the electrocatalytic reaction dynamics associated with intracluster migration of Au monoatom during the dynamic alloying process of Au1Ag24 NCs. This work demonstrates a novel approach for in situ indentifying the position effects of foreign doping atoms on the electrocatalytic activity of alloy NCs at the single atom level.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Electrocyclization Assembles 2,2&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran in Fungal Indole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pericyclic reactions, such as cycloaddition and electrocyclization, are among the most useful approaches for constructing complex natural products with diverse biological activities. While enzymatic pericyclic reactions have been increasingly reported in recent years, there are only few examples of enzyme&#8208;mediated electrocyclization reactions. The 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran (DMP) ring plays a significant role in constituting many bioactive fungal and plant natural products. In this study, we characterize the vsc biosynthetic gene cluster of the DMP&#8208;containing natural product versicamide A (1) in Aspergillus versicolor DL0022. The biosynthetic route for DMP formation and biochemical functions of the involved enzymes are fully elucidated. Specifically, we reveal that the berberine bridge&#8208;like oxidoreductase VscB mediates a crucial oxidative process, followed by an electrocyclization to form a C&#8722;O bridge bond, thereby affording the key DMP ring. Structural simulation, molecular modeling, mutational analysis, and quantum chemical calculations elucidate the oxidative electrocyclization mechanism. The FAD cofactor of VscB/NotD' facilitates hydride abstraction at the C25 position of the substrate, while the key amino acid residue E529 acts as a general base to deprotonate the C6 hydroxyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets for the Assembly of Efficient Membrane Bioreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immobilizing fragile enzymes in porous materials holds significant potential for biocatalysis but encounters challenges such as mismatched enzyme size and pore structure of host materials, along with harsh assembly conditions that can denature enzymes. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for constructing membrane bioreactors through water&#8208;mediated, vacuum&#8208;assisted layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets with enzymes. This method effectively addresses pore size limitations, preserves enzyme activity, and promotes convective transport of reactants to active sites, while shielding enzymes from harmful by&#8208;products through rapid transport in continuous membrane catalysis. The optimized bioreactor achieves a 1018&#8208;fold increase in relative activity compared to free enzymes in batch reactions, completing substrate conversion in just 7.95 seconds, and demonstrating enhanced stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain Energy Induced Rotary Speed Acceleration in&#160;a&#160;Light&#8208;driven Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven molecular motors based on over&#8208;crowded alkenes represent a major type of molecular machines that are able to rotate unidirectionally. The regulation of the rotary speed without altering the core structure of a motor is crucial and remains a major challenge. In the present study, we reported that the rotary speed of molecular motors can be significantly enhanced by harnessing the strain energy of cycloparaphenylene (CPP). A series of molecular motors incorporated in CPP with varying sizes were synthesized, and their photochemical and thermal isomerization behaviors were meticulously examined using UV&#8211;vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The remarkable increase of acceleration effect of the rotary speed with decreasing macrocycle sizes, up to 389&#8208;fold, can be attributed to the strain energy induced bending in the stator part, which reduces steric hindrance in the "fjord region" of the molecule, supported by a detailed computational study employing density functional theory. This work provides systematic insight into the behavior of molecular motors under strain energy, thereby paving the way for the application of motor&#8208;incorporating CPPs as a general strategy to accelerate the rotary speed of molecular motors.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Cyclic Olefin Polymers via Group Transfer Radical Cyclopolymerization for High Performance in Anode&#8208;Free Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic olefin polymers (COPs) are of high importance in optical and medical materials. These materials are typically synthesized via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene derivatives, using metallocene catalysts, followed by high&#8208;pressure hydrogenation catalyzed by noble metals. However, the complex synthetic processes, the continuous use of expensive catalysts, and the need to remove metal residues remain substantial barriers in COP production. In contrast, radical cyclopolymerization of dienes, which eliminates the need for metal catalysis and hydrogenation, offers a promising alternative for COP synthesis. Nevertheless, chain transfer reactions hinder the radical polymerization of non&#8208;conjugated dienes. To address these challenges, we present a novel strategy, group transfer radical cyclopolymerization (GTRCP), which effectively suppresses chain transfer and enables radical polymerization of dienes to yield COPs. This approach allows for the production of a broad range of sequenceregulated COPs with high molecular weights and low dispersity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the proposed GTRCP mechanism, highlighting its efficiency and selectivity, driven by substantial thermodynamic forces. The resulting COPs demonstrate great potentials as the interphase layer materials in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries, significantly enhancing the cycling performance towards practical energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Thrombus Boring Microrobot Prepared by an Integrated Phase Separation and Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembly Process towards Thrombolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pathological formation of thrombi is the primary etiological factor of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, accounting for one&#8208;quarter of global fatalities. Traditional thrombolytic drugs are constrained by short half&#8208;life, low utilization, and severe complications. Inspired by the tunnel boring machine to excavate strata into small rocks, we reported urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)&#8208;modified thrombus boring microrobots (uTBMs), prepared by a one&#8208;step integrated phase separation and interfacial self&#8208;assembly process, for effective thrombolysis. The uTBMs are composed of microspheres capped with dual&#8208;layered structures of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and cilia nanostructures. In situ observation reveals the integrated phase separation and interfacial self&#8208;assembly process of the uTBMs within an emulsion droplet. The capped layer of MNPs allows for controllable motion and rotation behavior under the manipulation of a remote magnetic field. The uPA&#8208;modified cilia nanostructures grasp and degrade the fibrin network, synergizing with the uTBMs rotation to mechanically excavate blood cells from thrombus individually, achieving ~8.5&#8208;fold higher thrombolytic efficacy than uPA alone. This research demonstrates the feasibility of controllably fabricating and modifying complex&#8208;structured microrobots via the simple process towards the potential thrombus therapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a versatile platform for the synthesis of functional polyacetals from sugar and furfuryl alcohol derivatives using controlled cascade enyne metathesis polymerization. A range of monomers with defined stereochemistry were explored that featured broad functional group tolerance. The polymerization showed living character and permitted preparation of functionalized polyacetals with targetable molecular weights and more complex architectures. In addition, by harnessing the chiral nature of starting materials, the method granted facile access to chiral polyacetals. Modulation of regiochemical and substituent factors around the acetal motif conferred tunable hydrolysis rate, as well as photodegradability when installed with an ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl group. The polymer structure was further elaborated by post&#8208;polymerization modification via leveraging the reactivity of suitable pendent groups and preparation of fully degradable bottlebrush polymers via graft&#8208;through polymerization. Further utilities of the method were&#160;showcased by the preparation of amphiphilic copolymers with complete degradability that exhibited self&#8208;assembly behaviors through copolymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing the Aziridination of Fluorinated Olefins by Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic system for the aziridination of fluorinated olefins using the metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer strategy is described. The transformation is stereospecific and takes place through a concerted addition of the olefin to the metal&#8208;nitrene intermediates.








Abstract
After decades of development of the metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions to olefins, examples involving the use of fluorinated olefins is yet unknown, despite the current importance of fluorocompounds. Herein we describe the use of copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;based catalysts for a general protocol that converts &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;fluoro olefins into the corresponding aziridines in high yields.

         <title>A Fluorine&#8208;Free Organic/Inorganic Interphase for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (NAG) is proposed as an additive for achieving aqueous Zn batteries combining performance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendliness, which not only modulates the Zn2+ solvation structure but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of an F&#8208;free organic (zinc chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI layer. 








Abstract
Construction of robust solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) has proved effective in mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions of zinc (Zn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes. Fluorinated SEIs, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional electrochemical stability and high Zn2+ conductivity. However, the formation of such SEIs typically relies on the use of fluorine (F)&#8208;containing precursors, which inadvertently raise environmental and biological concerns because they show high resistance to degradation in natural environments. Herein, we develop an F&#8208;free organic/inorganic hybrid SEI for aqueous Zn batteries using a low&#8208;cost N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (NAG) electrolyte additive. The NAG additive not only modulates the solvation structure of Zn2+ but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of a robust organic (Zn chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI layer, thereby enhancing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and Zn plating/stripping reversibility. Consequently, the Zn anode exhibits a long&#8208;term cycling over 6500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8210;2, a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8210;2, and greatly extended cycling stability in full cells (up to 2000 cycles). Our electrolyte design paves a promising avenue toward practical Zn batteries that combine performance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendliness.

&lt;p&gt;N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) is proposed as an additive for achieving aqueous Zn batteries combining performance, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendliness, which not only modulates the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation structure but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of an F-free organic (zinc chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) hybrid SEI layer. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction of robust solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) has proved effective in mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions of zinc (Zn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes. Fluorinated SEIs, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional electrochemical stability and high Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity. However, the formation of such SEIs typically relies on the use of fluorine (F)-containing precursors, which inadvertently raise environmental and biological concerns because they show high resistance to degradation in natural environments. Herein, we develop an F-free organic/inorganic hybrid SEI for aqueous Zn batteries using a low-cost N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) electrolyte additive. The NAG additive not only modulates the solvation structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of a robust organic (Zn chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) hybrid SEI layer, thereby enhancing Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation kinetics and Zn plating/stripping reversibility. Consequently, the Zn anode exhibits a long-term cycling over 6500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and greatly extended cycling stability in full cells (up to 2000 cycles). Our electrolyte design paves a promising avenue toward practical Zn batteries that combine performance, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Interconversion of Pyridine Dicarbanion&#8208;Bonded Ag13 Nanocluster Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigate the interplay between solvent environments and structural evolution of in situ formed polynuclear organometallic cluster intermediates. The solvent&#8208;mediated interconversion between two structural isomers reveals distinct stability and reactivity profiles, which stem from solvent&#8208;regulated variations in metal&#8211;metal bonding interactions and adaptive ligand configurations.








Abstract
Solvent screening is pivotal for optimizing metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, yet its impact on the in situ formation and reactivity of polynuclear organometallic clusters remains underexplored. We herein isolate two distinct thirteen&#8208;membered silver cluster isomers, Ag13&#8208;A and Ag13&#8208;M, in acetone and methanol, respectively. Significantly, we demonstrate the interconversion of these isomers facilitated by solvent manipulation. Mechanistic studies on the solvent&#8208;driven Ag13&#8208;A to Ag13&#8208;M transformation reveal this transformation proceeds with a low activation energy (23.39 &#177; 0.81 kcal mol&#8722;1) and positive entropy, involving counter anion dissociation, ligand twisting, and re&#8208;coordination. The observed differences in thermal stability and reactivity between two isomers are attributed to variations in Ag&#8211;Ag interactions and surface ligand arrangements, underscoring the critical role of solvent selection in affecting the whole organic transformation through in situ formed clusters. These results highlight the necessity of considering organometallic cluster intermediates in solvent screening.

         <title>Phosphorescent Iridium(III) Phenanthrolinedione Complexes as Lifetime&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Probes for Wash&#8208;Free Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging of Cellular Labeling</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a series of iridium(III) phenanthrolinedione complexes exhibiting sensitive phosphorescence responses, particularly lifetime changes, to bioorthogonal reactions with &#945;&#8208;angelica lactone&#8208;modified biomolecules. These complexes enabled wash&#8208;free, time&#8208;resolved bioimaging of bioorthogonal labeling in living cells. The lifetime&#8208;based readout provides multi&#8208;dimensional data, facilitating spatiotemporal monitoring of the labeling process.








Abstract
Fluorogenic bioorthogonal probes are crucial tools in biomedical research, which enable non&#8208;invasive, wash&#8208;free imaging of specific biomolecules in living systems. Lifetime&#8208;responsive bioorthogonal probes represent another promising and attractive alternative, offering the potential for real&#8208;time, wash&#8208;free visualization of bioorthogonal labeling processes via photoluminescence lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). However, their widespread application is limited by the lack of suitable lifetime&#8208;responsive probes. Herein, a series of phosphorescent iridium(III) phenanthrolinedione complexes were reported. Intriguingly, upon bioorthogonal reaction with an &#945;&#8208;angelica lactone derivative, the complexes exhibited remarkable emission responses in three distinct manners, which were found to correlate with the different emissive excited states of the complexes. Crucially, two of the complexes maintained similar emission intensity but exhibited significant emission lifetime elongation during labeling reactions, which facilitated simultaneous and discriminative visualization of the reacted and unreacted probes in cellular imaging without the need for washing steps. One of the complexes was used for organelle targeting and specific protein labeling through bioorthogonal reactions in living cells. The intracellular probe transportation and labeling dynamics were visualized and analyzed using PLIM. This work highlights the unique potential of lifetime&#8208;responsive iridium(III) complexes as powerful chemical tools for live&#8208;cell imaging and unveiling the spatiotemporal dynamics of biomolecules during bioorthogonal reactions.

         <title>Synergistic C&#9472;N Coupling for Efficient Cyclohexanone Oxime Synthesis from Ambient Air by Supported Molecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular catalyst is demonstrated to be unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions. The mass&#8208;specific efficiency of 87.00&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.3%, and exclusive carbon selectivity are the best known to date in H&#8208;cell. The whole synthetic and separation process is projected to be profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton&#8722;1, which is much lower than the breakeven point (&#8764;$10&#160;000 ton&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal the intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2&#8722;, and selective NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH catalytic reduction for C&#9472;N bond in situ. The unprecedented results obtained offer an ideal platform for the benign, economical, and sustainable production of cyclohexanone oxime as an alternative to the current existing processes. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime from rich nitrogen resources is a promising alternative to traditional industrial processes. However, the difficulties in unraveling atomic&#8208;scale catalytic mechanisms and managing selective C&#9472;N coupling still pose great challenges to realizing considerable yield and selectivity, and therefore rational catalyst design to boost collaborative C&#9472;N coupling for oxime synthesis is particularly attractive. In the present work, molecular catalysts are demonstrated to be unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions, i.e., iron bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;bipyridine (FeBPAbipyH) modified MWCNTs@CP (multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber paper) cathodes produced cyclohexanone oxime from NO2&#8722; and cyclohexanone, attaining mass&#8208;specific efficiency of 87.00&#160;mg h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;mgcat&#8722;1, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.3%, and exclusive carbon selectivity, which is the best efficiency known to date in H&#8208;cell. Mechanistic studies showed that the FeBPAbipyH molecular skeleton exhibited intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2&#8722;, and catalyzed selective NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH reduction for C&#9472;N bond in situ. The in&#8208;depth understanding of substrate&#8208;catalyst interactions and synergic C&#9472;N coupling from molecular points of view offers valuable insights to boost collaborative synthesis of organic nitrogen compounds. Further integrating plasma&#8208;driven N2 oxidation and electrocatalysis enabled cyclohexanone oxime formation at 61.73&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 on the FeBPAbipyH/MWCNTs@CP electrode, and the whole synthetic and separation process is projected to be profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton&#8722;1, which is much lower than the breakeven point (&#8764;$10&#160;000 ton&#8722;1), representing a sustainable pathway to nitrogenous chemical synthesis from abundant resources under ambient conditions.

         <title>Topological Control Over Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Elucidating Electron Transfer Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrinic 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with distinct sql and bex topologies but identical chemical compositions were constructed to probe topology&#8208;dependent electron transfer. Systematic characterization demonstrated that bex&#8208;COFs exhibit enhanced electron transfer kinetics and modified band structures compared to their sql analogues, revealing topology&#8208;directed electron regulation.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have emerged as promising functional materials due to their programmable architectures and tunable functionalities. Nevertheless, the structural diversity of porphyrin&#8208;based 2D COFs remains restricted by the prevalent use of sql topology, hindering comprehensive structure&#8208;property exploration. Herein, we systematically designed and synthesized porphyrinic 2D COFs featuring distinct sql and bex topological configurations. Comprehensive structural characterization confirmed precise control over lattice geometries, revealing monoporous structure in sql topology versus biporous architecture in bex topology. Electrochemical investigations uncovered topology&#8208;governed electron transport characteristics, with the unique coordination geometry of bex topology exhibiting enhanced electron transfer efficiency.

     alt="Topological Control Over Porphyrin-Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Elucidating Electron Transfer Characteristics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porphyrinic 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with distinct &lt;b&gt;sql&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bex&lt;/b&gt; topologies but identical chemical compositions were constructed to probe topology-dependent electron transfer. Systematic characterization demonstrated that &lt;b&gt;bex&lt;/b&gt;-COFs exhibit enhanced electron transfer kinetics and modified band structures compared to their &lt;b&gt;sql&lt;/b&gt; analogues, revealing topology-directed electron regulation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have emerged as promising functional materials due to their programmable architectures and tunable functionalities. Nevertheless, the structural diversity of porphyrin-based 2D COFs remains restricted by the prevalent use of &lt;b&gt;sql&lt;/b&gt; topology, hindering comprehensive structure-property exploration. Herein, we systematically designed and synthesized porphyrinic 2D COFs featuring distinct &lt;b&gt;sql&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;bex&lt;/b&gt; topological configurations. Comprehensive structural characterization confirmed precise control over lattice geometries, revealing monoporous structure in &lt;b&gt;sql&lt;/b&gt; topology versus biporous architecture in &lt;b&gt;bex&lt;/b&gt; topology. Electrochemical investigations uncovered topology-governed electron transport characteristics, with the unique coordination geometry of &lt;b&gt;bex&lt;/b&gt; topology exhibiting enhanced electron transfer efficiency. Band structure analysis demonstrated that topological configuration and chemical composition collectively modulate electronic structures. Inspired by these findings, we developed nickel-incorporated &lt;b&gt;bex&lt;/b&gt;-COFs for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. The optimized Ni-BBFPP-TAPP-COF with &lt;b&gt;bex&lt;/b&gt; topology demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, achieving a low overpotential of 342&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which surpasses most reported porphyrin-based electrocatalysts. This study not only significantly expands the structural repertoire of porphyrinic COFs but also establishes explicit correlations between topological engineering and electrocatalytic performance, providing fundamental design principles for advanced energy conversion materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond Second Coordination Shell: Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalization Engineering in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While long&#8208;range charge delocalization beyond the second coordination shell critically influence the geometric and electronic properties of single&#8208;atom active sites, their systematic modulation to enhance multi&#8208;electron catalytic processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a site&#8208;specific strategy to engineer the nickel tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) precursors by selectively cleaving carbon&#8208;carbon single bonds at the &#946;&#8208;carbon sites. This approach preserves the Ni&#8208;centered first and second coordination shells while systematically removing peripheral &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in extended coordination environments. The resultant Ni&#8208;N4 catalyst exhibits a 29&#8208;fold enhancement in CO faradaic efficiency at &#8208;1.4 V vs RHE compared to original counterparts. Notably, it maintains 98.3% CO selectivity at industrial&#8208;grade current densities up to 500 mA cm&#8208;2 in flow cell. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the electron&#8208;enriched Ni sites, arising from precisely regulated charge delocalization in higher coordination shells, facilitate stabilization of the critical *COOH intermediate. Our findings establish a paradigm for advanced catalyst design through deliberate engineering of higher coordination shells.</dc:description>

         <title>High Partial Molar Volume Polymer Electrolyte for Upgraded Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article demonstrates an underexplored design strategy to experimentally verify the impact of chemical potential difference (&#8710;&#181;) on the growth of Li&#8208;dendrites through manipulation of the partial molar volume of Li+ (VLi+${V}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^ + }$) in the polymer electrolyte. The high&#8208;VLi+${{\mathrm{V}}}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^ + }$ electrolyte can effectively reduce the &#8710;&#181; after Li deposition and stabilize Li metal anode by enhancing the interfacial exchange current density.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries combined with solid electrolytes represent a highly promising technology for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems. However, their cycling performance encounters inferior stability due to the continuous growth of Li&#8208;dendrites. The initial motivation for Li&#8208;dendrite growth theoretically arises from the high chemical potential difference (&#8710;&#181;) at the electrolyte/Li metal interface, yet the effectiveness of &#8710;&#181; regulation lacks experimental validation. Here, we experimentally present the impact of &#8710;&#181; on the growth of Li&#8208;dendrites through manipulation of the partial molar volume of Li+ (VLi+${V}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^ + }$) in the polymer electrolyte. By weakening Li&#8211;O coordination structure, the as&#8208;produced high&#8208;VLi+${V}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^ + }$ polymer electrolyte (108.5&#160;cm3 mol&#8722;1) shows 83% decrease in &#8710;&#181; (289&#160;J mol&#8722;1) compared with conventional counterparts, thereby enabling stable cycling for &gt;10 months in a Li||Li cell and &gt;2000 cycles in a Li||Cu cell with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 96%. To one's delight, a practical cylindrical Li||Li[Ni0.5Co0.3Mn0.2]O2 cell with capacity of 0.62 Ah delivers excellent cycle stability with negligible capacity attenuation over 85 cycles at 0.2 C. The beneficial role of high VLi+${V}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^ + }$ is leveraged to introduce a new dimension in polymer electrolyte engineering, highlighting the underexplored design strategy of regulating interfacial &#8710;&#181; to rejuvenate practical lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Synergistic Mechanism for Unconventional Anodic Reaction of Aldehyde Oxidation for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy of nonelectrochemical steps and electrochemical steps enables the unconventional anodic reaction of aldehyde oxidation for hydrogen production (AOR&#8208;H2), which is expected to break through the limit of existing energy conversion systems. Additionally,&#160;decorating Cu catalysts with metallic Pt species leads to a 12&#8208;fold increase in the intrinsic activity of AOR&#8208;H2 because the Pt species favor the electrochemical O&#9472;H bond cleavage.








Abstract
Anodic reactions involving non&#8208;faradaic processes have significantly expanded the potential application of anodic oxidation half&#8208;reactions. Metallic Cu materials can catalyze an unconventional anodic aldehyde oxidation reaction involving the non&#8208;faradaic H2 production (AOR&#8208;H2). AOR&#8208;H2 has distinct advantages of ultra&#8208;low thermodynamic potentials and high value&#8208;added redox products, etc., but the question of exactly how reduction steps occur during AOR&#8208;H2, is something which has long puzzled scientists. Here we illustrate the novel synergistic mechanism of nonelectrochemical/electrochemical redox steps in AOR&#8208;H2. Aldehyde undergoes hydration, deprotonation, and spontaneous C&#8211;H homolytic cleavage to generate H2, and then is electrochemically oxidized to form carboxylate. Decorating Cu catalysts with metallic Pt species, supported by theoretical calculations, leads to a 12&#8208;fold increase in the intrinsic activity of AOR&#8208;H2. This work inspires researchers to develop novel cathodic and anodic reactions involving the non&#8208;faradaic process for breaking through the limit of existing energy conversion systems.

         <title>Circular RNA&#8208;Based Molecular Computation Enhances Plasma Biomarker Detection in Biliary Tract Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DNA&#8208;based molecular computation system integrating plasma circular RNA (circRNA) biomarkers for diagnosing biliary tract cancer (BTC). By identifying four differentially expressed circRNAs, we designed a logistic regression model (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.970) translated into a DNA computation framework, demonstrating cost&#8208;effective, rapid diagnostics without complex instrumentation.








Abstract
Molecular diagnosis of biliary tract cancer (BTC) remains a significant clinical challenge due to the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. Although large panels based on multi&#8208;biomarkers have demonstrated potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, their clinical application is hindered by complexity and high costs. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a DNA&#8208;based molecular computation system that integrates the detection of plasma circular RNAs (circRNAs) with molecular computation, enabling intelligent and rapid diagnosis of BTC. By identifying and validating a specific and small set of circRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in BTC patients, we designed a DNA computation framework that directly translates biomarker levels into diagnostic outcomes without the need of external analysis and interpretation. In a validation cohort of 70 individuals, our approach achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 83%, demonstrating its potential as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient tool for rapid diagnosis of BTC. This work highlights the potential of molecular computation in enhancing integrated and rapid cancer diagnostics, paving the way for clinical implementation.

         <title>Aptamer as a molecular tethering agent induces PrPC aggregation and degradation to inhibit melanoma proliferation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanoma, a malignant tumor originating from melanocytes, is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. Previous studies have revealed that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is frequently overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to tumor progression. This study presents the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept evidence that nucleic acid aptamers can be used to construct a molecular tethering agent that regulates PrPC protein levels by inducing membrane&#8208;bound PrPC aggregation for anti&#8208;melanoma therapy. Using a screening strategy combining cell&#8208;SELEX and cell&#8208;internalization SELEX, we obtained an ssDNA aptamer, TT&#8208;1e, specifically binding to melanoma cells and tissues. We identified that the binding site of TT&#8208;1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. Based on the binding characteristics of TT&#8208;1e, we engineered an aptamer&#8208;based molecular tethering agent TTe&#8208;TTe. We found that TTe&#8208;TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrPC, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe&#8208;TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Triple&#8208;Phase Boundaries Enable Selective Urea Production from Simulated Flue Gas in a Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renewable energy powered co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8208; offers a promising pathway towards sustainable urea production. However, achieving high urea selectivity is challenging due to substantial competing side reactions. Here we show that engendering a high density of CO2 bubbles on the catalyst surface creates numerous triple&#8208;phase boundaries that are key towards enhancing CO2 versus NO3&#8208; availability for selective urea production. We implemented this strategy using a bipolar membrane in a zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer, which allows for the in&#8208;situ conversion of bicarbonate to CO2 bubbles at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. Notably, we demonstrate that this electrolyzer system can utilize simulated flue gas (20% CO2 + 5% O2) for urea production. With a Cu95Ru5 catalyst, we achieve a urea Faradaic efficiency of 58% at 2 V full&#8208;cell voltage over an extended 30&#8208;h period and a peak production rate of 35.46 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1. Under these conditions, the Faradaic efficiency to hydrogen evolution and nitrate reduction are 14.7% and 21.6%, respectively. Strikingly, these results with simulated flue gas are comparable to previously reported systems that use pure CO2. Our results introduce a simple yet effective design approach towards developing efficient electrolyzer systems for urea production.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of H2O2 via Energy Transfer Photocatalysis by Coupling with Furfuryl Alcohol Conversion over an&#160;Amide&#8208;Functionalized Heptazine Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxygen reduction provides a sustainable approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis, but the charge carrier&#8208;based pathway is severely limited by&#160;inefficient charge separation and redox decomposition of the produced H2O2. Energy transfer photocatalysis (EnTP) is an alternative charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;free route for H2O2 synthesis. Herein, we propose a strategy of killing two birds with one stone to&#160;simultaneously realize the&#160;synthesis of H2O2 and conversion of a biomass derivative by coupling EnTP with the Achmatowicz reaction. Results show efficient production of H2O2 at a rate of 14.6&#8201;mmol gcat&#8208;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 44.1% at 420&#8201;nm, coupled with the conversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfuryl alcohol (FFA) to hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;3(6H)&#8208;one with a high selectivity of 85.9%. Such a performance was attributed to the efficient EnTP over the amide&#8208;functionalized heptazine framework photocatalyst for singlet oxygen generation, which induces the FFA conversion and concurrently produces&#160;H2O2. A systematic study of the photoexcitation process of the catalysts reveals that the amide&#8208;functionalization significantly improves the intersystem crossing efficiency, as the structural modification optimizes the electronic structure and thus tunes the composition and distribution of energy bands.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies Based on Electronic Interactions for Effective Catalysts in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density (&gt;500 W h kg&#8208;1). However, LSBs exhibit an unsatisfactory energy density (&lt;400 W h kg&#8208;1) and cycle life (&lt;300 cycles) because of the shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates and the sluggish conversion reaction kinetics caused by insulating sulfur (S8) and lithium sulfide (Li2S). Although various types of catalysts, including metal&#8208;based compounds to single&#8208;atom catalysts, have been reported to address these issues, most catalysts exhibited limited catalytic activity under practical lean electrolyte conditions (&lt;5 &#956;L mg&#8208;1). A comprehensive understanding of the synthetic strategy and catalytic mechanism of catalysts is essential for their design, but understanding the electronic effects of the catalysts and LiPS is more important. Furthermore, the electronic design of these catalysts is not well understood. In this review, we introduce the catalytic mechanisms in LSBs and discuss catalyst design strategies in terms of electronic effects on the interactions between reactants and catalysts, with a primary focus on heterogeneous catalytic systems. We additionally consider how the electronic property of homogeneous systems, particularly redox mediators, affects catalytic behavior under lean electrolyte conditions, and propose future research directions for catalyst development in LSBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral spirobiindanes are recognized as the privileged structures in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the structurally similar chiral spirobipyridines have not yet been explored as chiral ligands or organocatalysts due to the absence of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective synthesis of spirobipyridines via double [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction. Spirobipyridines with ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;substituents could be obtained with exclusive regioselectivity and up to 99% ee in the presence of cobalt and bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Spirobipyridines coordinate with transition metals as chiral ligands. Spirobipyridine dioxides can be applied as chiral organocatalysts in the asymmetric allylation of aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of visible light&#8208;mediated photochemistry has experienced significant growth, leading to the development of a wide array of methodologies in synthetic organic chemistry. In particular, photocatalysis by using long&#8208;wavelength light such as red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light has garnered substantial attention recently. These strategies have inherent benefits of low energy, including minimal health hazards, less side reactions, and increased penetration through diverse reaction media. In this minireview, we present an overview of recent advancements in red&#8208; and NIR light&#8208;induced photocatalysis for the generation of various radicals and key intermediates in organic synthesis.

         <title>Introducing Photochemical Action Plots as a Tool for Unlocking On&#8208;Off Switchable Behavior in a Polymeric Eosin Y Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for investigating the wavelength&#8208;dependent efficiency of photochemical processes. Herein, we apply the photochemical action plot methodology developed by the Barner&#8208;Kowollik team to a photocatalytic reaction, resulting in the first examples of photocatalytic action plots, paving the way for future in&#8208;depth explorations of the wavelength dependence of similar reactions. Specifically, we investigate the wavelength dependence of the catalytic oxidation capabilities of an Eosin Y functionalized polymer photocatalyst (P1) as well as a small molecule representative of the polymer bound Eosin Y moieties (EY) for the oxidation of triphenylphosphine. Introduction of zinc(II) ions into the system proved to drastically influence the optical absorption properties of both catalysts, accompanied by a pronounced influence on their wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity profiles which is not predictable based on the absorption spectra. For P1, these changes can be reversed by metal&#8208;mediated single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) formation upon base addition, giving access to a stimuli&#8208;responsive polymeric photocatalyst. Detailed analysis of the photocatalytic action plots enabled the identification of a suitable wavelength for the realization of an on&#8208;off switchable polymeric photocatalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to Arylethylamines Enabled by Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Hydroarylation of Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylethylamines are prevalent structural skeletons in bioactive molecules and have significant interest within the organic chemistry community. We report here a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, delivering a wide variety of valuable arylethylamines with complete regiocontrol under mild conditions. Key to the success of this protocol is the employment of bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as ligands. Furthermore, the use of chiral NHC ligands enables straightforward access to enantioenriched arylethylamines with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF Catalysts for Plastic Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depolymerization is a promising solution to address the escalating global plastic waste crisis, as a key enabler for emerging technologies in chemical upcycling and closed&#8208;loop recycling of plastics. By virtue of their unparalleled bottom&#8208;up designability for structural control, stability, reactivity and compatibility with catalytically&#8208;active metal nanoparticles and enzymes, MOFs have enormous potential as an emerging class of porous heterogeneous catalysts for plastics depolymerization. Herein, we highlight key considerations and advances in MOF catalyst development and design for a range of depolymerization reactions, including alcoholysis, hydrogenolysis, pyrolysis, photocatalytic oxidation and enzymatic hydrolysis. Other than enabling MOFs to efficiently depolymerize the most abundant plastics in production today, including those with unreacted C&#8208;C backbones (e.g. polyolefins) and polymers with cleavable backbone linkages (e.g. polyesters), their versatility also extends to emerging applications in microplastic capture and degradation from wastewater. These unique properties of MOFs position them as potentially scalable and reusable heterogeneous catalysts that can complement existing inorganic catalysts for practical depolymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Ion Channels To Engineer Zn2+ Ion Transport Mediated Chemical&#8208;to&#8208;Optical Signal Transduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial ion channels have significant potential for various applications, including molecular communication, bio&#8208;sensing, and constructing artificial cells. In this report, we demonstrated the development of a molecular communication system that transports ions across the lipid bilayers via the formation of supramolecular ion channels and harnesses chemical reactions to overcome the challenges of executing signal&#8208;processing functions at the molecular level. The potent ionophore self&#8208;assembles into nanochannels within the lipid bilayers and selectively transports Zn2+ ions. The movement of Zn2+ ions through these supramolecular ion channels enables the in&#8208;situ generation of a water&#8208;soluble catalytic system with tyrosine. This catalytic system promotes esterase&#8208;like activity, generating fluorescent reporters from non&#8208;fluorescent ester&#8208;based compounds within the intravesicular environment. Furthermore, this process indicates the formation of a three&#8208;input AND logic gate in the fluorescence mode, allowing the monitoring of the chemical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal amplification process akin to biological counterparts. Developing these molecular communication systems to replicate the complexity of natural cellular processes opens up exciting opportunities for designing advanced biomimetic tools and exploring the fundamental principles underlying cellular communication.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Excited Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Tuning in Carbon Dots via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high&#8208;efficiency time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials that can be activated under visible light with strong stability remains challenging. In this study, carbon dots (CDs) were confined in the boric acid matrix to activate surface crosslinking emissive clusters and modulate charge transfer (CT) interaction, facilitating green and red dual emissive centers to coexist in composites. The presence of halogen atoms strengthened the interactions between CDs and boric acid. Notably, the CT interaction can offer excitons in low energy level and allow for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, making the red emissive center more dominant under visible light excitation. The interplay of dual centers featuring sufficient color differentiation and different decay rates activated characteristic TDPC evolution resulting in dynamic afterglow evolution from red to white under visible light excitation.&#160;Moreover, the formation of rigid boric acid crystalloid network resulted in an ultra&#8208;strong confinement at high temperature, enabling the composites to emit long persistent afterglow at high temperature of up to 393 K under visible light excitation. The study provides new light on the design of TDPC materials and represents a significant advancement toward expanding the application in information security.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrabright and Water&#8208;stable Eu(III)&#8208;based MOF Scintillators Sensitized by Dual&#8208;antenna Ligands for Real&#8208;Time and Underwater X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ln&#8208;MOF) scintillators are promising for X&#8208;ray imaging owing to their structural tunability and high X&#8208;ray attenuation. However, achieving efficient triplet&#8208;sensitized scintillation remains challenging due to the inefficient energy transfer between organic ligand triplets and lanthanide centers, leading to weak radioluminescence and limited imaging resolution. Herein, we propose a dual&#8208;antenna ligand strategy by synergizing 4,4&#8217;&#8208;oxybis (benzoic acid) (Oba) and phenanthroline derivatives (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline = Phen; or Bathophenanthroline = Bphen) with Eu3+ ions, constructing ultrabright Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Phen and Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen scintillators. Notably, Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen demonstrated a record relative light yield of 60331 &#177; 528 photons MeV&#8208;1, outperforming Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Phen by 71%. This superior scintillation performance originates from an 86.3% photoluminescence quantum yield, attributed to enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer efficiency and the suppression of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking among organic chromophore ligands. Besides, the fabrication of flexible Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen films achieve a spatial resolution of 37.0 lp mm&#8208;1 in static imaging and enable real&#8208;time dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging at 60 fps (2K). Additionally, it exhibited exceptional water stability, with negligible performance degradation in water for over 100 days, allowing clear underwater visualization of circuit boards under X&#8208;ray irradiation. It provides a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance water&#8208;stable scintillators via ligand engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive AIE Photosensitizers for Enhanced Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infections significantly alter the local microenvironment, with acidic byproducts from bacterial metabolism leading to a pronounced pH reduction. Leveraging this characteristic, we synthesized and identified DHTPA, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent and pH&#8208;responsive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer, for enhanced photodynamic therapy against bacterial infections. DHTPA aggregates exhibit a 2.1&#8208;fold increase in ROS generation under weakly acidic conditions (pH 5.5) compared to neutral conditions (pH 7.4), attributed to its pH&#8208;dependent electronic structure modulation. Upon NIR light irradiation, DHTPA aggregates precisely respond to the acidic microenvironment, significantly boosting ROS production for efficient bacterial eradication. In vitro studies demonstrated that DHTPA achieved over 99.9% bactericidal efficiency against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. In a murine infected wound model, DHTPA treatment accelerated wound healing by 2.4 times, markedly reduced bacterial burden, and alleviated inflammatory responses, highlighting its therapeutic potential. By integrating NIR activation, pH responsiveness, and AIE properties, DHTPA presents a precise and efficient antibacterial therapeutic strategy, offering an innovative solution for the clinical management of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiroptical Signal Inversion of Peptido&#8208;Coassemblies in Confined Parallel&#8208;Laminar Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality plays a vital role in material properties, and precise control of chiral signals is key to designing functional materials. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly offers an efficient means to integrate chiral building blocks with chromophores, yet controlling the assembly pathway remains challenging due to the complexity of non&#8208;covalent interactions. Here, we introduce a continuous parallel&#8208;laminar&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly strategy that exploits solvent ordering and solute diffusion in confined environments to regulate chiral signals in multi&#8208;component peptide co&#8208;assemblies. Notably, six nonpolar amino acids exhibit significantly enhanced chiroptical responses, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. Intriguingly, Fmoc&#8208;Ala and 1&#8208;aminopyrene (AP) co&#8208;assemblies formed in a microfluidic chip show a reversed chiroptical signal compared to those from batch reactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and COMSOL modeling suggest that velocity gradients and shear forces in microfluidics induce ordered non&#8208;covalent interactions, altering excimer stacking and modulating chiroptical properties. This study presents an effective strategy for controlling chiral optical signals in confined environments, offering an interesting approach for supramolecular chiral transfer and regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Atom Rearrangement Drives Potential&#8208;Adaptive Electrocatalytic Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic rearrangement of metal atoms at heterointerfaces by chemical bond conversion drives high efficiency electrocatalytic processes. It is of great significance to explore transformative catalytic systems that directly control the interfacial structure and function of atomic composition. As an emerging 2D carbon allotrope, graphdiyne (GDY) offers unprecedented advantages for heterointerface engineering. In particular, the uneven surface charge distribution, high distribution of active sites and customizable electronic structures of GDY provide unprecedented opportunities for developing new&#8208;generation catalytic systems. Here, we report a new idea to directly control the cooperative growth and drive metal atomic rearrangement on the interface of GDY/NiPd/GDY. Experimental results revealed two unique interfacial phenomena: (i) GDY&#8208;induced massive dislocation formation within NiPd nanoalloys and (ii) rearrangement of surface metal atoms from (111) to (200) facets. Detailed spectroscopic analysis further demonstrated the composition&#8208;dependent evolution of elemental valence states and stoichiometric ratios. This atomic&#8208;level restructuring establishes a charge&#8208;redistribution network featuring non&#8208;integer charge transfer, which improves the overall conductivity and intrinsic activity. What is even more encouraging is that this electrocatalytic olefin hydrogenation is carried out in an aqueous solution. The GDY/NiPd/GDY heterostructure achieves exceptional activity (turnover frequency: 6.8&#160;s&#8208;1), stability (&gt;5 cycles), and chemo&#8208;selectivity (~100%), which is superior to traditional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells via 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhanced Efficiency through Precision Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a class of porous polymers with tunable two&#8208; or three&#8208;dimensional structures, have drawn significant attention for their exceptional versatility across various applications. Recently, the integration of COFs into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has emerged as a promising strategy to address critical challenges, such as instability, interfacial recombination losses, and lead&#8208;associated environmental risks. Enhanced charge transport channels, passivation of defects, and customizable molecule architectures are some of the special benefits that COFs offer. In this study, we used Schiff base reactions to create two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs with an 8+2 connection motif, which were integrated into PSC self&#8208;assembled (SAM) layers. According to characterizations and theoretical calculations, COFs not only effectively optimize the energy level of the ITO/SAM substrate but also passivate perovskite defects and suppress defect&#8208;assisted recombination in PSC devices. These modifications significantly enhanced carrier transport and extraction, resulting in an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 22.57% to 25.20% (DP&#8208;BE) and 24.21% (DP&#8208;DBE). This work highlights the potential of COFs as multifunctional modifiers for interfacial engineering in PSCs, offering a promising route to improve device performance and stability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective arylative dearomatization of phenols and naphthols, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. This approach enables the efficient construction of a diverse library of quinazoline&#8208;containing spirocyclic compounds, featuring enantioenriched, three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures through the strategic integration of quinazolinone and spirocyclic frameworks. The successful transformation of planar aromatic precursors into complex three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures using our developed methodology was further validated by Principal Moment of Inertia (PMI) calculations. Additionally, we systematically evaluated the antiproliferative potential of the synthesized compounds against two representative cancer cell lines: Mino (human mantle cell lymphoma) and MV4&#8208;11 (human acute myeloid leukemia),&#160;revealing that compound (S)&#8208;4ac,characterized by well&#8208;defined stereochemistry and structural novelty, exhibited significantly enhanced antiproliferative efficacy against both cancer cell lines, with IC50 values 0.94 &#956;M and 0.46 &#956;M, respectively. In addition,&#160;flow cytometry quantification and Western blot analysis showed that these compounds induced apoptosis through caspase activation and mitochondrial dysfunction.&#160;These results demonstrated(S)&#8208;4ac&#160;as a highly promising lead compound for further anticancer drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging the Oxo Wall: A New Perspective on High&#8208;valent Metal&#8208;Oxo Species and Their Reactivity in Mn, Fe, and Co Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel perspective on high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species, particularly in Mn, Fe, and Co complexes. It reveals a surprising quantum mechanical mixture of CoIV=O and CoIII&#8211;O&#8226; species influenced by ligand design and symmetry. Additionally, the study uncovers correlations between oxyl radical character and C&#8722;H bond activation kinetics, challenging existing theories on reactivity.







Abstract
The &#8220;oxo&#8208;wall&#8221; is a well&#8208;established concept in the area of bioinorganic chemistry, which refers to the instability of the terminal metal&#8208;oxo complexes in the +4 oxidation state, with tetragonal C4v symmetry beyond group 8 elements. This leads to a diverse and highly reactive chemistry of Co&#8208;oxo complexes, as evidenced in the literature, ranging from challenging C&#8722;H bond activation to efficient water oxidation. Despite extensive research on first&#8208;row terminal metal&#8208;oxo complexes and the &#8220;oxo&#8208;wall&#8221; concept, studies correlating the reactivity of these species across the periodic table remain scarce. In this work, using a combination of DFT and ab initio CASSCF calculations, we have explored the structure, bonding, and reactivity of [MIV/V(15&#8208;TMC)(O)(CH3CN)]m+ (M= Mn, Fe and Co) species. Our study reveals several intriguing outcomes: (i) while existing literature typically indicates the presence of either CoIV=O or CoIII&#8211;O&#8226; species beyond the wall, we propose a quantum mechanical mixture of these two species (termed as CoIV=O 
 CoIII&#8211;O&#8226;), with the per cent of mixing dictated by ligand architecture and symmetry considerations; (ii) we observe that the oxyl radical character increases beyond the wall, correlating with larger Ntrans&#8208;M&#8722;O tilt angles; and (iii) we identify an inverse relationship between the percentage of M&#8211;O&#8226; character and the kinetic barriers for C&#8722;H bond activation. These findings offer a new perspective on the roles of oxidation states, spin states, and the nature of the metal ion in reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;oxo-wall&#8221; is a well-established concept in the area of bioinorganic chemistry, which refers to the instability of the terminal metal-oxo complexes in the +4 oxidation state, with tetragonal C&lt;sub&gt;4v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry beyond group 8 elements. This leads to a diverse and highly reactive chemistry of Co-oxo complexes, as evidenced in the literature, ranging from challenging C&#8722;H bond activation to efficient water oxidation. Despite extensive research on first-row terminal metal-oxo complexes and the &#8220;oxo-wall&#8221; concept, studies correlating the reactivity of these species across the periodic table remain scarce. In this work, using a combination of DFT and ab initio CASSCF calculations, we have explored the structure, bonding, and reactivity of [M&lt;sup&gt;IV/V&lt;/sup&gt;(15-TMC)(O)(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)]&lt;sup&gt;m+&lt;/sup&gt; (M= Mn, Fe and Co) species. Our study reveals several intriguing outcomes: (i) while existing literature typically indicates the presence of either Co&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O or Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt; species beyond the wall, we propose a quantum mechanical mixture of these two species (termed as Co&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O 
 Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt;), with the per cent of mixing dictated by ligand architecture and symmetry considerations; (ii) we observe that the oxyl radical character increases beyond the wall, correlating with larger N&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt;-M&#8722;O tilt angles; and (iii) we identify an inverse relationship between the percentage of M&#8211;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt; character and the kinetic barriers for C&#8722;H bond activation. These findings offer a new perspective on the roles of oxidation states, spin states, and the nature of the metal ion in reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Throughput Microarrays of Peptidoglycan Fragments as a Novel Sero&#8208;Diagnostic Tool for Patient Antibody Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel on&#8208;chip synthesis technology, microarrays of peptidoglycan fragments were generated comprising 864 variants derived from Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. These were used to map monoclonal antibody specificity and to screen samples from patients with the autoimmune disease epidermolysis bullosa, revealing distinct antibody responses. This highlights the platform's potential for profiling microbiome&#8208;associated diseases.







Abstract
Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a complex biopolymer crucial for cell wall integrity and function of all bacterial species. While the strong inflammatory properties of PGN and its derived muropeptides are well&#8208;documented in human innate immune responses, adaptive immunity, including antibody responses to PGN, remain inadequately characterized. Microarray technology represents a cost&#8208; and time&#8208;efficient method for studying such interactions. Our laser&#8208;based technology enables the high&#8208;throughput synthesis of biomolecules on functionalized glass slides. Here, this on&#8208;chip synthesis was developed for PGN fragments, to generate a variety of 216 stem peptides and attach six different glycan moieties that are major structural components of bacterial cell walls. Thereby, 864 PGN fragments from different Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive species were generated. The arrays were validated with four different monoclonal antibodies against PGN or poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine and identified their epitopes. Finally, proof of concept for antibody profiling in patient samples was performed by comparing a panel of well&#8208;characterized plasma samples of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) patients suffering from (chronic) wounds with Staphylococcus aureus infection. EB patients show an increased response to the muramyl dipeptide. Therefore, this novel high&#8208;throughput PGN glycopeptide microarray technology promises to identify distinct antibody profiles against human microbiomes in diseases, notably in those involving the intestine.

         <title>Tailoring Molecular Diffusion in Core&#8208;Shell Zeolite Imidazolate Framework Composites Realizes Efficient Kinetic Separation of Xylene Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8211;shell construction strategy enables precise heterogeneous diffusion control, facilitating the kinetic separation of xylene isomers. The distinctive heterogeneous pore channels in the core&#8211;shell ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67 composite allow the shell layer to effectively exclude larger isomers while selectively screening PX. Simultaneously, the inner core provides rapid diffusion kinetics for PX, ensuring efficient separation.







Abstract
The separation of xylene isomers is a critical and energy&#8208;intensive process in the petrochemical industry, primarily due to their closely similar molecular structures and boiling points. In this work, we report the synthesis and application of a novel core&#8211;shell zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) composite, ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67, designed to significantly enhance the kinetic separation of xylene isomers through a synergistic &#8220;shell&#8208;gated diffusion and core&#8208;facilitated transport&#8221; strategy. The external ZIF&#8208;67 shell selectively restricts the diffusion of larger isomers (MX and OX), while the internal ZIF&#8208;65 core accelerates the diffusion of PX, thereby amplifying the diffusion differences among the isomers. This architecture yields remarkable improvements in both selectivity and diffusion rates, as demonstrated by vapor&#8208;phase adsorption studies and molecular dynamics simulations. The ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67 composite exhibits up to 12.5 times higher PX/OX selectivity in liquid&#8208;phase adsorption and 3.4 times higher dynamic selectivity in fixed&#8208;column breakthrough experiments compared to the individual ZIF components. Theoretical simulations further corroborate the heterogeneous diffusion control mechanism, revealing the time&#8208;dependent diffusion regulation within the core&#8211;shell architecture. This work underscores the great potential of core&#8211;shell MOF composites in optimizing molecular sieving processes for industrially significant separations and highlights a new route for enhancing kinetic separation efficiency in complex multicomponent systems.

         <title>Chemical Proteomics Reveals Human Off&#8208;Targets of Fluoroquinolone Induced Mitochondrial Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic overview of the adverse effects of Ciprofloxacin related to mitochondrial toxicity. AIFM1 plays a role in the MIA40&#8208;mediated import into the IMS and oxidative folding of nuclear&#8208;encoded proteins, including ETC complexes I and IV subunits. Ciprofloxacin disrupts the IMS import machinery, impairing ETC function. Dysfunction, especially of complex I, leads to a reduction in the NAD+/NADH ratio. This alteration in redox homeostasis, coupled with a shortage of NAD+, a crucial cofactor for the TCA cycle, can trigger metabolic reprogramming involving IDH2.







Abstract
Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are an important class of potent broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics. However, their general use is more and more limited by adverse side effects. While general mechanisms for the fluoroquinolone&#8208;associated disability (FQAD) have been identified, the underlying molecular targets of toxicity remain elusive. In this study, focusing on the most commonly prescribed FQs Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin, whole proteome analyses revealed prominent mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells, specifically of the complexes I and IV of the electron transport chain (ETC). Furthermore, global untargeted chemo&#8208;proteomic methodologies such as photo&#8208;affinity profiling with FQ&#8208;derived probes, as well as derivatization&#8208;free thermal proteome profiling, were applied to elucidate human protein off&#8208;targets of FQs in living cells. Accordingly, the interactions of FQs with mitochondrial AIFM1 and IDH2 have been identified and biochemically validated for their contribution to mitochondrial dysfunction. Of note, the FQ induced ETC dysfunction via AIFM1 activates the reverse carboxylation pathway of IDH2 for rescue, however, its simultaneous inhibition further enhances mitochondrial toxicity. This off&#8208;target discovery study provides unique insights into FQ toxicity enabling the utilization of identified molecular principles for the design of a safer FQ generation.

         <title>Atropisomerism in Triarylboranes: Lewis Base Assisted Rotation at C&#8722;B Stereogenic Axis in Asymmetrical Boron Lewis Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
From decades to minutes: regulation of the rotation speed at the C&#8722;B chirality axis by peri&#8208;substituents and Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions in unprecedented triarylboranes with a C&#8722;B stereogenic axis enabled to reach atropostable and enantiopure triarylboranes.







Abstract
The synthesis, properties and structural requirements for atropisomerism at the C&#8722;B bond in boron Lewis acids such as triarylboranes have been understudied so far. We report the first series of atropisomeric triarylboranes constituted of a naphthyl rotor and a dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;bora&#8208;anthracenyl stator subunits, connected by a C&#8722;B stereogenic axis. Through systematic crystallographic, kinetic, photophysical and quantum chemical studies, the mechanisms, rates and barriers of diastereomerization and enantiomerization were determined. The orthogonal arrangement between the naphthyl and the dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;bora&#8208;anthracenyl scaffold moiety hamper the rotation of these two moieties around their Csp2&#8722;B bonds, enabling chiral resolution leading to enantiopure triarylboranes of high configurational stability. Furthermore, we fully elucidated a Lewis&#8208;base assisted pathway controlling the rotation speed at the C&#8722;B stereogenic axis, enabling the atropisomerical behavior of these triarylboranes be controlled by a Lewis base.

         <title>Solvent Chemistry Manipulated Iodine Redox Thermodynamics For Durable Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aprotic solvents with strong electron&#8208;donating properties facilitates charge transfer with iodine and promotes complexation with iodide ions as solvent&#8901;I3&#8722; species, which leads to a two&#8208;step transformation (I2 &#8596; I3&#8722; &#8596; I&#8722;) in aprotic solvents. However, protic solvents form additional hydrogen bonds with iodine, alleviating polarization and reducing interaction with iodide ions, which results in one&#8208;step conversion reaction (I2 &#8596; I&#8722;).







Abstract
The diverse valences of iodine enable it with multi&#8208;electron transfer capability for energy dense batteries. However, previous studies indicate that the primary I&#8722;/I2 redox couple exhibits distinct behaviors depending on electrolyte choice, with the mechanistic basis of aqueous versus nonaqueous systems remaining unclear. Here, we elucidated the solvent effect on iodine redox, particularly focusing on polyiodide formation and their molecular interaction correlations. We validate that a thermodynamically one&#8208;step conversion reaction (I2 &#8596; I&#8722;) occurs in the protic solvents, while it is a two&#8208;step transformation (I2 &#8596; I3&#8722; &#8596; I&#8722;) in aprotic solvents. This distinction arises from strong electron&#8208;donating properties in aprotic solvents that facilitate charge transfer with iodine, promoting complexation with iodide as solvent&#8901;I3&#8722; species. Conversely, protic solvents form additional hydrogen bonds with iodine, alleviating polarization and reducing interaction with iodide. Furthermore, to address the limitations of single protic electrolytes &#8211; characterized by sluggish dissolution&#8208;precipitation and slow ion migration rates &#8211; we propose a hybrid electrolyte combining water and ethylene glycol. These hybrids enhance iodine redox kinetics, inhibits I3&#8722; generation, and modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure to mitigate zinc anode corrosion and dendrite. The Zn&#8722;I2 batteries demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability in a wide temperature range, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

         <title>The Substituent&#8208;Effect in NHCP&#8208;Plumbylenes with a Phosphaplumbene Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of aryl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted NHCP&#8208;plumbylenes is achieved through metathesis reactions. Based on computational studies, the substituent effect and the potential double bond character in these species are discussed. A formal [2+2] cycloaddition at a P&#8722;Pb bond demonstrates the synthetic equivalence to double bonds.







Abstract
This work explores the use of plumbylene&#8208;phosphinidenes to address the challenge of isolating P=Pb bonds. Herein, we report the synthesis of three N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene phosphinidene (NHCP) substituted chlorotetrylene dimers [(IDipp)PECl]2 (E=Ge, Sn, Pb; IDipp=C([N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)CH]2)). Substituent attachment via salt metathesis (E=Sn, Pb) enables the isolation of NHCP&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted stannylene (IDipp)PSn(SiTms2SiTol3) as well as NHCP&#8208;silyl&#8208; and NHCP&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted plumbylenes (IDipp)PPb(SiTms2SiTol3) and (IDipp)PPb(mTer) (mTer=2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3, Tms=Trimethylsilyl). Access to these structures not only expands this chemistry to the heaviest of group 14 elements but also provides a deeper understanding of the substituent effect on NHCP&#8208;tetrylene bonding. Computational studies demonstrate that both silyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted species exhibit partial multiple bond character, with the silyl&#8208;substituted species showing higher bond orders and reduced polarization. This is further supported by the short P&#8722;E bond lengths observed in their solid&#8208;state structures. Finally, the formal [2+2] cycloaddition of diphenylketene to (IDipp)PPb(mTer) provides experimental evidence for the ability of NHCP&#8208;plumbylenes to serve as synthetic equivalents of P=Pb double bonds.

We illustrate the first Pd catalyzed regioselective distal and atroposelective olefination through dynamic kinetic resolution of simple arenes/biaryl via an electrooxidative reaction pathway. Electricity plays a significant role in streamlining the &#8216;regio&#8208;resolved&#8217; reaction furnishing chiral molecules synthesis without the requirement of metal oxidants and thermal energy.

Abstract
Regioselective and enantioselective C&#8208;H functionalization is a valuable method for synthesizing chiral and complex molecules. However, it often requires large amounts of toxic oxidants and high temperature, making it environmentally and economically adverse. Additionally, these traditional approaches generally suffer from regioselectivity and enantioselectivity issues. To overcome these limitations, a new mechanism is needed to control both of these simultaneously. Herein, we report the first Pd catalyzed regioselective distal and atroposelective olefination of simple arenes/biaryls via an electrooxidative reaction pathway. This unique electro&#8208;oxidative strategy with Pd(II) catalysis demonstrates unprecedented access to &#8216;regio&#8208;resolved&#8217; reactions, furnishing chiral molecule synthesis under dynamic kinetic resolution without the conventional requirement of metal&#8208;based oxidants and thermal energy. Both electroanalytical studies and DFT calculations suggest the involvement of a Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalytic cycle via a crucial Pd(III) intermediate that initiates both the distal and atroposelective olefination reactions.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Facet&#8208;Controlled Internal Electric Field in MOF/COF Heterojunction Towards Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalently connected NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti)/TpBpy&#8208;COF heterojunction with a strong internal electric field was constructed to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting performance. The results show that the co&#8208;exposure of the (001) and (111) crystal faces in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) forms the strongest internal electric field with TpBpy&#8208;COF, promoting the effective separation of photogenerated charges in the S&#8208;scheme path.







Abstract
Covalently integrating two type of crystalline porous materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to form heterostructure photocatalysts inheriting their structural merits has shown inherent advantages in hydrogen evolution reaction. However, how to control the internal electric field in aimed MOF/COF heterojunction to achieve an improved photocatalytic activity is still ambiguous. Herein, for the first time, we report a rational control of the internal electric field in MOF/COF heterojunction by engineering the crystal facet of MOFs to achieve enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) activity. A new type of covalently connected MOF/COF photocatalytic system based on NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) and TpBpy&#8208;COF was synthesized. As confirmed, the exposed crystal facet of MOFs greatly affected the resultant activity of MOF/COF system. The combination of decahedron NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) and TpBpy&#8208;COF shows an optimal OWS activity with the H2 and O2 evolution rates of 331.6 and 165.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, respectively, which is the best performance in COFs or COF&#8208;based photocatalyst at present. The great influence of formed anisotropic facets on internal electric field of the S&#8208;scheme MOF/COF heterojunction interface is fully confirmed by various characterizations, and the active crystal facet of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) for water oxidation reaction is further proved.

&lt;p&gt;A covalently connected NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125 (Ti)/TpBpy-COF heterojunction with a strong internal electric field was constructed to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting performance. The results show that the co-exposure of the (001) and (111) crystal faces in NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125 (Ti) forms the strongest internal electric field with TpBpy-COF, promoting the effective separation of photogenerated charges in the S-scheme path.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalently integrating two type of crystalline porous materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to form heterostructure photocatalysts inheriting their structural merits has shown inherent advantages in hydrogen evolution reaction. However, how to control the internal electric field in aimed MOF/COF heterojunction to achieve an improved photocatalytic activity is still ambiguous. Herein, for the first time, we report a rational control of the internal electric field in MOF/COF heterojunction by engineering the crystal facet of MOFs to achieve enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) activity. A new type of covalently connected MOF/COF photocatalytic system based on NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125(Ti) and TpBpy-COF was synthesized. As confirmed, the exposed crystal facet of MOFs greatly affected the resultant activity of MOF/COF system. The combination of decahedron NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125(Ti) and TpBpy-COF shows an optimal OWS activity with the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rates of 331.6 and 165.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under visible light, respectively, which is the best performance in COFs or COF-based photocatalyst at present. The great influence of formed anisotropic facets on internal electric field of the S-scheme MOF/COF heterojunction interface is fully confirmed by various characterizations, and the active crystal facet of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125(Ti) for water oxidation reaction is further proved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper(I) Halide Complex Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Aggregate Induced Emission for Efficient X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I) halide complex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging performance, which is resulted from the joint effect of effective X&#8208;ray absorption of the heavy Cu2I2 core, high exciton utilization efficiency facilitated by the fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and the effective suppression of non&#8208;radiative transitions in solid state.







Abstract
Developing solution&#8208;processable and stable scintillators with high light yields, low detection limits and high imaging resolutions holds great significance for flexible X&#8208;ray imaging. However, attaining an optimal equilibrium among X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, exciton utilization efficiency, and decay lifetime of scintillators remains a substantial challenge. Here, a new Cu(I) halide complex was synthesized in a mild condition. It exhibits intense blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristic, as well as good water&#8208;oxygen stability and photochemical stability. Notably, the complex shows excellent radiation resistance and efficient radioluminescence (RL) with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 42.5&#8197;nGyairs&#8722;1. This superior scintillation performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of effective X&#8208;ray absorption by the heavy Cu2I2 core, the high radiation&#8208;induced exciton utilization rate in TADF process, and the remarkable suppression of non&#8208;radiative transitions by the restriction of intramolecular motions in solid state. Furthermore, the favourable solution processability of the complex facilitates the successful fabrication of a flexible film, achieving high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging with a resolution of 17.3&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of hybrid Cu(I) halides with AIE&#8208;TADF effects for high&#8208;energy radiation detection and imaging, opening up new avenues for the exploration of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance scintillators.

         <title>Tuning Zn2+ Deposition Kinetics towards Deep&#8208;Reversible Zinc Metal Batteries with All&#8208;Climate Adaptability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steric hindrance effect of reduced glutathione (RGSH) tunes Zn2+ electrochemical reduction kinetics to match Zn2+ migration, suppressing the concentration polarization. RGSH with abundant hydrogen bond donors and acceptors reconfigures H&#8208;bond networks for all&#8208;climate adaptability, eliminating &#8220;dead Zn&#8221; at low temperature and HER corrosion at high temperature. Thus, ultra&#8208;long lifespan and wide service temperature AZMBs are achieved.







Abstract
Uncontrollable Zn dendrites and severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) hamper the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries, which closely related to the deposition kinetics and thermodynamic stability of Zn anode. In this work, we returned to the classic perspectives of kinetics and thermodynamics, introducing a small amount of reduced glutathione (RGSH) to reshape the kinetic behavior of Zn2+ deposition and increasing the thermodynamic energy barrier of HER. Specifically, the steric hindrance effect of RGSH tuned the electrochemical reduction kinetics to match Zn2+ migration and increased the proportion of Zn2+ in the bulk phase migration, thereby inducing dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior with ordered (002) texturing. Meanwhile, RGSH with abundant hydrogen bond donors and acceptors reconfigures the coordination network of water molecules for all&#8208;climate adaptability, eliminating the accumulation of &#8220;dead Zn&#8221; at low temperature and the HER corrosion at high temperature. As a result, the advanced Zn||Zn symmetric cells deliver an extra&#8208;long cycling performance (over 4600&#8197;h) and a wide temperature tolerance (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C~70&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, the NH4V4O10||Zn full cell can operate stably for over 1000 cycles with 84.3&#8201;% capacity retention. Surprisingly, the practical NH4V4O10||Zn pouch cell with limited N/P ratio (2.3) reserved 84.1&#8201;% capacity after 150 cycles.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Ketenimine Intermediates as Active Catalysts in the Michael Addition of Unactivated Nitriles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>
PCNHCP Manganese hydride complex [(PCNHCP)Mn(CO)2H] (1) is able to reversibly activate unactivated nitriles. The resulting manganese&#8208;ketenimine complexes have proven to be competent catalysts for the Michael addition of unactivated nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile, propionitrile, and butyronitrile) to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The reaction occurs under mild conditions, exhibits a wide substrate scope, and is easily scalable.







Abstract
The Michael addition of unactivated nitriles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is a challenging yet desirable strategy for installing alkyl cyano&#8208;groups (R&#8208;CN) in organic molecules. However, despite formidable efforts, using acetonitrile as a Michael donor in these reactions has remained a significant challenge. Herein, we report a highly active manganese(I) complex [(PCNHCP)Mn(CO)2H] (1), which chemoselectively catalyzes the 1,4&#8208;addition of unactivated nitriles (incl. acetonitrile) to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The developed methodology operates under mild conditions, does not require any additives or bases, features low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%), fast reaction times (2&#8211;8&#8197;hours), and is compatible with a wide variety of functional groups, including halides, trifluoromethyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and (hetero)aryl groups. Extensive mechanistic studies revealed that after base&#8208;free activation of the nitrile, either the N&#8208;bound manganese&#8208;ketenimine (propionitrile or benzyl cyanide) or the C&#8208;bound manganese&#8208;cyanoalkyl (acetonitrile) complex is formed. The difference in stability of these two species explains why more sterically hindered and presumably less activated nitriles (i.e., propionitrile, and butyronitrile) show higher reactivity than their corresponding more activated congeners (i.e., acetonitrile). Finally, the practicality of our approach was demonstrated through a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent derivatizations of the obtained product into important organic motifs such as ene&#8208;lactams and tetrahydropyridines.

During charging, SiO2 promotes efficient deposition of Mn2+ and Mn3+, while during discharge, the introduction of Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs facilitate efficient dissolution of MnO2. The synergistic effect enhances the reversibility of MnO2/Mn2+ reaction.







Abstract
Despite the widespread interest in electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries with excellent output voltage and high theoretical capacity, the spontaneous disproportionation reaction of free Mn3+ along with the disorderly deposited inactive MnO2 results in the low Mn2+/MnO2 conversion reversibility, which seriously affects their cycling stability. Here, we propose a novel aqueous SiO2 colloidal electrolyte with FeSO4 mediator (denoted as SF electrolyte) based on a bidirectional electrochemical&#8208;chemical model to achieve dual regulation of the MnO2 deposition/dissolution process. During the charging process, the SiO2 colloidal particles located at the carbon felt interface and the electrolyte bulk phase simultaneously provide sufficient disproportionation sites for the diffused Mn3+ to guide the orderly rapid deposition of MnO2. Meanwhile, the introduction of Fe2+ mediators during the discharge process can sufficiently react with MnO2 on the SiO2 particles in the electrolyte, thereby further enabling the efficient conversion of Mn2+/MnO2. Consequently, electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery with SF electrolyte can stably run for 550&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieve superior reversibility at a high area capacity of 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of colloidal electrolytes in modulating electrochemical&#8208;chemical processes to stabilize electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries.

         <title>Direct Observation of Electron Donation onto the Reactants and a Transient Poisoning Mechanism During CO2 Electroreduction on Ni Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ techniques reveal key insights into the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Ni single atom catalysts. Through poisoning studies, we reveal that the reduction of the system does not result in a metal&#8208;based reduction, rather it is associated with donation of electrons onto a combination of the support and the reactants. We demonstrate the suitability of these catalysts for application to CO2 waste streams which have unavoidable impurities.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are an important class of materials that mediate chemical reduction reactions, a key subset of which is Ni within a carbon support for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, how the metal atom/clusters and the carbon&#8208;based support act in concert to catalyze CO2RR is not well understood, with most reports attributing activity solely to the Ni&#8208;Nx/C moieties. To address this gap, we have undertaken a mechanistic investigation, employing in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with electrochemical studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to further understand how Ni single atoms work in conjunction with the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix to promote CO2RR to CO, and how the presence of impurities such as those present in CO2&#8208;containing waste flue gases (including NOx, and CN&#8722;) changes the catalyst upon reduction. In contrast to previous works, we do not find strong evidence for a purely metal&#8208;based reduction upon application of negative reductive potentials. Instead, we present evidence for an increase in the equatorial vs. axial splitting of Ni, consistent with electrons moving onto the reactants via the Ni single atom 3dz2 orbital. In addition, we demonstrate a transient poisoning mechanism of the Ni SAC by nitrite and thiocyanate, explaining the recovery of activity during CO2RR. These insights can aid the design of practical CO2 valorization technologies.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Boron Enolates to Construct Acyclic All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a mild and convenient method for the synthesis of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates via the 1,2&#8208;hydroboration of ketenes with boranes. The asymmetric allylic alkylation of boron enolates was also developed, providing efficient access to diverse valuable chiral aldehydes in good yields and with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Enolates are ubiquitous intermediates in organic synthesis. Among them, boron enolates exhibit distinctive reactivity patterns and selectivities due to the presence of a boron atom, making their synthesis highly attractive. Although methods for accessing ketone&#8208; or ester&#8208;derived boron enolates are well&#8208;developed, much less progress has been made in the development of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates due to aldehydes&#8242; high tendency toward self&#8208;condensation. Therefore, the practical applications of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates are significantly hindered. We present herein an efficient method for the preparation of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates via the 1,2&#8208;hydroboration of ketenes with boranes, avoiding the use of acidic R2BCl/R2BOTf and bases and leading to improved functional group tolerance. Utilizing this convenient protocol, we developed an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of boron enolates, yielding a wide array of chiral aldehydes bearing acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, which are prevalent in various natural products and bioactive molecules. The synthetic utility and practicality of this method are demonstrated through gram&#8208;scale reactions and asymmetric syntheses of the ent&#8208;5HT1&#8197;A antagonist as well as biological activity studies in inhibiting the growth of plant pathogens.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Assembly of Enzyme&#8208;Micelle Systems for Semi&#8208;Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a bio&#8208;hybrid assembly inspired by lipid&#8208;protein interactions in nature by utilizing photosensitized surfactants that self&#8208;assemble into light&#8208;absorbing micellar scaffolds capable of interfacing with hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases. This semi&#8208;artificial approach enabled benchmark turnover numbers for solar H2 production and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion, establishing a versatile platform for future photocatalytic transformations.







Abstract
Supramolecular surfactants provide a versatile platform to construct systems for solar fuel synthesis, for example via the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic photosensitizers and catalysts into diverse supramolecular structures. However, the utilization of amphiphilic photosensitizers in solar fuel production has predominantly focused on yielding gaseous products, such as molecular hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) with turnover numbers (TONs) of synthetic catalysts typically in the range of hundreds to thousands. Inspired by biological lipid&#8208;protein interactions, we present herein a bio&#8208;hybrid assembly strategy that utilizes photosensitizers as surfactants to form micellar scaffolds that interface with enzymes, namely hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases, for semi&#8208;artificial photosynthesis. Specifically, surfactants with a tris(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine)ruthenium(II) head group provide high photocatalytic activity upon association with the enzymes as their positively charged [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex electrostatically interacts with the enzymes favorably to enable direct electron transfer at the micelle&#8208;enzyme interface. Time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy support the beneficial charge carrier dynamics of the reductively quenched [Ru(bpy)3]+ species when the enzymes are introduced in the micellar solution. Thus, a biohybrid concept is introduced for solar fuel synthesis using a biomimetic enzyme&#8208;micellar system, providing also a platform for other photocatalytic transformations using enzymes in the future.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Mediated Lattice Oxygen Redox Design for Perovskite Oxide Catalysts</title>

SrFeO3&#8211;&#948; with Sr vacancies (SFO&#8208;Srv) undergoes a hole&#8208;mediated lattice oxygen redox mechanism during CO oxidation reaction. The holes in SFO&#8208;Srv are reversibly consumed and regenerated via highly covalent Fe(4&#8211;x)+&#8208;O(2&#8211;x)&#8211; sites during the entire lattice oxygen redox process.







Abstract
Present design and application of perovskite oxide catalysts assume lattice oxygen redox (LOR) mechanisms that depend on lattice oxygen activity without consideration of the entire redox cycle. Herein, using in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we uncover a hole&#8208;mediated LOR cycle on p&#8208;type Sr&#8208;deficient SrFeO3&#8211;&#948; (SFO&#8208;Srv) perovskites in CO oxidation reaction. Sr vacancies activate surface lattice oxygen of SFO&#8208;Srv and promote formation of highly covalent Fe(4&#8211;x)+&#8208;O(2&#8211;x)&#8211; sites. In situ electrical conductivity measurement demonstrates that holes directly participate in the entire LOR cycle, and are reversibly consumed and regenerated in reducing/oxidizing atmosphere via Fe(4&#8211;x)+&#8208;O(2&#8211;x)&#8211; sites of SFO&#8208;Srv. Hole&#8208;mediated LOR in SFO&#8208;Srv, as revealed by in situ soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, occurs through changing in covalency of Fe&#8722;O bonds, O 2p hole state, and electron density of Fe sites. 18O2 labeling experiment further confirms an improved Mars&#8211;van Krevelen pathway in the hole&#8208;mediated LOR cycle, which accounts for a ten&#8208;times enhancement of SFO&#8208;Srv for CO reaction rate over that of SFO alone.

         <title>Robust Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles via Ethynyl Bonding for High&#8208;Fidelity Bioanalytical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, rapid and user&#8208;friendly strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;functionalized AuNP conjugates via stable Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bonds was developed, which showed better resistance to biothiols than Au&#8722;S conjugates, enhancing detection signal fidelity and reliability in cell imaging, especially in complex physiological environments. This strategy addresses the longstanding issue of stability towards biothiols, thereby making it a valuable tool for a broad range of biological applications.







Abstract
While Au&#8722;S bonds have been widely applied in preparing gold nanoparticle (AuNP) bioconjugates for biosensing, cell imaging, and biomedical research, biothiols in complex biological environments can seriously interfere with the stability of the conjugates due to ligand exchange. Herein, we communicate a robust and fast strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;functionalized AuNP conjugates (PFCs) using the Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond, which can be completed within two minutes. The resulting Au&#8722;C&#8801;C PFCs exhibited better stability and resistance to biothiols than the corresponding Au&#8722;S PFCs, and also demonstrated excellent stability in high salt concentration, a wide range of pH values, and varying temperatures. The mechanism of Au&#8722;C&#8801;C conjugation was confirmed using molecular dynamics simulation and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Au&#8722;C&#8801;C PFCs significantly improved the signal fidelity in an intracellular caspase imaging assay. Overall, the developed strategy provides a promising approach for constructing AuNP nanoprobes, allowing reliable detection and broadening the potential for diverse biological applications.

         <title>Promoting Li+&#8208;Solvents Desolvation by Engineering Nickel Single Atoms into Graphene Membrane toward Fast Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni single atom anchored on the graphene membrane (Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G) was prepared by an in situ electrochemical doping coupled with a self&#8208;assembly strategy. The Ni single atom sites can accelerate the dissociation process of the Li+&#8208;solvent complex and obtain a large number of Li+, which delivers fast sulfur redox kinetics. Furthermore, the large&#8208;sized solvent molecules and polysulfides were largely sieved and restricted when passing through the specific nano&#8208;channels of the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries featuring high energy density are expected to be next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, but are severely impeded by the suppressive Li+&#8208;solvents desolvation process at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, a novel electrochemical in situ doping coupled with a self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed to fabricate the graphene membrane anchored by Ni single atoms (Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G), aimed at promoting the dissociation kinetics of Li+&#8208;solvents complex by combining electrocatalysis and nanochannel sieving effect. Theoretical simulation and in situ Raman spectroscopy characterizations revealed that the Ni&#8208;O5 configuration within the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane is capable of lowering the Li+&#8208;solvent dissociation energy barrier and promoting free Li+ migration, thereby delivering the fast sulfur redox kinetics. In addition, taking advantage of the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane with a special transport channel, the large&#8208;sized solvent molecules and polysulfides were sieved and confined to a great degree. As a result, the Li&#8722;S batteries with the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G on separator as cathode front&#8208;faces exhibit a high capacity of 1169&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a good rate performance and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability, where a capacity decay of only 0.024&#8201;% per cycle after 700 cycles can be achieved. Furthermore, the cell with a sulfur loading of 4.78&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 delivers a high areal capacity of 4.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;C.

         <title>A Sequential Release Micro&#8208;nano System for Colitis Therapy via Gut Microbiota and Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>

The micro&#8208;nano system achieves the sequential release of drugs in response to gut microbiota and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inulin prebiotics restore gut microbiota balance. Selenium compounds scavenge ROS and promote macrophage polarization, while 3&#8208;oxolithocholic acid suppresses TH17&#8208;cell differentiation. As a multifactorial therapeutic approach, inulin microspheres containing nanomicelles target the gut microbiome and immune responses for treating acute colitis.







Abstract
Commencing with the breakdown of the intestinal barrier, various pathogenic factors, such as dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, harmful inflammatory cytokines, and immune system imbalance, collectively contribute to the development of colitis. Numerous interventions focusing on single factors have been developed to provide short&#8208;term therapeutic benefits, but the continued existence of unresolved pathogenic factors can lead to disease exacerbation. Here we have designed a multicomponent system&#8208;inulin microspheres encapsulating selenium&#8208;containing nanomicelles, aiming to tackle the multiple factors associated with colitis. This micro&#8208;nano drug delivery platform achieves sequential release of drugs in the inflamed colon, with each component of the system functioning independently and jointly. The outer layer of inulin supplies nutrients for probiotics. The inner core comprises selenocystamine and 3&#8208;oxolithocholic acid, which polarize macrophages towards an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype and regulate adaptive immunity by inhibiting TH17&#8208;cell differentiation, respectively. In an acute colitis mouse model, this therapeutic system ameliorates colonic inflammation, enhances the abundance of gut microbiota, and modulates the mucosal immune system, showing potential in preventing colitis.

Click chemistry has been used to synthesize a non&#8208;ionic cathode interlayer (PDIBr&#8208;TOT). The dominant face&#8208;on orientation arising from the bulky and extended side chains affords a solar cell efficiency of 19.52&#8201;%, out&#8208;performing typical self&#8208;doping interlayers. Furthermore, the weak electron&#8208;donating side chains in the PDIBr&#8208;TOT interlayers remarkably enhance the device stability.







Abstract
Electron transport properties of cathode interlayers are crucial to high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). We propose a novel approach to enhance electron transport of cathode interlayers through controlling a preferential face&#8208;on molecular orientation of non&#8208;ionic perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208; (PDI) based cathode interlayers with restricted n&#8208;doping effects. 1&#8208;(2,5,8&#8208;trioxadec&#8208;10&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole (TOT) units as bulky and extended side chains were incorporated into brominated&#8208;PDIs via click chemistry to yield PDIBr&#8208;TOT. TOT side chains impart PDI&#8208;based interlayers with a dominant face&#8208;on orientation, meanwhile leading to a negligible doping effect due to their weak electron&#8208;donating properties. Impressively, at a slight doping level, higher electron mobility is gained through efficient vertical charge transport channels built by preferred face&#8208;on molecular orientations of PDIBr&#8208;TOT, beating the results acquired through strong doping effects of traditional PDIBr&#8722;N with an edge&#8208;on orientation. Thus, PDIBr&#8208;TOT can suppress exciton recombination and lower the surface energies for good contact with active layers, consequently leading to increases in fill factor and short&#8208;circuit current. Integrating PDIBr&#8208;TOT with various active layers, a remarkable efficiency of 19.52&#8201;% is obtained. Moreover, device stability is enhanced by restrained doping effects. Modulating face&#8208;on orientations of cathode interlayers prescribed here will encourage further innovative designs of high&#8208;performance cathode interlayers towards OSC advances.

&lt;p&gt;Click chemistry has been used to synthesize a non-ionic cathode interlayer (PDIBr-TOT). The dominant face-on orientation arising from the bulky and extended side chains affords a solar cell efficiency of 19.52&#8201;%, out-performing typical self-doping interlayers. Furthermore, the weak electron-donating side chains in the PDIBr-TOT interlayers remarkably enhance the device stability.

We propose a novel approach to enhance electron transport of cathode interlayers through controlling a preferential face-on molecular orientation of non-ionic perylene-diimide- (PDI) based cathode interlayers with restricted n-doping effects. 1-(2,5,8-trioxadec-10-yl)-1,2,3-triazole (TOT) units as bulky and extended side chains were incorporated into brominated-PDIs via click chemistry to yield PDIBr-TOT.

         <title>Tandem Switch&#8208;Triggered On&#8208;Demand Synthesis of Aromatic Amines in High Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a tandem switch strategy that transforms the site and component incompatibilities commonly observed in tandem synthesis into strengths. By using a kinetic switch with phosphotungstic acid&#8208;modified Ni&#8722;Ni(Al)O heterojunction catalyst and a thermodynamic switch via competitive adsorption of ethanol, hydrogen, and acrylonitrile, we achieve on&#8208;demand synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary aromatic amines, all with yields over 96&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tandem catalysis stands as a beacon of chemical sustainability. Although bifunctional catalysts have achieved wide success in two&#8208;step tandem reactions, achieving multi&#8208;step catalysis with three or more distinct and potentially incompatible catalytic sites and components remains an ambitious challenge. Here, we present a &#8220;tandem switch&#8221; strategy that transforms these incompatibilities into functional advantages, enabling on&#8208;demand production of primary, secondary, and tertiary aromatic amines, all with yields exceeding 96&#8201;%. A kinetic switch, enabled by phosphotungstic acid functionalization of the Ni&#8722;Ni(Al)O heterojunction catalyst, modulates the Ni&#8722;Ni and Ni&#8722;O boundary microenvironment to simultaneously accelerate the rate&#8208;determining steps in nitrobenzene hydrogenation, N&#8208;alkylation, and aza&#8208;Michael addition. Meanwhile, a thermodynamic switch, controlled by the competitive adsorption of ethanol, hydrogen, and acrylonitrile, stepwise minimizes Gibbs free energy to ensure a seamless reaction cascade. Hence, by toggling these tandem switches on or off, we achieve selective regulation of nitrobenzene conversion pathways into the production of targeted aromatic amine. Techno&#8208;economic analysis shows the developed process significantly reduces material and energy consumption for sustainable amine production.

         <title>Discovery of Covalent and Cell&#8208;Active ALKBH5 Inhibitors with Potent Antileukemia Effects In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by a non&#8208;catalytic C200&#8208;covalent strategy, a series of maleimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as covalent ALKBH5 inhibitors. Compound 18&#8201;l exhibited good ALKBH5 inhibitory activity, and excellent in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects. Furthermore, 18&#8201;l also had intracellular targeting at the proteomic level.







Abstract
The N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase ALKBH5 is the only other identified m6A eraser except for FTO, and dysregulated ALKBH5 functions were closely associated with leukemogenesis. However, the development of ALKBH5 inhibitors is slow compared to FTO inhibitors. Inspired by a non&#8208;catalytic C200&#8208;covalent strategy, a series of maleimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as potent and covalent ALKBH5 inhibitors in this work. The analog 18&#8201;l exhibited excellent inhibitory effects on ALKBH5 (IC50=0.62&#8197;&#956;M), and exerted a strong antiproliferative effect on NB4 cells with IC50 of 0.63&#8197;&#956;M. The Kd value of 18&#8201;l binding to ALKBH5 was 804&#8197;nM, while no binding was observed with FTO. This result indicated that 18&#8201;l was a highly selective inhibitor of ALKBH5 rather than FTO. Additionally, proteomic experiments showed that 18&#8201;l directly targeted ALKBH5 in cells and altered m6A levels on mRNA, blocked the related downstream signal pathways, promoted differentiation, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, 18&#8201;l exerted excellent in vivo antitumor activity with TGITV values of 66.3&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mg/kg in NB4 tumor xenograft models.

         <title>Maximizing the Accessibility of Acid Sites Within Zeolite Catalysts for Syngas Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the effective diffusion length into the relationship between the Thiele modulus and effectiveness factors of reaction rates, a 12MR channel length of 60&#8197;nm is identified to approach the threshold length for full access to the 8MR acid sites of MOR zeolite in direct syngas conversion. Consequently, MOR60 exhibits remarkable catalytic performance with CO conversion reaching 33&#8201;% and ethylene selectivity 69&#8201;%.







Abstract
Mass transport within zeolites is pivotal in determining the accessibility of active sites to reactants and hence the catalytic performance. However, there lacks of quantitative guidance for synthesis of desired zeolites with reduced diffusion limitation. Herein, we take mordenite (MOR) zeolite as a model, which is characterized by 12&#8208;membered rings (MR) channels as transport path towards the active sites within the 8MR side pockets for syngas conversion to light olefins. By correlating the effective diffusion lengths (

 ${2l}$



) with the Thiele modulus and the effectiveness factors of reaction rates over a composite catalyst ZnAlOx&#8208;MOR, we determine that the shortest 12MR channel length (

2L

 ${2L}$



) of 60&#8197;nm in this study is close to the threshold length necessary for full access to the 8MR acid sites. As a result, it exhibits excellent catalytic performance with CO conversion reaching 33&#8201;% and ethylene selectivity 69&#8201;%. Furthermore, the methodology is general and essential for further development of efficient zeolite catalysts with fully accessible active sites.

Introducing two bulky TSC blocks restrains the vibrational transitions of the multi&#8208;resonance nitrogen/carbonyl core, with full widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19 and 25&#8197;nm in solution. A record&#8208;high electroluminescent efficiency for a nitrogen/carbonyl system of 26.7&#8201;% with a FWHM of 23&#8197;nm was obtained within the blue spectrum.







Abstract
Organic luminescent materials featuring noncovalent through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) have attracted considerable attention. However, the presence of multiple vibrational energy levels and weak spatial electron delocalization typically results in broad emission peaks for TSC&#8208;based emitters, significantly impeding their extensive application in optoelectronic technologies. Herein, two TSC emitters, TSFQ&#8208;TRZ and TSFQ&#8208;Ph, were synthesized by integrating a fused nitrogen/carbonyl skeleton with various adjacent arene 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TPTRZ) and phenyl group segments through a rigid spiro spacer. These emitters exhibited narrow emissions, with full widths at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#8197;nm and 25&#8197;nm, respectively. Experimental and theoretical investigations unveiled that the TPTRZ segment introduces steric hindrance, while simultaneously suppressing molecular vibrations through intramolecular interactions&#8212;a key factor in achieving narrow emissions. Leveraging this narrow blue emission, electroluminescent devices employing TSFQ&#8208;TRZ as the emitter achieved an impressive maximum external quantum efficiency of 26.7&#8201;%, which further increased to 28.3&#8201;% when sensitized by phosphorescent emitter. This work demonstrates highly efficient, narrowband emissions from TSC&#8208;based emitters, thereby expanding their potential applications in the electroluminescence field.

         <title>Can Electroactive Tracer Molecules Reveal Viscoelastic Structure by Measuring Non&#8208;Fickian Diffusion?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Voltage scans of duration t electrolyze reducer R to oxidizer O yielding peak&#8208;currents (Ip). The ensuing concentration gradient of R induces a diffusion rate towards the electrode that peaks at Ip and decays as 1/t1/2. Plotting log of Ip2 vs. 1/t&#945; introduces diffusion exponent &#945; as slope indicator of &#8220;free&#8221; Fickian diffusion (&#945;=1) in viscous liquids and &#8220;hindered&#8221; Non&#8208;Fickian sub&#8208;diffusion (&#945;&lt;1) in viscoelastic hydrogels.







Abstract
We find that viscous and viscoelastic fluids are distinguishable by gauging Non&#8208;Fickian diffusion of dissolved electroactive molecules. Typically, such fluids are differentiated by measuring the mean&#8208;squared&#8208;displacement &lt;&#916;r2&gt; of embedded tracer particles (~1&#8197;&#956;m) diffusing over time (t). From the relationship &lt;&#916;r2&gt;=6Dt&#945; (D=particle diffusivity), log plots of &lt;&#916;r2&gt;vs.t&#945; reveal regimes encoded in the slope &#945;. For Fickian diffusion &#945;=1, whereas &#945;&lt;1 and &#945;&gt;1, indicate Non&#8208;Fickian sub&#8208; and super&#8208;diffusion, respectively. Here, we electrolyzed redox reporters as molecular tracers in selected fluids. The current (I) relationship I

&#8733;

 ${\propto }$



v1/2 (v=scan&#8208;rate) was recast as I2vs.1/t&#945; to introduce &#945; as Non&#8208;Fickian quantifier in log plots. When viscosity increased at high concentration of small&#8208;molecules, D for the redox reporter declined but &#945; remained constant at ~1 (Fickian). In contrast, both D and &#945;(&lt;1) decreased in viscoelastic hydrogels confirming a molecular sub&#8208;diffusive regime. These results agree with particle microrheology on the same fluid types using optical methods that are inapplicable to molecules. By quantifying Non&#8208;Fickian diffusion of electroactive molecular tracers, our method can uncover diffusion&#8208;structure relationships to identify regulators in neurodegenerative liquid&#8208;solid transitions of protein aggregates. Unlike tracer particles, the diffusivity of tracer molecules is controlled by the applied potential and electrode size.

         <title>Pathway Engineering in Pd&#8208;Based Supramolecular Cage Synthesis via Inner&#8208;Outer Steric Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of ligand LA with palladium can selectively generate three types of assemblies: Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4. By changing the reaction conditions, the three assemblies can be transformed into each other. Based on this, introducing ligand LB can prepare Pd2LA3LB through 10 pathways, and the synthesis path of trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 can reach up to 16.







Abstract
For artificial supramolecular architectures designed to mimic biological systems, achieving different pathway synthesis is challenging due to the requirement of multiple stable and interconvertible intermediates. Here, we propose a novel &#8220;inner&#8208;outer steric synergy&#8221; strategy and investigate controllable pathway engineering for the synthesis of specific structures. Firstly, three structures (Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3 and Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4) with interconversion properties were selectively formed by assembling externally modified ligand LA with Pd(II). Furthermore, Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2 can further assemble with the ligand LB with inner steric hindrance to generate heteroleptic trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 cage, while Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, as an intermediate, can assemble with LB to form Pd2LA3LB. It is noteworthy that Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, and Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4 can interconvert under specific conditions, enabling the synthesis of Pd2LA3LB and trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 through 10 and 16 pathways, respectively. This research not only introduces a novel strategy for constructing heteroleptic cages but also demonstrates the achievement of pathway engineering.

         <dc:description>
This study develops new photoinitiators (PIs) for photopolymerization, combining high efficiency, low toxicity, and compatibility with 3D printing. The C5 compound, designed via molecular modeling, outperforms commercial PIs, improving initiation by 40&#8211;132&#8201;% under LED and sunlight. Its efficiency, photochemical mechanism, and low toxicity are experimentally confirmed.







Abstract
The development of photoinitiators (PIs) combining high initiation ability, low&#8208;toxicity, and availability for high&#8208;precision 3D printing is a key challenge and an urgent problem to be solved nowadays in photopolymerization. In this study, carbazole chalcone glyoxylate oxime ester derivatives (denoted as Cs, C1&#8722;C5) containing both glyoxylate and oxime ester moieties with good light absorption properties in the visible range have been designed as type I PIs for the free radical photopolymerization (FRP) of trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) under 405&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) as well as sunlight irradiation. The reaction properties and mechanism of Cs are firstly predicted by molecular modeling/molecular design, which anticipate that C5 could exhibit the best photoinitiation ability, this structure being more prone to decarboxylation. Subsequent experimental results clearly show that the photoinitiation ability of C5 outperforms that of the benchmark commercial PIs (methyl benzoylformate (MBF), diphenyl (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO)), and phenylbis (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)&#8208;phosphine oxide (BAPO) under the same conditions. Compared to TPO, the photoinitiation ability of C5 improved by 40&#8201;%, 132&#8201;%, and 47&#8201;% exposed to LED@405&#8197;nm, LED@450&#8197;nm, and sunlight. In addition, C5 is successfully applied to 3D printing for the manufacture of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;resolution object. The photochemical mechanism of C5 is systematically and comprehensively analyzed using a combination of steady state photolysis, decarboxylation reaction, fluorescence experiments, and electron spin resonance&#8208;spin trapping (ESR&#8208;ST) technology. It is found that both glyoxylate and oxime ester in C5 are highly active and capable of undergoing decarboxylation reactions to produce CO2 and free radicals, which is consistent with the results predicted by molecular modeling. Furthermore, the low&#8208;toxicity of C5 is evidenced by cytotoxicity assays. The comprehensive molecular modeling and experimental approach adopted in this research has led to the development of novel PIs that are highly efficient and low&#8208;toxic, and can be used for high&#8208;precision 3D printing, which offers broad application prospects in the fields of environmental sustainability, visible light curing, and biomedical science.

         <title>Terpyridine&#8208; and Quarterpyridine&#8208;Based Cationic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Catalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>

Terpyridine&#8208; and quarterpyridine&#8208;based vinylene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor cationic COFs are synthesized, which exhibit considerably high visible&#8208;light catalytic efficiency with the H2O2 production rate (HPR) is as high as 7955&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in water and O2 atmosphere. Even though in air, its HPR value still reaches 6249&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The revealed structure&#8211;property relationship presents new insights into the engineering of multipyridine&#8208;based cationic COFs for highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.







Abstract
This paper presents multipyridine&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with precisely defined position and number of pyridinium cationic groups. Specifically, three terpyridine&#8208; and quarterpyridine&#8208;based trialdehydes were synthesized, and utilized as the starting monomers to polymerize with trimethylpyridinium bromide to yield vinylene&#8208;linked iTPy&#8208;COF, iTPPy&#8208;COF and iQPPy&#8208;COF, respectively. Thus constructed donor&#8208;acceptor cationic COFs exhibit considerably high visible&#8208;light catalytic efficiency for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis by the dual&#8208;channel mechanisms of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR). In pure water and O2 atmosphere, the H2O2 production rate (HPR) of iTPPy&#8208;COF after 1&#8197;h reaction is as high as 7955&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Even though in air, its HPR value still reaches 6249&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Moreover, it is found that changing the arm lengths and ratios of pyridine to benzene ring in the frameworks significantly affects the photocatalytic capability. The structure&#8211;property relationship is investigated in terms of the variations of electronic structures through the theoretical simulations and measurements of photophysical parameters such as fluorescence lifetimes, photocurrent intensities, and impedances of charge transfer, which offers new insights into the engineering of multipyridine&#8208;based cationic COFs for highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>Manipulating &#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions in Halogenated Additives for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells with 19.8&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two halogenated volatile solid additives DBB and DFBB selected to improve photovoltaic performance has been systematically studied. Our results demonstrate that the addition of DFBB with a higher electrostatic potential extremum and stronger &#963;&#8208;holes compared to DBB can regulate the multi&#8208;scale morphology to achieve a superior efficiency of 19.2&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO and 19.8&#8201;% for D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO. This work provides valuable insights to develop volatile additives for high performance OSCs.







Abstract
The incorporation of volatile solid additives has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the influence of the electronic structure of these additives on morphological evolution remains insufficiently understood. Herein, 1,4&#8208;Dibromobenzene (DBB) and 1,4&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;2,5&#8208;dibromobenzene (DFBB) are introduced as volatile additives into OSCs. Theoretical calculations indicate that DFBB has a higher electrostatic potential extremum and stronger &#963;&#8208;holes interaction compared to DBB, enabling more robust intermolecular interactions with acceptors. The synergistic halogen interactions between DFBB and the active layer matrix balances the differences in crystallinity between the donor and acceptor during the film formation process, promotes the formation of dense molecular packing and ordered orientation, optimizes the vertical composition distribution, and promotes the formation of domain sizes close to the exciton diffusion distance. Consequently, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device treated with DFBB achieves an efficiency of 19.2&#8201;% with a fill factor (FF) of 80.8&#8201;%, which is superior to the control and DBB. Further validation across various systems, including PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9, and D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO, highlights similar efficiency enhancements, with the D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO system achieving an outstanding PCE of 19.8&#8201;%. This work demonstrates that the modulation of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in volatile additives can effectively optimize multi&#8208;scale morphology for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Selective Gold Recycling from Electronic Waste Using a Highly Stable Porous Aromatic Framework/Polymer and Its Application for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous aromatic framework/polymer composite, PAF&#8208;147/polydopamine (PDA), is constructed via a mild in situ polymerization method for rapid and selective gold recovery from electronic waste leachate. Leveraging the redox adsorption mechanism and the unique microenvironment of PAF&#8208;147/PDA, the adsorbent post&#8208;adsorption is directly applicable for highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Recycling gold from electronic waste represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy for both resource recovery and waste reduction. In this study, we designed an innovative and highly stable porous aromatic framework (PAF)/polymer composite, PAF&#8208;147/polydopamine (PDA), as an efficient adsorbent for selective gold recovery for the first time. The maximum gold adsorption capacity of PAF&#8208;147/PDA reached 1700&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, it could rapidly extract over 95&#8201;% of gold from solutions in a pH range of 0&#8211;10 within just 2&#8197;minutes. Importantly, as a real application demonstration, the PAF&#8208;147/PDA composite selectively recovered 99&#8201;% of gold from the leachate of discarded central processing units. When the recovered Au&#8208;containing composite was applied to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, the Faradaic efficiency for CO production exceeded 95&#8201;% across acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, outperforming most reported gold&#8208;based catalysts due to the cooperation effect of the composite and Au. This work opens a new way for the combination of selective gold recovery from electronic waste with highly efficient CO2 conversion.

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation of Allyl Ethers: Optimization, Scope, Mechanism and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl ethers has been developed by using ketones as the C&#8208;nucleophiles. Linear vinyl ethers or branched allyl ethers were readily formed in high yield with excellent regioselectivity by changing the reaction conditions. Bimetallic synergistic catalysis with an achiral Pd(0) catalyst and a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;Ni(II) complex enabled the synthesis of a variety of enantioenriched allyl ethers.







Abstract
Vinyl ethers and allyl ethers are important motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods toward their synthesis, direct allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl ethers is one of the most efficient approaches. In this study, one of two regioisomers, a vinyl ether or an allyl ether, could be obtained, depending on whether a Lewis acid co&#8208;catalyst was present. Furthermore, branched allyl ethers were smoothly prepared in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 b/l, 99&#8201;% ee) by synergistic catalysis with an achiral Pd(0) complex and a chiral Lewis acid catalyst.

         <title>High&#8208;Connectivity 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with pdp Net for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>

Two novel high&#8208;connectivity 3D COFs, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662, are constructed using a combination of D2h&#8208;symmetric 8&#8208;nodal and D3h&#8208;symmetric 6&#8208;nodal building blocks. These COFs feature an unprecedented [8+6]&#8208;c pdp net with rare mesoporous polyhedral cages and exhibit outstanding C2H2/CO2 separation capabilities.







Abstract
High&#8208;connectivity 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention due to their structural complexity, stability, and potential for functional applications. However, the synthesis of 3D COFs using mixed high&#8208;nodal building units remains a substantial challenge. In this work, we introduce two novel 3D COFs, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662, which are constructed using a combination of D2h&#8208;symmetric 8&#8208;nodal and D3h&#8208;symmetric 6&#8208;nodal building blocks. These COFs feature an unprecedented [8+6]&#8208;c pdp net with rare mesoporous polyhedral cages (~3.9&#8197;nm). Remarkably, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662 exhibit outstanding separation capabilities, achieving adsorption selectivities of 4.3 and 5.9, respectively, for C2H2/CO2 (1/1, v/v) mixtures. Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm their excellent separation capability, maintaining this performance even under conditions of 100&#8201;% humidity. Monte Carlo simulations and DFT calculations indicate that the exceptional adsorption performance is attributed to the well&#8208;defined pore cavities of the COFs, with fluorination of the building unit further enhancing C2H2 selectivity through improved electrostatic and host&#8211;guest interactions. This study expands the structural diversity of COFs and highlights their potential for low&#8208;energy separation processes.

         <title>Tandem Assembly and Etching Chemistry towards Mesoporous Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Sodium Storage Over 50,000 Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>

Long&#8208;range ion transport in microporous channels severely limits the application of two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) in energy storage. We establish a bi&#8208;functional modulator manipulated tandem assembly and etching chemistry to incorporate perpendicularly aligned mesopores into the microporous cMOFs, which offers two orders of magnitude shorter micropore channels, enabling a remarkable rate cyclability over 50,000 cycles at 50&#8197;C.







Abstract
Despite two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) being attractive due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity and redox activity for energy applications, alleviating the constrained mass transfer within long&#8208;range micropore channels remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a tandem assembly and etching chemistry, to incorporate perpendicularly aligned mesopores into the micropores of cMOFs, via a bi&#8208;functional modulator. Synchrotron spectral and morphological analyses demonstrate that the elaborate ammonia modulator first coordinates with Zn2+ forming defects during the initial self&#8208;assembly of cMOF oligomers, which then initiates mesoporous cMOFs via in situ etching. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations further reveal that such a unique perpendicular mesoporous structure shorts the micropore channels by two orders of magnitude and relaxes the inherent ion stacking within micropores, leading to five times faster Na+ transport and a remarkable rate capability at 250&#8197;C and sodium storage lifespan over 50,000 cycles. Our protocol opens up a new avenue for introducing mesopores into microporous cMOFs for advanced energy applications and beyond.

         <title>Direct Photopatterning of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks via Photoinduced Fluorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a mild UV exposure dose (10&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&#8722;2), fluorinated azide molecules covalently bind to ZIFs via hydrocarbon insertion, resulting in fluorination and significantly increasing their stability in water. This method successfully realizes large&#8208;area, high&#8208;resolution direct lithography by selective exposure and water immersion.







Abstract
Precise and effective patterning strategies are essential for integrating metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into microelectronics, photonics, sensors, and other solid&#8208;state devices. Direct lithography of MOFs with light and other irradiation sources has emerged as a promising patterning strategy. However, existing direct lithography methods often rely on the irradiation&#8208;induced amorphization of the MOFs structures and the breaking of strong covalent bonds in their organic linkers. High&#8208;energy sources (such as X&#8208;rays or electron beams) and large irradiation doses &#8211; conditions unfavorable for scalable patterning &#8211; are thus required. Here, we report a photoinduced fluorination chemistry for patterning various zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) under mild UV irradiation. Using UV doses as low as 10&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&#8722;2, light&#8208;sensitive fluorine&#8208;containing molecules covalently bond to ZIFs and enhance their stability in water. This creates a water&#8208;stability contrast between ZIFs in exposed and unexposed regions, enabling scalable direct photolithography of ZIFs with high resolution (2&#8197;&#956;m) on 4&#8208;inch wafers and flexible substrates. The patterned ZIFs preserve their original crystallinity and porous properties while gaining increased hydrophobicity. This allows for the demonstration of a water&#8208;responsive fluorescent MOFs array with implications in sensing and multicolor information encryption.

&lt;p&gt;By using a mild UV exposure dose (10&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), fluorinated azide molecules covalently bind to ZIFs via hydrocarbon insertion, resulting in fluorination and significantly increasing their stability in water. This method successfully realizes large-area, high-resolution direct lithography by selective exposure and water immersion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise and effective patterning strategies are essential for integrating metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into microelectronics, photonics, sensors, and other solid-state devices. Direct lithography of MOFs with light and other irradiation sources has emerged as a promising patterning strategy. However, existing direct lithography methods often rely on the irradiation-induced amorphization of the MOFs structures and the breaking of strong covalent bonds in their organic linkers. High-energy sources (such as X-rays or electron beams) and large irradiation doses &#8211; conditions unfavorable for scalable patterning &#8211; are thus required. Here, we report a photoinduced fluorination chemistry for patterning various zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) under mild UV irradiation. Using UV doses as low as 10&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, light-sensitive fluorine-containing molecules covalently bond to ZIFs and enhance their stability in water. This creates a water-stability contrast between ZIFs in exposed and unexposed regions, enabling scalable direct photolithography of ZIFs with high resolution (2&#8197;&#956;m) on 4-inch wafers and flexible substrates. The patterned ZIFs preserve their original crystallinity and porous properties while gaining increased hydrophobicity. This allows for the demonstration of a water-responsive fluorescent MOFs array with implications in sensing and multicolor information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Body Heat&#8208; and Sunlight&#8208; Driven Self&#8208;Sustaining Motion via Material&#8208;Structure Synergy</title>

Diels&#8211;Alder bond&#8208;crosslinked liquid crystal elastomers with low nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures and high reprogrammability were developed, enabling low&#8208;energy, self&#8208;sustained actuators through material&#8208;structure synergy. These actuators achieve high strain rates around 30&#8201;&#176;C, facilitating self&#8208;sustaining motion powered by ambient/body heat or solar energy, with potential in biomedical and environmentally powered applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;sustained actuators powered by natural, low&#8208;energy sources based on liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are attractive as they offer high safety, abundant energy availability, and practicality in applications. However, achieving stable self&#8208;sustaining motion with low&#8208;energy sources requires high actuation strain rates within a narrow temperature range near ambient conditions &#8211; a great challenge as LCEs with low nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures (Tni) generally exhibit reduced actuation strain and strain rates. To address this, we synthesized a carbon nanotube&#8208;doped LCE with a low Tni and reversible Diels&#8211;Alder crosslinks, termed DALCE, and readily (re)fabricated it into specific structures (e.g., twisted&#8208;and&#8208;coiled or bimorph shapes). By leveraging material&#8208;structure synergy, we achieved both low Tni and high actuation strain rates, enabling self&#8208;rolling, self&#8208;breathing and autonomous twisting&#8208;untwisting movements powered by ambient/body temperature or natural sunlight. This low&#8208;energy, self&#8208;sustained actuator design opens new possibilities for LCE&#8208;based biomedical applications and naturally powered automatic devices.

         <title>Trade&#8208;Off Between Toxicity and Efficiency in Tin&#8208; versus Lead&#8208;Based Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites are considered promising alternatives to overcome the toxicity in their Pb&#8208;based counterparts. However, it was found that there is a trade&#8208;off between toxicity and efficiency. Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites are intrinsically limited by much stronger nonradiative recombination. Future research should go beyond the Pb and Sn bases.







Abstract
Toxicity remains one of the major challenges that prevent Pb&#8208;based halide perovskites from widespread utilization. Ideally, non&#8208;toxic alternatives can be identified while still maintaining the superior power conversion efficiency of the Pb&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Using the currently most promising candidate, the Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites, as an example, we show that a trade&#8208;off exists between toxicity and efficiency in the Sn&#8208; versus Pb&#8208;based halide perovskites. Indeed, the dominant nonradiative recombination center in the Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites differs from the one in its Pb&#8208;based counterparts, resulting in the nonradiative capture coefficient in CsSnI3 being an order of magnitude higher than that in CsPbI3. We attribute this difference to the band alignment. Our results indicate that development of halide perovskites beyond the Pb and Sn bases is essential for efficient yet environmentally friendly perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Triple&#8208;Targeted Radiosensitizer Enhances Hypoxic Tumor Targeting and Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;targeted, nitroimidazole&#8208;bearing radiosensitizer that self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles (A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs) has been developed for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging&#8208;guided on&#8208;demand radio&#8208;immunotherapy of hypoxic tumors.







Abstract
Targeted delivery of radiosensitizers and real&#8208;time monitoring of hypoxia are crucial for overcoming radiotherapy resistance in hypoxic tumors. Here, we report A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD, a triple&#8208;targeted nitroimidazole (Ni)&#8208;linked radiosensitizer that self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles (A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs) for bimodal near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR FL) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided radio&#8208;immunotherapy. A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs specifically accumulate in &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;positive tumors, where they are hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to form Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs, with enhanced FL at 710&#8197;nm and dual PA signals at 680 and 730&#8197;nm. Under hypoxic conditions, nitroreductase (NTR) further reduces these NPs, covalently labeling endogenous proteins and increasing NP size. This process partially alleviates aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, increasing the FL710 signal and decreasing the PA730 signal, enabling real&#8208;time tracking of tumor&#8208;specific delivery and hypoxia. Following low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation (2&#8197;Gy), elevated NTR expression promotes further Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs reduction, enhancing proteins labeling and causing DNA damage. Moreover, radiosensitization with A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs triggers robust immunogenic cell death, stimulating antitumor immunity that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, significantly prolonging survival in mice with orthotopic 4T1 tumors. This work underscores the potential of self&#8208;assembling, triple&#8208;targeted radiotheranostic agents for improving tumor targeting, imaging, and radiotherapy efficacy in hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Polyester&#8208;Derived Alcohol into Value&#8208;Added Chemicals by Engineering Atomically Dispersed Pd Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs atomically dispersed Pd species on TiO2 catalyst for photoreforming polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;derived ethylene glycol into value&#8208;added glycolaldehyde. The Pd single atoms can greatly promote the photocatalytic performance by enriching the photogenerated holes and promoting ethylene glycol adsorption, achieving a high glycolaldehyde yield of 5072&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% and long&#8208;term durability.







Abstract
Photoreforming presents a promising strategy for upcycling waste polyester&#8208;derived alcohol into valuable chemicals. However, it remains a great challenge due to its low performance and unsatisfactory selectivity toward high&#8208;value C2 products. Here, we report the highly efficient and selective conversion of ethylene glycol (EG, a monomer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) to glycolaldehyde using atomically dispersed Pd species supported on TiO2 catalyst. A glycolaldehyde production rate of 5072&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% and long&#8208;term durability can be achieved. Experimental and theoretical results show that Pd single atoms can enhance the photocatalytic activity by enriching the photogenerated holes, which are the dominant species for the selective oxidation of EG to glycolaldehyde. More importantly, the adsorption of EG molecules on the catalysts is significantly promoted, which is subsequently transformed into RO&#8901; radicals, a crucial intermediate in producing glycolaldehyde. Additionally, Pd single atoms on TiO2 enable the reduction of the glycolaldehyde desorption barrier, thereby facilitating high selectivity and inhibiting further oxidation to C1 products. This work provides new insights into the photocatalytic conversion of polyester wastes by atomic engineering.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% and long-term durability can be achieved. Experimental and theoretical results show that Pd single atoms can enhance the photocatalytic activity by enriching the photogenerated holes, which are the dominant species for the selective oxidation of EG to glycolaldehyde. More importantly, the adsorption of EG molecules on the catalysts is significantly promoted, which is subsequently transformed into RO&#8901; radicals, a crucial intermediate in producing glycolaldehyde. Additionally, Pd single atoms on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enable the reduction of the glycolaldehyde desorption barrier, thereby facilitating high selectivity and inhibiting further oxidation to C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; products. This work provides new insights into the photocatalytic conversion of polyester wastes by atomic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Unprecedented control of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in two axially chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated fluorescent enantiomers is achieved through supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The naphthalene monoimide (NMI) fluorophores (R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI), each equipped with two pyridyl functionalities, show solvent&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and enhanced chiroptical properties through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Co&#8208;assemblies with chiral diacids (D&#8208; and L&#8208;tartaric acids) produce hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical structures, resulting in inversion and amplification of CD and CPL properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly and chiroptical properties of two axially chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminogens, R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI, each equipped with two pyridyl moieties for hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding with chiral diacids. The two enantiomers display aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and increased CD and CPL signals in the self&#8208;assembled state with a high glum value of 1.5 (&#177;0.06)&#215;10&#8722;2 in 1:9 dioxane:methylcyclohexane. Crystallographic analysis confirmed mirror&#8208;image helical structures for R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, leading to elongated hexagonal platelets. Supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of R&#8208;NMI with D&#8208; and L&#8208;tartaric acids (D&#8208;TA and L&#8208;TA) could remarkably modulate and invert the chiroptical properties of R&#8208;NMI, which is unachievable with control chiral monoacids. The co&#8208;assembled structures were driven by pyridine&#8208;carboxylic acid H&#8208;bonding as revealed from the crystal structure analysis, which was also supported by computational studies. Strikingly, R&#8208;NMI+D&#8208;TA leads to an exceptionally high fourfold amplification in the glum value [5.4 (&#177;0.04)&#215;10&#8722;2] with an inverted sign, which additionally demonstrates intriguing temperature&#8208;dependent switching. In contrast, R&#8208;NMI+L&#8208;TA results in a threefold reduction in the glum value [0.54 (&#177;0.015)&#215;10&#8722;3], also with an inverted sign compared to R&#8208;NMI alone, establishing a clear strategy for chiral discrimination between the two enantiomers of TA.

         <title>Selective Hydrogenolysis of Biomass&#8208;Derived Aromatic Alcohols over 2D&#8208;Mo2COx MXene by a Reversible Redox&#8208;Relay Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;Mo2COx with strong CH2&#8722;OH affinity and H2 activation ability shows a selective hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural to 5&#8208;methyl furfural at a mild reaction temperature. The catalyst shows a great catalytic stability and broad universality for various furfuryl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, and hydroxycyclopentenone substrates.







Abstract
Selective CH2&#8722;OH hydrogenolysis of biomass&#8208;derived aromatic alcohols to produce methyl aromatics is crucial for synthesizing sustainable fuels and chemicals; yet traditional metal&#8211;acid bifunctional catalysis possesses significant challenges owing to its complex reaction network. Herein, a 2D&#8208;Mo2COx MXene was fabricated, demonstrating an efficient hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural into 5&#8208;methyl furfural, achieving an impressive yield (99.5&#8201;%) at the mild reaction temperature of 90&#8201;&#176;C. Catalytic mechanism investigations reveal that 2D&#8208;Mo2COx facilitate the activation and cleavage of the CH2&#8722;OH bond through a redox mechanism, driven by the strong CH2&#8722;OH affinity of the Mo&#8211;Mo metallic plane. In the absence of H2, hydrogen from O&#8722;H group is the source for methyl formation from CH2&#8722;OH. Under a H2 atmosphere, H2 is activated to remove residual oxygen species, boosting selective hydrogenolysis while suppressing furan and CH=O hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited broad universality for synthesizing methyl aromatics from various furfuryl alcohols, benzyl alcohols, and hydroxycyclopentenones. This study presents a novel redox&#8208;relay mechanism in advanced MXene catalysis, offering a straightforward hydrogenolysis pathway for challenging substrates.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated TEMPO&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photo&#8208;Induced Hydrogen Peroxide Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitroxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF) was synthesized using a one&#8208;pot strategy for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The involvement of the TEMPO active site accelerates photogenerated charge separation. It promotes O2 adsorption in the Yeager&#8208;type two&#8208;electron O2 reduction pathway, resulting in an H2O2 yield of 10066&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a water&#8208;benzyl alcohol system.







Abstract
Molecular engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offers an alternative approach to conventional anthraquinone oxidation via photo&#8208;induced H2O2 production from O2 reduction. Despite their potential, reported photocatalysts suffer limited proton mobility, low selectivity, and insufficient charge separation and utilization. Herein, we report a nitroxyl radical (TEMPO) decorated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;COF photocatalyst via a one&#8208;pot strategy. Under visible light irradiation, highly crystalline TAPP&#8208;TPDA&#8208;TEMPO&#8208;COF (TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF) exhibits a remarkable photocatalytic H2O2 yield of 10066&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in two&#8208;phase water&#8208;benzyl alcohol (10&#8201;% BA) system through direct two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) pathway. The mechanistic study by DFT calculations and in situ DRIFT spectra suggests Yeager&#8208;type adsorption of *O2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate on the nitroxyl radical site (N&#8722;O&#8901;). The efficient photocatalytic performance and stability of TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF are attributed to the involvement of the nitroxyl radical, which enhances selective O2 adsorption, establishes a distinct electron density distribution, and facilitates photogenerated charge separation compared to TT&#8208;HT&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF counterparts. This study uncovers a new perspective for constructing metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;mediated radical&#8208;based COFs for sustainable energy conversion, storage, and biomedical applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Spillover Promotes Stable Synthesis of Vinyl Chloride on Ru Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric O/N co&#8208;doped Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst was synthesized by a sequential oxygen etching strategy to overcome the over&#8208;chlorination of Ru atoms during acetylene hydrochlorination. This single&#8208;atom Ru thus induced an unconventional oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen spillover based on the electrostatic potential difference, which resulted in enhanced kinetics to proceed the reaction via Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism with a reduced energy barrier.







Abstract
Ru single&#8208;atom catalysts hold great promise for the robust synthesis of vinyl chloride through acetylene hydrochlorination. However, the easy over&#8208;chlorination of Ru atoms during reaction suppress the catalytic activity and stability. Herein, we have synthesized an oxygen doped Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst by a sequential oxygen etching strategy, which delivers the remarkable yield of vinyl chloride monomer (&gt;99.38&#8201;%) and stability (&gt;900&#8197;h, 180&#8197;h&#8722;1), far beyond those reported Ru counterparts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the asymmetric structure of single&#8208;atom Ru promotes an unconventional oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen spillover after the activation of hydrogen chloride, which enables the reaction to proceed through Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism with a reduced energy barrier of acetylene hydrochlorination compared to the traditional Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathway. As a result, the enhanced reaction kinetics further restrict over&#8208;chlorination of single&#8208;atom Ru, thereby ensuring the excellent durability. This work offers a strategy for designing multifunctional catalysts with enhanced performances for acetylene hydrochlorination.

         <title>3D Cluster&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based COFs, utilizing multicore Cu clusters with specific stereochemical configurations as building blocks, were first synthesized through a stepwise assembly strategy. In comparison to isolated Cu4 clusters, the well&#8208;ordered porous framework structure of Cu4COFs exhibits a narrower band gap, enhanced structural integrity, and more efficient charge transfer characteristics. These features endow Cu4COFs with greatly enhanced performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Copper clusters exhibit superior catalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and their defined structures endow them with unique advantages for modeling the catalytic mechanism at the atomic level. Additionally, the construction of highly stable and regularly structured covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on copper clusters still presents significant challenges. Herein, we reported two highly stable and reactive cluster&#8208;based COFs (termed Cu4COF&#8208;1 and Cu4COF&#8208;2) constructed via a stepwise assembly strategy. The epitaxially amino&#8208;modified Cu4 cluster (Cu4&#8208;NH2) was initially synthesized based on coordination bonds. Then, Cu4COFs were obtained by the covalent linkage of Cu4&#8208;NH2 clusters and organic linkers. Compared with isolated Cu4 clusters, the Cu4COFs exhibit greater stability, a narrower band gap, a larger specific surface area, and better charge transfer ability, which endow them with superior photocatalytic CO2RR performance under visible light. In&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the covalently linked Cu4COFs could efficiently lower the energy barrier for the formation of the critical *COOH intermediate, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity. This study offers a solid basis for the atomically precise construction of novel metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based COF catalysts.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area, Ultra&#8208;thin Organic Films with Both Photochromic and Phosphorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The doped materials used the most common plastic polymers (terephthalate, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride) as hosts exhibited visible photochromic and room temperature phosphorescence phenomena simultaneously. A large&#8208;scale industrial&#8208;grade film that exhibited excellent photostability was successfully fabricated, enabling direct application.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the most commonly used polymers in plastic products. Therefore, endowing these polymers with unique optical properties would significantly enhance their overall technological value. Herein, we synthesized a phosphorescent molecule, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzofuran (DBF), with notable reversible photochromic properties (switching between colorless and deep red) as the guest and constructed a doped system with the above polymers as the hosts. All doped materials exhibited both room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and reversible photochromic properties. The guest molecule exhibited strong reversible cyclization activity and small conformational changes during the reaction process, as well as moderate rigidity of the host matrix, which enabled the uncommon coexistence of these two properties in the doped system. Finally, DBF/PET was successfully formed into a transparent and uniform film with a length of 200&#8197;m, a width of 20&#8197;cm, a thickness of only 60&#8211;70&#8197;&#956;m. This film exhibited excellent thermal&#8208;stability, sensitivity, and resistance to photo&#8208;fatigue, indicating its applicability in industrial production.

         <title>Silver Molybdate Nanoparticles for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy through Pyroptosis Conversion and Ferroptosis Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
AMO is synthesized via a rapid solvothermal method. After entering tumor cells, AMO consumes GSH and degrades H2O2 to generate ROS, while also produces MoO42&#8722; and Ag+. The intracellular GSH consumption and ROS induction lead to ferroptosis. In addition, MoO42&#8722; upregulates intracellular GSDME, and in combination with the stimuli of ROS and Ag+, the cells undergo caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Further, ferroptosis and pyroptosis synergistically enhance the immune response.







Abstract
Pyroptosis holds great potential in tumor therapy due to its strong immunogenicity. Several strategies, including ion interference therapy (IIT), are developed to induce pyroptosis. However, the mechanism by which metal oxoanions induced pyroptosis remained unclear. It was reported that MoO42&#8722; ions could stimulate immune responses, but their pyroptosis&#8208;inducing mechanisms were not fully understood. Herein, we synthesized uniform and dispersed silver molybdate (Ag2MoO4) nanoparticles (AMO) via a solvothermal method. AMO responded to H2O2 and glutathione (GSH) stimuli, releasing Ag+ and MoO42&#8722; ions, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and depleting GSH, thereby inducing ferroptosis and pyroptosis. The MoO42&#8722; also inhibited cell migration and upregulated GSDME expression, converting apoptosis into caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Additionally, DNA damage and ROS activated the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, enhancing innate immunity. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of AMO and the immune checkpoint inhibitor &#945;PD&#8208;1 significantly inhibited tumor growth. This combination promoted dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, increased effector T cell numbers, induced M1 macrophage polarization, and alleviated immunosuppression. This study contributed to a deeper understanding of metal oxoanion&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, supporting its potential application in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Gas Sensor of Mixed&#8208;dimensional Heterostructures Combining Borophene and BC2N Quantum Dots: Enhanced Detection through Binary Cooperative Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our research introduces a significant advancement in gas sensor technology by decorating two&#8208;dimensional borophene with zero&#8208;dimensional BC2N quantum dots. Integrating theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, our study demonstrates substantial enhancements in NO2 gas sensing performance, with sensors detecting concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;ppm and achieving a sensitivity of 1170&#8201;% at 30&#8197;ppm, surpassing current technologies.







Abstract
The emergence of mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures has inspired worldwide interests in recent years, opening up new avenues for potential nanotechnology applications. Herein, we proposed a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterostructure composed of borophene sheets and BC2N quantum dots. The gas sensing performance of the heterostructure was evaluated through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental methods. Specifically, first&#8208;principles calculation results show that NO2 is the most strongly interacting molecule and induces the largest amount of charge transfer between the molecule and the heterostructure, suggesting exceptional sensitivity and selectivity of the heterostructure to NO2 gas. Following the theoretical insights, a borophene&#8208;BC2N heterostructure gas sensor was developed and its gas detection abilities were assessed with exposure to various gases at room temperature. Remarkably, this sensor displayed a sensitivity of 1170&#8201;% to 30&#8197;ppm NO2 and remain a high sensitivity of 108&#8201;% even to 0.2&#8197;ppm NO2. These results highlight borophene&#8208;BC2N heterostructure as a superior NO2 gas sensor, demonstrating enhanced sensing via BC2N quantum dots and integrated theoretical&#8208;experimental approaches.

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic Cycle of Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graph illustrates the complete electrochemical ammonia oxidation catalytic cycle by a ruthenium complex, capturing most intermediates. The pathways bifurcate at [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuII(N2H4)]2+, highlighting competitive steps including dimerization, nucleophilic attack, and disproportionation.







Abstract
This study presents a mechanism of ammonia oxidation catalyzed by [RuII(NH3)][PF6]2 (Ru=Ru(tpy)(dmabpy)) complexes. All intermediates, including the elusive [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuIV(NH)]2+, were detected, with several intermediates characterized spectroscopically. The catalytic cycle follows multiple reaction pathways branching at the key intermediates [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuII(N2H4)]2+. The competition between the pathways is influenced by ammonia concentration and the local proton concentration generated during electrooxidation at the anode. In the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming steps, dimerization of [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and nucleophilic attack of [RuIV(NH)]2+ by ammonia compete, while in the subsequent [RuII(N2H4)]2+ oxidation, direct oxidation competes with proton&#8208;catalyzed disproportionation. These findings provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the catalytic cycle and offer guidance for developing more efficient ruthenium&#8208;based ammonia oxidation catalysts.

A new &#8220;atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst&#8221; system comprising single&#8208;atom MNx and local sp3 carbon defects is proposed, which marries the advantages of typical single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts while addressing their respective weaknesses, thus synergistically achieves high electrocatalytic activity and battery efficiency.







Abstract
Atomic&#8208;level designed electrocatalysts, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts, have attracted extensive interests due to their maximized atom utilization efficiency and increased activity. Herein, a new electrocatalyst system termed as &#8220;atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst&#8221;, that marries the advantages of typical single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts while addressing their respective weaknesses, was proposed. In atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst, single&#8208;atom MNx and local carbon defects formed under a specific thermodynamic condition, act synergistically to achieve high electrocatalytic activity and battery efficiency. This symbiotic&#8208;catalyst shows greater structural precision and preparation accessibility than those of dual&#8208;atom catalysts owing to its reduced complexity in chemical space. Meanwhile, it outperforms the intrinsic activities of conventional single&#8208;atom catalysts due to multi&#8208;active&#8208;sites synergistic effect. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, an atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst comprising single&#8208;atom MnN4 moieties and abundant sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon defects was constructed for low&#8208;temperature zinc&#8208;air battery, which exhibited a high peak power density of 76&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with long&#8208;term stability at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, representing a top&#8208;level performance of such batteries.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Fence Effect in Au Nanoparticle&#8208;Loaded UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Chemoselective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;fence strategy for tailoring the electrostatic interaction between metal&#8211;organic framework structure and nitroarenes substrate molecules for boosting selective hydrogenation, leading to an excellent conversion (100&#8201;%) of 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene to 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene along with high selectivity and ultra&#8208;high catalytic efficiency (3880&#8197;h&#8722;1 turnover frequency), which provides a novel method to construct efficient catalyst for selective hydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
The chemoselective reaction are vital for fine chemicals, which requires economical and environmentally friendly catalysts. In order to improve the selectivity of multi&#8208;reaction competition, herein, we propose a novel ionic&#8208;fence strategy to synthesize heterogeneous catalyst for efficient hydrogenation. Practically, UIO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) modified with pyridinium&#8208;linker has been constructed through post&#8208;synthetic chains with paired anion via quaternization and ion exchange to form ionic&#8208;fence MOF (IFMOF&#8208;Cl), which can manage the adsorption mode of nitro substrate, further confine the formation of metal nanoparticles with high dispersity. The optimal Au@IFMOF&#8208;Cl catalyst demonstrates satisfactory selectivity for hydrogenation of nitro group compared to acetylene group in 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene. Specifically, it owns a high yield of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene (~97&#8201;%) with ultra&#8208;high catalytic efficiency (3880&#8197;h&#8722;1 TOF) and long stability, far superior to other catalysts without ionic fence effect. Adsorption experiments and density functional theory studies reveal that the incorporation of ionic fence could modulate the adsorption energy of nitro group, which is responsible for the high selectivity enhancement. Notably, this ionic&#8208;fence strategy exhibits comprehensive universality towards a wide range of substrates (23 kinds in total), providing a promising avenue for precisely engineering the internal microenvironments of catalysts to achieve highly selective synthesis of fine chemicals.

Harnessing T&#8208;type photoswitching (&#955;1) of dibenzothiadiazepine&#8208;dioxide (DBTDD), a dual&#8208;&#955; intersecting&#8208;controlled photoclick system is established, synchronizing with photolysis of sydnone (&#955;2) to enable cycloaddition. The photoswitching of DBTDD is pivotal in enabling bioorthogonal decoration of phospholipids on live cell membranes, increasing efficacy in line with elevated 445&#8197;nm laser power density with subcellular spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
The advancement of ring&#8208;strain preloaded dipolaro&#8208;/dienophiles plays a crucial role in bioorthogonal chemistry, enabling multiple high&#8208;precision conjugations toward biomolecules simultaneously. However, durability of these ring&#8208;strain preloaded reagents in vivo is a concern, as the ring&#8208;strain is not reloadable once released during delivery process. In situ conversion of light&#8208;energy into ring&#8208;strain is a promising approach to ensure both biostability and spatiotemporal control endowed by light. Herein, we advance a seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzene photoswitch, dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine&#8208;11,11&#8208;dioxide (DBTDD), bridged by a sulphone moiety. The photoisomerization from Z&#8208;DBTDD to ring&#8208;strain&#8208;loaded E&#8208;DBTDD enables an accelerated cycloaddition with various photogenerated dipoles to establish novel photoclick reactions, featuring a dual&#8208;&#955; (405&#8197;nm+445&#8197;nm) synergistic control. In reactions with monoarylsydnones, a higher photo&#8208;stationary ratio of E&#8208;DBTDD, achieved by varying the power density of 445&#8197;nm laser, presented an ultrafast cycloaddition rate (kE=6.6&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) with a 13.8&#8208;fold acceleration compared with Z&#8208;DBTDD, which is superior to established ring&#8208;strain reporters (e.g., BCN&#8208;OH, sTCO&#8208;OH, DBTD). Then, bioorthogonal photoclick labeling of DBTDD tagged artificial phospholipid on living cell membranes was realized at subcellular resolution via an essential dual&#8208;&#955; intersecting lithography with an elevated efficiency by adjusting the 445&#8197;nm power density.

         <title>Unveiling the Intrinsic Superior SHG Performance of Ce4+ Fluoride Masked by Subtle Ce3+ Impurity and Its Effective Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high performance pure Ce4+&#8208;fluoride, Na2(Ce4+)F6, and demonstrate that the presence of subtle Ce3+ impurity significantly reduces the properties. Being aware of this fact and carefully controlling the synthetic conditions are the key to ensuring the successful synthesis of superior Ce4+&#8208;compounds.







Abstract
Owing to its unique electronic configuration [Xe]4f0, Ce4+&#8208;compound is a highly desired in the field of advanced nonlinear optical materials, yet its synthesis remains a great challange. Herein, we report a series of cerium fluorides, including a pure Ce4+&#8208;fluoride, high&#8208;performance Na2(Ce4+)F6; three mixed valance state samples, (Mix1&#8211;3, with increasing Ce3+ concentration); and a fully reduced pure Ce3+&#8208;fluoride Na1.5(Ce3+)1.5F6. In particular, Na2(Ce4+)F6, shows an SHG response (4&#215;KDP), and a wide band gap (4.77&#8197;eV), which are the strongest and widest among all Ce&#8208;containing materials to date. With systematic studies, we demonstrate that the subtle Ce3+ impurity significantly reduces performance. By being aware of this fact and consciously controlling experimental conditions, we can ensure the synthesis of pure Na2(Ce4+)F6, which exhibits excellent overall performance and shows great potential for future applications. This work not only reinforced the crucial role of Ce4+ in significantly enhancing the key performance, but also provided invaluable experimental evidence and theoretical support for the future design of more efficient and superior functional materials.

         <title>Mixing Functionality in Polymer Electrolytes: A New Horizon for Achieving High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a supramolecularly extended/cross&#8208;linked polymer electrolyte (PCPE) by introducing an elaborate MBO plasticizer in polymer matrix for ASSLMBs. This innovative PCPE system possesses unique topological cross&#8208;linking structure and Lewis&#8208;acid interaction driven MBO&#8208;salt assembly superstructure, effectively overcomes the discrepancy between accelerating Li+ migration kinetics and enhancing mechanical robustness, thus achieving excellent electrochemical performances of practical ASSLMBs.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are a key materials component for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). In these membrane&#8208;like films, accelerating Li+ migration while enhancing the mechanical strength of SPEs is challenging. Herein, we introduce a new concept of supramolecularly organized, cross&#8208;linked polymer electrolyte (PCPE) by mixing an ion&#8208;conducting, multi&#8208;arm boron&#8208;containing oligomer (MBO) solid plasticizer into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;lithium salt matrix. Studies reveal that the Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction between the Lewis&#8208;acidic boron sites of MBO and lithium&#8208;salt anions induces an amorphous MBO&#8208;salt assembly subphase with percolating nanochannels for rapid Li+ transport. Meanwhile, due to the structural compatibility of the multiple linear arms of MBO with PEO, a supramolecular polymer network is obtained which partly crystallizes around the ionic nanodomains, offering an PCPE with improved mechanical strength hosting interconnected ion transport pathways. The resulting PCPE shows simultaneously enhanced ionic conductivity, improved mechanical properties, and film interface stability, which enable a dendrite&#8208;free Li/Li symmetric cell which could be cycled over 2600&#8197;h. Excellent electrochemical performance is also demonstrated in a close&#8208;to&#8208;practical high capacity ASSLMBs.

         <title>Towards Ultra&#8208;Stable Wide&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries by Using Ion&#8208;Sieving Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conducting COF&#8208;based separator (COF&#8208;Zn) was developed to enhance the performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) under challenging conditions. By integrating the COF&#8208;Zn separator with limited electrolyte, this approach achieves exceptional cycling stability across both organic and inorganic cathode&#8208;based batteries, presenting a versatile strategy for constructing ultra&#8208;stable AZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) offer notable advantages in safety and cost&#8208;efficiency, but Zn dendrite growth and unstable interfacial reactions hinder their commercial viability. A crucial factor in addressing these challenges lies in optimizing the separator to regulate ion transport and stabilize electrode interfaces. Herein, we propose a covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based separator with quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conduction, specifically a Zn2+&#8208;substituted sulfonate COF (COF&#8208;Zn) membrane, designed to tackle these issues. Featuring a high Zn transference number (0.87) and a thin 25&#8197;&#956;m profile, the COF&#8208;Zn separator allows for reduced electrolyte usage (20&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1) while effectively minimizing cathode dissolution. Its quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conductivity and electronegative properties improve Zn anode's stability by lowering water activity. This separator enables ultra&#8208;stable AZIBs, as demonstrated in various full cells including Zn//4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrenetetrone (PTO), Zn//I2 and Zn//V2O5. Remarkably, the Zn//PTO cell achieves an energy density of 260&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, 100&#8201;% capacity retention under reduced electrolyte conditions, and stable all&#8208;weather cycling from &#8722;40 to +100&#8201;&#176;C with a customized electrolyte.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) offer notable advantages in safety and cost-efficiency, but Zn dendrite growth and unstable interfacial reactions hinder their commercial viability. A crucial factor in addressing these challenges lies in optimizing the separator to regulate ion transport and stabilize electrode interfaces. Herein, we propose a covalent organic framework (COF)-based separator with quasi-single-ion conduction, specifically a Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-substituted sulfonate COF (COF-Zn) membrane, designed to tackle these issues. Featuring a high Zn transference number (0.87) and a thin 25&#8197;&#956;m profile, the COF-Zn separator allows for reduced electrolyte usage (20&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) while effectively minimizing cathode dissolution. Its quasi-single-ion conductivity and electronegative properties improve Zn anode's stability by lowering water activity. This separator enables ultra-stable AZIBs, as demonstrated in various full cells including Zn//4,5,9,10-pyrenetetrone (PTO), Zn//I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn//V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Remarkably, the Zn//PTO cell achieves an energy density of 260&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 100&#8201;% capacity retention under reduced electrolyte conditions, and stable all-weather cycling from &#8722;40 to +100&#8201;&#176;C with a customized electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Straightforward Formation of Borirenes from Boroles and Dialkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of unsymmetrical perarylated aromatic borirenes through a straightforward reaction between 1,3&#8208;diynes and boroles is reported. The study encompasses substrate scope exploration, X&#8208;ray studies and computational analysis. This work represents an illustration of the use of simplified reactions for the construction of three&#8208;membered systems containing boron.







Abstract
We report a selective one&#8208;step synthesis of perarylated borirenes by reaction of antiaromatic boroles with 1,4&#8208;diarylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynes. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, reveal key intermediates, including boranorbornadiene and 7&#8208;borabicyclo[4.1.0]heptadiene species, which are all in equilibrium with each other, ultimately leading to borirene formation by migration of the boranediyl bridge from the cyclohexadiene ring to the remaining exocyclic alkyne residue.

         <title>Elucidating the Role of Electric Fields in Fe Oxidation via an Environmental Atom Probe</title>

Field&#8208;Assisted Fe Oxidation imaged by Environmental Atom Probe. The oxidation of iron (Fe) at the tip of a sharp needle under high electrostatic fields has been visualized using an Environmental Atom Probe (EAP) and corroborated through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and a mean&#8208;field model applied to a multi&#8208;faceted catalytic grain, alongside statistical&#8208;mechanical analyses. EAP observations underscore the impact of surface structures, revealing that Fe oxidation predominantly occurs on exposed facets such as Fe{244} and Fe{112}, while facets with higher coordination numbers like Fe{024}, Fe{013}, and Fe{011} exhibit comparatively lower levels of oxidation. Intense electrostatic fields exert a significant influence on Fe oxidation by polarizing and attracting gas molecules toward the surface, thereby effectively raising the local pressure via enhanced electric field concentrations at the tip&#8216;s apex.







Abstract
We quantify the effects of intensely applied electric fields on the Fe oxidation mechanism. The specimen are pristine Fe single crystals exposing a variety of surface structures identified by field ion microscopy. These crystals are simultaneously exposed to low pressures of pure oxygen gas, on the order of 10&#8722;7&#8197;mbar, while applying intense electric fields on their surface of several tens of volts per nanometer. The local composition of the different surface structures is probed directly and in real time using an Environmental Atom Probe and successfully compared with first principles&#8208;based models. We found that rough Fe{244} and Fe{112} facets are more reactive toward oxygen than compact Fe{024} and Fe{011} facets. Results demonstrate that the influence of an electric field on the oxidation kinetics depends on the timescales that are involved as the system evolves toward equilibrium. The initial oxidation kinetics show that strong increases in electric fields facilitate the formation of an oxide. However, as one approaches equilibrium, high field values mitigate this formation. Ultimately, this study elucidates how high externally applied electric fields can be used to dynamically exploit reaction dynamics at the nanoscale towards desired products in a catalytic reaction at mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Engineering Oxygen Intermediates Adsorption on Amorphous NiFe Alloys for Highly Active and Selective Electrochemical Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple doping strategy is developed to engineer reactive intermediates adsorption on amorphous NiFe alloy catalysts. Mn&#8208;doping into amorphous NiFe alloy can significantly reduce the onset potential to generate active Ni3+ species, which spontaneously react with HMF via nucleophile dehydrogenation to form FDCA.







Abstract
Electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (HMFOR) offers a promising route to transform biomass into value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) greatly limits the HMFOR selectivity. Herein, we report a facile doping strategy to engineer oxygen intermediates adsorption on amorphous NiFe alloys to boost highly selective electrochemical HMF oxidation to produce 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), among which, amorphous Mn&#8208;doped NiFeB alloy displays a low HMFOR onset potential of 1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE, achieving 100&#8201;% HMF conversion with 88&#8201;% FDCA selectivity at an applied potential of 1.4&#8197;V vs. RHE, outperforming amorphous NiFeB (73&#8201;% FDCA selectivity) and Mo&#8208;doped NiFeB (65&#8201;% FDCA selectivity) alloys. Experimental characterizations suggest that the introduction of Mn/Mo into amorphous NiFeB alloy can increase/decrease its electronic density and thus strengthen/weaken oxygen intermediates adsorption. Operando experiments indicate that the amorphous Mn&#8208;doped NiFeB alloy can significantly reduce the onset potential to form active Ni3+ species, which spontaneously react with HMF via nucleophile dehydrogenation to form FDCA. Furthermore, in situ infrared spectroscopy measurements verify that the HMF oxidation pathway follows the 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) route rather than the 2,5&#8208;diformyfuran (DFF) route.

         <title>Super&#8208;Concentrated Alkali Hydroxide Electrolytes for Rechargeable Zn Batteries</title>

Saturating water with potassium hydroxide revives the grand old alkaline batteries in a rechargeable mode. A triggered proton hopping process break the stability&#8208;conductivity tradeoff for super&#8208;concentrated electrolytes.







Abstract
Increasing the salt concentration of an electrolyte to over 10&#8197;M brings new solute&#8208;solvent interactions that define an emerging class of super&#8208;concentrated electrolytes for rechargeable batteries. To this class we introduce a super&#8208;concentrated alkaline electrolyte. Nearly saturated with KOH (at 15&#8197;M), the aqueous solution displays a broad electrochemical stability window (&gt;2.5&#8197;V on Au) while retaining an exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&gt;0.27&#8197;S/cm at 25&#8201;&#176;C). Without a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, we can confirm the role of electron transfer kinetics in determining the stability as opposed to the thermodyanmic effect computed based on activity coefficients. The compositionally simple solution also allows spectroscopies and ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulation to identify a novel mechanism of OH&#8722; structural diffusion, where unlike the conventional Grotthuss mechanism through hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, electrostatic forces sustain proton hopping and break the common stability&#8208;conductivity tradeoff. A high ZnO solubility in the electrolyte further mitigate the issue of passivation when a Zn anode is deeply discharged. These unique properties enable a NiOOH||Zn battery to deliver a cumulative capacity &gt;10&#8197;Ah/cm2 at 40&#8197;mA/cm2 to meet practical needs of safe, inexpensive energy storage.

Abstract
The development of advanced catalysts frequently employs trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods and is lack of highly controlled synthesis, resulting in unsatisfactory development efficiency and performance. Here we propose a data&#8208;driven prediction coupled with precise synthesis strategy to accelerate the development of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for efficient water purification. The data&#8208;driven approach enables the rapid screening and prediction of high&#8208;performance SACs from 43 metals&#8208;N4 structures comprising transition and main group metal elements, followed by validation and structural modulation for improved performance through a highly controllable hard&#8208;template method. Impressively, a well&#8208;designed Fe&#8208;SAC with a high loading of Fe&#8208;pyridine&#8208;N4 sites (~3.83&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and highly mesoporous structure, exhibits ultra&#8208;high decontamination performance (rate constant of 100.97&#8197;min&#8722;1 g&#8722;2), representing the best Fenton&#8208;like activities for sulfonamide antibiotics to date. Furthermore, the optimized Fe&#8208;SAC shows excellent robust environmental resistance and cyclic stability with almost 100&#8201;% degradation efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics for 100&#8208;h continuous operation. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Fe&#8208;pyridine&#8208;N4 sites can reduce the energy barrier of intermediate O* formation, the rate&#8208;determining step, resulting in highly selective generation of singlet oxygen. The integration of data&#8208;driven method with precise synthesis strategy provides a novel paradigm for the rapid development of high&#8208;performance catalysts for environmental field as well as other important fields including sustainable energy and catalysis.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Marine Diterpenoids Caucanolide E and F by Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation: Rigorous Reassignment of Two Almost Indistinguishable Diastereomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of gem&#8208;hydrogenation, which exploits the electrophilic character of the ruthenium carbene intermediates transiently formed, to natural product total synthesis allowed the stereostructure of a pair of diastereomeric seco&#8208;cembranoids that are almost indistinguishable by NMR to be rigorously assigned. Computational analysis of the data by the CP probabilistic method provided independent confirmation.







Abstract
As the spectra of the diastereomeric marine seco&#8208;cembranoids caucanolide E and F are almost identical, the isolation team had not been able to firmly assign their stereostructure. The puzzle has now been solved by a synthetic approach predicated on biogenetic considerations, which suggested that both natural products are 10S configured but differ in the configuration of their C8 stereocenter. Under this proviso, they can be distinguished by comparison with synthetic samples that are deliberately 8S,10S and 8S,10R configured: only one natural product can match sign and magnitude of the [&#945;]D of one of these reference compounds; this particular caucanolide must be the 8S,10S isomer. Both reference compounds needed for this benchmarking exercise were accessible from a single precursor via ruthenium catalyzed gem&#8208;hydrogenation of an enyne to furnish an alkoxyfuran in the first place, followed by hydrolysis; this key transformation leverages the electrophilic character of the pianostool ruthenium carbene intermediates passed through. The recorded data showed that the assignment proposed in the literature is incorrect and needs to be reversed; this conclusion was independently confirmed by a combined NMR/DFT approach using a CP3 probability analysis.

         <title>GOAT: A Global Optimization Algorithm for Molecules and Atomic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present GOAT, a new global optimization algorithm that hops over the potential energy surface until it finds the global minimum and conformational ensembles. The algorithm does not rely on molecular dynamics, which makes it useful to run even with hybrid DFT and deal with systems withs complicated electronic structures.







Abstract
In this work, we propose a new Global Optimization Algorithm (GOAT) for molecules and clusters of atoms and show how it can find the global energy minima for both systems without resorting to molecular dynamics (MD). This avoids the potential millions of time&#8208;consuming gradient calculations required by a long MD run. Because of that, it can be used with any regular quantum chemical method, even with the costlier hybrid DFT. We showcase its accuracy by running it on various systems, from organic molecules to water clusters, metal complexes, and metal nanoparticles, comparing it with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods such as the Conformer&#8208;Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST). We also discuss its underlying theory and mechanisms for succeeding in challenging cases. GOAT is, in general, more efficient and accurate than previous algorithms in finding global minima and succeeds in cases where others cannot due to the free choice for the Potential Energy Surface (PES).

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Heli(aminoborane)s with Highly Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three &#960;&#8208;extended heli(aminoborane)s (E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C) were synthesized to find a balance between fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;lum) and absorption/luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs/glum). These molecules exhibited remarkable photophysical properties, including high &#934;lum and narrowband emission (full width at half maximum, FWHM=16&#8197;nm), in which E[10]HAB&#8208;A boosted circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) up to 583&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Helical molecular carbons (HMCs) possess high absorption/luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs/glum) and significant luminescence quantum yield (&#934;lum), resulting in a high circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness (BCPL), which is essential for the development of CPL materials for practical applications. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN)&#8208;doped HMCs, named &#960;&#8208;extended heli(aminoborane)s (E[10]HAB&#8208;A, E[10]HAB&#8208;B and E[10]HAB&#8208;C), consisting of laterally &#960;&#8208;extended [10]helicene skeleton with alternating N and B atoms at the inner rim. The aromaticity, electronic structures, and photophysical properties of E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C were systematically investigated through experiments and theoretical calculations. E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C displayed remarkable photophysical properties, including high molar extinction coefficient and bright narrowband emission. The isolated enantiomers of E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C exhibited intense circular dichroism (CD) and CPL, in which E[10]HAB&#8208;A shows gabs and glum values up to 0.024 and 0.017, simultaneously with high &#934;lum of 82&#8201;% and a narrow full width at half maximum of 16&#8197;nm. Accordingly, E[10]HAB&#8208;A exhibits a BCPL as high as 583&#8197;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, which is the largest value among the reported BN&#8208;doped HMCs. Our study indicates that inner rim BN&#8208;doping and &#960;&#8208;extension are effective strategies to achieve high &#934;lum and balanced glum values in HMCs.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Enhanced Selectivity in Aerobic Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol over TiO2 Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO2) facilitates the activation of molecular oxygen (O2) through a two electron reduction process instead of a single&#8208;electron reduction. This effectively suppresses the generation of superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;), thereby reducing the unwanted &#8901;O2&#8722;&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening reaction of aromatics to significantly enhance selectivity.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol using molecular oxygen (O2) is a promising alternative to the traditional cumene process. However, the selectivity toward phenol is often poor due to the ring&#8208;opening reaction induced by the superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;), which is predominantly produced from the single&#8208;electron reduction of O2. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO2) facilitates the activation of O2 through a two&#8208;electron reduction process instead of a single&#8208;electron reduction. This effectively suppresses the generation of &#8901;O2&#8722;, thereby reducing phenol decomposition and significantly enhancing the selectivity. In addition, these OVs can trap the electrons to promote chare separation and serve as the adsorption sites for O2 activation. As a result, the introduction of abundant OVs on the surface of TiO2 not only enhances phenol yield but also importantly improves selectivity toward phenol. This finding enriches our understanding of how OVs influence reaction pathways and product selectivity, providing valuable insights for the design and tailoring of OV&#8208;rich photocatalysts for selective organic oxygenations.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Elucidating the Role of Electric Fields in Fe Oxidation via an Environmental Atom Probe (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 18/2025)</title>

Environmental atom probe tomography and multi&#8208;scale modeling reveal electric field effects in iron oxidation, as demonstrated by Sten V. Lambeets, Jean&#8208;Sabin McEwen et al. in their Research Article (e202423434). The inhomogeneous field on an iron tip (grey/black spheres) creates an uneven oxygen distribution. The field gradient, shown as an intensity grid, is strongest near the tip. Surface composition is probed upon exposure to oxygen (red spheres) by collecting emitted iron oxide cations, which are then compared to field&#8208;based oxidation calculations.

A data&#8208;driven prediction coupled with precise synthesis strategy is proposed to accelerate the development of advanced catalysts. This strategy enables rapid screening of catalytic sites, followed by precise structural modulation for optimistic activity. A well&#8208;designed Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits ultra&#8208;high decontamination and excellent stability for water purification, as reported by Guo&#8208;Ping Sheng, Zhen&#8208;Yu Wu, Hao Li, Zheng&#8208;Hao Li et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202500004).

Molecular crystals that belong to non&#8208;centrosymmetric space groups demonstrate piezoelectricity by interconverting electrical and mechanical energy. The cover image shows molecular crystal unit cells interlocking into a crystalline electrified assembly. As Pierre&#8208;Andr&#233; Cazade, Sarah Guerin et al. demonstrate in their Research Article (e202501232), the unit cell can be studied using computational chemistry to predict the piezoelectric response of a crystal and screen for sustainable materials in sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting.

In this unconventional process, N2 activation is realized through &#960; back&#8208;donation on the Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites can regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid by&#8208;product formation, thus boosting NH3 synthesis.

A strategy for the racemic sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S) effect that achieved precise control over both the intensity and sign of global chirality was presented by Wei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202500444). Distinct chiral communication pathways between enantiomeric sergeants and achiral soldiers in this racemic liquid crystalline S&amp;S system were found to further in situ drive multiple transitions of chiroptical properties in racemic copolymer assemblies.

         <title>Water in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in &#8220;water science&#8221; within the field of electrocatalysis, which covers the fundamental understanding of the dynamic structure and nature of water under electrochemical conditions, the specific roles of water in typical electrocatalytic reactions, and effective strategies for manipulating water to optimize the performance of electrocatalytic systems.







Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered electrocatalysis technologies occupy a central position in clean energy conversion and the pursuit of a net&#8208;zero carbon emission future. Water can serve multiple roles in electrocatalytic reactions, for instance, as a reaction medium, reactant, modifier, promoter, etc. This significantly influences the mass transport, active site, intermediate adsorption and reaction kinetics, ultimately determining the electrocatalytic performance (e.g., activity, selectivity, and stability) as well as device efficiency. As the heart location where electrocatalytic reactions occur, the typical electrical&#8208;double layer is established at a water&#8208;electrode interface. Therefore, the comprehension and regulation of water are crucial topics in electrocatalysis, which encourages us to organize this review. We begin with the fundamental understanding on structure of water and its behavior under electrochemical conditions. Subsequently, we delve into the &#8220;water effect&#8221; by elucidating specific functions of water in electrocatalysis. Recent advances in manipulating water to enhance electrocatalytic efficiency of representative reactions such as hydrogen evolution/oxidation, oxygen evolution/reduction, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction and organic electrosynthesis, are also highlighted. We finally discuss the remaining challenges and future opportunities in this field.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Circular Photogalvanic Effects in Two&#8208;dimensional Perovskite Ferroelectric&#8208;based Transistor toward Multi&#8208;state Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implement multi&#8208;state memory behavior through gate&#8208;tunable circular photogalvanic effects in the transistor device based on a two&#8208;dimensional perovskite ferroelectric, which highlights the potential of perovskite ferroelectrics for further exploration toward multi&#8208;state memory in the field of integrated devices.







Abstract
Spintronics has long been an exciting branch of condensed matter science, among which the spin splitting of energy bands in an inversion asymmetric material endows the circular photogalvanic effects (CPGE) toward high&#8208;performance spin&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Here, we have successfully achieved gate&#8208;tunable CPGE in a biaxial perovskite ferroelectric (n&#8208;HA)2CsPb2Br7 (1, n&#8208;HA is n&#8208;heptanamine), involving the broken symmetry from its spontaneous polarization. Strikingly, under left&#8208; and right&#8208;circularly polarized light, this CPGE acquires a large anisotropy factor for photocurrents up to ~1.04, far beyond most organic semiconductors and chiral counterparts (&lt;0.2). It is the large splitting coefficient along the ky direction (~1.476&#8197;eV &#197;) that contributes to the significant realization of CPGE in 1. Notably, this spin&#8208;based CPGE of 1 has been modulated via the gate&#8208;voltage manipulation in its transistor&#8208;type devices, leading to multi&#8208;state memory behaviors. That is, six distinct conductance states are obtained under circularly polarized light, containing the original, high/low&#8208;state responses L(&#8208;1,0,1) to the left circularly polarized light, as well as three right components R(&#8208;1,0,1). This study establishes a pathway for further exploration toward multi&#8208;state memory in the field of ferroelectric integrated devices.

         <title>Cascade Lanthanide&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer for Nanocrystal&#8208;Sensitized Organic Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide nanocrystal&#8208;sensitized organic upconversion is reported, which produced various upconversion luminescence with wavelength ranging from 600&#8197;nm to 475&#8197;nm under 808&#8197;nm excitation. The crucial energy transfer step from lanthanides to organic triplet states has been extensively investigated, demonstrating the promise of nanocrystal&#8208;sensitization for upconversion applications.







Abstract
Sensitized organic photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) shows significant potential for energy conversion and photocatalysis, but achieving efficient upconversion across multiple wavelengths with single&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitation remains a daunting challenge. Here, we report a strategy utilizing lanthanide&#8208;doped nanocrystals (LnNCs) to sensitize TTA upconversion in multiple organic emitters under NIR excitation, achieving an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of up to 1.1&#8197;eV. This approach leverages a cascade lanthanide&#8208;triplet energy transfer design, adopting an interfacial energy transfer pathway via lanthanide ions to surface energy relay molecules for extended triplet sensitization. It allows consecutive transfer of photon energy from LnNCs to TTA emitters, mitigating energy mismatch between the triplet levels of emitters and excitation photon energies. The use of LnNCs enhances energy transfer efficiency through the unique spin&#8208;orbital coupling and narrow&#8208;band absorption properties of lanthanide ions. Our approach offers tunable upconversion emission, minimized energy loss during sensitization, and improved chemical stability of LnNCs. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of this system in NIR&#8208;induced photopolymerization, showcasing its potential for applications such as 3D printing and photocatalysis.

     alt="Cascade Lanthanide-Triplet Energy Transfer for Nanocrystal-Sensitized Organic Photon Upconversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lanthanide nanocrystal-sensitized organic upconversion is reported, which produced various upconversion luminescence with wavelength ranging from 600&#8197;nm to 475&#8197;nm under 808&#8197;nm excitation. The crucial energy transfer step from lanthanides to organic triplet states has been extensively investigated, demonstrating the promise of nanocrystal-sensitization for upconversion applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensitized organic photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) shows significant potential for energy conversion and photocatalysis, but achieving efficient upconversion across multiple wavelengths with single-wavelength near-infrared (NIR) excitation remains a daunting challenge. Here, we report a strategy utilizing lanthanide-doped nanocrystals (LnNCs) to sensitize TTA upconversion in multiple organic emitters under NIR excitation, achieving an anti-Stokes shift of up to 1.1&#8197;eV. This approach leverages a cascade lanthanide-triplet energy transfer design, adopting an interfacial energy transfer pathway via lanthanide ions to surface energy relay molecules for extended triplet sensitization. It allows consecutive transfer of photon energy from LnNCs to TTA emitters, mitigating energy mismatch between the triplet levels of emitters and excitation photon energies. The use of LnNCs enhances energy transfer efficiency through the unique spin-orbital coupling and narrow-band absorption properties of lanthanide ions.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Heteroaryl Ketones by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Carbonylation of Alkenes and N&#8208;Alkenyl Heteroarenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;heteroaryl ketones by nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarbonylation of N&#8208;alkenyl arenes and alkenes is reported. The success of this reaction relies on the sorting of two different alkenes along with the control of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aminoketones serve as important substructures in life science and precursors for the synthesis of diverse value&#8208;added targets in organic and biochemistry. However, direct access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aminoketones from simple and readily available starting materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report an unprecedented nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling protocol for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;heteroaryl ketones from alkenes and enamines in the presence of a carbon monoxide surrogate. The success of this reaction relies on the sorting of two different alkenes along with the control of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This reductive&#8208;oxidative carbonylation of enamines and unactivated alkenes featuring the use of a carbon monoxide surrogate allows for the gas&#8208;free streamlined assembly of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;heteroaryl ketones from two distinct alkenes.

         <dc:description>
A general strategy to prepare water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridyl organoboron reagents has been developed. The merger of the reagents with a neutral Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling condition enables a robust and efficient 2&#8208;pyridylation reaction of aryl halides.







Abstract
The stability of 2&#8208;pyridylation reagents is a long&#8208;standing issue in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry due to hydrolysis. However, as the use of pyridine&#8208;based pharmaceuticals continues to increase, there is a high demand for stable and reactive 2&#8208;pyridylation reagents. Herein, a general strategy to prepare water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridylboron reagents has been developed. The application of the water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridylboron reagents in a neutral Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling with a halide scavenger enables an efficient 2&#8208;pyridylation reaction of aryl halides.

         <title>Chiral Communication between Enantiomeric Sergeants and Achiral Soldiers in Racemic Triblock Copolymers with Heterochiral Cores for Triggering Multiple Helicity Inversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different chiral communication pathways were found between the chiral sergeant and achiral soldier units in racemic S&amp;S system, which further in situ driven the multiple transitions of globally chiroptical properties of the racemic copolymer assemblies.







Abstract
Amplification of asymmetry in complex supramolecular/polymer system results from the delicate interplay of chiral and achiral structures. Here, a novel approach to the racemic sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S) effect, using enantiomeric sergeants (Sgt.) and achiral soldiers (Sold.), achieves unique precise control over both intensity and sign of global chirality. Chiroptical assemblies of different dimensions in racemic S&amp;S copolymers can be constructed in situ via polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA). We systemically investigated chiral communication pathways between chiral&#8208;chiral, chiral&#8208;achiral, and two oppositely configured azobenzene (Azo) segments, which robustly affect the global chiroptical activity of the racemic S&amp;S assemblies. Chain length&#8208;, Sgt./Sold. ratios&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;dependent CD/UV/Vis, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) results provided insights into the kinetics for chiroptical inversions. LC phase transitions, the helical preferences of the Sgt. and Sold. units, and the stability of the &#8220;chiral core&#8221; allow racemic S&amp;S copolymer assemblies to exhibit chiral conflict between heterochiral blocks in an enantioselective fashion.

Dobby polypeptides with unique jellyfish&#8208;type stereochemical structures are synthesized via &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;initiated, 1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetramethylguanidine&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydride. Their biocompatible building blocks, efficient synthesis, well&#8208;defined structures and excellent self&#8208;assembling capacities render the jellyfish&#8208;type polypeptides as promising candidates for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Strict criteria of biomedical materials in synthesis efficiency, structure determinacy, and biological safety pose formidable challenges for the synthesis of dobby polypeptides. Herein we reported a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;initiated, 1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetramethylguanidine (TMG)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;step N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) strategy to synthesize a series of dobby polypeptides that fulfill the criteria of biomedical materials. By leveraging TMG's catalytic mechanisms in nucleophilicity enhancement for CD hydroxyl groups and active center creation for NCA monomers, this strategy achieves efficient NCA polymerization within 2&#8197;hours and high monomer conversion up to 93.5&#8201;%. Meticulous characterizations illustrate that CD&#8208;centric polypeptides present jellyfish&#8208;type stereochemical structures, in which the arm number, length, orientation and initiation sites are precisely determined. Simultaneously, CD&#8208;centric polypeptides possess excellent self&#8208;assembling capacities to guide nanostructure fabrication, exhibiting broad&#8208;spectrum small&#8208;molecule drug encapsulation. Additionally, natural CD applied in multipoint initiation of core&#8208;first NCA ROP fundamentally improves the biodegradability and biosafety of dobby polypeptides, thus facilitating their biomedical applications.

         <title>Ring Expansion via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryne Insertion into C&#8722;C Bonds of Benzocyclobutenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first insertion of arynes into non&#8208;enolizable ketones is demonstrated in this ortho&#8208;phenylene ring expansion of benzocyclobutenones using 2&#8208;haloaryl boronates as the coupling partner. In this transformation, Pd plays a dual role in both aryne formation and C&#8722;C activation.







Abstract
Insertion of arynes into cyclic C&#8722;C bonds provides a straightforward approach for ring expansion with an ortho&#8208;phenylene moiety; however, the current scope of substrates has been restricted to enolizable ketones. Here we report the first example of aryne&#8208;insertion into non&#8208;enolizable ketones through Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond activation of benzocyclobutenones. 2&#8208;Haloaryl boronates were employed as an unconventional aryne precursor. The reaction shows a wide substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. The mechanistic studies reveal an interesting dual role of the Pd catalyst for both aryne generation and C&#8722;C bond activation.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Computational Screening of Small Molecular Crystals for Sustainable Piezoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a high&#8208;throughput computational screening of organic molecular crystals for piezoelectric applications. Using DFT calculations, the study identifies key organic materials with significant piezoelectric responses and introduces CrystalDFT, a comprehensive database for scalable analysis, providing a data&#8208;driven foundation for future material discovery in organic piezoelectrics. These sustainable materials can be used for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting applications.








Abstract
Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next&#8208;generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor&#8208;made solid&#8208;state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles and techniques such as cocrystallization, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterized by methods such as X&#8208;ray diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here, we present our database of small molecular crystals and their density functional theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring (unpoled) longitudinal piezoelectric response (d11/d22/d33). This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.

         <title>Enabling Unconventional &#8220;Alternating&#8208;Distal&#8221; N2 Reduction Pathway for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; hybrid pathway is achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH2NH2&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH + NH3&#8221; step with an amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N2 activation is realized through &#960; back donation on Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites can regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the by&#8208;product formation for boosting NH3 synthesis.








Abstract
The general understanding on the reaction path is that the electrocatalytic&#160;N2 reduction follows either individual associative alternating or distal pathways, where efficient N2 activation and selective NH3 production are very challenging. Herein, an unconventional &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; pathway was achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH2NH2&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH&#160;+&#160;NH3&#8221; step to boost NH3 synthesis with an amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N2 activation was realized through &#960; back donation on the Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites could regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the nitrogen&#8208;containing by&#8208;product formation. Such &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; pathway was affirmed by in situ spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations. In a neutral media, an average ammonia production rate of 82.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and an outstanding Faradaic efficiency of 37.3% were attained. This work validated an unconventional mechanism in electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis, which might be extended to other catalytic process with multiple possible reaction paths.
