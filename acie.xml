         <title>Total Synthesis of Pallamolides A&#8208;E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have achieved the first total synthesis of pallamolides A&#8208;E, of which pallamolides B&#8208;E possess intriguing tetracyclic skeletons with novel intramolecular transesterifications. Key transformations include highly diastereoselective sequential Michael additions to construct the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core with simultaneous generation of two quaternary carbon centers, a one&#8208;pot SmI2&#8208;mediated intramolecular ketyl&#8208;enoate cyclization/ketone reduction to generate the key oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety, and an acid&#8208;mediated deprotection/oxa&#8208;Michael addition/&#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination cascade sequence to assemble pallamolides tetracyclic skeletons. Kinetic resolution of ketone 14 via Corey&#8208;Bakshi&#8208;Shibata reduction enabled the asymmetric synthesis of pallamolides A&#8208;E.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefin hydrogenation is one of the most important transformations in organic synthesis. Electrochemical transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an attractive approach to replace the dangerous hydrogen gas with electrons and protons. However, this reaction poses major challenges due to rapid hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal&#8208;hydride species that outcompetes alkene hydrogenation step, and facile deposition of the metal catalyst at the electrode that stalls reaction. Here we report an economical and efficient strategy to achieve high selectivity for hydrogenation reactivity over the well&#8208;established HER. Using an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable nickel salt as the catalyst, this mild reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. In addition, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides could be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection. The practicability of our method has been demonstrated by the success of large&#8208;scale synthesis using catalytic amount of electrolyte and a minimal amount of solvent. Cyclic voltammetry and kinetic studies were performed, which support a NiII/0 catalytic cycle and the pre&#8208;coordination of the substrate to the nickel center.</dc:description>

         <title>Acoustic Levitation Synthesis of Ultrahigh&#8208;density Spherical Nucleic Acid Architectures for Specific SERS Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllably regulating the electrostatic bilayer of nanogold colloids is a significant premise for synthesizing spherical nucleic acid (SNA) and building ordered plasmonic architectures. We develop a facile acoustic levitation reactor to universally synthesize SNAs with an ultra&#8208;high density of DNA strands. Results reveal a new mechanism of DNA grafting via acoustic wave that can reconfigure the ligands on colloidal surfaces. The acoustic levitation reactor enables substrate&#8208;free three&#8208;dimentional (3D) spatial assembly of SNAs with controllable interparticle nanogaps through regulating DNA lengths.  This kind of architecture may overcome the plasmonic enhancement limits by blocking electron tunneling and breaking electrostatic shielding in dried aggregations. Finite element simulations support the architecture with 3D spatial plasmonic hotspot matrix, and its ultrahigh surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) capability is evidenced by in&#8208;situ untargeted tracking of biomolecular events during photothermal stimulation (PTS)&#8208;induced cell death process. For biomarker diagnosis, the conjugation of ATP aptamer onto SNAs enables in&#8208;situ targeted tracking of ATP during PTS&#8208;induced cell death process. Particularly, the CD71 receptor and integrin &#945;3&#946;1 protein on PL45 cell could be well distinguished by label&#8208;free SERS fingerprints when using specific XQ&#8208;2d and DML&#8208;7 aptamers, respectively. Our current acoustic levitation reactor promises great potentials in biochemical synthesis and sensing in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Diluted Active Sites of Ultrasmall High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Efficient Formic Acid Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poisoning of undesired intermediates or impurities greatly hinders the catalytic performances of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, high&#8208;entropy intermetallics i&#8208;(PtPdIrRu)2FeCu (HEI) are constructed to inhibit the strongly adsorbed carbon monoxide intermediates (CO*) during the formic acid oxidation reaction. As probed by multiple&#8208;scaled structural characterizations, HEI nanoparticles are featured with partially negative Pt oxidation states, diluted Pt/Pd/Ir/Ru atomic sites and ultrasmall average size less than 2 nm. Benefiting from the optimized structures, HEI nanoparticles deliver more than 10 times promotion in intrinsic activity than that of pure Pt, and well&#8208;enhanced mass activity/durability than that of ternary i&#8208;Pt2FeCu intermetallics counterpart. In situ infrared spectroscopy manifests that both bridge and top CO* are favored on pure Pt but limited on HEI. Further theoretical elaboration indicates that HEI displayed a much weaker binding of CO* on Pt sites and sluggish diffusion of CO* among different sites, in contrast to pure Pt that CO* bound more strongly and was easy to diffuse on larger Pt atomic ensembles. This work verifies that HEIs are promising catalysts via integrating the merits of intermetallics and high&#8208;entropy alloys.</dc:description>

         <title>Postsynthetically Modified Alkoxide&#8208;Exchanged Ni2(OR)2BTDD: Synergistic Interactions of CO2 with Open Metal Sites and Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Postsynthetic modifications (PSMs) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) play a crucial role in enhancing material performance through open metal site (OMS) functionalization or ligand exchange. However, a significant challenge persists in preserving open metal sites during ligand exchange, as these sites are inherently bound by incoming ligands. In this study, for the first time, we introduced alkoxides by exchanging bridging chloride in Ni2Cl2BTDD (BTDD = bis (1H&#8208;1,2,3,&#8208;triazolo [4,5&#8208;b],&#8208;[4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;i]) dibenzo[1,4]dioxin) through PSM. Rietveld refinement of synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data indicated that the alkoxide oxygen atom bridges Ni(II) centers while the OMSs of the MOF are preserved. Due to the synergy of the existing OMS and introduced functional group, the alkoxide&#8208;exchanged MOFs showed CO2 uptakes superior to the pristine MOF. Furthermore, the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations for Ni_T suggested that CO2 interacts with the OMS and the surrounding methyl groups of tert&#8208;butoxide groups, which is responsible for the enhanced CO2 capacity. This work provides a facile and unique synthetic strategy for realizing a desirable OMS&#8208;incorporating MOF platform through bridging ligand exchange.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Ni&#8208;W Dimer Sites Induced Stable Compressive Strain for Boosting the Performance of&#160;Pt as Electrocatalyst&#160;for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying Pt catalysts with transition metal elements is an effective pathway to enhance the performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but often accompanied with severe metal dissolution issue, resulting in poor stability of alloy catalysts. Here, instead of forming traditional alloy structure, we modify Pt surface with a novel Ni&#8208;W dimer structure by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The obtained NiW@PtC catalyst exhibits superior ORR performance both in liquid half&#8208;cell and practical fuel cell compared with initial Pt/C. It is discovered that strong synergistic Ni&#8208;W dimer structure arising from short atomic distance induced a stable compressive strain on the Pt surface, thus boosting Pt catalytic performance. This surface modification by synergistic dimer sites offers an effective strategy in tailoring Pt with excellent activity and stability, which provides a significant perspective in boosting the performance of commercial Pt catalyst modified with polymetallic atom sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Engineering of MOF&#8208;Derived Bimetallic Oxide Solid Solution Anchored with Au Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas and C2 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering that CO2 reduction is mostly a multielectron reaction, it is necessary for the photocatalysts to integrate multiple catalytic sites and cooperate synergistically to achieve efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to various products, such as C2 hydrocarbons. Herein, through crystal engineering, we designed and constructed a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived Zr/Ti bimetallic oxide solid solution support, which was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. After anchoring Au nanoparticles, the composite photocatalyst exhibited excellent performances toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction to syngas (H2 and CO production rates of 271.6 and 260.6 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and even C2 hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6 production rates of 6.80 and 4.05 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1). According to the control experiments and theoretical calculations, the strong interaction between bimetallic oxide solid solution support and Au nanoparticles was found to be beneficial for binding intermediates and reducing CO2 reduction, highlighting the synergy effect of the catalytic system with multiple active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Linkage Chemistry and Its Critical Role in The Evolution of &#960; Electronic Structures and Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a molecular platform for designing a novel class of functional materials with well&#8208;defined structures. A crucial structural parameter is the linkage, which dictates how knot and linker units are connected to form two&#8208;dimensional polymers and layer frameworks, shaping ordered &#960;&#8208;array and porous architectures. However, the roles of linkage in the development of ordered &#960; electronic structures and functions remain fundamental yet unresolved issues. Here we report the designed synthesis of COFs featuring four representative linkages: hydrazone, imine, azine, and C=C bonds, to elucidate their impacts on the evolution of &#960; electronic structures and functions. Our observations revealed that the hydrazone linkage provides a non&#8208;conjugated connection, while imine and azine allow partial &#960; conjugation, and the C=C bond permits full &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Importantly, the linkage profoundly influences the control of &#960; electronic structures and functions, unraveling its pivotal role in determining key electronic properties such as bandgap, frontier energy levels, light absorption, luminescence, carrier density and mobility, and magnetic permeability. These findings highlight the significance of linkage chemistry in COFs and offer a general and transformative guidance for designing framework materials to achieve electronic functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Strategy Tailoring Molecular Structures of Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials (HTMs) are ideal materials for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but most current design strategies for tailoring the molecular structures of HTMs are limited to single strategy. Herein, four HTMs based on dithienothiophenepyrrole (DTTP) core are devised through dual&#8208;strategy methods combining conjugate engineering and side chain engineering. DTTP&#8208;ThSO with ester alkyl chain that can form six&#8208;membered ring by the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O noncovalent conformation lock with thiophene in the backbone shows good planarity, high&#8208;quality film, matching energy level and high hole mobility, as well as strong defect passivation ability. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% with a nice long&#8208;term stability is achieved by dopant&#8208;free DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based PSCs, representing one of the highest values for un&#8208;doped organic HTMs based PSCs. Especially, the fill factor (FF) of 82.3% is the highest value for dopant&#8208;free small molecular HTMs&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs to date. Moreover, DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based devices have achieved an excellent PCE of 20.9% in large&#8208;area (1.01 cm2) devices. This work clearly elucidates the structure&#8208;performance relationships of HTMs and offers a practical dual&#8208;strategy approach to designing dopant&#8208;free HTMs for high&#8208;performance PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridged Bicyclic Lactam Enables Chemically Recyclable Nylon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nylon, a widely&#8208;used high&#8208;performance thermoplastic, boasts exceptional durability and resistance to various solvents and weak acids, making it indispensable across diverse applications. However, its nonbiodegradable nature has led to alarming environmental pollution in land and oceans. Chemical recycling to monomers (CRM) stands as a crucial strategy for establishing a circular plastic economy, but the CRM of nylon remains largely unexplored. Herein, we introduce the bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), evolved from &#948;&#8208;valerolactam and pyrrolidone, to solve the the trade&#8208;off in depolymerizability and performance. Notably, 5/6&#8208;LM exhibits nearly 95% conversion in mild polymerization conditions and efficient depolymerization catalyzed by lewis acids. This compound is synthetically accessible from commercially available chemicals in a single step at room temperature, demonstrating high efficiency and scalability up to 50g in laboratory. Furthermore, the resulting polyamide displays remarkable attributes including high crystallinity and thermostability up to 283&#176;C, significantly broadening the scope of chemically recyclable nylons.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis for Electrochemical Chlorination and Nitration of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique biphasic electrochemical reaction, wherein tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts play a dual role as both electrolyte and phase transfer catalysts, was developed to furnish chlorination and nitration of aromatic compounds using cheap inorganic salts with up to 98&#8201;% yield, shorter reaction time and higher Faradaic efficiency.







Abstract
A biphasic anodic oxidation method for aromatic halogenation process was developed, where aqueous metal salts were directly used as halogen source. Ammonium salts serve as both electrolytes and phase transfer catalysis to facilitate anion transport and oxidative transformation. This design allows for chlorination or nitration of multiple types of arenes using NaCl or KNO2.

         <title>Breaking Global Diatropic Current to Tame Diradicaloid Character: Thiele's Hydrocarbon Under Macrocyclic Constraints</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two p&#8208;phenylene units with dissimilar resonance character (benzene and quinone) are embedded in a macrocyclic system. Their mutual orientation, in terms of the dihedral angle between the carbocyclic units, can stabilize the diradicaloid character of the system. Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analysis confirmed a presence of open&#8208;shell singlet state with a low &#916;EST of &#8722;0.34&#8197;kcal/mol.







Abstract
A diradical/biradical character of organic derivatives is one of the key aspects of contemporary research focusing on the fundamental studies followed by potential applicability relying on the unique optical, electronic, or magnetic properties assigned to unpaired electrons. A precise involvement of two p&#8208;phenylenes into a cyclophane&#8208;like conjugated, diatropic system creates a flexible molecule with the two different characters of both subunits (benzene and quinone) imprinting into the structure a Kekul&#233; delocalized system. A dynamic of both carbocyclic subunits, and their mutual interaction generates a singlet open&#8208;shell state (J=&#8722;1.25&#8197;kcal/mol) as documented spectroscopically (NMR and EPR). The extended theoretical analysis has proved a correlation between dihedral angle and the diradicaloid character that shifts from a closed&#8208;shell singlet to an open&#8208;shell state, eventually showing the y0=0.86 for 78&#8197;degrees and &#916;EST=&#8722;0.34&#8197;kcal/mol.

         <title>Dienes as Versatile Substrates for Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dienes are valued for their abundance, ease of preparation, and unique properties, as they play a crucial role in synthesizing complex, bioactive molecules. This review focuses on the past decade's advances and challenges in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving diene substrates, emphasizing their versatility and the emergence of novel reactivity patterns.







Abstract
Dienes have been of great interest to synthetic chemists as valuable substrates due to their abundance and ease of synthesis. Their unique stereoelectronic properties enable broad reactivity with a wide range of transition metals to construct molecular complexity facilitating synthesis of biologically active compounds. In addition, structural diene variation can result in substrate&#8208;controlled reactions, providing valuable mechanistic insights into reactivity and selectivity patterns. The last decade has seen a wealth of new methodologies involving diene substrates through the power of transition metal catalysis. This review summarizes recent advances and remaining opportunities for transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving dienes.

         <title>Binding FSI&#8722; to Construct a Self&#8208;Healing SEI Film for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries by In situ Crosslinking Vinyl Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing SEI film containing bound FSI&#8722; anions as repairing agent is constructed via the cross&#8208;linking of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) to improve the performances of lithium anode. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&#8722; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self&#8208;healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO2 cells with the loading of 16.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and are stably operated for 500&#8197;cycles with the retention rates of 81.4&#8201;% and the average coulombic efficiency of 99.97&#8201;%, operated between 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li.







Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) membrane on the Li metal anode tends to breakdown and undergo reconstruction during operation, causing Li metal batteries to experience accelerated decay. Notably, an SEI membrane with self&#8208;healing characteristics can help considerably in stabilizing the Li&#8208;electrolyte interface; however, uniformly fixing the repairing agent onto the anode remains a challenging task. By leveraging the noteworthy film&#8208;forming attributes of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;) anions and the photopolymerization property of the vinyl group, the ionic liquid 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) was crosslinked with polyethylene oxide (PEO) in this study to form a self&#8208;healing film fixing FSI&#8722; groups as the repairing agent. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&#8722; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self&#8208;healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO2 cells with the loading of 16.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and are stably operated for 500&#8197;cycles with the retention rates of 81.4&#8201;% and the average coulombic efficiency of 99.97&#8201;%, operated between 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li. This study presents a new design approach for self&#8208;healing Li metal anodes and durable lithium metal battery.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Principinol B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total synthesis of principinol B was achieved by convergent and modular synthetic strategies. Two enantioenriched fragments were assembled by a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction/carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis sequence. The oxabicyclo[3.2.1] core structure was introduced by the Williamson ether synthesis.







Abstract
We have accomplished the first and asymmetric total synthesis of principinol B, a grayanoid possessing an oxabicyclo[3.2.1] architecture. A functionalized 5/7/6/5 tetracyclic intermediate was assembled in a convergent manner by a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction and subsequent carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis of two enantiomerically enriched fragments. The oxabicyclo[3.2.1] architecture containing a 6,10&#8208;ether bridge was constructed by the Williamson ether synthesis.

         <title>MoS2 Hollow Multishelled Nanospheres Doped Fe Single Atoms Capable of Fast Phase Transformation for Fast&#8208;charging Na&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time, which promotes the electron transfer and Na+ diffusion kinetic, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. Besides, the strong adsorption with Na+ and self&#8208;catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S, combining buffering effect of HoMS to improve the cyclic stability.







Abstract
Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self&#8208;catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple&#8208;shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is superior to previously&#8208;reported results. Even at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 259.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (83.68&#8201;%) was reserved after 500 cycles. Such elaborate catalytic site decorated HoMS is also promising to realize other &#8220;fast&#8208;charging&#8221; high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

The reaction merges olefin carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag (HLF) reaction by radical addition/crucial distal N and H transfer sequences to yield &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;sulphonamide&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;amino acid esters under tandem C&#8722;C and dual C&#8722;N bonds forging.







Abstract
As a type of elementary organic compounds containing N&#8722;N single bond, hydrazone involved chemical conversions are extremely extensive, but they are mainly limited to N2&#8208;retention and N2&#8208;removal modes. We report herein an unprecedented protocol for the realization of division utilization of the N2&#8208;moiety of hydrazone by a radical facilitated N&#8722;N bond deconstruction strategy. This new conversion mode enables the successful combination of alkene carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reaction by the reaction of N&#8208;homoallyl mesitylenesulfonyl hydrazones with ethyl difluoroiodoacetate under photocatalytic redox neutral conditions. Mechanism studies reveal that the reaction undergoes a radical relay involving addition, crucial remote imino&#8208;N migration and H&#8208;atom transfer. Consequently, a series of structurally significant &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;sulphonamide&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;amino acid esters are efficiently produced via continuous C&#8722;C bond and dual C&#8722;N bonds forging.

         <title>Predicting Lewis Acidity: Machine Learning the Fluoride Ion Affinity of p&#8208;Block&#8208;Atom&#8208;Based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluoride ion affinity (FIA) is among the most prominent descriptors for Lewis acidity. This paper presents FIA&#8208;GNN, a machine learning model that predicts FIA values in gas and solution (CH2Cl2) phase within a fraction of a second on a standard personal laptop. This is several orders of magnitude faster compared to the conventional quantum chemical approach. FIA&#8208;GNN is applied in four different case studies including catalysis research.







Abstract
&#8220;How strong is this Lewis acid?&#8221; is a question researchers often approach by calculating its fluoride ion affinity (FIA) with quantum chemistry. Here, we present FIA49k, an extensive FIA dataset with 48,986 data points calculated at the RI&#8208;DSD&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/def2&#8208;QZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c level of theory, including 13 different p&#8208;block atoms as the fluoride accepting site. The FIA49k dataset was used to train FIA&#8208;GNN, two message&#8208;passing graph neural networks, which predict gas and solution phase FIA values of molecules excluded from training with a mean absolute error of 14&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (r2=0.93) from the SMILES string of the Lewis acid as the only input. The level of accuracy is notable, given the wide energetic range of 750&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 spanned by FIA49k. The model's value was demonstrated with four case studies, including predictions for molecules extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database and by reproducing results from catalysis research available in the literature. Weaknesses of the model are evaluated and interpreted chemically. FIA&#8208;GNN and the FIA49k dataset can be reached via a free web app (grebgroup.de/fia&#8208;gnn).

         <title>Catalytic and Base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls via a Cyclic Iodonium Ylide Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and catalytic &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls have been developed, providing expedient access toward a wide range of high&#8208;value 2&#8208;aryl (hetero)cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls. The key to success is through a cyclic iodonium ylide strategy. Our approach is base&#8208;free and exhibits broad substrate scope (&gt;100&#8197;examples). Importantly, our approach allows late&#8208;stage modification and significantly simplifying previous synthesis.







Abstract
To date, it remains challenging to achieve a general and catalytic &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, particularly ubiquitous heteroaromatic ones. In most cases, the preparation of their medically significant arylated derivatives requires multistep synthetic sequences. Herein, we introduce a new, convenient strategy involving the conversion of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls to cyclic iodonium ylides (CIYs), followed by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation with arylboronic reagents via carbene coupling. This approach is mild, operationally simple, base&#8208;free, biocompatible, and exhibits broad substrate scope (&gt;100&#8197;examples), especially with respect to various heteroaromatic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls and ortho&#8208;substituted or base&#8208;sensitive arylboronic acids. Importantly, owing to the excellent compatibility with various arylboronic acids or boronate esters (ArBpin, ArBneop, or ArBF3K), this method allows the late&#8208;stage installation of heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motifs in highly complex settings. The utility of this transformation is further demonstrated through significantly simplifying the synthesis of several bioactive molecules and natural products.

         <title>Precisely Patterned Channels in a Vertical Organic Electrochemical Transistor with a Diazirine Photo&#8208;Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted interest in the field of neuromorphic devices and implantable electronics due to their excellent characteristics. Here, we use small molecule photo&#8208;crosslinkers double&#8208;end trifluoromethyl diazirine (DtFDA) to precisely pattern the channel layer and modulate ion transport in OECTs to fabricate high&#8208;performance vertical electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) rely on both efficient ionic doping/de&#8208;doping process and carrier transport in the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic channel under the modulation of gate bias. Moreover, channels that hold photopatterning capability are highly desired to minimize parasitic capacitance and simplify the fabrication process/cost. However, yielding photo&#8208;patternable channels with both precise/robust patterning capability and controllable ionic&#8208;electronic coupling is still challenging. Herein, double&#8208;end trifluoromethyl diazirines (DtFDA) with different chain lengths are introduced in the OECT channel to act as both photo&#8208;crosslinker and medium to regulate ionic&#8208;electronic transport. Specifically, high&#8208;resolution patterns with a minimum line width/gap of 2&#8197;&#956;m are realized in p(g2T&#8208;T) or Homo&#8208;gDPP based channels by introducing DtFDA. Maximum transconductances of 68.6&#8197;mS and 81.6&#8197;mS, current on/off ratio of 106 and 107 (under a drain voltage of only &#177;0.1&#8197;V), are achieved in p&#8208; and n&#8208;type vertical OECTs (vOECTs), respectively, along with current densities exceeding 1&#8197;kA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability of more than 100,000 cycles (2000&#8197;seconds). This work provides a new and facile strategy for the fabrication of vOECT channels with high resolution and high performance via the introduction of a simple and efficient crosslinker.

         <title>The Rhodium Analogue of Coenzyme B12 as an Anti&#8208;Photoregulatory Ligand Inhibiting Bacterial CarH Photoreceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to the memory of Albert EschenmoserCarH photoreceptors bound to photolabile cobalt corrin coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl) are DNA&#8208;binding tetramers that repress genes for carotenoid synthesis in the dark. Light triggers AdoCbl photolysis and CarH tetramer disassembly to activate gene expression. AdoRhbl, a synthetic photostable isostructural rhodium surrogate of AdoCbl, emulates AdoCbl in CarH binding, tetramerization and DNA binding yet blocks photoregulation by CarH in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl; 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;adenosylcobalamin), the quintessential biological organometallic radical catalyst, has a formerly unanticipated, yet extensive, role in photoregulation in bacteria. The light&#8208;responsive cobalt&#8208;corrin AdoCbl performs this nonenzymatic role by facilitating the assembly of CarH photoreceptors into DNA&#8208;binding tetramers in the dark, suppressing gene expression. Conversely, exposure to light triggers the decomposition of this AdoCbl&#8208;bound complex by a still elusive photochemical mechanism, activating gene expression. Here, we have examined AdoRhbl, the non&#8208;natural rhodium analogue of AdoCbl, as a photostable isostructural surrogate for AdoCbl. We show that AdoRhbl closely emulates AdoCbl in its uptake by bacterial cells and structural functionality as a regulatory ligand for CarH tetramerization, DNA binding, and repressor activity. Remarkably, we find AdoRhbl is photostable even when bound &#8220;base&#8208;off/His&#8208;on&#8221; to CarH in vitro and in vivo. Thus, AdoRhbl, an antivitamin B12, also represents an unprecedented anti&#8208;photoregulatory ligand, opening a pathway to precisely target biomimetic inhibition of AdoCbl&#8208;based photoregulation, with new possibilities for selective antibacterial applications. Computational biomolecular analysis of AdoRhbl binding to CarH yields detailed structural insights into this complex, which suggest that the adenosyl group of photoexcited AdoCbl bound to CarH may specifically undergo a concerted non&#8208;radical syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;elimination mechanism, an aspect not previously considered for this photoreceptor.

&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to the memory of Albert EschenmoserCarH photoreceptors bound to photolabile cobalt corrin coenzyme B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (AdoCbl) are DNA-binding tetramers that repress genes for carotenoid synthesis in the dark. Light triggers AdoCbl photolysis and CarH tetramer disassembly to activate gene expression. AdoRhbl, a synthetic photostable isostructural rhodium surrogate of AdoCbl, emulates AdoCbl in CarH binding, tetramerization and DNA binding yet blocks photoregulation by CarH in vitro and in vivo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coenzyme B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (AdoCbl; 5&#8242;-deoxy-5&#8242;-adenosylcobalamin), the quintessential biological organometallic radical catalyst, has a formerly unanticipated, yet extensive, role in photoregulation in bacteria. The light-responsive cobalt-corrin AdoCbl performs this nonenzymatic role by facilitating the assembly of CarH photoreceptors into DNA-binding tetramers in the dark, suppressing gene expression. Conversely, exposure to light triggers the decomposition of this AdoCbl-bound complex by a still elusive photochemical mechanism, activating gene expression. Here, we have examined AdoRhbl, the non-natural rhodium analogue of AdoCbl, as a photostable isostructural surrogate for AdoCbl. We show that AdoRhbl closely emulates AdoCbl in its uptake by bacterial cells and structural functionality as a regulatory ligand for CarH tetramerization, DNA binding, and repressor activity. Remarkably, we find AdoRhbl is photostable even when bound &#8220;base-off/His-on&#8221; to CarH in vitro and in vivo. Thus, AdoRhbl, an antivitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, also represents an unprecedented anti-photoregulatory ligand, opening a pathway to precisely target biomimetic inhibition of AdoCbl-based photoregulation, with new possibilities for selective antibacterial applications. Computational biomolecular analysis of AdoRhbl binding to CarH yields detailed structural insights into this complex, which suggest that the adenosyl group of photoexcited AdoCbl bound to CarH may specifically undergo a concerted non-radical &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-elimination mechanism, an aspect not previously considered for this photoreceptor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolved Readers of 5&#8208;Carboxylcytosine CpG Dyads Reveal a High Versatility of the Methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;Binding Domain for Recognition of Noncanonical Epigenetic Marks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytosine 5&#8208;modifications&#8211;occurring in different combinations in the two DNA strands of CpG dyads&#8211;are central to human chromatin regulation, but the customized recognition of such combinatorial marks is challenging. By re&#8208;evolving MBDs, the readers of canonical 5&#8208;methylated CpGs, we identify strong and selective readers of noncanonical 5&#8208;carboxylcytosine&#8208;containing CpGs that have fully abandoned the conserved recognition of methylated CpGs.







Abstract
Mammalian genomes are regulated by epigenetic cytosine (C) modifications in palindromic CpG dyads. Including canonical cytosine 5&#8208;methylation (mC), a total of four different 5&#8208;modifications can theoretically co&#8208;exist in the two strands of a CpG, giving rise to a complex array of combinatorial marks with unique regulatory potentials. While tailored readers for individual marks could serve as versatile tools to study their functions, it has been unclear whether a natural protein scaffold would allow selective recognition of marks that vastly differ from canonical, symmetrically methylated CpGs. We conduct directed evolution experiments to generate readers of 5&#8208;carboxylcytosine (caC) dyads based on the methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;binding domain (MBD), the widely conserved natural reader of mC. Despite the stark steric and chemical differences to mC, we discover highly selective, low nanomolar binders of symmetric and asymmetric caC&#8208;dyads. Together with mutational and modelling studies, our findings reveal a striking evolutionary flexibility of the MBD scaffold, allowing it to completely abandon its conserved mC recognition mode in favour of noncanonical dyad recognition, highlighting its potential for epigenetic reader design.

         <title>Sustainable Polymers with High Performance and Infinite Scalability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time report the polyaddition of COS, diamines, and diacrylates, which is highly efficient, atom&#8208;economical, quantitatively yield, catalyst&#8208;free, and affords 46&#8197;polymers covering high&#8208;Tm crystalline plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, and amorphous plastics. The in&#8208;chain ester and thiourethane groups contribute to the enzyme&#8208;degradability and enhanced thermal/mechanical properties of the obtained polymers.







Abstract
Our society has been pursuing high&#8208;performance biodegradable polymers made from facile methods and readily available monomers. Here, we demonstrate a library of enzyme&#8208;degradable polymers with desirable properties from the first reported step polyaddition of diamines, COS, and diacrylates. The polymers contain in&#8208;chain ester and thiourethane groups, which can serve as lipase&#8208;degradation and hydrogen&#8208;bonding physical crosslinking points, respectively, resulting in possible biodegradability as well as upgraded mechanical and thermal properties. Also, the properties of the polymers are scalable due to the versatile method and the wide variety of monomers. We obtain 46&#8197;polymers with tunable performance covering high&#8208;Tm crystalline plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, and amorphous plastics by regulating polymer structure. Additionally, the polymerization method is highly efficient, atom&#8208;economical, quantitatively yield, metal&#8208; and even catalyst&#8208;free. Overall, the polymers are promising green materials given their degradability, simple and modular synthesis, remarkable and tunable properties, and readily available monomers.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Single&#8208;Copper&#8208;Site Catalysts for Room&#8208;Temperature Benzene Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (Cu SACs, designated as Cu/NPC) with the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Cu sites on the nitrogen (N)&#8208;phosphorus (P)&#8208;carbon (C) support were synthesized using an in situ phosphorous&#8208;immitting method. The P&#8208;rich coordinated Cu sites of the Cu/NPC were responsible for the direct C&#8722;H activation of benzene to phenol conversion.







Abstract
Crafting single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) that possess &#8220;just right&#8221; modulated electronic and geometric structures, granting accessible active sites for direct room&#8208;temperature benzene oxidation is a coveted objective. However, achieving this goal remains a formidable challenge. Here, we introduce an innovative in situ phosphorus&#8208;immitting strategy using a new phosphorus source (phosphorus nitride, P3N5) to construct the phosphorus&#8208;rich copper (Cu) SACs, designated as Cu/NPC. These catalysts feature locally protruding metal sites on a nitrogen (N)&#8208;phosphorus (P)&#8208;carbon (C) support (NPC). Rigorous analyses, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), validate the coordinated bonding of nitrogen and phosphorus with atomically dispersed Cu sites on NPC. Crucially, systematic first&#8208;principles calculations, coupled with the climbing image nudged&#8208;elastic&#8208;band (CI&#8208;NEB) method, provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of the distorted Cu&#8722;N2P2 centers in Cu/NPC for selective oxidation of benzene to phenol production. Interestingly, Cu/NPC has shown more energetically favorable C&#8722;H bond activation compared to the benchmark Cu/NC SACs in the direct oxidation of benzene, resulting in outstanding benzene conversion (50.3&#8201;%) and phenol selectivity (99.3&#8201;%) at room temperature. Furthermore, Cu/NPC achieves a remarkable turnover frequency of 263&#8197;h&#8722;1 and mass&#8208;specific activity of 35.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benzene&#8208;to&#8208;phenol conversion catalysts to date.

         <title>Deprotective Functionalization: A Direct Conversion of Nms&#8208;Amides to Carboxamides Using Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a concept termed &#8220;deprotective functionalization&#8221;, which we have applied to the coupling of Nms&#8208;protected amines with carboxylic acids. Notably, this approach circumvents the need for a dedicated amine&#8208;deprotection step and obviates the use of additional reagents for carboxylate activation. The reaction was shown to be, in many cases, superior to deprotection followed by functionalization, both in terms of yield and atom economy.







Abstract
The nature of protecting group chemistry necessitates a deprotection step to restore the initially blocked functionality prior to further transformation. As this aspect of protecting group manipulation inevitably adds to the step count of any synthetic sequence, the development of methods enabling simultaneous deprotection and functionalization (&#8220;deprotective functionalization&#8221;&#8212;distinct from &#8220;deprotection followed by functionalization&#8221;) is appealing, as it has the potential to improve efficiency and streamline synthetic routes. Herein, we report a deprotective functionalization of the newly introduced Nms&#8208;amides guided by density functional theory (DFT) analysis, which exploits the inherent Nms reactivity. Mechanistic studies further substantiate and help rationalize the exquisite reactivity of Nms&#8208;amides, as other commonly used protecting groups are shown not to exhibit the same reactivity patterns. The practicality of this approach was ultimately demonstrated in selected case studies.

         <title>Stable&#160;Anion Exchange Membrane Bearing Quinuclidinium for High&#8208;performance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are core components in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs). However, the stability of functional quaternary ammonium cations, especially under high temperatures and harsh alkaline conditions, seriously affects their performance and durability. Herein, we synthesized a 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenylquinuclidinium molecular building unit.&#160;Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and accelerated aging analysis indicated that the quinine ring structure was exceedingly stable, and the SN2 degradation mechanism dominated. Through acid&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts polymerization, a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) AEMs with controllable molecular weight and adjustable ion exchange conductivity (IEC) were prepared. The stable quinine structure in PAQ&#8208;x&#160;was verified and retained in the ex&#8208;situ alkaline stability. Furthermore, the branched polymer structure reduces the swelling rate and water uptake to achieve a tradeoff between dimensional stability and ionic conductivity, significantly improving the membrane's overall performance. Importantly, PAQ&#8208;5 was used in non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based AEM&#8208;WE, achieving a high current density of 8 A cm&#8208;2 at 2 V and excellent stability over 2446 h in a gradient constant current test. Based on the excellent alkaline stability of this diaryl&#8208;quinuclidinium group, it can be further considered as a multifunctional building unit to create multi&#8208;topological polymers for energy conversion devices used in alkaline environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Bypassing Ammonia: From N2 to Nitrogen Heterocycles without N1 Intermediates or Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diboradiazido compounds, derived in one step from the boron&#8208;mediated reduction of dinitrogen (N2), were treated separately with sulfur and acetic anhydride, providing heterocyclic compounds that are BN isosteres of thiophene and 1,3&#8208;oxazole, respectively. These simple reactions represent the final steps in two&#8208;step routes to complex heterocycles from N2 that both circumvent the need for transition metal reagents and completely bypass the traditional intermediate ammonia.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating and stabilizing a reversible four electron redox reactions of I&#8208;/I+ for aqueous Zn&#8208;iodine battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low capacity and poor cycle stability greatly inhibit the development of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. Herein, a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;Iodine battery has been reached by designing and optimizing both electrode and electrolyte. The Br&#8208; is introduced as the activator to trigger I+, and coupled with I+ forming interhalogen to stabilize I+ to achieve a four&#8208;electron reaction, which greatly promotes the capacity. And the Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;I LDH nanoflowers served as the confinement host to enable the reactions of I&#8208;/I+ occurring in the layer due to the spacious and stable interlayer spacing of Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;I LDH, which effectively suppresses the iodine&#8208;species shuttle ensuring high cycling stability. As a result, the electrochemical performance is greatly enhanced, especially in specific capacity (as high as 350 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 far higher than two&#8208;electron transfer Zn&#8208;Iodine batteries) and cycling performance (94.6% capacity retention after 10000 cycles). This strategy provides a new way to realize high capacity and long&#8208;term stability of Zn&#8208;Iodine batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxide Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions&#160;for Abundant Production of Mugineic Acids and Nicotianamine Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A succinct synthetic approach to mugineic acids and 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was established.&#160;Unlike all other synthetic methods, this approach utilized epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions to form two C&#8208;N bonds and is characterized by the absence of redox reactions.&#160;Mugineic acid was synthesized from three readily available fragments on a gram scale in 6 steps. The protected 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was also synthesized in 4 steps, and the dansyl group, serving as a fluorophore, was introduced through a click reaction after propargylation of the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy group. The dansyl&#8208;labeled nicotianamine (NA) iron complexes were&#160;internalized by oocytes overexpressing ZmYS1 (from maize) or PAT1 (from human) transporters, indicating successful transport of the synthesized NA&#8208;probe through these&#160;transporters.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Chlorotonils: Dehalogenil as Promising Lead Compound for In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural product chlorotonil displays high potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Yet, its scaffold is characterized by low solubility and oral bioavailability but progress was recently made to enhance these properties. Applying late&#8208;stage functionalization, we aimed to further optimize the molecule. Previously unknown reactions including a sulfur&#8208;mediated dehalogenation were revealed. Dehalogenil, the product of this reaction, was identified as the most promising compound so far, as this new derivative displayed improved solubility and in vivo efficacy while retaining excellent antimicrobial activity. We confirmed superb activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. and mature transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We also demonstrated favorable in vivo toxicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in infection models with S.&#160;aureus. Taken together, these results identify dehalogenil as an advanced lead molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Modification of Polysulfide Surfaces with Low&#8208;Power Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The modification of polymer surfaces using laser light is important for many applications in the nano&#8208;, bio&#8208; and chemical sciences. Such capabilities have supported advances in biomedical devices, electronics, information storage, microfluidics, and other applications. In most cases, these modifications require high power lasers that are expensive and require specialized equipment and facilities to minimize risk of hazardous radiation. Additionally, polymer systems that can be easily modified by lasers are often complex and costly to prepare. In this report, these challenges are addressed with the discovery of low&#8208;cost sulfur copolymers that can be rapidly modified with lasers emitting low&#8208;power infrared and visible light. The featured copolymers are made from elemental sulfur and either cyclopentadiene or dicyclopentadiene. Using a suite of lasers with discreet wavelengths (532, 638 and 786 nm) and powers, a variety of surface modifications could be made on the polymers such as controlled swelling or etching via ablation. The facile synthesis and laser modification of these polymer systems were exploited in applications such as direct laser lithography and erasable information storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Metabolic Glycosylation Reporters Enable Detection of Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in Living Cells without S&#8208;Glyco Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification of cytosolic and nuclear proteins involved in numerous fundamental regulation processes. Investigation of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation by metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) has been carried out for two decades with peracetylated N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine derivatives modified with varying reporter groups. Recently, it has been shown that these derivatives can result in non&#8208;specific protein labeling termed S&#8208;glyco modification. Here, we report norbornene&#8208;modified GlcNAc derivatives with a protected phosphate at the anomeric position and their application in MGE. These derivatives overcome two limitations of previously used O&#8208;GlcNAc reporters. They do not lead to detectable S&#8208;glyco modification, and they efficiently react in the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which can be carried out even within living cells. Using a derivative with an S&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;thioethyl&#8208;protected phosphate, we demonstrate the protein&#8208;specific detection of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation of several proteins and the protein&#8208;specific imaging of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation inside living cells by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) visualized by confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein O-GlcNAcylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification of cytosolic and nuclear proteins involved in numerous fundamental regulation processes. Investigation of O-GlcNAcylation by metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) has been carried out for two decades with peracetylated N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylgalactosamine derivatives modified with varying reporter groups. Recently, it has been shown that these derivatives can result in non-specific protein labeling termed S-glyco modification. Here, we report norbornene-modified GlcNAc derivatives with a protected phosphate at the anomeric position and their application in MGE. These derivatives overcome two limitations of previously used O-GlcNAc reporters. They do not lead to detectable S-glyco modification, and they efficiently react in the inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which can be carried out even within living cells. Using a derivative with an S-acetyl-2-thioethyl-protected phosphate, we demonstrate the protein-specific detection of O-GlcNAcylation of several proteins and the protein-specific imaging of O-GlcNAcylation inside living cells by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) visualized by confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Delivery of Charged Species using Ion&#8208;selective Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled release systems have gained considerable attention owing to their potential to deliver molecules, including ions and drugs, in a customized manner. We present a light&#8208;induced ion&#8208;transfer platform consisting of a dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs, ~300 nm) with the conductive polymer poly(3&#8208;octylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (POT) in the core and a potassium (K+)&#8208;selective membrane in the shell. Owing to the photoactive nature of POT, each NP can be used for a dual purpose: as a host for positively charged species and as an actuator to trigger the subsequent release. POT0&#160;and doped POT+&#160;coexist in the core, allowing K+&#160;encapsulation in the shell. As POT0&#160;is photo&#8208;oxidized to POT+, K+&#160;is released to the (aqueous) dispersion phase to preserve the neutrality. This process is reversible and can be assessed using the native fluorescence of POT0&#160;and via potentiometric measurements. The NP structure and its mechanism of action were thoroughly studied with a series of control experiments and complementary techniques. Understanding the NP and its surrounding interactions will pave the way for other nanostructured systems, facilitating sophisticated applications. The delivery of ionic drugs and interference/pollutant catching for advanced sensing/restoration will be considered in future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Phenol Derivatives over Bismuth&#8208;Based Porous Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective oxidative coupling of phenol derivatives, involving carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) and carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8208;O) bond formation, has emerged as a critical approach in the synthesis of natural products. However, achieving precise control over the selectivity in coupling reactions of unsubstituted phenols utilizing solar light as the driving force remains a big challenge. In this study, we report a series of porous Cs3Bi2X9 (X = Cl, Br, I) photocatalysts with tailored bandgaps and compositions engineered for efficient solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative phenol coupling. Notably, p&#8208;Cs3Bi2Br9 exhibited about 73 % selectivity for C&#8208;C coupling, displaying a high formation rate of 47.3 &#956;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8209;1 under solar radiation. Furthermore, this approach enables control of the site&#8208;selectivity for phenol derivatives on Cs3Bi2X9, enhancing C&#8208;C coupling. The distinctive porous structure and appropriate band&#8208;edge positions of Cs3Bi2Br9 facilitated efficient charge separation, and surface interaction/activation of phenolic hydroxyl groups, resulting in the kinetically preferred formation of C&#8208;C over C&#8208;O bond. Mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway, supported by comprehensive control experiments, unveiled the crucial role of interfacial charge transfers and Lewis acid Bi sites in stabilizing phenolic intermediates, thereby directing the regioselectivity of diradical couplings and resulting in the formation of unsymmetrical biphenols.</dc:description>

         <title>The Use of Xenonucleic Acids Significantly Reduces the In Vivo Drift of Electrochemical Aptamer&#8208;Based Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based sensors support the high&#8208;frequency, real&#8208;time monitoring of molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest in vivo. Achieving this requires methods for correcting the sensor drift seen during in vivo placements. While this correction ensures EAB sensor measurements remain accurate, as drift progresses it reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and precision. Here, we show that enzymatic cleavage of the sensor&#8217;s target&#8208;recognizing DNA aptamer is a major source of this signal loss. To demonstrate this, we deployed a tobramycin&#8208;detecting EAB sensor analog fabricated with the DNase&#8208;resistant &#8220;xenonucleic acid&#8221; 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA in a live rat. In contrast to the sensor employing the equivalent DNA aptamer, the 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA aptamer sensor lost very little signal and had improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise. We further characterized the EAB sensor drift using unstructured DNA or 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA oligonucleotides. While the two devices drift similarly in vitro in whole blood, the in vivo drift of the 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA&#8208;employing device is less compared to the DNA&#8208;employing device. Studies of the electron transfer kinetics suggested that the greater drift of the latter sensor arises due to enzymatic DNA degradation. These findings, coupled with advances in the selection of aptamers employing XNA, suggest a means of improving EAB sensor stability when they are used to perform molecular monitoring in the living body.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning Non&#8208;emissive Schiff Bases into Aggregate Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Schiff bases are a crucial component in various functional materials but often exhibit non&#8208;emissive behavior which significantly limits their potential applications as luminescent materials. However, traditional approaches to convert them into aggregate emitters often require intricate molecular design, tedious synthesis, and significant time and resource consumption. Herein, we present a cocrystallization&#8208;induced emission strategy that can transform non&#8208;emissive (hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted Schiff bases into green&#8208;yellow to yellow aggregate emitters via even simple grinding of a mixture of Schiff bases and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCB) mixtures. The combined experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that the cocrystallization inhibits the C=N isomerization and promotes face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8722;&#960; interaction, which restricts access to both the dark state and canonical intersection to ultimately induce emission. Furthermore, the induced emission enables the observation of solid&#8208;state molecular motions through fluorescence signals, advancing white light emission diodes, and notably, solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on cocrystal for the first time. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Crystallinity and Suppressing Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Completely Non&#8208;fused Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) organic solar cells (OSCs) have received increasing attention because of their promising application in tandem device and indoor photovoltaic. However, the lack of a precise correlation between molecular structure and stacking behaviors of wide bandgap electron acceptors has greatly limited its development. Here, we adopted an asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) and synthesized two completely non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), HF&#8208;BTA33 and HCl&#8208;BTA33. The results show that AHS significantly enhances the molecular dipoles and suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in enhanced intramolecular/intermolecular interactions and decreased nonradiative decay. As a result, PTQ10:HF&#8208;BTA33 realizes a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42% with a VOC of 1.232 V, higher than that of symmetric analogue F&#8208;BTA33 (PCE=10.02%, VOC=1.197 V). Notably, PTQ10:HCl&#8208;BTA33 achieves the highest PCE of 12.54% with a VOC of 1.201 V due to the long&#8208;range ordered &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing and enhanced surface electrostatic interactions thereby facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport. This work not only proves that asymmetric halogenation of completely NFREAs is a simple and effective strategy for achieving both high PCE and VOC, but also provides deeper insights for the precise molecular design of low cost completely NFREAs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Elastomer Bearing Loop Structures with Dissipating Characteristics and Enhanced Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Loops are prevalent topological structures in cross&#8208;linked polymer networks, resulting from the folding of polymer chains back onto themselves. Traditionally, they have been considered as defects that compromise the mechanical properties of the network, leading to extensive efforts in synthesis to prevent their formation. In this study, we introduce the inclusion of cyclic dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moieties within the polymer network strands to form CCNs, and surprisingly, these loops enhance the mechanical performances of the network, leading to tough elastomers. The toughening effect can be attributed to the unique cyclic structure of DB24C8. The relatively small size and the presence of rigid phenyl rings provide the loops with relatively stable conformations, allowing for substantial energy dissipation upon the application of force. Furthermore, the DB24C8 rings possess a broad range of potential conformations, imparting the materials with exceptional elasticity. The synergistic combination of these two features effectively toughens the materials, resulting in a remarkable 66&#8208;fold increase in toughness compared to the control sample of covalent networks. Moreover, the mechanical properties, particularly the recovery performance of the network, can be effectively tuned by introducing guests to bind with DB24C8, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzymes Catalyze Heterobicyclic and Spirocyclic Isoquinolone Core Formation in Piperazine Alkaloid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the discovery and biosynthesis of new piperazine alkaloids&#8210;arizonamides, and their derived compounds&#8210;arizolidines, featuring heterobicyclic and spirocyclic isoquinolone skeletons, respectively. Their biosynthetic pathway involves two crucial non&#8208;heme iron enzymes, ParF and ParG, for core skeleton construction. ParF has a dual function facilitating 2,3&#8208;alkene formation of helvamide, as a substrate for ParG, and oxidative cleavage of piperazine. Notably, ParG exhibits catalytic versatility in multiple oxidative reactions, involving cyclization and ring reconstruction. A key amino acid residue Phe67 was characterized to control the formation of the constrained arizonamide B backbone by ParG.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Design and Efficient Synthesis for High Ambipolar Mobility Emissive Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High ambipolar mobility emissive conjugated polymers   (HAME&#8208;CPs) are perfect candidates for organic optoelectronic devices, such as polymer light emitting transistors. However, due to intrinsic trade&#8208;off relationship between high ambipolar mobility and strong solid&#8208;state luminescence, the development of HAME&#8208;CPs suffers from high structural and synthetic complexity. Herein, a universal design principle and simple synthetic approach for HAME&#8208;CPs are developed. A series of simple non&#8208;fused polymers composed of charge transfer units, &#960; bridges and emissive units are synthesized via a two&#8208;step microwave assisted C&#8208;H arylation and direct arylation polymerization protocol with high total yields up to 61%. The synthetic protocol is verified valid among 7 monomers and 8 polymers. Most importantly, all 8 conjugated polymers have strong solid&#8208;state emission with high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 24%. Furthermore, 4 polymers exhibit high ambipolar field effect mobility up to 10&#8208;2 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, and can be used in multifunctional optoelectronic devices. This work opens a new avenue for developing HAME&#8208;CPs by efficient synthesis and rational design .</dc:description>

         <title>Metabolic Glycoengineering&#8208;Enabled Molecularly Specific Acoustic Tweezing Cytometry for Targeted Mechanical Stimulation of Cell Surface Sialoglycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study developed a new type of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;functionalized microbubbles (MBs) and validated their attachment to azide&#8208;labelled sialoglycans on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated via metabolic glycoengineering (MGE). This enabled application of mechanical forces to sialoglycans on hPSCs via molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry (mATC), i.e., displacing sialoglycan&#8208;anchored MBs using ultrasound (US). It was shown that subjected to forces of US pulses, sialoglycan&#8208;anchored MBs exhibited significantly larger displacements and faster, more complete recovery after each pulse than integrin&#8208;anchored MBs, indicating that sialoglycans are more stretchable and elastic than integrins on hPSCs in response to mechanical force. Furthermore, stimulating sialoglycans on hPSCs using mATC reduced stage&#8208;specific embryonic antigen&#8208;3 (SSEA&#8208;3) and GD3 expression but not OCT4 and SOX2 nuclear localization. Conversely, stimulating integrins decreased OCT4 nuclear localization but not SSEA&#8208;3 and GD3 expression, suggesting that mechanically stimulating sialoglycans and integrins initiated distinct mechanoresponses during the early stages of hPSC differentiation. Taken together, the results demonstrated that MGE&#8208;enabled mATC uncovered not only different mechanical properties of sialoglycans on hPSCs than integrins but also their different mechanoregulatory impacts on hPSC differentiation, validating MGE&#8208;based mATC as a new, powerful tool for investigating the roles of glycans and other cell surface biomolecules in mechanotransduction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
With the assistance of a commercially available L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid ligand, the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols via the Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#8722;H alkenylation has been realized.

Abstract
The construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols via Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#8722;H alkenylation with the assistance of a commercially available L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid has been realized for the first time. Employing oxime ether as the directing group, silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanol derivatives could be readily prepared with excellent enantioselectivities, featuring a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, parallel kinetic resolution with unsymmetric substrates further highlighted the generality of this protocol. Mechanistic studies indicate that L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid could stabilize the Pd catalyst and provide excellent chiral induction. Preliminary computational studies unveil the origin of the enantioselectivity in the C&#8722;H bond activation step.

         <title>Oligo(phenyleneethynylene)s: Shape&#8208;Tunable Building Blocks for Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses in a comparative way the self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution of oligophenyleneethynylenes (OPEs), a class of dyes that has been widely used for various functional materials. The classification of different OPEs according to their molecular shape allows to rationalize their structure/self&#8208;assembly correlation, which should pave the way for the development of functional materials based on &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.







Abstract
Oligo(phenyleneethynylene)s (OPEs) have attracted widespread attention due to their remarkable (opto)electronic and photophysical properties, which have enabled numerous applications. The versatile functionalization possibilities of OPEs make them unique candidates to form various shape&#8208;persistent geometries, including linear, triangular, rectangular, hexagonal and macrocyclic. However, as a result of this structural variety, it is oftentimes challenging to correlate molecular design with self&#8208;assembly properties. In this minireview, we have classified OPEs based on their molecular shapes and correlated them with their self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution. Particularly, we provide important insights into the aggregation propensity of the different molecular shapes and how to tune the association strength using various non&#8208;covalent interactions. Our classification will enable a better understanding of the structure&#8208;property correlation in OPEs, which is key to develop supramolecular functional materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Dialane&#8208;Bridged Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable, dialane&#8208;bridged diradical species has been synthesized that exists in two conformers&#8212;twisted and planar&#8212;depending on the solvent of crystallization. Both conformers have been isolated and thoroughly characterized using various analytical techniques. Their reactivity has been examined with oxidizing agents to demonstrate the reduction capability of diradicals.







Abstract
Radicals of the lightest group 13 element, boron, are well established and observed in numerous forms. In contrast to boron, radical chemistry involving the heavier group 13 elements (aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium) remains largely underexplored, primarily attributed to the formidable synthetic challenges associated with these elements. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of planar and twisted conformers of a doubly CAAC (cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene)&#8208;radical&#8208;substituted dialane. Extensive characterization through spectroscopic analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms their identity, while quantum chemical calculations support their open&#8208;shell nature and provide further insights into their electronic structures. The dialane&#8208;connected diradicals exhibit high susceptibility to oxidation, as evidenced by electrochemical measurements and reactions with o&#8208;chloranil and a variety of organic azides. This study opens a previously uncharted class of dialuminum systems to study, broadening the scope of diradical chemistry and its potential applications.

         <title>(111) Facet&#8208;oriented Cu2Mg Intermetallic Compound with Cu3&#8208;Mg Sites for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (111) facet&#8208;oriented Cu2Mg intermetallic compound with high&#8208;density ordered Cu3&#8208;Mg sites can stabilize oxygen&#8208;containing ethanol intermediates (*CHCHOH) at adjacent Cu catalytic sites during CO2 electroreduction, thus promoting the ethanol production with high selectivity.







Abstract
The efficient ethanol electrosynthesis from CO2 is challenging with low selectivity at high CO2 electrolysis rates, due to the competition with H2 and other reduction products. Copper&#8208;based bimetallic electrocatalysts are potential candidates for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion, but the secondary metal has mainly been focused on active components (such as Ag, Sn) for CO2 electroreduction, which also promote selectivity of ethylene or other reduction products rather than ethanol. Limited attention has been given to alkali&#8208;earth metals due to their inherently active chemical property. Herein, we rationally synthesized a (111) facet&#8208;oriented nano Cu2Mg (designated as Cu2Mg(111)) intermetallic compound with high&#8208;density ordered Cu3&#8208;Mg sites. The in situ Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculations revealed that the Cu3&#8722;
&#8722;&#8208;Mg&#8722;
+ active sites allowed to increase *CO surface coverage, decrease reaction energy for *CO&#8722;CO coupling, and stabilize *CHCHOH intermediates, thus promoting the ethanol formation pathway. The Cu2Mg(111) catalyst exhibited a high FEC2H5OH of 76.2&#177;4.8&#8201;% at 600&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, and a peak value of |jC2H5OH| of 720&#177;34&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, almost 4 times of that using conventional Cu2Mg with (311) facets, comparable to the best reported values for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol electroreduction.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Driven Evolution of Adaptive Artificial Ion Channels or Nanopores with Specific Anticancer Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a novel class of artificial channels, showing an intriguing adaptive ability to form chloride ion channels at low concentrations while transforming into nanopores at high concentrations. The triphenylphosphonium (TPP) groups endow the channel&#8208;forming units with mitochondria&#8208;targeting properties, enabling them to drill holes on the mitochondrial membrane which subsequently induce targeted apoptosis of cancer cells.







Abstract
In nature, ceramides are a class of sphingolipids possessing a unique ability to self&#8208;assemble into protein&#8208;permeable channels with intriguing concentration&#8208;dependent adaptive channel cavities. However, within the realm of artificial ion channels, this interesting phenomenon is scarcely represented. Herein, we report on a novel class of adaptive artificial channels, Pn&#8208;TPPs, based on PEGylated cholic acids bearing triphenylphosphonium (TPP) groups as anion binding motifs. Interestingly, the molecules self&#8208;assemble into chloride ion channels at low concentrations while transforming into small molecule&#8208;permeable nanopores at high concentrations. Moreover, the TPP groups endow the molecules with mitochondria&#8208;targeting properties, enabling them to selectively drill holes on the mitochondrial membrane of cancer cells and subsequently trigger the caspase&#8197;9 apoptotic pathway. The anticancer efficacies of Pn&#8208;TPPs correlate with their abilities to form nanopores. Significantly, the most active ensembles formed by P5&#8208;TPP exhibits impressive anticancer activity against human liver cancer cells, with an IC50 value of 3.8&#8197;&#956;M. While demonstrating similar anticancer performance to doxorubicin, P5&#8208;TPP exhibits a selectivity index surpassing that of doxorubicin by a factor of 16.8.

         <title>Halide Superionic Conductors with Non&#8208;Close&#8208;Packed Anion Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design of non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion frameworks for halide superionic conductors is reported to show great potential for achieving superionic conductivity due to the significantly more distorted site and larger diffusion channel compared to its close&#8208;packed counterparts.







Abstract
Halide superionic conductors (SICs) are drawing significant research attention for their potential applications in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A key challenge in developing such SICs is to explore and design halide structural frameworks that enable rapid ion movement. In this work, we show that the close&#8208;packed anion frameworks shared by traditional halide ionic conductors face intrinsic limitations in fast ion conduction, regardless of structural regulation. Beyond the close&#8208;packed anion frameworks, we identify that the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion frameworks have great potential to achieve superionic conductivity. Notably, we unravel that the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed UCl3&#8208;type framework exhibit superionic conductivity for a diverse range of carrier ions, including Li+, Na+, K+, and Ag+, which are validated through both ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and experimental measurements. We elucidate that the remarkable ionic conductivity observed in the UCl3&#8208;type framework structure stems from its significantly more distorted site and larger diffusion channel than its close&#8208;packed counterparts. By employing the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion framework as the key feature for high&#8208;throughput computational screening, we also identify LiGaCl3 as a promising candidate for halide SICs. These discoveries provide crucial insights for the exploration and design of novel halide SICs.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Terpolymerisation of Elemental Sulfur Waste with Propylene Oxide and Carbon Disulfide via Lithium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental sulfur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, cannot form a copolymer with industrially relevant propylene oxide unless a mechanistic trick is employed, wherein thiolate intermediates are formed in situ to combine the two incompatible monomers.







Abstract
Elemental sulfur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, represents a promising raw material for the synthesis of degradable polymers. We show that simple lithium alkoxides facilitate the polymerisation of elemental sulfur S8 with industrially relevant propylene oxide (PO) and CS2 (a base chemical sourced from waste S8 itself) to give poly(monothiocarbonate&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx) in which x can be controlled by the amount of supplied sulfur. The in situ generation of thiolate intermediates obtained by a rearrangement, which follows CS2 and PO incorporation, allows to combine S8 and epoxides into one polymer sequence that would otherwise not be possible. Mechanistic investigations reveal that alkyl oligosulfide intermediates from S8 ring opening and sulfur chain length equilibration represent the better nucleophiles for inserting the next PO if compared to the trithiocarbonates obtained from the competing CS2 addition, which causes the sequence selectivity. The polymers can be crosslinked in situ with multifunctional thiols to yield reprocessable and degradable networks. Our report demonstrates how mechanistic understanding allows to combine intrinsically incompatible building blocks for sulfur waste utilisation.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Phosphine Boranes via Crystallization&#8208;Induced Dynamic Resolution of Lithiated Intermediate by Understanding the Underlying Epimerization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis of chiral phosphine boranes in high e.r.s utilizing the inexpensive ligand (R,R)&#8208;TMCDA by crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic resolution of its &#945;&#8208;lithiated intermediate. By in&#8208;depth mechanistical studies, the as stereochemically stable known intermediate epimerizes in presence of remaining starting material rendering this method promising for other important P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.







Abstract
Described herein is the successful crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic resolution (CIDR) of an &#945;&#8208;lithiated phosphine borane utilizing the easily accessible and inexpensive ligand (R,R)&#8208;TMCDA. Starting from the essential P&#8208;prochiral building block dimethyl phenyl phosphine borane we were able to obtain phosphine boranes in yields up to 80&#8201;% and e.r. up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 by crystallization of the lithiated intermediate prior to the trapping reaction. NMR&#8208;based deuterium labeling experiments indicate that the epimerization in solution is based on the intermolecular proton transfer between nonlithiated phosphine borane and the corresponding lithiated intermediate, rendering the presence of the remaining starting compound in an optimized solvent mixture the main factor for successful enantioselective synthesis. Quantum chemical calculations using different model systems based on solid state structures confirm these experimental results. By gaining insights into the epimerization mechanism, essential principles for CIDR of lithiated phosphine boranes are elucidated that may be expanded to other important P&#8208;stereogenic compounds and simple chiral amines.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light Activated Formulation for the Spatially Controlled Release of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein for Brain Gene Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoparticle formulation, using oligonucleotide chemistry, able to release a gene editing system with single cell resolution after near infrared laser activation. The full potential of the formulation was demonstrated in the brain after intracerebral and intranasal administrations. The spot of the laser defined the region of gene editing.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as a promising platform for gene editing; however, the lack of an efficient and safe delivery system to introduce it into cells continues to hinder clinical translation. Here, we report a rationally designed gene&#8208;editing nanoparticle (NP) formulation for brain applications: an sgRNA:Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex is immobilized on the NP surface by oligonucleotides that are complementary to the sgRNA. Irradiation of the formulation with a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser generates heat in the NP, leading to the release of the ribonucleoprotein complex. The gene&#8208;editing potential of the formulation was demonstrated in vitro at the single&#8208;cell level. The safety and gene editing of the formulation were also demonstrated in the brains of reporter mice, specifically in the subventricular zone after intracerebral administration and in the olfactory bulb after intranasal administration. The formulation presented here offers a new strategy for the spatially controlled delivery of the CRISPR system to the brain.

         <title>A Terrylene Bisimide based Universal Host for Aromatic Guests to Derive Contact Surface&#8208;Dependent Dispersion Energies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large &#960;&#8208;surface provided by terrylene bisimide affords a cyclophane that can accommodate a large variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guests with binding constants up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1. A linear relationship between the Gibbs binding energy and the surface area of the guest could be used to derive the interaction parameter of 0.31&#8197;kJ/mol&#197;2.







Abstract
&#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are among the most important intermolecular interactions in supramolecular systems. Here we determine experimentally a universal parameter for their strength that is simply based on the size of the interacting contact surfaces. Toward this goal we designed a new cyclophane based on terrylene bisimide (TBI) &#960;&#8208;walls connected by para&#8208;xylylene spacer units. With its extended &#960;&#8208;surface this cyclophane proved to be an excellent and universal host for the complexation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guests, including small and large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as dye molecules. The observed binding constants range up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1 and show a linear dependence on the 2D area size of the guest molecules. This correlation can be used for the prediction of binding constants and for the design of new host&#8211;guest systems based on the herewith derived universal Gibbs interaction energy parameter of 0.31&#8197;kJ/mol&#197;2 in chloroform.

         <title>Pt&#8208;Decorated Gold Nanoflares for High&#8208;Fidelity Phototheranostics: Reducing Side&#8208;Effects and Enhancing Cytotoxicity toward Target Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, photodynamic nanoflares constructed on Pt&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (Au@Pt PDNF) were communicated to avoid false&#8208;positive therapeutic signals caused by intracellular biothiol. Compared to conventional nanoflares, the Au@Pt PDNF exhibited high&#8208;fidelity theranostics while reducing side&#8208;effects. Furthermore, the Pt&#8208;shell was confirmed to generate oxygen which relieved hypoxia&#8208;related photodynamic resistance and enhanced the antitumor effect.







Abstract
Functionalized with the Au&#8722;S bond, gold nanoflares have emerged as promising candidates for theranostics. However, the presence of intracellular abundantly biothiols compromises the conventional Au&#8722;S bond, leading to the unintended release of cargoes and associated side&#8208;effects on non&#8208;target cells. Additionally, the hypoxic microenvironment in diseased regions limits treatment efficacy, especially in photodynamic therapy. To address these challenges, high&#8208;fidelity photodynamic nanoflares constructed on Pt&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (Au@Pt PDNF) were communicated to avoid false&#8208;positive therapeutic signals and side&#8208;effects caused by biothiol perturbation. Compared with conventional photodynamic gold nanoflares (AuNP PDNF), the Au@Pt PDNF were selectively activated by cancer biomarkers and exhibited high&#8208;fidelity phototheranostics while reducing side&#8208;effects. Furthermore, the ultrathin Pt&#8208;shell catalysis was confirmed to generate oxygen which alleviated hypoxia&#8208;related photodynamic resistance and enhanced the antitumor effect. This design might open a new venue to advance theranostics performance and is adaptable to other theranostic nanomaterials by simply adding a Pt shell.

This design might open a new venue to advance theranostics performance and is adaptable to other theranostic nanomaterials by simply adding a Pt shell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Induced Formation of Surface Acid Sites on Pt/Al(PO3)3 Enables Remarkably Efficient Hydrogenolysis of C&#8722;O Bonds in Alcohols and Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum metaphosphate&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles have been developed for the hydrogenolysis of a wide range of alcohols and ethers under exceptionally mild conditions (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;atm of H2, as low as 70&#8201;&#176;C). The key for the high performance of the catalyst is H2&#8208;induced formation of surface Br&#248;nsted acid sites, which efficiently activate C&#8722;O bonds in alcohols and ethers.







Abstract
The hydrogenolysis of oxygenates such as alcohols and ethers is central to the biomass valorization and also a valuable transformation in organic synthesis. However, a mild and efficient catalyst system for the hydrogenolysis of a large variety of alcohols and ethers with various functional groups is still underdeveloped. Here, we report an aluminum metaphosphate&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/Al(PO3)3) for the hydrogenolysis of a wide variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl and benzylic alcohols, and dialkyl, aryl alkyl, and diaryl ethers, including biomass&#8208;derived furanic compounds, under mild conditions (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;atm of H2, as low as 70&#8201;&#176;C). Mechanistic studies suggested that H2 induces formation of the surface Br&#248;nsted acid sites via its cleavage by supported Pt nanoparticles. Accordingly, the high efficiency and the wide applicability of the catalyst system are attributed to the activation and cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds by the hydrogen&#8208;induced Br&#248;nsted acid sites with the assistance of Lewis acidic Al sites on the catalyst surface. The high efficiency of the catalyst implies its potential application in energy&#8208;efficient biomass valorization or fine chemical synthesis.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Tolerance Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium batteries employing Li or silicon (Si) anodes hold promise for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their cycling behavior encounters rapid capacity degradation due to the vulnerability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). Though anion&#8208;derived SEIs mitigate this degradation, the unavoidable reduction of solvents introduces heterogeneity to SEIs, leading to fractures during cycling. Here, we elucidate how the reductive stability of solvents, dominated by the electrophilicity (EPT) and coordination ability (CDA), delineates the SEI formed on Li or Si anodes. Solvents exhibiting lower EPT and CDA demonstrate enhanced tolerance to reduction, resulting in inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs with homogeneity. Guided by these criteria, we synthesized three promising solvents tailored for Li or Si anodes. The decomposition of these solvents is dictated by their EPTs under similar solvation structures, imparting distinct characteristics to SEIs and impacting battery performance. The optimized electrolyte, 1 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in N&#8208;Pyrrolidine&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFSPY), achieves 600 cycles of Si anodes with a capacity retention of 81% (1910 mAh g&#8208;1). In anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) pouch cells, this electrolyte sustains over 100 cycles with an 82% capacity retention. These findings illustrate that reducing solvent decomposition benefits SEI formation, offering valuable insights for the designing electrolytes in high&#8208;energy lithium batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to realize portable pathogen diagnostics with easier quantitation, digitization and integration, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use electrochemical sensing strategy (Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock) for real&#8208;time detection of isothermal nucleic acid amplification. Bridged by a branch DNA as codelock, the isothermal amplicon is transduced into increased current of an electrochemical probe, holding multiple advantages of high sensitivity, high selectivity, signal&#8208;on response, &#8220;zero&#8221; background and one&#8208;pot operation. Through a self&#8208;designed portable instrument (BioAlex PHE&#8208;T), the detection can implement on a multichannel microchip and output real&#8208;time amplification curves just like an expensive commercial PCR machine. The microchip is a rebuilding&#8208;free and disposable component. The branch codelock probe can be customized for different targets and designs. Such high performance and flexibility have been demonstrated utilizing four virus (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, African swine fever, Flu A and Flu B) genes as targets, and two branch (3&#8208;way and 4&#8208;way) DNAs as codelock probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Enhancement of Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Entropically Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Addressing the dual enhancement of circular polarization (glum) and luminescence quantum yield (QY) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) systems poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present an innovative strategy utilizing the entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes (L&#8208;Pt) with tetraethylene glycol chains, resulting in unique temperature dependencies. The entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;Pt leads to a synergistic improvement in phosphorescence emission efficiency (QY was amplified from 15% at 25 &#176;C to 53% at 60 &#176;C) and chirality, both in the ground state and the excited state (glum value has been magnified from 0.04 &#215; 10&#8208;2 to 0.06) with increasing temperature. Notably, we observed reversible modulation of phosphorescence and chirality observed over at least 10 cycles through successive heating and cooling, highlighting the intelligent control of luminescence and chiroptical properties by regulating intermolecular interactions among neighboring L&#8208;Pt molecules. Importantly, the QY and glum of the L&#8208;Pt assembly in solid state were measured as 69% and 0.16 respectively, representing relatively high values compared to most self&#8208;assembled CPL systems.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Addressing the dual enhancement of circular polarization (glum) and luminescence quantum yield (QY) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) systems poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present an innovative strategy utilizing the entropically driven self-assembly of amphiphilic phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes (L-Pt) with tetraethylene glycol chains, resulting in unique temperature dependencies. The entropically driven self-assembly of L-Pt leads to a synergistic improvement in phosphorescence emission efficiency (QY was amplified from 15% at 25 &#176;C to 53% at 60 &#176;C) and chirality, both in the ground state and the excited state (glum value has been magnified from 0.04 &#215; 10-2 to 0.06) with increasing temperature. Notably, we observed reversible modulation of phosphorescence and chirality observed over at least 10 cycles through successive heating and cooling, highlighting the intelligent control of luminescence and chiroptical properties by regulating intermolecular interactions among neighboring L-Pt molecules. Importantly, the QY and glum of the L-Pt assembly in solid state were measured as 69% and 0.16 respectively, representing relatively high values compared to most self-assembled CPL systems. This study marks the pioneering demonstration of dual thermo-enhancement of phosphorescence and CPL and provides valuable insights into the thermal effects on high-temperature and switchable CPL materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Introducing Carborane Clusters into Crystalline Frameworks via Thiol&#8208;yne Click Chemistry for Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline frameworks represent a cutting&#8208;edge frontier in material science, and recently, there has been a surge of interest&#160;in energetic crystalline frameworks. However, the well&#8208;established porosity often leads to diminished output energy, necessitating a novel approach for performance enhancement. Thiol&#8208;yne coupling, a versatile metal&#8208;free click reaction, has been underutilized in crystalline frameworks. As a proof of concept, we herein demonstrate the potential of this approach by introducing the energy&#8208;rich, size&#8208;matched, and reductive 1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaborane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol (CB&#8208;SH) into an acetylene&#8208;functionalized framework, Zn(AIm)2,via thiol&#8208;yne click reaction. This innovative decoration strategy resulted in a remarkable 46.6% increase in energy density, a six&#8208;fold reduction in ignition delay time (4 ms) with red fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer, and impressive enhancement of stability. Density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanism by which CB&#8208;SH promotes hypergolic ignition. The thiol&#8208;yne click modification strategy presented here permits engineering of crystalline frameworks for the design of advanced energetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Boundary&#8208;Rich Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts with Manganese(II)&#8208;Coordinated Active Environment for Selective Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;supported manganese&#8208;centered boundary&#8208;rich electrocatalysts show high activity for selective H2O2 synthesis. The secondary epoxide and hydroxyl groups surrounding Mn&#8722;N3&#8722;O sites and the O2 enrichment in the curved boundaries together contribute to the activity enhancement for the targeted electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Coordinated manganese (Mn) electrocatalysts owing to their electronic structure flexibility, non&#8208;toxic and earth abundant features are promising for electrocatalytic reactions. However, achieving selective hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production through two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8208;ORR) is a challenge on Mn&#8208;centered catalysts. Targeting this goal, we report on the creation of a secondary Mn(II)&#8208;coordinated active environment with reactant enrichment effect on boundary&#8208;rich porous carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts, which facilitates the selective and rapid synthesis of H2O2 through 2e&#8208;ORR. The catalysts exhibit nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and H2O2 productivity up to 15.1&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, representing the record high activity for Mn&#8208;based electrocatalyst in H2O2 electrosynthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that the epoxide and hydroxyl groups surrounding Mn(II) centers improve spin state by modifying electronic properties and charge transfer, thus tailoring the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate. Multiscale simulations reveal that the high&#8208;curvature boundaries facilitate oxygen (O2) adsorption and result in local O2 enrichment due to the enhanced interaction between carbon surface and O2. These merits together ensure the efficient formation of H2O2 with high local concentration, which can directly boost the tandem reaction of hydrolysis of benzonitrile to benzamide with nearly 100&#8201;% conversion rate and exclusive benzamide selectivity.

         <title>pKa as a Predictive Descriptor for Electrochemical Anion Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using detailed experiments on a single&#8208;crystal electrode, we find that the adsorption strength of a series of carboxylate anions to a metal is linearly corelated with their acid dissociation constant (pKa). Density functional theory shows that this correlation is dictated by the difference in their electron affinity&#8212;how easily the anion can give up its electron upon adsorption determines its adsorption strength.







Abstract
The adsorption of anions onto metal surfaces is important in many applications including effective (electro)catalyst design, metal surface modification, and contaminant removal in wastewater treatment. In electrocatalysis, anions can be both reactive intermediates or site&#8208;blocking spectators, where their adsorption strength therefore dictates the rate of reaction. In this work, we have measured the adsorption energy of a series of carboxylic acids on a Pt (111) single&#8208;crystal electrode surface from aqueous solution. We find that the adsorption strength of the carboxylate anion is linearly correlated with its acid&#8208;dissociation constant (pKa) and therefore the heterolytic O&#8722;H bond dissociation strength in solution. Using density functional theory modeling, we split the anion adsorption energy into a sum of the adsorption energy and electron affinity of a neutral (carboxyl) radical. Surprisingly, the adsorption energy of the carboxyl radicals are similar and therefore the large difference in electron affinity is what dictates anion adsorption strength; the greater the cost in energy to remove the electron from the anion upon adsorption, the weaker its binding. Therefore, at least within a class of anions with similar structure and surface binding atoms, both electron affinity and acidity are predictive descriptors of adsorption strength.

The rational design and photophysical investigation of donor&#8208;acceptor dyads based on spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,7&#8217;&#8208;dibenzo[c,h]acridine]&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;one uncover the complex interplay among different light&#8208;driven pathways, including intramolecular charge transfer, fluorescence, and intersystem crossing. This investigation offers important guidance for designing novel functional materials for triplet sensitizers and fluorescent sensors.







Abstract
In this work, we prepared a series of electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems based on spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,7&#8217;&#8208;dibenzo[c,h]acridine]&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;one (SFDBAO). Our SFDBAOs consist of orthogonally positioned fluorenes and aromatic ketones. By fine&#8208;tuning the substitution of electron&#8208;donating pyrenes, the complex interplay among different excited&#8208;state decay channels and the overall impact of solvents on these decay channels were uncovered. Placing pyrene, for example, at the aromatic ketones resulted in a profound solvatochromism in the form of a bright charge&#8208;transfer (CT) emission spanning from yellow to red&#8208;NIR. In contrast, a dark non&#8208;emissive CT was noted upon pyrene substitution at the fluorenes. In apolar solvents, efficient triplet&#8208;excited state generation was observed for all SFDBAOs. Either charge transfer was concluded to mediate the intersystem crossing (ISC) in the case of pyrene substitution or the El&#8208;Sayed rule was applicable when lacking pyrene substitution as in the case of SFABAO. In polar solvents, charge separation is the sole decay upon pyrene substitution. Moreover, competition between ISC and CT lowered the triplet&#8208;excited state generation in SFDBAO.

         <title>Reversible Radical Addition Guides Selective Photocatalytic Intermolecular Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Ene Molecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photoredox three&#8208;component coupling of thiols with readily available alkynes and alkenes has been developed. The reaction mechanism was evaluated by combining ESI&#8208;HRMS, EPR spectroscopy, isotope labeling and control experiments. The applicability of the reversible radical addition approach for intermolecular reactions and the key role of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in stereoselectivity control have been shown by DFT studies.







Abstract
In modern organic chemistry, harnessing the power of multicomponent radical reactions presents both significant challenges and extraordinary potential. This article delves into this scientific frontier by addressing the critical issue of controlling selectivity in such complex processes. We introduce a novel approach that revolves around the reversible addition of thiyl radicals to multiple bonds, reshaping the landscape of multicomponent radical reactions. The key to selectivity lies in the intricate interplay between reversibility and the energy landscapes governing C&#8722;C bond formation in thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reactions. The developed approach not only allows to prioritize the thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene cascade, dominating over alternative reactions, but also extends the scope of coupling products obtained from alkenes and alkynes of various structures and electron density distributions, regardless of their relative polarity difference, opening doors to more versatile synthetic possibilities. In the present study, we provide a powerful tool for atom&#8208;economical C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bond formation, paving the way for the efficient synthesis of complex molecules. Carrying out our experimental and computational studies, we elucidated the fundamental mechanisms underlying radical cascades, a knowledge that can be broadly applied in the field of organic chemistry.

         <title>Amphiphilic Covalent Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Pickering Emulsion Catalysis with Size Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles constructed with highly hydrophobic monomers as linkers were demonstrated to show a superior amphiphilicity for the formation of stable Pickering emulsions. Because of the high surface areas and tunable pore diameters of COFs, Pickering emulsion catalysis with both a high reaction efficiency and a remarkable size selectivity was achieved.







Abstract
Exploiting advanced amphiphilic solid catalysts is crucial to the development of Pickering emulsion catalysis. Herein, covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles constructed with highly hydrophobic monomers as linkers were found to show superior amphiphilicity and they were then developed as a new class of solid emulsifiers for Pickering emulsion catalysis. Employing amphiphilic COFs as solid emulsifiers, Pickering emulsions with controllable emulsion type and droplet sizes were obtained. COF materials have also been demonstrated to serve as porous surface coatings to replace traditional surface modifications for stabilizing Pickering emulsions. After implanting Pd nanoparticles into amphiphilic COFs, the obtained catalyst displayed a 3.9&#8197;times higher catalytic efficiency than traditional amphiphilic solid catalysts with surface modifications in the biphasic oxidation reaction of alcohols. Such an enhanced activity was resulted from the high surface area and regular porous structure of COFs. More importantly, because of their tunable pore diameters, Pickering emulsion catalysis with remarkable size selectivity was achieved. This work is the first example that COFs were applied in Pickering emulsion catalysis, providing a platform for exploring new frontiers of Pickering emulsion catalysis.

         <title>Axial&#8211;Equatorial Halide Ordering in Layered Hybrid Perovskites from Isotropic&#8211;Anisotropic 207Pb NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodide preferentially occupies the axial sites in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 2D perovskites. This results in a larger, more negative, 207Pb chemical shift anisotropy that can be distinguished in the isotropic&#8211;anisotropic 207Pb NMR correlation spectra.







Abstract
Bandgap&#8208;tuneable mixed&#8208;halide 3D perovskites are of interest for multi&#8208;junction solar cells, but suffer from photoinduced spatial halide segregation. Mixed&#8208;halide 2D perovskites are more resistant to halide segregation and are promising coatings for 3D perovskite solar cells. The properties of mixed&#8208;halide compositions depend on the local halide distribution, which is challenging to study at the level of single octahedra. In particular, it has been suggested that there is a preference for occupation of the distinct axial and equatorial halide sites in mixed&#8208;halide 2D perovskites. 207Pb NMR can be used to probe the atomic&#8208;scale structure of lead&#8208;halide materials, but although the isotropic 207Pb shift is sensitive to halide stoichiometry, it cannot distinguish configurational isomers. Here, we use 2D isotropic&#8211;anisotropic correlation 207Pb NMR and relativistic DFT calculations to distinguish the [PbX6] configurations in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 3D FAPb(Br1&#8722;xIx)3 perovskites and 2D BA2Pb(Br1&#8722;xIx)4 perovskites based on formamidinium (FA+) and butylammonium (BA+), respectively. We find that iodide preferentially occupies the axial site in BA&#8208;based 2D perovskites, which may explain the suppressed halide mobility.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Additive Enables High Moisture Tolerance and Favorable Electric Double Layer for Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;salt additive&#8208;reinforced carbonate electrolyte (LTFAN) is proposed for stabilizing high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The in situ generated nitrogenous and fluoride&#8208;rich electrode electrolyte interphase with LTFAN vastly accelerates the interfacial reaction dynamics, and dual&#8208;salt additive notably strengthens the moisture tolerance. A thermodynamically favorable electric double layer at charged cathode interface is constructed.







Abstract
The carbonate electrolyte chemistry is a primary determinant for the development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, their implementation is greatly plagued by sluggish electrode interfacial dynamics and insufficient electrolyte thermodynamic stability. Herein, lithium trifluoroacetate&#8208;lithium nitrate (LiTFA&#8722;LiNO3) dual&#8208;salt additive&#8208;reinforced carbonate electrolyte (LTFAN) is proposed for stabilizing high&#8208;voltage LMBs. We reveal that 1) the in situ generated inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (EEI) enables rapid interfacial dynamics, 2) TFA&#8722; preferentially interacts with moisture over PF6&#8722; to strengthen the moisture tolerance of designed electrolyte, and 3) NO3&#8722; is found to be noticeably enriched at the cathode interface on charging, thus constructing Li+&#8208;enriched, solvent&#8208;coordinated, thermodynamically favorable electric double layer (EDL). The superior moisture tolerance of LTFAN and the thermodynamically stable EDL constructed at cathode interface play a decisive role in upgrading the compatibility of carbonate electrolyte with high&#8208;voltage cathode. The LMBs with LTFAN realize 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;NCM523/4.4&#8197;V&#8208;NCM622 superior cycling reversibility and excellent rate capability, which is the leading level of documented records for carbonate electrode.

         <title>Diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine (DPPH) Affords Late&#8208;Stage S&#8208;imination to access free&#8208;NH Sulfilimines and Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free, and high&#8208;yielding sulfur&#8208;imination using O&#8208;(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine to access sulfilimine salts and free&#8208;NH sulfoximines has been reported. Its generality was evidenced using a broad substrate scope along with late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex, biologically relevant substrates including a notorious amatoxin. DPPH was also shown to iminate sulfoxides with high yields under Rh catalysis to afford sulfoximines.







Abstract
Sulfilimines, as potential aza&#8208;isosteres of sulfoxides, are valued as building blocks, auxiliaries, ligands, bioconjugation handles, and as precursors to versatile S(VI) scaffolds including sulfoximines and sulfondiimines. Here, we report a thioether imination methodology that exploits O&#8208;(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine (DPPH).

     alt="Diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine (DPPH) Affords Late-Stage S-imination to access free-NH Sulfilimines and Sulfoximines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-free, and high-yielding sulfur-imination using O-(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine to access sulfilimine salts and free-NH sulfoximines has been reported. Its generality was evidenced using a broad substrate scope along with late-stage functionalization of complex, biologically relevant substrates including a notorious amatoxin. DPPH was also shown to iminate sulfoxides with high yields under Rh catalysis to afford sulfoximines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfilimines, as potential aza-isosteres of sulfoxides, are valued as building blocks, auxiliaries, ligands, bioconjugation handles, and as precursors to versatile S(VI) scaffolds including sulfoximines and sulfondiimines. Here, we report a thioether imination methodology that exploits O-(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine (DPPH). Under mild, metal-free, and biomolecule-compatible conditions, DPPH enables &lt;i&gt;late-stage&lt;/i&gt; S-imination on peptides, natural products, and a clinically trialled drug, and shows both excellent chemoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. This methodological report is extended to an efficient and high-yielding one-pot reaction for accessing &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt;-NH sulfoximines with diverse substrates including ones of potential clinical importance. In the presence of a rhodium catalyst, sulfoxides are S-iminated in higher yields to afford &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt;-NH sulfoximines. S-imination was validated on an oxidatively delicate amatoxin to give sulfilimine and sulfoximine congeners. Interestingly, these new sulfilimine and sulfoximine-amatoxins show cytotoxicity. This method is further extended to create sulfilimine and sulfoximine-Fulvestrant and buthionine analogues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Reconstruction on Metal Nitride during Photo&#8208;oxidation</title>

Photo&#8208;induced surface reconstruction of Co3Mo3N forming amorphous Mo&#8208;rich@Co&#8208;rich bilayer structure leads to a shortened Co&#8722;Mo bond length resulting in improved performance for both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (PHER) and photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (POER) compared to pure Co3Mo3N.







Abstract
The efficient conversion and storage of solar energy for chemical fuel production presents a challenge in sustainable energy technologies. Metal nitrides (MNs) possess unique structures that make them multi&#8208;functional catalysts for water splitting. However, the thermodynamic instability of MNs often results in the formation of surface oxide layers and ambiguous reaction mechanisms. Herein, we present on the photo&#8208;induced reconstruction of a Mo&#8208;rich@Co&#8208;rich bi&#8208;layer on ternary cobalt&#8208;molybdenum nitride (Co3Mo3N) surfaces, resulting in improved effectiveness for solar water splitting. During a photo&#8208;oxidation process, the uniform initial surface oxide layer is reconstructed into an amorphous Co&#8208;rich oxide surface layer and a subsurface Mo&#8722;N layer. The Co&#8208;rich outer layer provides active sites for photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (POER), while the Mo&#8208;rich sublayer promotes charge transfer and enhances the oxidation resistance of Co3Mo3N. Additionally, the surface reconstruction yields a shortened Co&#8722;Mo bond length, weakening the adsorption of hydrogen and resulting in improved performance for both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (PHER) and POER. This work provides insight into the surface structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationships of MNs in solar energy conversion, and is expected to have significant implications for the design of metal nitride&#8208;based catalysts in sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Sulfonyl Molecules Induced Oriented Lithium Deposition for Long&#8208;Term Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

During Li+ desolvation, the electrochemical binding ability of TSOH regulates Li+ plating morphology along the (110) crystal surface toward dendrite&#8208;free Li anode. The electron&#8208;rich structure brings lower reduction potential energy and inhibits decomposition of Li salts. Even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, a &#8216;smooth and dense&#8217; SEI is formed, significantly reducing interface transmission resistance of Li+ ions.







Abstract
Dendrites growth and unstable interfacial Li+ transport hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we report an active layer of 2,4,6&#8211;trihydroxy benzene sulfonyl fluorine on copper substrate that induces oriented Li+ deposition and generates highly crystalline solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to achieve high&#8208;performance LMBs. The lithiophilic &#8722;SO2&#8722; groups of highly crystalline SEI accept the rapidly transported Li+ ions and form a dense inner layer of LiF and Li3N, which regulate Li+ plating morphology along the (110) crystal surface toward dendrite&#8208;free Li anode. Thus, Li||Cu cells with lithiophilic SEI achieve an average deposition efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% after 700&#8197;cycles, and Li||Li cells operate well for 1100&#8197;h. Besides, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells with modified SEI exhibit a capacity retention that is 14&#8197;times than that of conventional SEI. Even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, Li||Cu cells reach stable deposition efficiency of 83.2&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

Abstract
In dinitrogen (N2) fixation chemistry, bimetallic end&#8208;on bridging N2 complexes M(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)M can split N2 into terminal nitrides and hence attract great attention. To date, only 4d and 5d transition complexes, but none of 3d counterparts, could realize such a transformation. Likewise, complexes {[Cp*Cr(dmpe)]2(&#956;&#8208;N2)}0/1+/2+ (1&#8211;3) are incapable to cleave N2, in contrast to their Mo congeners. Remarkably, cross this series the N&#8722;N bond length of the N2 ligand and the N&#8722;N stretching frequency exhibit unprecedented nonmonotonic variations, and complexes 1 and 2 in both solid and solution states display rare thermally activated ligand&#8208;mediated two&#8208;center spin transitions, distinct from discrete dinuclear spin crossovers. In&#8208;depth analyses using wave function based ab initio calculations reveal that the Cr&#8208;N2&#8208;Cr bonding in complexes&#8197;1&#8211;3 is distinguished by strong multireference character and cannot be described by solely one electron configuration or Lewis structure, and that all intriguing spectroscopic observations originate in their sophisticate multireference electronic structures. More critical is that such multireference bonding of complexes&#8197;1&#8211;3 is at least a key factor that contributes to their kinetic inertness toward N2 splitting. The mechanistic understanding is then used to rationalize the disparate reactivity of related 3d M(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)M complexes compared to their 4d and 5d analogs.

         <title>Characterization and Engineering of Two Highly Paralogous Sesquiterpene Synthases Reveal a Regioselective Reprotonation Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three critical active site residues [L311&#8208;S419&#8208;C458]/[M311&#8208;V419&#8208;A458] were identified as the switch of the regioselective C3/C6 reprotonation of germacrene A in sesquiterpene synthase catalysis through the characterization and engineering of two highly paralogous sesquiterpene synthases, AhCS and AhIS, using a combination of isotopic labeling experiments, cryo&#8208;electron microscopy, and structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis.







Abstract
Sesquiterpene synthases (STPSs) catalyze carbocation&#8208;driven cyclization reactions that can generate structurally diverse hydrocarbons. The deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation process is widely used in STPSs to promote structural diversity, largely attributable to the distinct regio/stereoselective reprotonations. However, the molecular basis for reprotonation regioselectivity remains largely understudied. Herein, we analyzed two highly paralogous STPSs, Artabotrys hexapetalus (&#8722;)&#8208;cyperene synthase (AhCS) and ishwarane synthase (AhIS), which catalyze reactions that are distinct from the regioselective protonation of germacrene A (GA), resulting in distinct skeletons of 5/5/6 tricyclic (&#8722;)&#8208;cyperene and 6/6/5/3 tetracyclic ishwarane, respectively. Isotopic labeling experiments demonstrated that these protonations occur at C3 and C6 of GA in AhCS and AhIS, respectively. The cryo&#8208;electron microscopy&#8208;derived AhCS complex structure provided the structural basis for identifying different key active site residues that may govern their functional disparity. The structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis of these residues resulted in successful functional interconversion between AhCS and AhIS, thus targeting the three active site residues [L311&#8208;S419&#8208;C458]/[M311&#8208;V419&#8208;A458] that may act as a C3/C6 reprotonation switch for GA. These findings facilitate the rational design or directed evolution of STPSs with structurally diverse skeletons.

         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of thioamides with alkynoate esters is presented. The reaction provides alkenylated products in high yields and selectivities that are primed for diverse downstream derivatizations.







Abstract
An enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of thioamides with but&#8208;2&#8208;ynoate ester coupling partners employing thioamide directing groups is presented. The method is operationally simple and requires only mild reaction conditions, while providing alkenylated products as single regioisomers in excellent yields (up to 85&#8201;%) and high enantiomeric excess [up to 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 enantiomeric ratio (er), or up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er after a single recrystallization]. Diverse downstream derivatizations of the products are demonstrated, delivering a range of enantioenriched constructs. Extensive computational studies using density functional theory provide insight into the detailed reaction mechanism, origin of enantiocontrol, and the unusual regioselectivity of the alkenylation reaction.

         <title>Mechanophotocatalysis: A Generalizable Approach to Solvent&#8208;minimized Photocatalytic Reactions for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via the synergistic union with mechanochemistry, four archetypal photocatalysis reactions have been realized under solvent&#8208;free or solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. The mechanophotocatalytic versions feature competitive or superior efficiencies to the solution&#8208;state reactions, while also showcasing an enhanced tolerance to aerobic conditions.







Abstract
This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study cements the viability and generality of mechanophotocatalysis, merging mechanochemistry and photocatalysis to enable solvent&#8208;minimized photocatalytic reactions. We demonstrate the transmutation of four archetypal solution&#8208;state photocatalysis reactions to a solvent&#8208;minimized environment driven by the combined actions of milling, light, and photocatalysts. The chlorosulfonylation of alkenes and the pinacol coupling of aldehydes and ketones were conducted under solvent&#8208;free conditions with competitive or superior efficiencies to their solution&#8208;state analogues. Furthermore, decarboxylative alkylations are shown to function efficiently under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions, while the photoinduced energy transfer promoted [2+2] cycloaddition of chalcone experiences a significant initial rate enhancement over its solution&#8208;state variant. This work serves as a platform for future discoveries in an underexplored field: validating that solvent&#8208;minimized photocatalysis is not only generalizable and competitive with solution&#8208;state photocatalysis, but can also offer valuable advantages.

         <title>A Single Set of Well&#8208;Designed Aptamer Probes for Reliable On&#8208;site Qualitative and Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Quantitative Detection</title>

An aptasensor was developed with supersandwich DNA (SSW&#8208;DNA) modified on the outer surface of nanochannels with hydrophobic inner walls realizing the reliable on&#8208;site qualitative and laboratory ultra&#8208;sensitive quantitative detection of MC&#8211;LR. This work highlights the enhanced performance and broader applicability based on the well&#8208;designed single set of probes and nanochannels.







Abstract
Aptamer&#8208;based probes are pivotal components in various sensing strategies, owing to their exceptional specificity and versatile programmable structure. Nevertheless, numerous aptamer&#8208;based probes usually offer only a single function, limiting their capacity to meet the diverse requirements of multi&#8208;faceted sensing systems. Here, we introduced supersandwich DNA probes (SSW&#8208;DNA), designed and modified on the outer surface of nanochannels with hydrophobic inner walls, enabling dual functionality: qualitative detection for on&#8208;site analysis and quantitative detection for precise analysis. The fragmented DNAs resulting from the target recognition, are subsequently identified through lateral flow assays, enabling robust on&#8208;site qualitative detection of microcystin&#8208;LR with an impressively low limit of detection (LOD) at 0.01&#8197;&#956;g/L. Meanwhile, the nanochannels enable highly sensitive quantification of microcystin&#8208;LR through the current analysis, achieving an exceptionally low LOD at 2.5&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;&#956;g/L, with a broad dynamic range spanning from 1&#215;10&#8722;6 to 1&#215;102&#8197;&#956;g/L. Furthermore, the process of target recognition introduces just a single potential error propagation, which reduces the overall risk of errors during the entire qualitative and quantitative detection process. This sensing strategy broadens the scope of applications for aptamer&#8208;based composite probes, holding promising implications across diverse fields, such as medical diagnosis, food safety, and environmental protection.

         <title>Multivariate Machine Learning Models of Nanoscale Porosity from Ultrafast NMR Relaxometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning allows rapid classification and prediction of the surface area (SA) of nanoporous materials through NMR relaxometry measurements of solvent imbibed in the porous network. Here, principal component analysis (PCA) screens &#8220;high&#8221; and &#8220;low&#8221; SA materials, and partial least squares (PLS) provides numerical estimates of SA. This non&#8208;destructive technique can be used to help develop new materials with optimized porosity.







Abstract
Nanoporous materials are of great interest in many applications, such as catalysis, separation, and energy storage. The performance of these materials is closely related to their pore sizes, which are inefficient to determine through the conventional measurement of gas adsorption isotherms. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry has emerged as a technique highly sensitive to porosity in such materials. Nonetheless, streamlined methods to estimate pore size from NMR relaxometry remain elusive. Previous attempts have been hindered by inverting a time domain signal to relaxation rate distribution, and dealing with resulting parameters that vary in number, location, and magnitude. Here we invoke well&#8208;established machine learning techniques to directly correlate time domain signals to BET surface areas for a set of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) imbibed with solvent at varied concentrations. We employ this series of MOFs to establish a correlation between NMR signal and surface area via partial least squares (PLS), following screening with principal component analysis, and apply the PLS model to predict surface area of various nanoporous materials.

     alt="Multivariate Machine Learning Models of Nanoscale Porosity from Ultrafast NMR Relaxometry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning allows rapid classification and prediction of the surface area (SA) of nanoporous materials through NMR relaxometry measurements of solvent imbibed in the porous network. Here, principal component analysis (PCA) screens &#8220;high&#8221; and &#8220;low&#8221; SA materials, and partial least squares (PLS) provides numerical estimates of SA. This non-destructive technique can be used to help develop new materials with optimized porosity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoporous materials are of great interest in many applications, such as catalysis, separation, and energy storage. The performance of these materials is closely related to their pore sizes, which are inefficient to determine through the conventional measurement of gas adsorption isotherms. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry has emerged as a technique highly sensitive to porosity in such materials. Nonetheless, streamlined methods to estimate pore size from NMR relaxometry remain elusive. Previous attempts have been hindered by inverting a time domain signal to relaxation rate distribution, and dealing with resulting parameters that vary in number, location, and magnitude. Here we invoke well-established machine learning techniques to directly correlate time domain signals to BET surface areas for a set of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) imbibed with solvent at varied concentrations. We employ this series of MOFs to establish a correlation between NMR signal and surface area via partial least squares (PLS), following screening with principal component analysis, and apply the PLS model to predict surface area of various nanoporous materials. This approach offers a high-throughput, non-destructive way to assess porosity in c.a. one minute. We anticipate this work will contribute to the development of new materials with optimized pore sizes for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Detection of BODIPY&#8208;, Biotin&#8208;, and 19F&#8208; Labeled Single&#8208;Entity Dendritic Heparan Sulfate Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Labeled single&#8208;entity heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized to investigate their cellular distribution, involvement with the immune system, and biodistribution. A fluorescently labeled HS mimetic was observed in the brain of mice and was shown to preferentially associate with immune cells from the tumor site rather than from the spleen. The compounds reported represent a new tool box helping to unravel the mechanism of action of HS mimetics.







Abstract
Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) are naturally occurring mammalian glycosaminoglycans, and their synthetic and semi&#8208;synthetic mimetics have attracted significant interest as potential therapeutics. However, understanding the mechanism of action by which HS, heparin, and HS mimetics have a biological effect is difficult due to their highly charged nature, broad protein interactomes, and variable structures. To address this, a library of novel single&#8208;entity dendritic mimetics conjugated to BODIPY, Fluorine&#8208;19 (19F), and biotin was synthesized for imaging and localization studies. The novel dendritic scaffold allowed for the conjugation of labeling moieties without reducing the number of sulfated capping groups, thereby better mimicking the multivalent nature of HS&#8208;protein interactions. The 19F labeled mimetics were assessed in phantom studies and were detected at concentrations as low as 5&#8197;mM. Flow cytometric studies using a fluorescently labeled mimetic showed that the compound associated with immune cells from tumors more readily than splenic counterparts and was directed to endosomal&#8208;lysosomal compartments within immune cells and cancer cells. Furthermore, the fluorescently labeled mimetic entered the central nervous system and was detectable in brain&#8208;infiltrating immune cells 24&#8197;hours after treatment. Here, we report the enabling methodology for rapidly preparing various labeled HS mimetics and molecular probes with diverse potential therapeutic applications.

Using in situ methods of atomic force microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and optical microscopy, we visualized the processes of Li plating, stripping and replating tuned by the on&#8208;site formed SEI at the argyrodite solid&#8208;electrolyte/Li anode interface in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Our work provides insights into correlations between the interfacial evolution and cell performance, contributing to the improvement of solid&#8208;state energy devices.







Abstract
The interfacial processes, mainly the lithium (Li) plating/stripping and the evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), are directly related to the performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries (ASSLBs). However, the complex processes at solid&#8208;solid interfaces are embedded under the solid&#8208;state electrolyte, making it challenging to analyze the dynamic processes in real time. Here, using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy, we directly visualized the Li plating/stripping/replating behavior, and measured the morphological and mechanical properties of the on&#8208;site formed SEI at nanoscale. Li spheres plating/stripping/replating at the argyrodite solid electrolyte (Li6PS5Cl)/Li electrode interface is coupled with the formation/wrinkling/inflating of the SEI on its surface. Combined with in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, details of the stepwise formation and physicochemical properties of SEI on the Li spheres are obtained. It is shown that higher operation rates can decrease the uniformity of the Li+&#8208;conducting networks in the SEI and worsen Li plating/stripping reversibility. By regulating the applied current rates, uniform nucleation and reversible plating/stripping processes can be achieved, leading to the extension of the cycling life. The in situ analysis of the on&#8208;site formed SEI at solid&#8208;solid interfaces provides the correlation between the interfacial evolution and the electrochemical performance in ASSLBs.

Programmable DNA motors with tunable properties. The 0&#8201;% GC is the fastest motor and can detect and stall in the presence of single oligonucleotides.







Abstract
DNA motors that consume chemical energy to generate processive mechanical motion mimic natural motor proteins and have garnered interest due to their potential applications in dynamic nanotechnology, biosensing, and drug delivery. Such motors translocate by a catalytic cycle of binding, cleavage, and rebinding between DNA &#8220;legs&#8221; on the motor body and RNA &#8220;footholds&#8221; on a track. Herein, we address the well&#8208;documented trade&#8208;off between motor speed and processivity and investigate how these parameters are controlled by the affinity between DNA legs and their complementary footholds. Specifically, we explore the role of DNA leg length and GC content in tuning motor performance by dictating the rate of leg&#8208;foothold dissociation. Our investigations reveal that motors with 0&#8201;% GC content exhibit increased instantaneous velocities of up to 150&#8197;nm/sec, three&#8208;fold greater than previously reported DNA motors and comparable to the speeds of biological motor proteins. We also demonstrate that the faster speed and weaker forces generated by 0&#8201;% GC motors can be leveraged for enhanced capabilities in sensing. We observe single&#8208;molecule sensitivity when programming the motors to stall in response to the binding of nucleic acid targets. These findings offer insights for the design of high&#8208;performance DNA motors with promising real&#8208;world biosensing applications.

         <title>Conditional Cooperativity in RAS Assembly Pathways on Nanodiscs and Altered GTPase Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size&#8208;tunable nanodisc platforms and NMR revealed the structural mechanism for the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of both wild&#8208;type and oncogenic mutants of native, fully processed KRAS on the membrane. The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition of the membrane. Higher&#8208;order oligomers retain higher numbers of active GTP&#8208;bound protomers by reducing GTP hydrolysis and increasing GDP/GTP exchange.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assemblies (i.e., nanoclusters) of the RAS GTPase on the membrane act as scaffolds that activate downstream RAF kinases and drive MAPK signaling for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanistic details of nanoclustering remain largely unknown. Here, size&#8208;tunable nanodisc platforms and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) analyses revealed the structural basis of the cooperative assembly processes of fully processed KRAS, mutated in a quarter of human cancers. The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition of the membrane. Notably, the oncogenic mutants assemble in nonsequential pathways with two mutually cooperative &#8216;&#945;/&#945;&#8217; and &#8216;&#945;/&#946;&#8217; interfaces, while &#945;/&#945; dimerization of wild&#8208;type KRAS promotes the secondary &#945;/&#946; interaction sequentially. Mutation&#8208;based interface engineering was used to selectively trap the oligomeric intermediates of KRAS and probe their favorable interface interactions. Transiently exposed interfaces were available for the assembly. Real&#8208;time NMR demonstrated that higher&#8208;order oligomers retain higher numbers of active GTP&#8208;bound protomers in KRAS GTPase cycling. These data provide a deeper understanding of the nanocluster&#8208;enhanced signaling in response to the environment. Furthermore, our methodology is applicable to assemblies of many other membrane GTPases and lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based formulations of stable protein oligomers with enhanced cooperativity.

The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition of the membrane. Notably, the oncogenic mutants assemble in nonsequential pathways with two mutually cooperative &#8216;&#945;/&#945;&#8217; and &#8216;&#945;/&#946;&#8217; interfaces, while &#945;/&#945; dimerization of wild-type KRAS promotes the secondary &#945;/&#946; interaction sequentially. Mutation-based interface engineering was used to selectively trap the oligomeric intermediates of KRAS and probe their favorable interface interactions. Transiently exposed interfaces were available for the assembly. Real-time NMR demonstrated that higher-order oligomers retain higher numbers of active GTP-bound protomers in KRAS GTPase cycling. These data provide a deeper understanding of the nanocluster-enhanced signaling in response to the environment. Furthermore, our methodology is applicable to assemblies of many other membrane GTPases and lipid nanoparticle-based formulations of stable protein oligomers with enhanced cooperativity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular and Structural Basis for C&#947;&#8722;C Bond Formation by PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Fub7</title>

Fub7, a pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzyme, catalyzes stereoselective and substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective C&#947;&#8722;C bond formations. Now a structural and enzymological study have elucidated the structural and molecular underpinnings of its catalytic specificity and selectivity, paving the way for harnessing its activity in the synthesis of cyclic noncanonical amino acids.







Abstract
Pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze &#947;&#8208;replacement reactions are prevalent, yet their utilization of carbon nucleophile substrates is rare. The recent discovery of two PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes, CndF and Fub7, has unveiled unique C&#8722;C bond forming capabilities, enabling the biocatalytic synthesis of alkyl&#8208; substituted pipecolic acids from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine and &#946;&#8208;keto acid or aldehyde derived enolates. This breakthrough presents fresh avenues for the biosynthesis of pipecolic acid derivatives. However, the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes remain elusive, and a dearth of structural information hampers their extensive application. Here, we have broadened the catalytic scope of Fub7 by employing ketone&#8208;derived enolates as carbon nucleophiles, revealing Fub7&#8217;s capacity for substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of unsymmetrical ketones. Through an integrated approach combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopy, mutagenesis, and computational docking studies, we offer a detailed mechanistic insight into Fub7 catalysis. Our findings elucidate the structural basis for its substrate specificity, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity. Our work sets the stage ready for subsequent protein engineering effort aimed at expanding the synthetic utility of Fub7, potentially unlocking novel methods to access a broader array of noncanonical amino acids.

         <title>The Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride as the Reinforcing Phase of Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>

A powdery h&#8208;BN with a micron&#8208;sized three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure was developed with a facile NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted approach based on reduced reaction temperature. It exhibited superior advantages in improving the electrochemical performance of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes compared with the commercial two&#8208;dimensional (2D) h&#8208;BN.







Abstract
Powdery hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), as an important material for electrochemical energy storage, has been typically synthesized in bulk and one/two&#8208;dimensional (1/2D) nanostructured morphologies. However, until now, no method has been developed to synthesize powdery three&#8208;dimensional (3D) h&#8208;BN. This work introduces a novel NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize micron&#8208;sized 3D h&#8208;BN with a honeycomb&#8208;like structure and its proposed formation mechanism. We propose that NaCl acts as the template of 3D structure and promotes the nitridation reaction by adsorbing NH3. Glucose facilitates the homogeneous coating of boric acid onto the NaCl surface via functionalizing the NaCl surface. During the nitridation reaction, boron oxides (BO4 and BO3) form from a dehydration reaction of boric acid, which is then reduced to O2&#8208;B&#8208;N and O&#8208;B&#8208;N2 intermediates before finally being reduced to BN3 by NH3. When incorporated into polyethylene oxide&#8208;based electrolytes for Li metal batteries, 5&#8197;wt&#8201;% of 3D h&#8208;BN significantly enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Consequently, this composite electrolyte demonstrates superior electrochemical stability. It delivers 300&#8197;h of stable cycles in the Li//Li cell at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and retains 89&#8201;% of discharge capacity (138.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) after 100 cycles at 1&#8197;C in the LFP//Li full cell.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of TNA Protects DNA Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) accepts threose nucleic acid (TNA) nucleotide substrates, and catalyzes de novo synthesis of TNA on the 3&#8217; ends of DNA oligonucleotides. The TNA extension protects DNAs from nuclease digestion, and the DNA&#8208;TNA chimeras are used directly as staple strands in the self&#8208;assembly of DNA origami nanostructures (DONs). The TNA&#8208;shielded DONs are more biologically stable under the physiological environment.







Abstract
Xeno&#8208;nucleic acids (XNAs) are synthetic genetic polymers with improved biological stabilities and offer powerful molecular tools such as aptamers and catalysts. However, XNA application has been hindered by a very limited repertoire of tool enzymes, particularly those that enable de novo XNA synthesis. Here we report that terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) catalyzes untemplated threose nucleic acid (TNA) synthesis at the 3&#8217; terminus of DNA oligonucleotide, resulting in DNA&#8208;TNA chimera resistant to exonuclease digestion. Moreover, TdT&#8208;catalyzed TNA extension supports one&#8208;pot batch preparation of biostable chimeric oligonucleotides, which can be used directly as staple strands during self&#8208;assembly of DNA origami nanostructures (DONs). Such TNA&#8208;protected DONs show enhanced biological stability in the presence of exonuclease I, DNase&#8197;I and fetal bovine serum. This work not only expands the available enzyme toolbox for XNA synthesis and manipulation, but also provides a promising approach to fabricate DONs with improved stability under the physiological condition.

         <title>Concentrated Formic Acid from CO2 Electrolysis for Directly Driving Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The continuous production of pure formic acid solution with high concentration (2&#8197;M) for more than 300&#8197;h was achieved by using an MEA electrolyzer containing solid state electrolytes equipped with our developed moist heat ventilation collection system. The resultant formic acid could directly serve as the fuel for air&#8208;breathing formic acid fuel cells, which closed the carbon cycle loop of the formic acid economy.







Abstract
The production of formic acid via electrochemical CO2 reduction may serve as a key link for the carbon cycle in the formic acid economy, yet its practical feasibility is largely limited by the quantity and concentration of the product. Here we demonstrate continuous electrochemical CO2 reduction for formic acid production at 2&#8197;M at an industrial&#8208;level current densities (i.e., 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for 300&#8197;h on membrane electrode assembly using scalable lattice&#8208;distorted bismuth catalysts. The optimized catalysts also enable a Faradaic efficiency for formate of 94.2&#8201;% and a highest partial formate current density of 1.16&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, reaching a production rate of 21.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. To assess the practicality of this system, we perform a comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis and life cycle assessment, showing that our approach can potentially substitute conventional methyl formate hydrolysis for industrial formic acid production. Furthermore, the resultant formic acid serves as direct fuel for air&#8208;breathing formic acid fuel cells, boasting a power density of 55&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an exceptional thermal efficiency of 20.1&#8201;%.

         <title>Bimetallic Synergy Enables Silole Insertion into THF and the Synthesis of Erbium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>

A potassium silole salt reacts with erbium or yttrium cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl half&#8208;sandwich complexes via insertion of a silole silicon atom into a carbon&#8208;oxygen bond of THF. Analogous reactions involving a potassium germole salt reveal intact transfer of the germole to the rare&#8208;earth element, giving germole&#8208;ligated coordination polymers. The erbium&#8208;containing products are single&#8208;molecule magnets, and one example is characterized using high&#8208;frequency AC susceptometry.







Abstract
The potassium silole K2[SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2] reacts with [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4] (M=Er, Y; COT=cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl) in THF to give products that feature unprecedented insertion of the nucleophilic silicon centre into a carbon&#8208;oxygen bond of THF. The structure of the major product, [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(&#956;&#8208;L1)K]&#8734; (1M), consists of polymeric chains of sandwich complexes, where the spiro&#8208;bicyclic silapyran ligand [C4H8OSiC4(SiMe3)2Ph2]2&#8722; (L1) coordinates to potassium via the oxygen. The minor product [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(&#956;&#8208;L1)K(THF)]2 (2M) features coordination of the silapyran to the rare&#8208;earth metal. In forming 1M and 2M, silole insertion into THF only occurs in the presence of potassium and the rare&#8208;earth metal, highlighting the importance of bimetallic synergy. The lower nucleophilicity of germanium(II) leads to contrasting reactivity of the potassium germole K2[GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2] towards [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4], with intact transfer of the germole occurring to give the coordination polymers [{&#951;5&#8208;GeC4(SiMe3)2Me2}M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)K]&#8734; (3M). Despite the differences in reactivity induced by the group 14 heteroatom, the single&#8208;molecule magnet properties of 1Er, 2Er and 3Er are similar, with thermally activated relaxation occurring via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet, subject to effective energy barriers of 122, 80 and 91&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively. Compound 1Er is also analysed by high&#8208;frequency dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements up to 106&#8197;Hz.

         <title>Uncovering Photoelectronic and Photothermal Effects in Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work quantitatively disentangles the photoelectronic (PE) and photothermal (PT) effects in plasmon&#8208;mediated electrocatalysis using CO2RR on Ag NPs electrode as the model system. The PE effect prevails over a wide potential window for the CO2RR to CO, while the PT effect dominates the H2 evolution reaction at high overpotentials. It is revealed spectroscopically that the carbonyl&#8208;containing C1 intermediate applies to the plasmon&#8208;promoted CO2RR to CO process.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;mediated electrocatalysis that rests on the ability of coupling localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and electrochemical activation, emerges as an intriguing and booming area. However, its development seriously suffers from the entanglement between the photoelectronic and photothermal effects induced by the decay of plasmons, especially under the influence of applied potential. Herein, using LSPR&#8208;mediated CO2 reduction on Ag electrocatalyst as a model system, we quantitatively uncover the dominant photoelectronic effect on CO2 reduction reaction over a wide potential window, in contrast to the leading photothermal effect on H2 evolution reaction at relatively negative potentials. The excitation of LSPR selectively enhances the CO faradaic efficiency (17&#8208;fold at &#8722;0.6&#8197;VRHE) and partial current density (100&#8208;fold at &#8722;0.6&#8197;VRHE), suppressing the undesired H2 faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) reveals a plasmon&#8208;promoted formation of the bridge&#8208;bonded CO on Ag surface via a carbonyl&#8208;containing C1 intermediate. The present work demonstrates a deep mechanistic understanding of selective regulation of interfacial reactions by coupling plasmons and electrochemistry.

         <title>Adaptisorption of Nonporous Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptisortion tailored for nonporous polymers has been achieved by dative boron&#8208;nitrogen bonding and host&#8208;guest binding. The coupling of these two components enables nonporous polymeric crystals to adsorb molecules from solution and undergo recrystallization as thermodynamically favored crystals.







Abstract
Although our knowledge and understanding of adsorptions in natural and artificial systems has increased dramatically during the past century, adsorption associated with nonporous polymers remains something of a mystery, hampering applications. Here we demonstrate a model system for adaptisorption of nonporous polymers, wherein dative B&#8722;N bonds and host&#8208;guest binding units act as the kinetic and thermodynamic components, respectively. The coupling of these two components enables nonporous polymer crystals to adsorb molecules from solution and undergo recrystallization as thermodynamically favored crystals. Adaptisorption of nonporous polymer crystals not only extends the types of adsorption in which the sorbate molecules are integrated in a precise and orderly manner in the sorbent systems, but also provides a facile and accurate approach to the construction of polymeric materials with precise architectures and integrated functions.

         <title>Staggered Assembly of a Dimeric Au13 Cluster: Impacts on Coupling of Geometric Isomerism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first completely staggered configuration of a di&#8208;superatomic Au25 cluster was solved with atomic precision. The significant torsion angle induces changes in electron coupling and complicates the relaxation pathway of electrons in the excited state when compared with the parallel eclipsed configuration.







Abstract
The specific states of aggregation of metal atoms in sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized gold clusters are related to the different quantum confinement volumes of electrons, leading to novel optical and electronic properties. These volumes can be tuned by changing the relative positions of the gold atoms to generate isomers. Studying the isomeric gold core and the electron coupling between the basic units is fundamentally important for nanoelectronic devices and luminescence; however, appropriate cases are lacking. In this study, the structure of the first staggered di&#8208;superatomic Au25&#8208;S was solved using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The optical properties of Au25&#8208;S were studied by comparing with eclipsed Au25&#8208;E. From Au25&#8208;E to Au25&#8208;S, changes in the electronic structures occurred, resulting in significantly different optical absorptions originating from the coupling between the two Au13 modules. Au25&#8208;S shows a longer electron decay lifetime of 307.7&#8197;ps before populating the lowest triplet emissive state, compared to 1.29&#8197;ps for Au25&#8208;E. The experimental and theoretical results show that variations in the geometric isomerism lead to distinct photophysical processes owing to isomerism&#8208;dependent electronic coupling. This study offers new insights into the connection between the geometric isomerism of nanosized building blocks and the optical properties of their assemblies, opening new possibilities for constructing function&#8208;specific nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;The specific states of aggregation of metal atoms in sub-nanometer-sized gold clusters are related to the different quantum confinement volumes of electrons, leading to novel optical and electronic properties. These volumes can be tuned by changing the relative positions of the gold atoms to generate isomers. Studying the isomeric gold core and the electron coupling between the basic units is fundamentally important for nanoelectronic devices and luminescence; however, appropriate cases are lacking. In this study, the structure of the first staggered di-superatomic Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; was solved using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The optical properties of Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; were studied by comparing with eclipsed Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. From Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; to Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, changes in the electronic structures occurred, resulting in significantly different optical absorptions originating from the coupling between the two Au&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; modules. Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; shows a longer electron decay lifetime of 307.7&#8197;ps before populating the lowest triplet emissive state, compared to 1.29&#8197;ps for Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. The experimental and theoretical results show that variations in the geometric isomerism lead to distinct photophysical processes owing to isomerism-dependent electronic coupling. This study offers new insights into the connection between the geometric isomerism of nanosized building blocks and the optical properties of their assemblies, opening new possibilities for constructing function-specific nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular ortho Photocycloaddition Reactions of 2&#8208;Acetonaphthones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular ortho photocycloaddition of 2&#8208;acetonaphthones has been achieved with high enantioselectivity. The catalytic use of a chiral Lewis acid was critical for the success of the reaction and its mode of action has been elucidated by mechanistic experiments and calculations. The primary photocycloaddition products underwent photochemically or thermally a variety of consecutive reactions.







Abstract
2&#8208;Acetonaphthones, which bear an alkenyl group tethered to its C1 carbon atom via an oxygen atom, were found to undergo an enantioselective intramolecular ortho photocycloaddition reaction. A chiral oxazaborolidine Lewis acid leads to a bathochromic absorption shift of the substrate and enables an efficient enantioface differentiation. Visible light irradiation (&#955;=450&#8197;nm) triggers the reaction which is tolerant of various groups at almost any position except carbon atom C8 (16 examples, 53&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, 80&#8211;97&#8201;% ee). Consecutive reactions were explored including a sensitized rearrangement to tetrahydrobiphenylenes, which occurred with full retention of configuration. Evidence was collected that the catalytic photocycloaddition occurs via triplet intermediates, and the binding mode of the acetonaphthone to the chiral Lewis acid was elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Coupling Electron Transfer and Redox Site in Boranil Covalent Organic Framework Toward Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metalloporphyrin&#8208;based boranil covalent organic framework (M&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2) photocatalysts are fabricated through the post&#8208;functionalization strategy. Density functional theory and experimental studies unveiled the synergistic effect of metal (Ni) and BF2 moiety that alter the electronic band structures and charge carrier mobility, leading to a lower energy barrier for boosting oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The efficient polymeric semiconducting photocatalyst for solar&#8208;driven sluggish kinetics with multielectron transfer oxygen evolution has spurred scientific interest. However, existing photocatalysts limited by &#960;&#8208;conjugations, visible&#8208;light harvest, and charge transfer often compromise the O2 production rate. Herein, we introduced an alternative strategy involving a boranil functionalized&#8208;based fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated ordered donor and acceptor (D&#8211;A) covalent organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2) photocatalyst. The co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2 exhibits an excellent ~11&#8208;fold photocatalytic water oxidation rate, reaching 1404&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation compared to pristine Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF (123&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) alone and surpasses to reported organic frameworks counterpart. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the push/pull mechanism (metalloporphyrin/BF2) is responsible for the appropriate light&#8208;harvesting properties and extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation through chelating BF2 moieties. This strategy benefits in narrowing band structure, improving photo&#8208;induced charge separation, and prolonged charge recombination. Further, the lower spin magnetic moment of M&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2 and the closer d&#8208;band center of metal sites toward the Fermi level lead to a lower energy barrier for *O intermediate. Reveal the potential of the functionalization strategy and opens up an alternative approach for engineering future photocatalysts in energy conversion applications.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes Embedding Azulene and Stone&#8208;Wales Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>

We report the on&#8208;surface synthesis of non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing different combinations of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Their structure and electronic properties were investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations.







Abstract
The incorporation of non&#8208;benzenoid motifs in graphene nanostructures significantly impacts their properties, making them attractive for applications in carbon&#8208;based electronics. However, understanding how specific non&#8208;benzenoid structures influence their properties remains limited, and further investigations are needed to fully comprehend their implications. Here, we report an on&#8208;surface synthetic strategy toward fabricating non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing different combinations of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Their structure and electronic properties were investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations. After thermal activation of the precursor P on the Au(111) surface, we detected two major nanographene products. Nanographene Aa&#8722;a embeds two azulene units formed through oxidative ring&#8208;closure of methyl substituents, while Aa&#8722;s contains one azulene unit and one Stone&#8208;Wales defect, formed by the combination of oxidative ring&#8208;closure and skeletal ring&#8208;rearrangement reactions. Aa&#8722;a exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with the highest magnetic exchange coupling reported up to date for a non&#8208;benzenoid containing nanographene, coexisting with side&#8208;products with closed shell configurations resulted from the combination of ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;rearragement reactions (Ba&#8722;a, Ba&#8722;s, Bs&#8208;a and Bs&#8722;s). Our results provide insights into the single gold atom assisted synthesis of novel NGs containing non&#8208;benzenoid motifs and their tailored electronic/magnetic properties.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Aminotetralins via [4+2] Annulation of Aldimines with Alkenes by Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation has been achieved for the first time by the use of half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts with different metals, providing an efficient protocol for the divergent synthesis of both trans and cis diastereoisomers of the multi&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminotetralin derivatives from readily available aldimines and alkenes.







Abstract
The search for efficient and selective methods for the divergent synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted aminotetralins is of much interest and importance. We report herein for the first time the diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of 2&#8208;methyl aromatic aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation by half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts, which constitutes an efficient route for the divergent synthesis of both trans and cis diastereoisomers of multi&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminotetralin derivatives from readily accessible aldimines and alkenes. The use of a scandium catalyst bearing a sterically demanding cyclopentadienyl ligand such as C5Me4SiMe3 or C5Me5 exclusively afforded the trans&#8208;selective annulation products in the reaction of aldimines with styrenes and aliphatic alkenes. In contrast, the analogous yttrium catalyst, whose metal ion size is larger than that of scandium, yielded the cis&#8208;selective annulation products. This protocol features 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility.

     alt="Divergent Synthesis of Multi-Substituted Aminotetralins via [4+2] Annulation of Aldimines with Alkenes by Rare-Earth-Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H activation has been achieved for the first time by the use of half-sandwich rare-earth catalysts with different metals, providing an efficient protocol for the divergent synthesis of both &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; diastereoisomers of the multi-substituted 1-aminotetralin derivatives from readily available aldimines and alkenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for efficient and selective methods for the divergent synthesis of multi-substituted aminotetralins is of much interest and importance. We report herein for the first time the diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of 2-methyl aromatic aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H activation by half-sandwich rare-earth catalysts, which constitutes an efficient route for the divergent synthesis of both &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; diastereoisomers of multi-substituted 1-aminotetralin derivatives from readily accessible aldimines and alkenes. The use of a scandium catalyst bearing a sterically demanding cyclopentadienyl ligand such as C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; exclusively afforded the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-selective annulation products in the reaction of aldimines with styrenes and aliphatic alkenes. In contrast, the analogous yttrium catalyst, whose metal ion size is larger than that of scandium, yielded the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-selective annulation products. This protocol features 100&#8201;% atom-efficiency, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. The reaction mechanisms have been elucidated by kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments and the isolation and transformations of some key reaction intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe for the High&#8208;Spatiotemporal&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Copper(II) Dynamics in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that in vivo Cu2+ dynamics in the brain can be spatiotemporal visualized using the rational designed BBB&#8208;permeable ratiometric photoacoustic probe as the imaging agent. Taking advantages of high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution imaging abilities of the probe, we have revealed the detailed alternations in Cu2+ levels in the Parkinson's disease mouse brain during both the disease progression and drug intervention at micron&#8208;resolution.







Abstract
Copper dysmetabolism is associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, making high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution imaging of Cu2+ in the brain essential for understanding the underlying pathophysiological processes. Nevertheless, the current probes encounter obstacles in crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and providing high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution in deep tissues. Herein, we present a photoacoustic probe capable of imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain with high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution. The probe demonstrates selective ratiometric and reversible responses to Cu2+, while also efficiently crossing the BBB. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully visualized Cu2+ in the brain of Parkinson's disease (PD) model mouse with a remarkable micron&#8208;level resolution. The imaging results revealed a significant increase in Cu2+ levels in the cerebral cortex as PD progresses, highlighting the close association between Cu2+ alternations in the region and the disease. We also demonstrated that the probe can be used to monitor changes in Cu2+ distribution in the PD model mouse brain during L&#8208;dopa intervention. Mechanism studies suggest that the copper dyshomeostasis in the PD mouse brain was dominated by the expression levels of divalent metal transporter 1. The application of our probe in imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain offers valuable insights into the copper&#8208;related molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Development of Mannosylated Lipid Nanoparticles for mRNA Cancer Vaccine with High Antigen Presentation Efficiency and Immunomodulatory Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to promote the antitumor efficacy of mRNA vaccines, sweet lipid nanoparticles (STLNPs&#8208;Man) are developed by incorporating a mannosylated ionizable lipid to enhance the uptake by DCs through the mannose receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, STLNPs&#8208;Man exhibits the ability to downregulate the expression of cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 on T cells through the blockade of CD206/CD45 axis to further potentiate the antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Insufficient accumulation of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)&#8208;based mRNA vaccines in antigen presenting cells remains a key barrier to eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. Herein, we develop dendritic cells (DCs) targeting LNPs by taking advantage of mannose receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Efficient delivery of mRNA to DCs is achieved in vitro and in vivo utilizing the sweet LNPs (STLNPs&#8208;Man). Intramuscular injection of mRNA vaccine (STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA) results in a four&#8208;fold higher uptake by DCs in comparison with commercially used LNPs. Benefiting from its DCs targeting ability, STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA significantly promotes the antitumor performances, showing a comparable therapeutic efficacy by using one&#8208;fifth of the injection dosage as the vaccine prepared from normal LNPs, thus remarkably avoiding the side effects brought by conventional mRNA vaccines. More intriguingly, STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA exhibits the ability to downregulate the expression of cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 on T cells due to the blockade of CD206/CD45 axis, showing brilliant potentials in promoting antitumor efficacy combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

Direct room temperature dimerization of carbon monoxide by anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) has been reported to quantitatively yield (E)&#8208;ethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(olate) bridged mesoionic carbene (iMIC) lithium compounds, COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2.

We report the room temperature dimerization of carbon monoxide mediated by C4/C5&#8208;vicinal anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) (ADC = ArC{(Dipp)NC}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph, DMP (4&#8208;Me2NC6H4), Bp (4&#8208;PhC6H4)) to yield (E)&#8208;ethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(olate) (i.e. &#8722;O&#8722;C=C&#8722;O&#8722; = COen) bridged mesoionic carbene (iMIC) lithium compounds COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2 (COen&#8208;[iMIC]2 = [ArC{(Dipp)NC}2(CO)]2) in quantitative yields. COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2 are highly colored stable solids, exhibit a strikingly small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, and readily undergo 2e&#8208;oxidations with selenium, CuCl (or CuCl2), and AgCl to afford the dinuclear compounds COon&#8208;[(iMIC)E]2 (E = Se, CuCl, AgCl) featuring a 1,2&#8208;dione bridged neutral bis&#8208;iMIC (i.e. COon&#8208;[iMIC]2 = [ArC{(Dipp)NC}2(C=O)]2). COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2 undergo redox&#8208;neutral salt metathesis reactions with LiAlH4 and (Et2O)2BeBr2 and afford COen&#8208;[(iMIC)AlH2]2 and COen&#8208;[(iMIC)BeBr]2, in which the dianionic COen&#8208;moiety remains intact. All compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Stereoelectronic properties of COon&#8208;[iMIC]2 are quantified by experimental and theoretical methods.

         <title>Bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; Reaction&#8208;Triggered Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Combined with Released Lonidamine for Enhanced Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>

We reported the application of bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; (BCR) reaction between prodrug iminosydnone&#8208;lonidamine (ImLND) and dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) to form highly photothermal&#8208;active nanoaggregates with synergistic drug release. The reactants of BCR reaction were grafted on surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and was proven both in vitro and in vivo to robustly enhance the therapeutic outcome of photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Cancer has been the most deadly disease, and 13 million cancer casualties are estimated to occur each year by 2030. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted great interest due to its high spatiotemporal controllability and noninvasiveness. Due to the trade&#8208;off between particle size and photothermal efficiency of AuNPs, rational design is needed to realize aggregation of AuNPs into larger particles with desirable NIR adsorption in tumor site. Exploiting the bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; (BCR) reaction between iminosydnone and cycloalkyne, aggregation of AuNPs can be achieved and attractively accompanied by the release of chemotherapeutic drug purposed to photothermal synergizing. We synthesize iminosydnone&#8208;lonidamine (ImLND) as a prodrug and choose dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) as the trigger of BCR reaction. A PEGylated AuNPs&#8208;based two&#8208;component nanoplatform consisting of prodrug&#8208;loaded AuNPs&#8208;ImLND and tumor&#8208;targeting peptide RGD&#8208;conjugated AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD is designed. In the therapeutic regimen, AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD are intravenously injected first for tumor&#8208;specific enrichment and retention. Once the arrival of AuNPs&#8208;ImLND injected later at tumor site, highly photothermally active nanoaggregates of AuNPs are formed via the BCR reaction between ImLND and DBCO. The simultaneous release of lonidamine further enhanced the therapeutic performance by sensitizing cancer cells to PTT.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Conjugated Electrolytes as Biomimetics of Lipid Bilayers for In Vivo Liposome Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the existing dye leakage drawback, lipophilic cyanine dyes are still widely used to track liposomes and other lipid systems. In this study, we have revolutionized the lipophilic dye structure by mimicking the entire lipid bilayer, rather than a single lipid molecule. The new conjugated electrolyte&#8208;based probes exhibit excellent compatibility with the lipid membrane, coupled with superior and readily adjustable photophysical properties.







Abstract
Liposomes serve as promising and versatile vehicles for drug delivery. Tracking these nanosized vesicles, particularly in vivo, is crucial for understanding their pharmacokinetics. This study introduces the design and synthesis of three new conjugated electrolyte (CE) molecules, which emit in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), facilitating deeper tissue penetration. Additionally, these CEs, acting as biomimetics of lipid bilayers, demonstrate superior compatibility with lipid membranes compared to commonly used carbocyanine dyes like DiR. To counteract the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, CEs employ a twisted backbone, as such their fluorescence intensities can effectively enhance after a fluorophore multimerization strategy. Notably, a &#8220;passive&#8221; method was employed to integrate CEs into liposomes during the liposome formation, and membrane incorporation efficiency was significantly promoted to nearly 100%. To validate the in vivo tracking capability, the CE&#8208;containing liposomes were functionalized with cyclic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (cRGD) peptides, serving as tumor&#8208;targeting ligands. Clear fluorescent images visualizing tumor site in living mice were captured by collecting the NIR&#8208;II emission. Uniquely, these CEs exhibit additional emission peak in visible region, enabling in vitro subcellular analysis using routine confocal microscopy. These results underscore the potential of CEs as a new&#8208;generation of membrane&#8208;targeting probes to facilitate the liposome&#8208;based medicine research.

         <title>Rationalizing the Influence of the Binding Affinity on the Activity of Phosphoserine Phosphatases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activity of diverse phosphoserine phosphatases was maximized around an intermediate binding affinity of Km=0.5&#8197;mM, supporting the applicability of the Sabatier principle towards enzymes in general. However, there was also a large deviation between theoretical and experimental activity. Therefore, binding energy is an important parameter, but other physicochemical parameters must also be considered to maximize enzymatic activity.







Abstract
The Sabatier principle states that catalytic activity can be maximized when the substrate binding affinity is neither too strong nor too weak. Recent studies have shown that the activity of several hydrolases is maximized at intermediate values of the binding affinity (Michaelis&#8211;Menten constant: Km). However, it remains unclear whether this concept of artificial catalysis is applicable to enzymes in general, especially for those which have evolved under different reaction environments. Herein, we show that the activity of phosphoserine phosphatase is also enhanced at an intermediate Km value of approximately 0.5&#8197;mM. Within our dataset, the variation of Km by three orders of magnitude accounted for a roughly 18&#8208;fold variation in the activity. Owing to the high phylogenetic and physiological diversity of our dataset, our results support the importance of optimizing Km for enzymes in general. On the other hand, a 77&#8208;fold variation in the activity was attributed to other physicochemical parameters, such as the Arrhenius prefactor of kcat, and could not be explained by the Sabatier principle. Therefore, while tuning the binding affinity according to the Sabatier principle is an important consideration, the Km value is only one of many physicochemical parameters which must be optimized to maximize enzymatic activity.

         <title>Enabling Stable and Low&#8208;Strain Lithium Plating/Stripping with 2D Layered Transition Metal Carbides by Forming Li&#8208;Zipped MXenes and a Li Halide&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>

A novel &#8220;electrochemical scissor&#8221; and &#8220;Li zipper&#8221;&#8208;driven interlayer Li plating protocol in 2D layered transition metal carbides (MXenes) is proposed, where lithium serves as a &#8220;zipper&#8221; to reunite the adjacent MXene back to MAX&#8208;like phase to markedly enhance the bulk phase&#8208;structural stability, and a Li halide&#8208;rich SEI is formed by &#8220;electrochemical scissor&#8221; removing the terminals of MXenes to maintain the stability and high Li+ diffusivity of SEI.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials demonstrate prominent advantage in regulating lithium plating/stripping behavior by confining lithium diffusion/plating within interlayer gaps. However, achieving effective interlayer confined lithium diffusion/plating without compromising the stability of bulk&#8208;structural and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) remains a considerable challenge. This paper presents an electrochemical scissor and lithium zipper&#8208;driven protocol for realizing interlayer confined lithium plating with pretty&#8208;low strain and volume change. In this protocol, lithium serves as a &#8220;zipper&#8221; to reunite the adjacent MXene back to MAX&#8208;like phase to markedly enhance the structural stability, and a lithium halide&#8208;rich SEI is formed by electrochemically removing the terminals of halogenated MXenes to maintain the stability and rapid lithium ions diffusion of SEI. When the Ti3C2I2 serves as the host for lithium plating, the average coulomb efficiency exceeds 97.0&#8201;% after 320 lithium plating/stripping cycles in conventional ester electrolyte. Furthermore, a full cell comprising of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and Ti3C2I2@Li exhibits a capacity retention rate of 73.4&#8201;% after 200 cycles even under high cathode mass&#8208;loading (20&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.4. Our findings advance the understanding of interlayer confined lithium plating in 2D layered materials and provide a new direction in regulating lithium and other metal plating/stripping behaviors.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Mono&#8208;N&#8208;Methylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines without the Requirement of External High&#8208;Hydrogen Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy enables the selective synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylated aliphatic primary amines, including deuterium&#8208;labelled drugs. This innovative approach combines an earth&#8208;abundant manganese catalyst with a weak base, resulting in a practical and sustainable protocol for mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylation. By effectively inhibiting the formation of formamide byproducts, it eliminates the need for external high&#8208;pressure hydrogen.







Abstract
The synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylated aliphatic primary amines has traditionally been challenging, requiring noble metal catalysts and high&#8208;pressure H2 for achieving satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we developed an approach for the selective coupling of methanol and aliphatic primary amines, without high&#8208;pressure hydrogen, using a manganese&#8208;based catalyst. Remarkably, up to 98&#8201;% yields with broad substrate scope were achieved at low catalyst loadings. Notably, due to the weak base&#8208;catalyzed alcoholysis of formamide intermediates, our novel protocol not only obviates the addition of high&#8208;pressure H2 but also prevents side secondary N&#8208;methylation, supported by control experiments and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Probing a Major DNA Weakness: Resolving the Groove and Sequence Selectivity of the Diimine Complex &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Major changes&#8212;the crystallisation of a junction forming DNA decamer with &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+ shows three different sequence&#8208;selective binding modes, and displacement of Sr2+ from the minor groove to the interhelical space.







Abstract
The grooves of DNA provide recognition sites for many nucleic acid binding proteins and anticancer drugs such as the covalently binding cisplatin. Here we report a crystal structure showing, for the first time, groove selectivity by an intercalating ruthenium complex. The complex &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+, where phi=9,10&#8208;phenanthrenediimine, is bound to the DNA decamer duplex d(CCGGTACCGG)2. The structure shows that the metal complex is symmetrically bound in the major groove at the central TA/TA step, and asymmetrically bound in the minor groove at the adjacent GG/CC steps. A third type of binding links the strands, in which each terminal cytosine base stacks with one phen ligand. The overall binding stoichiometry is four Ru complexes per duplex. Complementary biophysical measurements confirm the binding preference for the &#923;&#8208;enantiomer and show a high affinity for TA/TA steps and, more generally, TA&#8208;rich sequences. A striking enantiospecific elevation of melting temperatures is found for oligonucleotides which include the TATA box sequence.

         <title>Photoinduced Precise Synthesis of Diatomic Ir1Pd1&#8208;In2O3 for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol via Angstrom&#8208;Scale&#8208;Distance Dependent Synergistic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel photo&#8208;induced neighbour&#8208;deposition strategy to precisely synthesize the heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom Ir1Pd1&#8208;In2O3(CP&#8208;PD) catalyst. The strong synergistic effect in an angstrom scale endows adjacent diatomic Ir&#8208;Pd sites with extraordinary catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.







Abstract
The atomically dispersed metal catalysts with full atomic utilization and well&#8208;defined site structure hold great promise for various catalytic reactions. However, the single metallic site limits the comprehensive reaction performance in most reactions. Here, we demonstrated a photo&#8208;induced neighbour&#8208;deposition strategy for the precise synthesis of diatomic Ir1Pd1 on In2O3 applied for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The proximity synergism between diatomic sites enabled a striking promotion in both CO2 conversion (10.5&#8201;%) and methanol selectivity (97&#8201;%) with good stability of 100&#8197;h run. It resulted in record&#8208;breaking space&#8208;time yield to methanol (187.1&#8197;gMeOH&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8197;hour&#8722;1). The promotional effect mainly originated from stronger CO2 adsorption on Ir site with assistance of H&#8208;spillover from Pd site, thus leading to a lower energy barrier for *HCOO pathway. It was confirmed that this synergistic effect strongly depended on the dual&#8208;site distance in an angstrom scale, which was attributed to weaker *H spillover and less electron transfer from Pd to Ir site as the Pd&#8208;to&#8208;Ir distance increased. The average dual&#8208;site distance was evaluated by our firstly proposed photoelectric model. Thus, this study introduced a pioneering strategy to precisely synthesize homonuclear/heteronuclear diatomic catalysts for facilitating the desired reaction route via diatomic synergistic catalysis.

         <title>Engineering Hydroxylase Activity, Selectivity, and Stability for a Scalable Concise Synthesis of a Key Intermediate to Belzutifan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alpha&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) are promising biocatalysts for selective oxidations, but their practical use is limited by substrate scope and stability. We engineered an &#945;KGD to hydroxylate a non&#8208;native substrate with total turnovers exceeding those of reported &#945;KGDs. The engineered &#945;KGD enabled direct synthesis of a hydroxy&#8208;indanone to replace the previous five step synthesis en route to the oncology treatment belzutifan.







Abstract
Biocatalytic oxidations are an emerging technology for selective C&#8722;H bond activation. While promising for a range of selective oxidations, practical use of enzymes catalyzing aerobic hydroxylation is presently limited by their substrate scope and stability under industrially relevant conditions. Here, we report the engineering and practical application of a non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase for the direct stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective hydroxylation of a non&#8208;native fluoroindanone en route to the oncology treatment belzutifan, replacing a five&#8208;step chemical synthesis with a direct enantioselective hydroxylation. Mechanistic studies indicated that formation of the desired product was limited by enzyme stability and product overoxidation, with these properties subsequently improved by directed evolution, yielding a biocatalyst capable of &gt;15,000 total turnovers. Highlighting the industrial utility of this biocatalyst, the high&#8208;yielding, green, and efficient oxidation was demonstrated at kilogram scale for the synthesis of belzutifan.

What makes a chemistry&#8208;based innovation challenge successful and how can activities for scientific outreach be improved? In this Viewpoint we discuss the Compound Challenge&#8212;a global retrosynthesis competition that has resonated within the scientific community. Through examining the feedback of the participants, we gain valuable insight and lessons into what makes an open innovation activity successful and what pitfalls to avoid.







Abstract
For five years now, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany has hosted The Compound Challenge&#8212;a global retrosynthesis competition. When the event kicked off in 2018 on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of the company, no one could have predicted the path it would take&#8212;from a novel competition to a pivotal event within the synthetic chemistry community. But what makes the Compound Challenge tick and what drives its popularity? And, more importantly, what lessons can be taken from the Compound Challenge and applied to other challenges in scientific education and outreach? In this Viewpoint Article we will tell the story of the Compound Challenge, from its inception to its current status. Through examining feedback following each of its iterations, we begin to define what makes an open innovation challenge so compelling. It is our hope that educators, leaders, and innovators will be able to learn from our successes as well as our mistakes and apply these lessons to their future outreach activities.

A festive electrochemistry&#8208;informed neural network (ECINN) is demonstrated by Richard G. Compton et&#8197;al.&#160;(e202315937) in their Communication. The ECINN has three subnets, each made of three layers of &#8220;Chinese lantern&#8221; neurons, embedding diverse electrochemical knowledge including electrochemical kinetics to mass transport to solve experimental voltammograms and hence parameter estimation. Decorated with auspicious clouds and China&#8242;s earliest dragon from Neolithic Hongshan Culture, the cover celebrates the Year of the Dragon.

A multi&#8208;function biosensing system based on supersandwich DNA probes (SSW&#8208;DNA) and solid&#8208;state nanochannels with hydrophobic partition modification was developed by Yu Huang, Fan Xia et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316434). Based on the disassembly of SSW&#8208;DNA, during the target recognition, the on&#8208;site detection is achieved by introducing fluorescent molecules on SSW&#8208;DNA and using test strips. Since the entire detection system only involves one target identification process, it introduces only one potential error propagation, thereby reducing the overall risk of errors in the entire qualitative and quantitative detection process.

DNA binding by intercalation , showing both sequence and enantiospecificity, of a ruthenium diimine complex, is reported by Christine Cardin, Andrew Kellett et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202318863). The right&#8208;handed helix seen in the crystal structure shows variable degrees of twisting, including the first intercalation by a ruthenium complex from the DNA major groove. In solution, the lambda enantiomer was found to be more stabilising with a range of DNA sequences.

Dual&#8208;atom catalysts present a promising catalytic platform for improving activity and selectivity simultaneously. In their Research Article (e202401168), Xiaohao Liu et&#8197;al. develop a universal &#8220;photo&#8208;induced neighbour&#8208;deposition&#8221; strategy to precisely construct In2O3&#8208;supported diatomic Ir&#8208;Pd sites. The strong synergism on the Angstrom scale accelerates *H spillover and electron transfer from Pd to Ir. This as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a record&#8208;breaking performance for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.

         <title>Redox Out of the Box: Catalytic Versatility Across NAD(P)H&#8208;Dependent Oxidoreductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent reductases have been established as chemoselective biocatalysts for the asymmetric reduction of C=O, C=N, and C=C bonds. Serendipity, screening, and engineering unearthed that the ability to convert distinct electrophiles is shared by numerous enzyme families. This review sheds light on this underexplored facet of NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent reductases and highlights the catalytic versatility of these enzymes.







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of double bonds using NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases has proven to be an efficient tool for the synthesis of important chiral molecules in research and on industrial scale. These enzymes are commercially available in screening kits for the reduction of C=O (ketones), C=C (activated alkenes), or C=N bonds (imines). Recent reports, however, indicate that the ability to accommodate multiple reductase activities on distinct C=X bonds occurs in different enzyme classes, either natively or after mutagenesis. This challenges the common perception of highly selective oxidoreductases for one type of electrophilic substrate. Consideration of this underexplored potential in enzyme screenings and protein engineering campaigns may contribute to the identification of complementary biocatalytic processes for the synthesis of chiral compounds. This review will contribute to a global understanding of the promiscuous behavior of NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases on C=X bond reduction and inspire future discoveries with respect to unconventional biocatalytic routes in asymmetric synthesis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on strategies for C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers, amines and amides over heterogeneous photocatalysts including inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconductors and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) photocatalysts.







Abstract
Activation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is extremely attractive but remains a great challenge. Heterogeneous photocatalysis offers a promising and sustainable approach for C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and has been fast developing in the past decade. This Minireview focuses on mechanism and strategies for heterogeneous photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. After introducing mechanistic insights, heterogeneous photocatalytic strategies for C(sp3)&#8722;H activation including precise design of active sites, regulation of reactive radical species, improving charge separation and reactor innovations are discussed. In addition, recent advances in C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers, amines and amides by heterogeneous photocatalysis are summarized. Lastly, challenges and opportunities are outlined to encourage more efforts for the development of this exciting and promising field.

         <title>Nanocatalytic Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we discuss how nanocatalysts specifically regulate anti&#8208;tumor immunity through the tumor microenvironment, and the key is to use unique components or redox status in solid tumors to initiate catalytic reactions for selective release of immune regulators at the tumor site. The biological mechanism of nanocatalytic reaction in regulating antitumor immunity was discussed in detail and the prospects were prospected.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for human being to defeat cancer. Although existing immunotherapy regimens (CAR&#8208;T, etc.) have made breakthroughs in the treatments of hematological cancer and few solid tumors such as melanoma, the therapeutic efficacy on most solid tumors is still far from being satisfactory. In recent years, the researches on tumor immunotherapy based on nanocatalytic materials are under rapid development, and significant progresses have been made. Nanocatalytic medicine has been demonstrated to be capable of overcoming the limitations of current clinicnal treatments by using toxic chemodrugs, and exhibits highly attractive advantages over traditional therapies, such as the enhanced and sustained therapeutic efficacy based on the durable catalytic activity, remarkably reduced harmful side&#8208;effects without using traditional toxic chemodrugs, and so on. Most recently, nanocatalytic medicine has been introduced in the immune&#8208;regulation for disease treatments, especially, in the immunoactivation for tumor therapies. This article presents the most recent progresses in immune&#8208;response activations by nanocatalytic medicine&#8208;initiated chemical reactions for tumor immunotherapy, and elucidates the mechanism of nanocatalytic medicines in regulating anti&#8208;tumor immunity. By reviewing the current research progress in the emerging field, this review will further highlight the great potential and broad prospects of nanocatalysis&#8208;based anti&#8208;tumor immune&#8208;therapeutics.

         <title>Sonogenetics for Monitoring and Modulating Biomolecular Function by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonogenetics is an evolving field in which ultrasound is used for the molecular control of cellular functions at different levels, thereby opening new avenues in biological and medical research. Here we discuss sonogenetic mediators and review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic methods utilizing thermal and mechanical ultrasonic effects as well as mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems and ultrasound biomolecular imaging.







Abstract
Ultrasound technology, synergistically harnessed with genetic engineering and chemistry concepts, has started to open the gateway to the remarkable realm of sonogenetics&#8212;a pioneering paradigm for remotely orchestrating cellular functions at the molecular level. This fusion not only enables precisely targeted imaging and therapeutic interventions, but also advances our comprehension of mechanobiology to unparalleled depths. Sonogenetic tools harness mechanical force within small tissue volumes while preserving the integrity of the surrounding physiological environment, reaching depths of up to tens of centimeters with high spatiotemporal precision. These capabilities circumvent the inherent physical limitations of alternative in vivo control methods such as optogenetics and magnetogenetics. In this review, we first discuss mechanosensitive ion channels, the most commonly utilized sonogenetic mediators, in both mammalian and non&#8208;mammalian systems. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic approaches that leverage thermal or mechanical features of ultrasonic waves. Additionally, we explore strategies centered around the design of mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems. Furthermore, we delve into the realm of ultrasound imaging of biomolecular function, encompassing the utilization of gas vesicles and acoustic reporter genes. Finally, we shed light on limitations and challenges of sonogenetics and present a perspective on the future of this promising technology.

         <title>Designing Efficient Single Metal Atom Biocatalysts at the Atomic Structure Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we highlight the design of single metal atom catalysts at the atomic structure level by focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and briefly discuss their biological catalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Various nanomaterials as biocatalysts could be custom&#8208;designed and modified to precisely match the specific microenvironment of diseases, showing a promise in achieving effective therapy outcomes. Compared to conventional biocatalysts, single metal atom catalysts (SMACs) with maximized atom utilization through well&#8208;defined structures offer enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. Currently, there is still a gap in a comprehensive overview of the connection between structures and biocatalytic mechanisms of SMACs. Therefore, it is crucial to deeply investigate the role of SMACs in biocatalysis from the atomic structure level and to elucidate their potential mechanisms in biocatalytic processes. In this minireview, we summarize catalysis regulation methods of SMACs at the atomic structure level, focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and briefly discuss biocatalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.

         <title>Bidirectional Neuronal Actuation by Uncaging with Violet and Green Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have created a chromatically complimentary pair of caging chromophores from coumarin&#8208;102, by thionation of the exocyclic julolidine oxygen. This enabled wavelength selective photolysis of thio&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102&#8208;GABA on neurons with green versus violet light. When partnered with coumarin&#8208;102&#8208;Glu, violet and green light could be used for bidirectional neuronal actuation.







Abstract
We have developed a photochemical protecting group that enables wavelength selective uncaging using green versus violet light. Change of the exocyclic oxygen of the laser dye coumarin&#8208;102 to sulfur, gave thio&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102, a new chromophore with an absorption ratio at 503/402&#8197;nm of 37. Photolysis of thio&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102 caged &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid was found to be highly wavelength selective on neurons, with normalized electrical responses &gt;100&#8208;fold higher in the green versus violet channel. When partnered with coumarin&#8208;102 caged glutamate, we could use whole cell violet and green irradiation to fire and block neuronal action potentials with complete orthogonality. Localized irradiation of different dendritic segments, each connected to a neuronal cell body, in concert with 3&#8208;dimenional Ca2+ imaging, revealed that such inputs could function independently. Chemical signaling in living cells always involves a complex balance of multiple pathways, use of (thio)&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102 caged compounds will enable arbitrarily timed flashes of green and violet light to interrogate two independent pathways simultaneously.

         <title>Discovering Electrochemistry with an Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN) embeds chemistry prior knowledge including the Butler&#8208;Volmer, Nernst and Diffusion equations to discover electrode kinetics and mass transport parameter simultaneously from sparse experiments. ECINN seamlessly integrates mass transport and BV equation and provides arguably the best Tafel analysis method. This work encourages embedding domain knowledge to realize strong intelligence with sparse data.







Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly integrated into chemistry research by guiding experimental procedures, correlating structure and function, interpreting large experimental datasets, to distill scientific insights that might be challenging with traditional methods. Such applications, however, largely focus on gaining insights via big data and/or big computation, while neglecting the valuable chemical prior knowledge dwelling in chemists&#8217; minds. In this paper, we introduce an Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN) by explicitly embedding electrochemistry priors including the Butler&#8211;Volmer (BV), Nernst and diffusion equations on the backbone of neural networks for multi&#8208;task discovery of electrochemistry parameters. We applied the ECINN to voltammetry experiments of 
 and 
redox couples to discover electrode kinetics and mass transport parameters. Notably, ECINN seamlessly integrated mass transport with BV to analyze the entire voltammogram to infer transfer coefficients directly, so offering a new approach to Tafel analysis by outdating various mass transport correction methods. In addition, ECINN can help discover the nature of electron transfer and is shown to refute incorrect physics if imposed. This work encourages chemists to embed their domain knowledge into machine learning models to start a new paradigm of chemistry&#8208;informed machine learning for better accountability, interpretability, and generalization.

         <title>Enhancing the Crystallinity of Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks through an in situ Protection&#8208;Deprotection Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protection of neighbouring groups during imine condensation reactions modulates the reactivity of building units in the synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The reduced reactivity of the protected aldehyde precursor decelerates the kinetics, making the reaction more reversible and improving the crystallinity of 2D COFs.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as highly robust materials, showing significant potential for practical applications. However, the exclusive reliance on 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (Tp aldehyde) in the design of such COFs often results in the production of non&#8208;porous amorphous polymers when combined with certain amine building blocks. Attempts to adjust the crystallinity and porosity by a modulator approach are inefficient because Tp aldehyde readily forms stable &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked monomers/oligomers with various aromatic amines through an irreversible keto&#8208;enol tautomerization process. Our research employed a unique protection&#8208;deprotection strategy to enhance the crystallinity and porosity of &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked squaramide&#8208;based 2D COFs. Advanced solid&#8208;state NMR studies, including 1D 13C CPMAS, 1H fast MAS, 15N CPMAS, 2D 13C&#8722;1H correlation, 1H&#8722;1H DQ&#8208;SQ, and 14N&#8722;1H HMQC NMR were used to establish the atomic&#8208;level connectivity within the resultant COFs. The TpOMe&#8208;Sqm COFs synthesized utilizing this strategy have a surface area of 487&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, significantly higher than similar COFs synthesized using Tp aldehyde. Furthermore, detailed time&#8208;dependent PXRD, solid&#8208;state 13C CPMAS NMR, and theoretical DFT studies shed more light on the crystallization and linkage conversion processes in these 2D COFs. Ultimately, we applied this protection&#8208;deprotection method to construct novel keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked highly porous organic polymers with a surface area of 1018&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Stabilization of Acenes: &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221;&#8208;Pentacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient three&#8208;step synthesis, starting from commercially available pentacenetetraone, gives helical, doubly quaterphenylene wrapped pentacenes. The &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; architecture effectively shields the acene backbones&#8212;the para&#8208;quaterphenylene derivative displays unique stability with respect to photoxodiation and Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with PTAD or fullerene.







Abstract
We report soluble tetrakis&#8208;biphenylyl substituted pentacenes comprised of sp2 carbons and synthesized from pentacene&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraone. Intramolecular Yamamoto coupling of two tetrakis(chlorobiphenylyl)pentacenes yields helical, doubly wrapped pentacenes, in which the quaterphenylene units solubilize the pentacenes and shield their central anthracene units to an unprecedented degree. The criss&#8208;cross&#8208;bridged pentacenes resist (photo)oxidation, Diels&#8211;Alder reactions and are much less reactive than TIPS&#8208;ethynylated pentacene. Extension of this concept might provide access to the larger acenes.

The &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; architecture effectively shields the acene backbones&#8212;the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-quaterphenylene derivative displays unique stability with respect to photoxodiation and Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with PTAD or fullerene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report soluble tetrakis-biphenylyl substituted pentacenes comprised of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbons and synthesized from pentacene-5,7,12,14-tetraone. Intramolecular Yamamoto coupling of two tetrakis(chlorobiphenylyl)pentacenes yields helical, doubly wrapped pentacenes, in which the quaterphenylene units solubilize the pentacenes and shield their central anthracene units to an unprecedented degree. The criss-cross-bridged pentacenes resist (photo)oxidation, Diels&#8211;Alder reactions and are much less reactive than TIPS-ethynylated pentacene. Extension of this concept might provide access to the larger acenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Ion&#8208;Induced Large Fragment Deactivation: A Different Strategy for Site&#8208;Selectivity in a Complex Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex natural product functionalizations generally involve the use of highly engineered reagents, catalysts, or enzymes to achieve site&#8208;selectivity by lowering a selected transition state energy. We invert this strategy by raising the energy of transition states representing undesirable sites through metal ion chelation, leaving desirable ones accessible to functionalization by a potentially wide variety of electrophilic synthetic methods.







Abstract
Complex natural product functionalizations generally involve the use of highly engineered reagents, catalysts, or enzymes to react exclusively at a desired site through lowering of a select transition state energy. In this communication, we report a new, complementary strategy in which all transition states representing undesirable sites in a complex ionophore substrate are simultaneously energetically increased through the chelation of a metal ion to the large fragment we wish to neutralize. In the case of an electrophilic, radical based fluorination reaction, charge repulsion (electric field effects), induced steric effects, and electron withdrawal provide the necessary deactivation and proof of principle to afford a highly desirable natural product derivative. We envisage that many other electrophilic or charge based synthetic methods may be amenable to this approach as well.

         <title>Engineered Anchor Peptide LCI with a Cobalt Cofactor Enhances Oxidation Efficiency of Polystyrene Microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered anchor peptide LCI_F16C with a flexible cobalt cofactor Co&#8208;L2 hydroxylated polystyrene microparticles using commercially available oxone as oxidant. The oxidation using biohybrid catalyst (Co&#8208;L2@LCI_F16C) showed 15 times higher functionalization level than using the free cobalt cofactors.







Abstract
A typical component of polymer waste is polystyrene (PS) used in numerous applications, but degraded only slowly in the environment due to its hydrophobic properties. To increase the reactivity of polystyrene, polar groups need to be introduced. Here, biohybrid catalysts based on the engineered anchor peptide LCI_F16C are presented, which are capable of attaching to polystyrene microparticles and hydroxylating benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in polystyrene microparticles using commercially available oxone as oxidant. LCI peptides achieve a dense surface coverage of PS through monolayer formation within minutes in aqueous solutions at ambient temperature. The catalytically active cobalt cofactor Co&#8208;L1 or Co&#8208;L2 with a modified NNNN macrocyclic TACD ligand (TACD=1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane) is covalently bound to the anchor peptide LCI through a maleimide linker. Compared to the free cofactors, a 12&#8208; to 15&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity using biohybrid catalysts based on LCI_F16C was observed.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Tetracyclic Cycloheptanols through (4+3) Annulation via C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H Activation Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular (4+3) annulation of &#945;&#8208;arylalkene&#8211;benzocyclobutenols has been developed, which proceeds through sequential &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination of alcohols, migratory insertion with alkenes, 1,4&#8208;Rh shift, and nucleophilic addition to the in situ formed ketones. The protocol offers a diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective approach to dihydrofuran&#8208;annulated dibenzocycloheptanols with two discontinuous chiral carbon centers built.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed annulations of four&#8208;membered rings via C&#8722;C activation are powerful tools to construct complex fused and bridged ring systems. Despite significant progress in (4+1), (4+2) and (4+4) annulations, the (4+3) annulation remains unexplored. Herein, we develop an asymmetric Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular (4+3) annulation of &#945;&#8208;arylalkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols for the synthesis of dihydrofuran&#8208;annulated dibenzocycloheptanols with two discontinuous chiral carbon centers via a C&#8722;C and C&#8722;H activation cascade. The reaction features excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities and 100&#8201;% atom economy, and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.

         <title>Selective C&#8722;H Halogenation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single component flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase AetF halogenates a range of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted styrenes, often with high stereoselectivity, and AetF and homologues of this enzyme also halogenate terminal alkynes. These findings expand the scope of FDH catalysis, and mutagenesis studies and deuterium kinetic isotope effects provide insight into the unique utility of single component FDHs for biocatalysis.







Abstract
Single component flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) possess both flavin reductase and FDH activity in a single enzyme. We recently reported that the single component FDH AetF catalyzes site&#8208;selective bromination and iodination of a variety of aromatic substrates and enantioselective bromolactonization and iodoetherification of styrenes bearing pendant carboxylic acid or alcohol substituents. Given this inherent reactivity and selectivity, we explored the utility of AetF as catalyst for alkene and alkyne C&#8722;H halogenation. We find that AetF catalyzes halogenation of a range of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted styrenes, often with high stereoselectivity. Despite the utility of haloalkenes for cross&#8208;coupling and other applications, accessing these compounds in a stereoselective manner typically requires functional group interconversion processes, and selective halogenation of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted olefins remains rare. We also establish that AetF and homologues of this enzyme can halogenate terminal alkynes. Mutagenesis studies and deuterium kinetic isotope effects are used to support a mechanistic proposal involving covalent catalysis for halogenation of unactivated alkynes by AetF homologues. These findings expand the scope of FDH catalysis and continue to show the unique utility of single component FDHs for biocatalysis.

Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems are obtained by utilizing noble metal&#8208;free photosensitizer (zinc&#8208;porphyrin) and catalyst (cobalt&#8208;quaterpyridine) derivatives. Upon introducing an additional chromophore (Bodipy), an antenna effect enhanced the photoproduction leading to 42.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 of CO and 759 turnover numbers.







Abstract
Dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems (DSPs) have been extensively investigated for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution. However, their application in carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction remains limited. Furthermore, current solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO DSPs typically employ rhenium complexes as catalysts. In this study, we have developed DSPs that incorporate noble metal&#8208;free components, specifically a zinc&#8208;porphyrin as photosensitizer (PS) and a cobalt&#8208;quaterpyridine as catalyst (CAT). Taking a significant stride forward, we have achieved an antenna effect for the first time in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO DSPs by introducing a Bodipy as an additional chromophore to enhance light harvesting efficiency. The energy transfer from Bodipy to zinc porphyrin resulted in remarkable stability (turn over number (TON)=759 vs. CAT), and high CO evolution activity (42&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 vs. CAT).

         <title>Eu(OTf)3&#8208;Catalyzed Formal Dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloaddition of Bicyclo&#8208;[1.1.0]butanes with Nitrones: Access to Polysubstituted 2&#8208;Oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes</title>

Rapid access of diverse polysubstituted 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which were not readily accessible by known methods, has been realized through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with easily accessible nitrones.







Abstract
Herein, we have synthesized multifunctionalized 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which are considered potential bioisosteres for meta&#8208;substituted arenes, through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with nitrones. This methodology represents the initial instance of fabricating bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes adorned with multiple heteroatoms. The protocol exhibits both mild reaction conditions and a good tolerance for various functional groups. Computational density functional theory calculations support that the reaction mechanism likely involves a nucleophilic addition of nitrones to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, succeeded by an intramolecular cyclization. The synthetic utility of this novel protocol has been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of the analogue of Rupatadine.

         <title>An ATP &#8220;Synthase&#8221; Derived from a Single Structural Domain of Bacterial Histidine Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;domain ATP &#8220;synthase&#8221; was derived from bacterial histidine kinases. This enzyme catalyzes ATP synthesis from ADP under mild conditions in vitro by exploiting an AdK&#8208;like catalytic mechanism. It can be generally applied as new biomolecular catalyst used for ATP supply to facilitate multifarious vital phosphorylation systems.







Abstract
ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a vital energy source for living organisms, and its biosynthesis and precise concentration regulation often depend on macromolecular machinery composed of protein complexes or complicated multidomain proteins. We have identified a single&#8208;domain protein HK853CA derived from bacterial histidine kinases (HK) that can catalyze ATP synthesis efficiently. Here, we explored the reaction mechanism and multiple factors that influence this catalysis through a combination of experimental techniques and molecular simulations. Moreover, we optimized its enzymatic activity and applied it as an ATP replenishment machinery to other ATP&#8208;dependent systems. Our results broaden the understanding of ATP biosynthesis and show that the single CA domain can be applied as a new biomolecular catalyst used for ATP supply.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C4&#8208;selective Carboxylation of Pyridines with CO2 via Pyridylphosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical copper&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective carboxylation of pyridines with CO2 via pyridylphosphonium salts has been developed. The C&#8722;P bond carboxylation with CO2 was achieved for the first time. This work represents a novel mode of site&#8208;selective carboxylation of pyridines, which may be a useful approach in new drug design and discovery in the future.







Abstract
Pyridine motifs are widespread pharmacophores in many drugs. Installing various substituents through pyridine C&#8722;H bond functionalization is significant for new drug design and discovery. Developments of late&#8208;stage functionalization reactions enrich the strategies for selective functionalization of pyridines. However, late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H carboxylation of pyridines is a long&#8208;standing challenge, especially selectively carboxylation with CO2 on pyridine motifs. Herein, we describe a practical method for C4&#8722;H carboxylation of pyridines via one&#8208;pot C&#8722;H phosphination and copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of the resulted phosphonium salts with CO2. The reaction is conducted under mild conditions and compatible with multiple active groups and several pyridine drugs, providing diverse valuable isonicotinic acid compounds, demonstrating the application potential of this strategy.

         <title>Pushing The Extreme of Multicentre Bonding: Planar Pentacoordinate Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar pentacoordinate hydride has been predicted for the first time in the global minimum C2V geometry of Li5H6&#8722; cluster.







Abstract
Planar hypercoordination has sparkled interest among the researchers from last few decades. Most of the elements in the Periodic Table have shown this remarkable structural feature. However, the smallest element, hydrogen, is missing in the list. No evidence is there in the literature. Herein, we introduce the first planar pentacoordinate hydrogen atom (ppH) in the global minimum geometry of Li5H6&#8722; cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is stabilized by multicentre bonding with five surrounding Li atoms. Natural charge analysis reveals that the central hydrogen is acting like a hydride which is strongly attracted by the positively charged surrounding lithium centres. The ppH structure is stabilized by strong electrostatic attraction as well as extensive multicentre bonding. Aromaticity has no role to play here. The cluster is dynamically stable and is expected to be detected in gas phase.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Rod&#8208;Coil Bottlebrush Copolymers into Degradable Nanodiscs with a UV&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Immolation Process</title>

Tadpole&#8208;like amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymer (BBC) with UV&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immolative poly(ethyl glyoxylate) side chains are prepared. Through direct self&#8208;assembly such BBC in water, nanoparticles with disc&#8208;like morphologies can be prepared. Upon UV irradiation, these nanodiscs demonstrate controlled degradation and disassembly, transitioning from discs to micelles, and facilitating targeted molecular release.







Abstract
Polymer nanodiscs, especially with stimuli&#8208;responsive features, represent an unexplored frontier in the nanomaterial landscape. Such 2D nanomaterials are considered highly promising for advanced biomedicine applications. Herein, we designed a rod&#8208;coil copolymer architecture based on an amphiphilic, tadpole&#8208;like bottlebrush copolymer, which can directly self&#8208;assemble into core&#8211;shell nanodiscs in an aqueous environment. As the bottlebrush side chains are made of amorphous, UV&#8208;responsive poly(ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG) chains, they can undergo rapid end&#8208;to&#8208;end self&#8208;immolation upon light irradiation. This triggered nanodisc disassembly can be used to boost small molecule release from the nanodisc core, which is further aided by a morphological change from discs to spheres.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Rhodium&#8208;Carbynoid in [2+1+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt was prepared, and it was applied in Rh&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component [2+1+2] cycloadditions for the first time, affording various imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles under mild conditions. This strategy involved a unique trifluoromethyl Rh&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=Rh), wherein three new chemical bonds were forged at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of trifluoromethyl in a single step.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl cationic carbyne (CF3C+:) possessing dual carbene&#8208;carbocation behavior emulated as trifluoromethyl metal&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=M) has not been explored yet, and its reaction characteristics are unknown. Herein, a novel &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt was prepared and used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component [2+1+2] cycloadditions for the first time with commercially available N&#8208;fused heteroarenes and nitriles, yielding a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles that are of interest in medicinal chemistry, in which the insertion of trifluoromethyl Rh&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=Rh) into C=N bonds of N&#8208;fused heteroarenes was involved. This strategy demonstrates synthetic applications in late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals, construction of CD3&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocycles, gram&#8208;scale experiments, and synthesis of phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor analog. These highly valuable and modifiable imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles exhibit good antitumor activity in vitro, thus demonstrating their potential applications in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>A Bioengineered Nanovesicle Vaccine Boosts T&#8208;B cell Interaction for Immunotherapy of Echinococcus multilocularis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a nanovesicle vaccine that displays multiple epitope peptides of Echinococcus multilocularis on the surface. The vaccine can efficiently activate dendritic cells, induce specific T/B cells to form a mutually activated circuit, and inhibit Echinococcus multilocularis infection.







Abstract
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a zoonotic parasitic disease, resulting from being infected with the metacestode larvae of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis (E.&#8197;multilocularis). Novel prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed since the current chemotherapy displays limited efficiency in AE treatment. Bioengineered nano cellular membrane vesicles are widely used for displaying the native conformational epitope peptides because of their unique structure and biocompatibility. In this study, four T&#8208;cells and four B&#8208;cells dominant epitope peptides of E.&#8197;multilocularis with high immunogenicity were engineered into the Vero cell surface to construct a membrane vesicle nanovaccine for the treatment of AE. The results showed that the nanovesicle vaccine can efficiently activate dendritic cells, induce specific T/B cells to form a mutually activated circuit, and inhibit E.&#8197;multilocularis infection. This study presents for the first time a nanovaccine strategy that can completely eliminate the burden of E.&#8197;multilocularis.

         <title>A Modular Turn&#8208;On Strategy to Profile E2&#8208;Specific Ubiquitination Events in Living Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A cascade of three enzymes, E1&#8722;E2&#8722;E3, is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to target proteins, but the role of the central E2 has been largely overlooked. This work presents a new method, called targeted charging of ubiquitin to E2, or tCUbE, that can follow ubiquitin all the way through its cascade to report on E2 activity and interactions in living mammalian cells.







Abstract
A cascade of three enzymes, E1&#8722;E2&#8722;E3, is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to target proteins, which controls many different aspects of cellular signaling. The role of the E2 has been largely overlooked, despite influencing substrate identity, chain multiplicity, and topology. Here we report a method&#8212;targeted charging of ubiquitin to E2 (tCUbE)&#8212;that can track a tagged ubiquitin through its entire enzymatic cascade in living mammalian cells. We use this approach to reveal new targets whose ubiquitination depends on UbcH5a E2 activity. We demonstrate that tCUbE can be broadly applied to multiple E2s and in different human cell lines. tCUbE is uniquely suited to examine E2&#8722;E3&#8208;substrate cascades of interest and/or piece together previously unidentified cascades, thereby illuminating entire branches of the UPS and providing critical insight that will be useful for identifying new therapeutic targets in the UPS.

         <title>Synthesis of S(IV)&#8208;Stereogenic Chiral Thio&#8208;Oxazolidinones via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [3+2] Annulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulations are disclosed, providing a modular platform for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral thio&#8208;oxazolidinones. Preliminary mechanistic studies are performed to rationalize the observed enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;controls.







Abstract
Organic molecules bearing chiral sulfur stereocenters exert a great impact on asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral drugs, and chiral materials. Compared with acyclic ones, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of thio&#8208;heterocycles has largely lagged behind due to the lack of efficient synthetic strategies. Here we establish the first modular platform to access chiral thio&#8208;oxazolidinones via Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulations of vinylethylene carbonates with sulfinylanilines. This protocol is featured by readily available starting materials, and high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. In particular, an unusual effect of a non&#8208;chiral supporting ligand on the diastereoselectivity was observed. Possible reaction mechanisms and stereocontrol models were proposed.

&lt;p&gt;Organic molecules bearing chiral sulfur stereocenters exert a great impact on asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral drugs, and chiral materials. Compared with acyclic ones, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of thio-heterocycles has largely lagged behind due to the lack of efficient synthetic strategies. Here we establish the first modular platform to access chiral thio-oxazolidinones via Pd-catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulations of vinylethylene carbonates with sulfinylanilines. This protocol is featured by readily available starting materials, and high enantio- and diastereoselectivity. In particular, an unusual effect of a non-chiral supporting ligand on the diastereoselectivity was observed. Possible reaction mechanisms and stereocontrol models were proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Torsional Strain Enabled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization towards Axially Chiral Semiaromatic Polyesters with Chemical Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the non&#8208;polymerizability of the biaryl&#8208;fused monomer DBO, a cyclic ester Me&#8208;DBO installed with dimethyl substitution was prepared to enable its polymerizability via enhancing torsional strain while preserving an excellent recyclability. Remarkably, mixing these complementary enantiopure polymers containing axial chirality promoted a transformation from amorphous to crystalline material.







Abstract
The development of new chemically recyclable polymers via monomer design would provide a transformative strategy to address the energy crisis and plastic pollution problem. Biaryl&#8208;fused cyclic esters were targeted to generate axially chiral polymers, which would impart new material performance. To overcome the non&#8208;polymerizability of the biaryl&#8208;fused monomer DBO, a cyclic ester Me&#8208;DBO installed with dimethyl substitution was prepared to enable its polymerizability via enhancing torsional strain. Impressively, Me&#8208;DBO readily went through well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization, producing polymer P(Me&#8208;DBO) with high glass transition temperature (Tg &gt;100&#8201;&#176;C). Intriguingly, mixing these complementary enantiopure polymers containing axial chirality promoted a transformation from amorphous to crystalline material, affording a semicrystalline stereocomplex with a melting transition temperature more than 300&#8201;&#176;C. P(Me&#8208;DBO) were capable of depolymerizing back to Me&#8208;DBO in high efficiency, highlighting an excellent recyclability.

         <title>Anionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Showing Tautomerism and Colorful Luminescence for the Ultrasensitive Detection of Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) based on tautomers has been constructed from triarylamidine bromide salts. The HOF exhibits both structural phase transition and proton transfer tautomerism under external stimulation, accompanied by color&#8208;switching of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The HOF can be used for the highly sensitive and specific detection of acetone.







Abstract
Tautomers coexisting in an equilibrium system have significant potential for regulating luminescent properties because of their structural differences. However, separating and stabilizing tautomers at room temperature is a considerable challenge. In this study, it is found that hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composed of Br&#8208; anions can effectively separate and stabilize two proton&#8208;transfer tautomers of triarylformamidinium bromide: namely, the nitrogen cation (BA&#8208;N) and carbon cation (BA&#8208;C). The BA&#8208;N crystal consisting of a dense anionic HOF and parallelly aligned organic cations exhibits green thermally activated delayed fluorescence and red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). The BA&#8208;C crystal contains acetone molecules that induce an antiparallel arrangement of the organic cations to form a loose HOF, producing blue prompt fluorescence and green RTP. Interestingly, switching of the HOFs between BA&#8208;N and BA&#8208;C can be achieved through the uptake and release of acetone, thereby dynamically adjusting multiple luminescent properties. Consequently, the HOF crystals can be used for the highly sensitive and specific sensing of acetone with a detection limit of 66.74&#8197;ppm. This study not only stabilizes tautomeric luminescent materials at room temperature, but also provides a new method for constructing smart HOFs with a sensitive response to a stimulus.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven C&#8722;C Coupling for Targeted Synthesis of CH3COOH with Nearly 100&#8201;% Selectivity from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CO2 photoreduction towards CH3COOH with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity is realized over a catalyst with charge asymmetric metal pair sites, wherein the metal charge asymmetric active sites induced by doping engineering can boost the C&#8722;C coupling of double COOH* intermediates.







Abstract
Targeted synthesis of acetic acid (CH3COOH) from CO2 photoreduction under mild conditions mainly limits by the kinetic challenge of the C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we utilized doping engineering to build charge&#8208;asymmetrical metal pair sites for boosted C&#8722;C coupling, enhancing the activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction towards CH3COOH. As a prototype, the Pd doped Co3O4 atomic layers are synthesized, where the established charge&#8208;asymmetrical cobalt pair sites are verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra. Theoretical calculations not only reveal the charge&#8208;asymmetrical cobalt pair sites caused by Pd atom doping, but also manifest the promoted C&#8722;C coupling of double *COOH intermediates through shortening of the coupled C&#8722;C bond distance from 1.54 to 1.52 &#197; and lowering their formation energy barrier from 0.77 to 0.33&#8197;eV. Importantly, the decreased reaction energy barrier from the protonation of two*COOH into *CO intermediates for the Pd&#8208;Co3O4 atomic layer slab is 0.49&#8197;eV, higher than that of the Co3O4 atomic layer slab (0.41&#8197;eV). Therefore, the Pd&#8208;Co3O4 atomic layers exhibit the CH3COOH evolution rate of ca. 13.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100% selectivity, both of which outperform all previously reported single photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction towards CH3COOH under similar conditions.

         <title>Switching Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Pathways through Electronic Tuning of Copper Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cu porphyrins with fine&#8208;tuned electronic structures are synthesized and examined as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Mechanism studies reveal that the catalytically active species switches from a formal CuI species to a formal Cu0 species upon decreasing the electron density of these Cu porphyrins. This work presents an unparalleled example of regulating hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism via electronic tuning of catalysts.







Abstract
The electronic structure of metal complexes plays key roles in determining their catalytic features. However, controlling electronic structures to regulate reaction mechanisms is of fundamental interest but has been rarely presented. Herein, we report electronic tuning of Cu porphyrins to switch pathways of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Through controllable and regioselective &#946;&#8208;oxidation of Cu porphyrin 1, we synthesized analogues 2&#8211;4 with one or two &#946;&#8208;lactone groups in either a cis or trans configuration. Complexes 1&#8211;4 have the same Cu&#8208;N4 core site but different electronic structures. Although &#946;&#8208;oxidation led to large anodic shifts of reductions, 1&#8211;4 displayed similar HER activities in terms of close overpotentials. With electrochemical, chemical and theoretical results, we show that the catalytically active species switches from a CuI species for 1 to a Cu0 species for 4. This work is thus significant to present mechanism&#8208;controllable HER via electronic tuning of catalysts.

         <title>Giant Negative Thermal Expansion in Ultralight NaB(CN)4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaB(CN)4 exhibits a giant negative thermal expansion behaviour (&#945;V&#8764;&#8722;9.24&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 100&#8211;200&#8197;K; &#945;V&#8764;&#8722;3.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 200&#8211;650&#8197;K) with interesting ultralight mass density properties. Non&#8208;rigid vibrational modes, characterized by a maximum negative Gruneisen parameter, play a key factor in the generation of the giant NTE observed in NaB(CN)4.







Abstract
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) is crucial for controlling the thermomechanical properties of functional materials, albeit being relatively rare. This study reports a giant NTE (&#945;V&#8764;&#8722;9.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 100&#8211;200&#8197;K; &#945;V&#8764;&#8722;3.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 200&#8211;650&#8197;K) observed in NaB(CN)4, showcasing interesting ultralight properties. A comprehensive investigation involving synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations has been conducted to explore the thermal expansion mechanism. The findings indicate that the low&#8208;frequency phonon modes play a primary role in NTE, and non&#8208;rigid vibration modes with most negative Gr&#252;neisen parameters are the key contributing factor to the giant NTE observed in NaB(CN)4. This work presents a new material with giant NTE and ultralight mass density, providing insights for the understanding and design of novel NTE materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Regulated Nucleation for Growing Highly Uniform Single&#8208;Crystalline Microrods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a light&#8208;irradiation method to control the synchronous nucleation of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) fluorophore for growing highly uniform single&#8208;crystalline microrods, which is in sharp contrast to the prevailing methods of inhibiting spontaneous nucleation and additionally adding seeds. The D&#8208;A fluorophore was observed to undergo photoinduced electron transfer to CrCl3, leading to the generation of HCl and the subsequent protonation of the D&#8208;A fluorophore. By intensifying photoirradiation or prolonging its duration, the concentration of protonated D&#8208;A fluorophores can be rapidly increased to a high supersaturation level. This results in the formation of a controlled number of nuclei in a synchronous manner, which in turn kickstart the epitaxial growth of protonated D&#8208;A fluorophores towards uniform single&#8208;crystalline microrods of controlled sizes. &#160;The light&#8208;regulated synchronous nucleation and uniform growth of microrods are a unique phenomenon that can only be achieved by specific Lewis acids, making it a novel probing method for sensitively detecting strong Lewis acids such as chromium chloride.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent, Kinetically Controlled Isomerization of Terminal Alkenes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because internal alkenes are more challenging synthetic targets than terminal alkenes, metal&#8208;catalyzed olefin mono&#8208;transposition (i.e., positional isomerization) approaches have emerged to afford valuable E&#8208; or Z&#8208; internal alkenes from their complementary terminal alkene feedstocks. However, the applicability of these methods has been hampered by lack of generality, commercial availability of precatalysts, and scalability. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed platform for the stereodivergent E/Z&#8208;selective synthesis of internal alkenes at room temperature. Commercial reagents enable this one&#8208;carbon transposition of terminal alkenes to valuable E&#8208; or Z&#8208;internal alkenes via a Ni&#8211;H&#8208;mediated insertion/elimination mechanism. Though the mechanistic regime is the same in both systems, the underlying pathways that lead each of the active catalysts are distinct, with the Z&#8208;selective catalyst forming from comproportionation of an oxidative addition complex followed by oxidative addition with substrate and the E&#8208;selective catalyst forming from protonation of the metal by the trialkylphosphonium salt additive. In each case, ligand sterics and denticity control stereochemistry and prevent over&#8208;isomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>The Stability of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ion&#8208;Pair Complex Unexpectedly Increases with Increasing Solvent Polarity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generally observed decrease of the electrostatic energy in the complex with increasing solvent polarity has led to the assumption that the stability of the complexes with ion&#8208;pair hydrogen bonds decreases with increasing solvent polarity. Besides, the smaller solvent&#8208;accessible surface area (SASA) of the complex in comparison with the isolated subsystems results in a smaller solvation energy of the latter, leading to a destabilization of the complex in the solvent compared to the gas phase.
In our study, which combines Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Infrared Spectroscopy experiments, quantum chemical calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we question the general validity of this statement. We demonstrate that the binding free energy of the ion&#8208;pair hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex between 2&#8208;fluoropropionic acid and n&#8208;butylamine (CH3CHFCOO&#8208;&#8230; NH3But+) increases with increased solvent polarity. This phenomenon is rationalized by a substantial charge transfer between the subsystems that constitute the ion&#8208;pair hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex. This unexpected finding introduces a new perspective to our understanding of solvation dynamics, emphasizing the interplay between solvent polarity and molecular stability within hydrogen&#8208;bonded systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Functionalization of Dehydroalanine&#8208;Derived Peptides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unnatural amino acids, and their synthesis via the late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of peptides, play a crucial role in areas such as drug design and discovery. Historically, the LSF of biomolecules has predominantly utilized traditional synthetic methodologies that exploit nucleophilic residues, such as cysteine, lysine or tyrosine. In this study, we present a photocatalytic hydroarylation process targeting the electrophilic residue dehydroalanine (Dha). This residue possesses an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated moiety and can be combined with various arylthianthrenium salts, both in batch and flow reactors. Notably, the flow setup proved instrumental for efficient scale&#8208;up, paving the way for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids and peptides in substantial quantities. Our photocatalytic approach, being inherently mild, permits the diversification of peptides even when they contain sensitive functional groups. The readily available arylthianthrenium salts facilitate the seamless integration of Dha&#8208;infused peptides with a wide range of arenes, drug blueprints, and natural products, culminating in the creation of unconventional phenylalanine derivatives. The synergistic effect of the high functional group tolerance and the modular characteristic of the aryl electrophile enables efficient peptide conjugation and ligation in both batch and flow conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of &#8220;Structural Pin&#8221; Interactions and Their Significance for the Conformational Control of Macrocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While peptide macrocycles with rigid conformations have proven to be useful in the design of chemical probes of protein targets, conformational flexibility and rapid interconversion can be equally vital for biological activity and favorable physicochemical properties. This study introduces the concept of &#8220;structural pin&#8221;, which describes a hydrogen bond that is largely responsible for stabilizing the entire macrocycle backbone conformation. Structural analysis of macrocycles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X&#8208;ray diffraction indicates that disruption of the structural pin can drastically influence the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased flexibility. This finding provides a new tool to interrogate dynamic behaviour of macrocycles. Identification of structural pins offers a potentially useful conceptual framework to understand positions that can either be modified to give flexible structures or retained to maintain the rigidity of the scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>The Celiac&#8208;Disease Superantigen Oligomerizes and Increases Permeability in an Enterocyte Cell Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten proteins, affecting approximately 1% of the global population. The 33&#8208;mer deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) is a metabolically modified wheat&#8208;gluten superantigen for CeD. Here, we demonstrate that the 33&#8208;mer DGP spontaneously assembles into oligomers with a diameter of approximately 24 nm. The 33&#8208;mer DGP oligomers present two main secondary structural motifs&#8212;a major polyproline II helix and a minor &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. Importantly, in the presence of 33&#8208;mer DGP oligomers, there is&#160;a statistically significant increase in the permeability in the gut epithelial cell model Caco&#8208;2, accompanied by the redistribution of zonula occludens&#8208;1, a master tight junction protein. These findings provide novel molecular and supramolecular insights into the impact of 33&#8208;mer DGP in CeD and highlight the relevance of gliadin peptide oligomerization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A mononuclear, T&#8208;shaped palladium(I) d9 metalloradical (3), stabilized by a bulky carbazole&#8208;based PNP&#8208;ligand, was obtained by reduction of palladium chloride or thermal Pd&#8208;C bond homolysis of the corresponding neopentyl complex. Pressurizing with CO gave the Pd(I) carbonyl complex, which was structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Delocalization of the unpaired electron to the carbonyl carbon was detected by EPR spectroscopy and theoretically modeled by DFT and ab initio methods. The partially reduced and radicalized CO slowly reacts with di(tert&#8208;butyl) disulfide under homolytic S&#8208;S cleavage and C&#8208;S bond formation to give the corresponding metallathioester</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Pyroelectricity, Thermal and Photochemical Switching in a Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Crystal by In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The switching behavior of the novel hybrid material (FA)Na[Fe(CN)5(NO)].H2O (1) in response to temperature (T), light irradiation and electric field (E) is studied using in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Crystals of 1 display piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, second and third harmonic generation. XRD shows that the FA+ are disordered at room&#8208;temperature, but stepwise cooling from 273&#8208;100K induces gradual ordering, while cooling under an applied field (E = +40kVcm&#8208;1) induces a sudden phase change at 140K. Structural&#8208;dynamics calculations suggest the field pushes the system into a region of the structural potential&#8208;energy surface that is otherwise inaccessible, demonstrating that application of T and E offers an effective route to manipulating the crystal chemistry of these materials. Photocrystallography also reveals photoinduced linkage isomerism, which coexists with but is not correlated to other switching behaviors. These experiments highlight a new approach to in&#8208;situ studies of hybrid materials, providing insight into the structure&#8208;property relationships that underpin their functionality.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A pair of novel polymorphic ionic cocrystals of 3,4&#8208;dicyanotelluradiazole and tetraphenylphosphonium bromide are synthesized and are characterized by single&#8208;crystal XRD. Strong and directional non&#8208;covalent chalcogen bonds (ChB) between Te and Br are analyzed via solid&#8208;state NMR to reveal large and anisotropic J(125Te,79/81Br) coupling tensors, providing unequivocal evidence for non&#8208;Fermi contact contributions across ChBs. Along with large 79/81Br quadrupolar couplings for the Br&#8208; anions, these data provide new tools to characterize chalcogen bonds and to differentiate between ChB polymorphs.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Modulation of Piezofluorochromic Behaviors in Organic Molecular Cages by Replacing Non&#8208;Luminous Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic piezochromic materials that manifest pressure&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responses are important in various fields such as data storage and anticounterfeiting. The manipulation of piezofluorochromic behaviors for these materials is promising but remains a great challenge. Herein, a non&#8208;luminous components regulated strategy is developed and organic molecular cages (OMCs), a burgeoning class of crystalline organic materials with structural dynamics, are first explored for the&#160; design of piezofluorochromic materials with tunable luminescence. A series of OMCs based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) chromophores, termed Cage 1&#8208;3, are synthesized and their piezofluorochromic behaviors are investigated by diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the sufficient voids between its flexible chromophores offered by the OMC structure, Cage 1 exhibits thermofluorochromic and piezofluorochromic properties. Moreover, the piezofluorochromic performance of this OMC could be further promoted by replacing its non&#8208;luminous components with improved flexibilities, and a remarkable luminescence peak shift by 150 nm together with a response sensitivity of 13.8 nm GPa&#8208;1 was achieved upon hydrostatic compression. The cage structure plays a vital role in facilitating efficient and reversible piezofluorochromic behaviors. This study has shed light on the rational design and exploitation of OMCs as an exceptional platform to accomplish customizable piezofluorochromic behaviors and enlarge their potential applications in pressure&#8208;based luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Morphology Manipulation by Side&#8208;chain Engineering of Quinoxaline&#8208;Substituted Organic Photothermal Molecules for Efficient Solar&#8208;Thermal Conversion and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic photothermal materials have attracted more and more attention due to the structural diversity, flexibility, and compatibility. However, the energy conversion efficiency is limited due to the narrow absorption spectrum, strong reflection/transmittance and insufficient non&#8208;radiative decay. Herein, we synthesized two quinoxaline&#8208;based D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D type molecules with ethyl (BQE) or carboxylate (BQC) substitutes. The strong intramolecular charge transfer endow both molecules broad absorption ranging from 350&#8211;1000 nm. Besides, the high reorganization energy and weak molecular packing of BQE yield efficient non&#8208;radiative decay. More importantly, the self&#8208;assembly of BQE leads to textured surface and enhances the light&#8208;trapping efficiency with dramatically reduced light reflection/transmittance. Consequently, BQE achieved impressive solar&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency&#160;of 18.16% under 1.0 kW m&#8722;2&#160;irradiation with good photobleaching resistance.&#160;Inspired by this, the&#160;water evaporation rate attained&#160;to 1.2 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with efficiency of 83% for BQE based interfacial evaporation device under 1.0 kW m&#8722;2&#160;simulated sunlight.&#160;Eventually, synergetic integration of solar&#8208;steam and thermoelectric co&#8208;generation device based on BQE is realized without sacrificing solar&#8208;steam efficiency significantly, highlighting the practical application toward impactful photothermal exploitation. This work provides new insights of molecular design&#160;for enhancing light&#8208;trapping management by molecular self&#8208;assembly, which paves the way of photothermal&#8208;driven application of organic photothermal materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrofunctionalization of Cyclobutenones: Total Synthesis of gem&#8208;Dimethylcyclobutane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclobutanes with a gem&#8208;dimethyl group are common motifs in natural products. However, strategies for constructing enantioenriched gem&#8208;dimethyl cyclobutanes are still underdeveloped. Herein, we report an enantioselective approach to synthesize a broad group of chiral 2,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanones through sequential 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/trapping/cross&#8208;coupling of readily available cyclobutenones. The intermediate 2&#8208;bromocyclobutanone provides a valuable synthetic handle for further coupling transformations. In addition, this strategy was successfully utilized to synthesize gem&#8208;dimethyl cyclobutane&#8208;containing natural products,&#160; including (+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;caryophyllene, (&#8208;)&#8208;raikovenal, (&#8208;)&#8208;1&#946;,9&#945;H&#8208;5&#8208;linoleoyloxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;secocaryophyllen&#8208;4&#8208;one, and (&#8208;)&#8208;rumphellanones A&#8208;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Detection of Novel Low&#8208;Frequency Gene Fusions via High&#8208;Yield Ligation and Multiplexed Enrichment Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Panel&#8208;based methods are commonly employed for the analysis of novel gene fusions in precision diagnostics and new drug development in cancer. However, these methods are constrained by limitations in ligation yield and the enrichment of novel gene fusions with low variant allele frequencies. In this study, we conducted a pioneering investigation into the stability of double&#8208;stranded adapter DNA, resulting in improved ligation yield and enhanced conversion efficiency. Additionally, we implemented blocker displacement amplification, achieving a remarkable 11&#8208;fold enrichment of novel gene fusions. Leveraging the pre&#8208;enrichment achieved with this approach, we successfully applied it to Nanopore sequencing, enabling ultra&#8208;fast analysis of novel gene fusions within a one&#8208;hour with high sensitivity. This method offers a robust and remarkably sensitive means of analyzing novel gene fusions, promising the discovery of pivotal biomarkers that can significantly improve cancer diagnostics and the development of new therapeutic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>The Influence of Ions on the Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical stability window of water is known to vary with the type and concentration of dissolved salts. However, the underlying influence of ions on the thermodynamic stability of aqueous solutions has not been fully understood. Here, we investigated the electrolytic behaviors of aqueous electrolytes as a function of different ions. Our findings indicate that ions with high ionic potential, i.e., charge density, promote the formation of their respective hydration structures, enhancing electrolytic reactions via an inductive effect, particularly for small cations. Conversely, ions with lower ionic potentials increase the proportion of free water molecules&#8212;those not engaged in hydration shells or hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks&#8212;leading to greater electrolytic stability. Furthermore, we observe that the chemical environment created by bulky ions with lower ionic potentials impedes electrolytic reactions by frustrating the solvation of protons and hydroxide ions, the products of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. We found that the solvation of protons plays a more substantial role than that of hydroxide, which explains a more significant shift for OER than for HER, a puzzle that cannot be rationalized by the notion of varying O&#8211;H bond strengths of water. These deep insights may inform the design of aqueous systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Direct Air Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>According to the rule of chemical thermodynamics, the catalytic activation of small molecules (like N2 in air and CO2 in flue gas) generally exhibits a negative activity dependence on O2 owning to the competitive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nevertheless, some catalysts can show positive activity dependence for N2 electrofixation, an important route to produce ammonia under ambient condition. Here we report that the positive activity dependence on O2 of (Ni0.20Co0.20Fe0.20Mn0.19Mo0.21)3S4 catalyst arises from high&#8208;entropy mechanism. Thorough experimental and theoretical studies, we demonstrate that under the reaction condition in the mixed N2/O2, the adsorption of O2 on high&#8208;entropy catalyst contributes to activating N2 molecules characteristic of elongated N&#8801;N bond lengths. As comparison to the low&#8208; and media&#8208;entropy counterparts, high entropy can play the second role of attenuating competitive ORR by displaying a negative exponential entropy&#8208;ORR activity relationship. Accordingly, benefiting from the O2, the system for direct air electrofixation has demonstrated an ammonia yield rate of 47.70 &#956;g h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, which is even 1.5 times of pure N2 feedstock (31.92 &#956;g h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2), overtaking all previous reports for this reaction. We expect the present finding providing an additional dimension to high entropy that leverages systems beyond the constraint of traditional rules.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen through Mn Doping in NiCo2O4&#8722;d Spinel Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Durable Acid Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design the electrocatalysts without noble metal is still a challenge for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid media. Herein, we reported the manganese doping method to decrease the concentration of oxygen vacancy (Vo) and form the Mn&#8722;O structure adjacent octahedral sites in spinel NiCo2O4&#8722;&#948; (NiMn1.5Co3O4&#8722;&#948;), which highly enhanced the activity and stability of spinel NiCo2O4&#8722;&#948; with a low overpotential (&#951;) of 280 mV at j = 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability of 80 h in acid media. The isotopic labelling experiment based on differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) clearly demonstrated the lattice oxygen in NiMn1.5Co3O4&#8722;&#948; is more stable due to strong Mn&#8208;O bond and synergetic adsorbate evolution mechanism (SAEM) for acid OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal highly increased oxygen vacancy formation energy (EVO) of NiCo2O4&#8722;&#948; after Mn doping. More importantly, the highly hydrogen bonding between Mn&#8722;O and *OOH adsorbed on adjacent Co octahedral sites promote the formation of *OO from *OOH due to the greatly enhanced charge density of O in Mn substituted sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimethyl Carbonate Synthesis from CO2 over CeO2 with Electron&#8208;enriched Lattice Oxygen Specises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from CO2 has both theoretical and practical value in carbon neutrality, but its efficiency is far from the application requirements due to the lacks of understanding of reaction mechanism and rational design of catalyst. Herein, abundant electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen species were introduced into CeO2 catalyst by constructing a large number of point defects and crystal&#8208;terminated phases in the crystal reconstruction process. Benefitting from the modulation of acid&#8208;base properties by electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen, a much higher DMC yield of 22.2 mmol g&#8208;1 was achieved on optimized CeO2 catalyst than other reported metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based catalysts at similar conditions. Mechanistic investigations illustrated that the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen, instead of the oxygen vacancy, not only provided abundant sites for CO2 adsorption and activation, but also significantly induced the weakly absorbed methoxy species formation. Both of which facilitated the coupling of methoxy and CO2 to *CH3OCOO intermediate. In addition, the *CH3OCOO adsorption was obviously weakened on electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen, thus shifting the rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS) from *CH3OCOO formation to *CH3OCOO dissociation and lowing the reaction energy barrier. This work provides insight into the underlying reaction mechanism for DMC synthesis from CO2 and methanol and the design of highly active catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>The Impact of Metagenomics on Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the ever&#8208;growing demand for sustainable ways to produce high&#8208;value small molecules, biocatalysis has come to the forefront of greener routes to these chemicals. As such, the need to constantly find and optimise suitable biocatalysts for specific transformations has never been greater. Metagenome mining has been shown to rapidly expand the toolkit of promiscuous enzymes needed for new transformations, without requiring protein engineering steps. If protein engineering is needed, the metagenomic candidate can often provide a better starting point for engineering than a previously discovered enzyme on the open database or from literature, for instance. In this review, we highlight where metagenomics has made substantial impact on the area of biocatalysis in recent years. We review the discovery of enzymes in previously unexplored or &#8216;hidden&#8217; sequence space, leading to the characterisation of enzymes with enhanced properties that originate from natural selection pressures in native environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly selective acetylene&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene electroreduction over Cd&#8208;decorated Cu catalyst with efficiently inhibited carbon&#8208;carbon coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical acetylene reduction (EAR) employing Cu catalysts represents an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective method for ethylene production and purification. However, Cu&#8208;based catalysts encounter product selectivity issues stemming from carbon&#8208;carbon coupling and other side reactions. We explored the use of secondary metals to modify Cu&#8208;based catalysts and identified Cd decoration as particular effective. Cd decoration demonstrated a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.38% with well&#8208;inhibited carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reactions (0.06% for butadiene FE at &#8211;0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 5 vol.% acetylene gas feed. Notably, ethylene selectivity of 99.99% was achieved in the crude ethylene feed during prolonged stability tests. Theoretical calculations revealed that Cd metal accelerates the water dissociation on neighboring Cu surfaces allowing more H* to participate in the acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation, while increasing the energy barrier for carbon&#8208;carbon coupling, thereby contributing to a high ethylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation efficiency and significant inhibition of carbon&#8208;carbon coupling. This study provides a paradigm for a deeper understanding of secondary metals in regulating the product selectivity of EAR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts for H2O2 Production: Linkage Position Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. However, the nature of organic polymers makes the balance between high activity and stability challenging. We demonstrate that the linkage position matters in the design of robust COF photocatalysts with durable high activity without sacrificial reagents. COFs with ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;linkages (o&#8208;COFs and p&#8208;COFs) were constructed by 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol with benzene&#8208;, pyridine&#8208;, pyrazine&#8208;orthodiamines and paradiamines. The pyrzaine&#8208;containing o&#8208;COFs with two pyridinic nitrogen atoms exhibited a H2O2 production rate of 4396&#160;&#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 together with long&#8208;time continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance in pure water (48 h), superior to the corresponding p&#8208;COFs. A four&#8208;step reaction mechanism is proposed by density function calculations. Moreover, the active sites and origin of stability enhancement for o&#8208;COFs are clarified. This work&#160;provides a simple and effective molecular design strategy in the design of&#160;robust COF photocatalysts for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Engineering for Oriented Crystal Growth toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anode for Aqueous Zinc Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn deposition with a surface&#8208;preferred (002) crystal plane has attracted extensive attention due to its inhibited dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the nucleation and growth of the Zn(002) crystal plane are closely related to the interfacial properties. Herein, oriented growth of Zn(002) crystal plane is realized on Ag&#8208;modified surface that is directly visualized by in situ atomic force microscopy. A solid solution HCP&#8208;Zn (~1.10 at.% solubility of Ag, 30 &#176;C) is formed on the Ag coated Zn foil (Zn@Ag) and possesses the same crystal structure as Zn to reduce its nucleation barrier caused by their lattice mismatch. It merits oriented Zn deposition and corrosion&#8208;resistant surface, and presents long cycling stability in symmetric cells and full cells coupled with V2O5 cathode. This work provides insights into interfacial regulation of Zn anodes for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Weakly Coordinating Diluent Modulated Solvation Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diluents have been extensively employed to overcome the disadvantages of high viscosity and sluggish kinetics of high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, but generally do not change the pristine solvation structure. Herein, a weakly coordinating diluent, hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (HFME), is applied to regulate the coordination of Na+ with diglyme and anion and form a diluent&#8208;participated solvate. This unique solvation structure promotes the accelerated decomposition of anions and diluents, with the construction of robust inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases. In addition, the introduction of HFME reduces the desolvation energy of Na+, improves ionic conductivity, strengthens the antioxidant, and enhances the safety of the electrolyte. As a result, the assembled Na||Na symmetric cell achieves a stable cycle of over 1800 h. The cell of Na||P&#8217;2&#8208;Na0.67MnO2 delivers a high capacity retention of 87.3% with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% after 350 cycles. This work provides valuable insights into solvation chemistry for advanced electrolyte engineering.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diluents have been extensively employed to overcome the disadvantages of high viscosity and sluggish kinetics of high-concentration electrolytes, but generally do not change the pristine solvation structure. Herein, a weakly coordinating diluent, hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (HFME), is applied to regulate the coordination of Na+ with diglyme and anion and form a diluent-participated solvate. This unique solvation structure promotes the accelerated decomposition of anions and diluents, with the construction of robust inorganic-rich electrode-electrolyte interphases. In addition, the introduction of HFME reduces the desolvation energy of Na+, improves ionic conductivity, strengthens the antioxidant, and enhances the safety of the electrolyte. As a result, the assembled Na||Na symmetric cell achieves a stable cycle of over 1800 h. The cell of Na||P&#8217;2-Na0.67MnO2 delivers a high capacity retention of 87.3% with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% after 350 cycles. This work provides valuable insights into solvation chemistry for advanced electrolyte engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upcycling of Carbon Fiber/Thermoset Composites into High&#8208;Performance Elastomers and Repurposed Carbon Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recycling of carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composites (CFRCs) based on thermosetting plastics is difficult. In the present study, high&#8208;performance CFRCs are fabricated through complexation of aromatic pinacol&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polyurethane (PU&#8208;AP) thermosets with carbon fiber (CF) cloths. PU&#8208;AP thermosets exhibit a breaking strength of 95.5 MPa and toughness of 473.6 MJ m&#8208;3 and contain abundant hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups, which can have strong adhesion with CFs. Because of the high interfacial adhesion between CF cloths and PU&#8208;AP thermosets and high toughness of PU&#8208;AP thermosets, CF/PU&#8208;AP composites possess a high tensile strength of &gt;870 MPa. Upon heating in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAc) at 100 &#176;C, the aromatic pinacols in the CF/PU&#8208;AP composites can be cleaved, generating non&#8208;destructive CF cloths and linear polymers that can be converted to high&#8208;performance elastomers. The elastomers are mechanically robust, healable, reprocessable, and damage&#8208;resistant with an extremely high tensile strength of 74.2 MPa and fracture energy of 149.6 kJ m&#8208;2. As a result, dissociation of CF/PU&#8208;AP composites enables the recovery of reusable CF cloths and high&#8208;performance elastomers, thus realizing the upcycling of CF/PU&#8208;AP composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecule and Microstructure Modulations of Cyano&#8208;Containing Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Fully Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyano&#8208;containing electrodes usually promise high theoretical potentials while suffering from uncontrollable self&#8208;dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, to remedy their limitations, an unprecedented core&#8208;shell heterostructured electrode of carbon nanotubes encapsulated in poly(1,4&#8208;dicyanoperfluorobenzene sulfide) (CNT@PFDCB) is rationally crafted via molecule and microstructure modulations. Specifically, the linkage of sulfide bridges of PFDCB prevents the active cyano groups from dissolving, resulting in a robust structure. The fluorinations modulate the electronic configurations in frontier orbitals, allowing higher electrical conductivity and elevated output voltage. Combined with the core&#8208;shell architecture to unlock the sluggish diffusion kinetics for both electrons and guest ions, the CNT@PFDCB exhibits an impressive capacity (203.5 mAh g&#8208;1), remarkable rate ability (127.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 3.0 A g&#8208;1), and exceptional cycling stability (retaining 81.1% capacity after 3000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8208;1). Additionally, the Li&#8208;storage mechanisms regarding PFDCB are thoroughly revealed by in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations, which involve the coordination interaction between Li ions and cyano groups and the electron delocalization along the conjugated skeleton. More importantly, a practical fully organic cell based on the CNT@PFDCB is well&#8208;validated that demonstrates a tremendous potential of cyanopolymer as the cathode to replace its inorganic counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Fluoroalkylation through Ligand Coupling Reaction of Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand coupling on hypervalent main group elements has emerged as a pivotal methodology for the synthesis of functionalized N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds in recent years due to the avoidance of transition metals and the mildness of the reaction conditions. In this direction, the reaction of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfur(IV) and N&#8208;heteroaryl phosphorus(V) compounds has been well studied. However, the ligand coupling of sulfur(VI) is still underdeveloped and the reaction of alkyl N&#8208;heteroarylsulfones is still elusive, which does not match the high status of sulfones as the chemical chameleons in organic synthesis. Here we present a ligand coupling&#8208;enabled formal SO2 extrusion of fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;azaheteroarylsulfones under the promotion of Grignard reagents, which not only enriches the chemistry of sulfones, but also provides a novel and practical synthetic tool towards N&#8208;heteroaromatic fluoroalkylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Abiotic Methane Production Driven by Ubiquitous Non&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Type Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abiotic CH4 production driven by Fenton&#8208;type reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been confirmed to be an indispensable component of the atmospheric CH4 budget. While the chemical reactions independent of Fenton chemistry to ROS are ubiquitous in nature, it remains unknown whether the produced ROS can drive abiotic CH4 production. Here, we first demonstrated the abiotic CH4 production at the soil&#8210;water interface under illumination. Leveraging this finding, polymeric carbon nitrides (CNx) as a typical analogue of natural geobattery material and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a natural methyl donor were used to unravel the underlying mechanisms. We revealed that the ROS, photocatalytically produced by CNx, can oxidize DMSO into CH4 with a high selectivity of 91.5%. Such an abiotic CH4 production process was further expanded to various non&#8208;Fenton&#8208;type reaction systems, such as electrocatalysis, pyrocatalysis and sonocatalysis. This work provides insights into the geochemical cycle of abiotic CH4, and offers a new route to CH4 production via integrated energy development.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Overall Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxygen reduction to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a promising route to providing oxidants for various industrial applications. However, the lack of well&#8208;designed photocatalysts for efficient overall H2O2 production in pure water has impeded ongoing research and practical thrusts. Here we present a cyanide&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TBTN&#8208;COFs) combining 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TBTN) and Benzotrithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;Tricarbaldehyde (BTT) building blocks with water&#8208;affinity and charge&#8208;separation. The ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (&lt;500 fs) and prolonged excited state lifetime (748 ps) can be realized by TBTN&#8208;COF, resulting in a hole accumulated BTT and electron&#8208;rich TBTN building block. Under one sun, the 11013 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 yield rate of H2O2 can be achieved without any sacrificial agent, outperforming most previous reports. Furthermore, the DFT calculation and in&#8208;situ DRIFTS spectrums suggesting a Yeager&#8208;type absorption of *O2 intermediate in the cyanide active site, which prohibits the formation of superoxide radical and revealing a favored H2O2 production pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Ceramic Metal&#8208;Based Flow Battery Composite Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In metal&#8208;based flow battery, membranes significantly impact energy conversion efficiency and security. Unfortunately, damages to the membrane occur due to gradual accumulation of metal dendrites, causing short circuits and shortening cycle life. Herein, we developed a rigid hierarchical porous ceramic flow battery composite membrane with a sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;thick polyelectrolyte coating to achieve high ion selectivity and conductivity, to restrain dendrite, and to realize long cycle life and high areal capacity. An aqueous zinc&#8208;iron flow battery prepared using this membrane achieved an outstanding energy efficiency of &gt;80%, exhibiting excellent long&#8208;term stability (over 1000 h) and extremely high areal capacity (260 mAh cm&#8722;2). Low&#8208;field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, in situ infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR analysis, and nano&#8208;computed tomography revealed that the rigid hierarchical pore structures and numerous hydrogen bonding networks in the membrane contributed to the stable operation and superior battery performance. This study contributes to the development of next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based flow battery membranes for energy and power generation.</dc:description>

An aqueous zinc-iron flow battery prepared using this membrane achieved an outstanding energy efficiency of &amp;gt;80%, exhibiting excellent long-term stability (over 1000 h) and extremely high areal capacity (260 mAh cm&#8722;2). Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, in situ infrared spectroscopy, solid-state NMR analysis, and nano-computed tomography revealed that the rigid hierarchical pore structures and numerous hydrogen bonding networks in the membrane contributed to the stable operation and superior battery performance. This study contributes to the development of next-generation metal-based flow battery membranes for energy and power generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) Bond&#8208;Forming for the Synthesis of Skipped Dienes with Synergistic Aminocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8208;C bond&#8208;forming reactions represent a great challenge in homogeneous catalysis primarily due to a limited understanding of its mechanistic principles. Herein, we have developed an interesting catalytic strategy that leverages a synergistic combination of a dimeric manganese(I) catalyst and a chiral aminocatalyst to address this issue. A range of conjugated dienals and trienals can exclusively proceed 1,4&#8208;hydroalkenylation by using readily available aromatic and aliphatic alkenyl boronic acids as coupling partners, producing a rich library of skipped diene aldehydes in synthetically useful yields and high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, downstream transformations of these products can not only afford a concise approach to construct enantioenriched skipped trienes but also realize enantioselective total synthesis of analogues to (&#8208;)&#8208;Blepharocalyxin D in four steps. DFT calculations suggest the 1,4&#8208;hydroalkenylation is kinetically more favorable than 1,6&#8208;hydroalkenylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Activation of Nucleobases with Small Molecules for the Conditional Control of Antisense Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of azidomethylene (Azm)&#8208;caged nucleobases into morpholino oligonucleotides via solid phase synthesis, enabled by the unique compatibility of azides with P(V) chemistry, allowed for conditional control of antisense function. The developed Azm&#8208;caged MOs (azMOs) were readily activated by a small molecule phosphine trigger through a Staudinger reduction and exhibited robust knockdown of exogenous and endogenous genes in cells and aquatic embryos. Furthermore, orthogonal knockdown of two genes in zebrafish embryos were enabled through use of azMO in combination with a photoactivatable MO.







Abstract
Conditionally controlled antisense oligonucleotides provide precise interrogation of gene function at different developmental stages in animal models. Only one example of small molecule&#8208;induced activation of antisense function exist. This has been restricted to cyclic caged morpholinos that, based on sequence, can have significant background activity in the absence of the trigger. Here, we provide a new approach using azido&#8208;caged nucleobases that are site&#8208;specifically introduced into antisense morpholinos. The caging group design is a simple azidomethylene (Azm) group that, despite its very small size, efficiently blocks Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing in a programmable fashion. Furthermore, it undergoes facile decaging via Staudinger reduction when exposed to a small molecule phosphine, generating the native antisense oligonucleotide under conditions compatible with biological environments. We demonstrated small molecule&#8208;induced gene knockdown in mammalian cells, zebrafish embryos, and frog embryos. We validated the general applicability of this approach by targeting three different genes.

         <title>Light Enables the Cathodic Interface Reaction Reversibility in Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Granulate&#8208;like discharge products are randomly stacked on solid&#8208;state cathodes (SSCs), facilitating their accommodation and ensuring the effective triple&#8208;phase boundaries (TPBs) of SSLOBs, thereby improving the battery reversibility of light irradiation.







Abstract
Limited triple&#8208;phase boundaries arising from the accumulation of solid discharge product(s) in solid&#8208;state cathodes (SSCs) pose a challenge to high&#8208;property solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (SSLOBs). Light&#8208;assisted SSLOBs have been gradually explored as an ingenious system; however, the fundamental mechanisms of the SSCs interface behavior remain unclear. Here, we discovered that light assistance can enhance the fast inner&#8208;sphere charge transfer in SSCs and regulate the discharge products with spherical particles generated via the surface growth model. Moreover, the high photoelectron excitation and transportation capabilities of SSCs can retard cathodic catalytic decay by avoiding structural degradation of the cathode with a reduced charge voltage. The light&#8208;induced SSLOBs exhibited excellent stability (170&#8197;cycles) with a low discharge&#8211;charge polarization overpotential (0.27&#8197;V). Furthermore, transparent SSLOBs with exceptional flexibility, mechanical stability, and multiform shapes were fabricated for theory&#8208;to&#8208;practical applications in sunlight&#8208;induced batteries. Our study opens new opportunities for the introduction of solar energy into energy storage systems.

         <title>Colloidal Zeta Potential Modulation as a Handle to Control the Crystallization Kinetics of Tin Halide Perovskites for Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We provided a new method for accurately controlling the nucleation kinetics of tin halide perovskite films through modulating zeta potential of tin halide perovskite colloids. A fast nucleation rate was achieved by adding 3&#8208;aminopyrrolidine dihydroiodate (APDI2) in the precursor solution to change the zeta potential of the FASnI3 colloids. The high&#8208;quality tin halide perovskite film with APDI2 yields a high photovoltaic efficiency of 15.13&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tin halide perovskites (THPs) have demonstrated exceptional potential for various applications owing to their low toxicity and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the crystallization kinetics of THPs are less controllable than its lead counterpart because of the higher Lewis acidity of Sn2+, leading to THP films with poor morphology and rampant defects. Here, a colloidal zeta potential modulation approach is developed to improve the crystallization kinetics of THP films inspired by the classical Derjaguin&#8208;Landau&#8208;Verwey&#8208;Overbeek (DLVO) theory. After adding 3&#8208;aminopyrrolidine dihydro iodate (APDI2) in the precursor solution to change the zeta potential of the pristine colloids, the total interaction potential energy between colloidal particles with APDI2 could be controllably reduced, resulting in a higher coagulation probability and a lower critical nuclei concentration. In situ laser light scattering measurements confirmed the increased nucleation rate of the THP colloids with APDI2. The resulting film with APDI2 shows a pinhole&#8208;free morphology with fewer defects, achieving an impressive efficiency of 15.13&#8201;%.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the latest advances in data processing techniques for single&#8208;entity electrochemistry towards achieving automation, real&#8208;time monitoring, increased sensitivity, as well as improved temporal and current resolution.







Abstract
Single&#8208;entity electrochemistry is a powerful tool that enables the study of electrochemical processes at interfaces and provides insights into the intrinsic chemical and structural heterogeneities of individual entities. Signal processing is a critical aspect of single&#8208;entity electrochemical measurements and can be used for data recognition, classification, and interpretation. In this review, we summarize the recent five&#8208;year advances in signal processing techniques for single&#8208;entity electrochemistry and highlight their importance in obtaining high&#8208;quality data and extracting effective features from electrochemical signals, which are generally applicable in single&#8208;entity electrochemistry. Moreover, we shed light on electrochemical noise analysis to obtain single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint spectra that can provide rich information about the ion networks at the interface. By incorporating advanced data analysis tools and artificial intelligence algorithms, single&#8208;entity electrochemical measurements would revolutionize the field of single&#8208;entity analysis, leading to new fundamental discoveries.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Silole and Disila&#8208;Cyclooctene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silole derivatives and nanoribbon structures with eight&#8208;membered sila&#8208;cyclic rings were successfully synthesized on Au(111) through reactions between bromo&#8208;substituted molecules and silicon atoms. Their chemical structures were investigated by bond&#8208;resolved STM and DFT calculations. The band gaps of the silole derivatives and the nanoribbon measured with STS measurements were 3.1&#8197;eV and 2.5&#8197;eV, respectively.







Abstract
The incorporation of Si atoms into organic compounds significantly increases a variety of functionality, facilitating further applications. Recently, on&#8208;surface synthesis was introduced into organosilicon chemistry as 1,4&#8208;disilabenzene bridged nanostructures were obtained via coupling between silicon atoms and brominated phenyl groups at the ortho position on Au(111). Here, we demonstrate a high generality of this strategy via syntheses of silole derivatives and nanoribbon structures with eight&#8208;membered sila&#8208;cyclic rings from dibrominated molecules at the bay and peri positions on Au(111), respectively. Their structures and electronic properties were investigated by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This work demonstrates a great potential to deal with heavy group 14 elements in on&#8208;surface silicon chemistry.

         <title>A Conjugated Phenylene Nanocage with a Guest&#8208;Adaptive Deformable Cavity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated phenylene nanocage featuring a highly deformable cavity has been constructed from a pliable calix[6]arene moiety and a strained phenylene moiety. The cage contains a guest&#8208;adaptive cavity, the volume of which can expand by as much as 85&#8201;% upon complexation with fullerene guests of different sizes.







Abstract
The highly strained, phenylene&#8208;derived organic cages are typically regarded as very rigid entities, yet their deformation potential and supramolecular properties remain underexplored. Herein, we report a pliable conjugated phenylene nanocage by synergistically merging rigid and flexible building blocks. The anisotropic cage molecule contains branched phenylene chains capped by a calix[6]arene moiety, the delicate conformational changes of which endow the cage with a remarkably deformable cavity. When complexing with fullerene guests, the cage showcases excellent guest&#8208;adaptivity, with its cavity volume capable of swelling by as much as 85&#8201;%.

         <title>Expanded Azahelicenes with Large Dissymmetry Factors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded azahelicenes consisting of up to 43 rings are accessible by a facile synthesis. The enantiomers of the acquired azahelicenes exhibited large dissymmetry factors with up to 0.048 (gabs) and 0.021 (glum), respectively.







Abstract
Expanded azahelicenes, as heteroanalogues of helically chiral helicenes, hold significant potential for chiroptical materials. Nevertheless, their investigation and research have remained largely unexplored. Herein, we present the facile synthesis of a series of expanded azahelicenes NHn (n=1&#8211;5) consisting of 11, 19, 27, 35, and 43 fused rings, mainly by Suzuki coupling followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structures of NH2, NH3 and NH4 were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis, and their (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208; enantiomers were also isolated with chiral high performance liquid chromatography. The enantiomers exhibit large absorption (abs) and luminescence (lum) dissymmetry factors, with |gabs|max=0.044; |glum|max=0.003 for NH2, |gabs|max=0.048; |glum|=0.014 for NH3, and |gabs|max=0.043; |glum|max=0.021 for NH4, which are superior to their respective all&#8208;carbon analogues.

         <title>Electrostatic Field in Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis Driven C&#8722;F Bond Cleavage of Perfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel approach using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as the catalyst under low frequency ultrasound irradiation to degrade perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). A strong interfacial electrostatic field (IEF) on PTFE surface has shown great success in triggering C&#8722;F bond cleavage and achieving near&#8208;complete defluorination. This catalytic mechanism brings new PFASs treatment technologies for sustainable demands.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent and toxic to human health. It is demanding for high&#8208;efficient and green technologies to remove PFASs from water. In this study, a novel PFAS treatment technology was developed, utilizing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles (1&#8211;5&#8197;&#956;m) as the catalyst and a low frequency ultrasound (US, 40&#8197;kHz, 0.3&#8197;W/cm2) for activation. Remarkably, this system can induce near&#8208;complete defluorination for different structured PFASs. The underlying mechanism relies on contact electrification between PTFE and water, which induces cumulative electrons on PTFE surface, and creates a high surface voltage (tens of volts). Such high surface voltage can generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS, i.e., O2&#8901;&#8722;, HO&#8901;, etc.) and a strong interfacial electrostatic field (IEF of 109~1010&#8197;V/m). Consequently, the strong IEF significantly activates PFAS molecules and reduces the energy barrier of O2&#8901;&#8722; nucleophilic reaction. Simultaneously, the co&#8208;existence of surface electrons (PTFE*(e&#8722;)) and HO&#8901; enables synergetic reduction and oxidation of PFAS and its intermediates, leading to enhanced and thorough defluorination. The US/PTFE method shows compelling advantages of low energy consumption, zero chemical input, and few harmful intermediates. It offers a new and promising solution for effectively treating the PFAS&#8208;contaminated drinking water.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Host&#8211;Microbe Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals Ferroptosis&#8208;Associated Heterogeneity during Acinetobacter baumannii Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated scRandom&#8208;seq, a new high&#8208;throughput Random primer&#8208;based host&#8211;microbe dual single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing technology, and applied this technology to an Acinetobacter baumannii (A.b) infection model. We witnessed the ferroptosis&#8208;associated heterogeneity in host cells for the first time, which suggests that ferroptosis may become a new clinical target for resisting A.b infection.







Abstract
Interactions between host and bacterial cells are integral to human physiology. The complexity of host&#8211;microbe interactions extends to different cell types, spatial aspects, and phenotypic heterogeneity, requiring high&#8208;resolution approaches to capture their full complexity. The latest breakthroughs in single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) have opened up a new era of studies in host&#8211;pathogen interactions. Here, we first report a high&#8208;throughput cross&#8208;species dual scRNA&#8208;seq technology by using random primers to simultaneously capture both eukaryotic and bacterial RNAs (scRandom&#8208;seq). Using reference cells, scRandom&#8208;seq can detect individual eukaryotic and bacterial cells with high throughput and high specificity. Acinetobacter baumannii (A.b) is a highly opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen that displays resistance to many antibiotics, posing a significant threat to human health, calling for discoveries and treatment. In the A.b infection model, scRandom&#8208;seq witnessed polarization of THP&#8208;1 derived&#8208;macrophages and the intracellular A.b&#8208;induced ferroptosis&#8208;stress in host cells. The inhibition of ferroptosis by Ferrostatin&#8208;1 (Fer&#8208;1) resulted in the improvement of cell vitality and resistance to A.b infection, indicating the potential to resist related infections. scRandom&#8208;seq provides a high&#8208;throughput cross&#8208;species dual single&#8208;cell RNA profiling tool that will facilitate future discoveries in unraveling the complex interactions of host&#8211;microbe interactions in infection systems and tumor micro&#8208;environments.

Here, we first report a high-throughput cross-species dual scRNA-seq technology by using random primers to simultaneously capture both eukaryotic and bacterial RNAs (scRandom-seq). Using reference cells, scRandom-seq can detect individual eukaryotic and bacterial cells with high throughput and high specificity. &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;A.b&lt;/i&gt;) is a highly opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen that displays resistance to many antibiotics, posing a significant threat to human health, calling for discoveries and treatment. In the &lt;i&gt;A.b&lt;/i&gt; infection model, scRandom-seq witnessed polarization of THP-1 derived-macrophages and the intracellular &lt;i&gt;A.b&lt;/i&gt;-induced ferroptosis-stress in host cells. The inhibition of ferroptosis by Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) resulted in the improvement of cell vitality and resistance to &lt;i&gt;A.b&lt;/i&gt; infection, indicating the potential to resist related infections. scRandom-seq provides a high-throughput cross-species dual single-cell RNA profiling tool that will facilitate future discoveries in unraveling the complex interactions of host&#8211;microbe interactions in infection systems and tumor micro-environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Regulated Synthetic Channels: Enabling Reversible Ion Transport by Modulating the Ion&#8208;Permeation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible redox&#8208;regulated ion transport has been achieved by rebuilding the gating module of natural redox&#8208;regulated channel proteins within an artificial system. The disulfide bonds in these artificial channels can serve as redox&#8208;tunable switches to regulate the formation and disruption of ion&#8208;permeation pathways, thereby achieving a transition of the transmembrane transport process between ON and OFF states.







Abstract
Natural redox&#8208;regulated channel proteins often utilize disulfide bonds as redox sensors for adaptive regulation of channel conformations in response to diverse physiological environments. In this study, we developed novel synthetic ion channels capable of reversibly switching their ion&#8208;transport capabilities by incorporating multiple disulfide bonds into artificial systems. X&#8208;ray structural analysis and electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that these disulfide&#8208;bridged molecules possess well&#8208;defined tubular cavities and can be efficiently inserted into lipid bilayers to form artificial ion channels. More importantly, the disulfide bonds in these molecules serve as redox&#8208;tunable switches to regulate the formation and disruption of ion&#8208;permeation pathways, thereby achieving a transition in the transmembrane transport process between the ON and OFF states.

         <title>A Powerful Strategy for Synthesizing Block Copolymers via Bimetallic Synergistic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful strategy for efficiently constructing block copolymers, comprising polyacrylate&#8208; and epoxide&#8208;derived polymer segments, via a bimetallic synergistic catalysis. The high compatibility with a wide range of monomers enables the synthesis of block copolymers with diverse structures.







Abstract
Block copolymers, comprising polyether and polyolefin segments, are an important and promising category of functional materials. However, the lack of efficient strategies for the construction of polyether&#8208;b&#8208;polyolefin block copolymers have hindered the development of these materials. Herein, we propose a simple and efficient method to obtain various block copolymers through the copolymerization of epoxides and acrylates via bimetallic synergistic catalysis. The copolymerization of epoxides and acrylates proceeds in a sequence&#8208;controlled manner, where the epoxides&#8208;involved homo&#8208; or copolymerization occurs first, followed by the homopolymerization of acrylates initiated by the alkoxide species from the propagating polymer chain, thus yielding copolymers with a block structure. Notably, the high monomer compatibility of this powerful strategy provides a platform for synthesizing various polyacrylate&#8208;based block copolymers comprising polyether, polycarbonate, polythiocarbonate, polyester, and polyurethane segments, respectively.

         <title>Bipolar Polymeric Protective Layer for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Corrosion&#8208;Resistant Lithium Metal Anode in Ethylene Carbonate Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar polymeric protective layer (BPPL) is developed using cyanoethyl (&#8722;CH2CH2C&#8801;N) and hydroxyl (&#8722;OH) polar groups, aiming to prevent EC&#8208;induced corrosion and facilitating rapid, uniform Li+ ion transport, where the polar hydroxyl group provides hydrogen bonding interactions between bipolar polymer and carbonate solvent, which effectively facilitates the Li+ desolvation, and traps free solvent molecules to block side reactions. The polar cyanoethyl group anchors anions to polymer chains through ion&#8208;dipole interactions, improving Li+ migration and restraining Li dendrite growth.







Abstract
The unstable interface between Li metal and ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;based electrolytes triggers continuous side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth, significantly impacting the lifespan of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a bipolar polymeric protective layer (BPPL) is developed using cyanoethyl (&#8722;CH2CH2C&#8801;N) and hydroxyl (&#8722;OH) polar groups, aiming to prevent EC&#8208;induced corrosion and facilitating rapid, uniform Li+ ion transport. Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between &#8722;OH and EC facilitates the Li+ desolvation process and effectively traps free EC molecules, thereby eliminating parasitic reactions. Meanwhile, the &#8722;CH2CH2C&#8801;N group anchors TFSI&#8722; anions through ion&#8208;dipole interactions, enhancing Li+ transport and eliminating concentration polarization, ultimately suppressing the growth of Li dendrite. This BPPL enabling Li|Li cell stable cycling over 750 cycles at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Li|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and Li|LiFePO4 full cells display superior electrochemical performance. The BPPL provides a practical strategy to enhanced stability and performance in LMBs application.

         <title>Chloride and Hydride Transfer as Keys to Catalytic Upcycling of Polyethylene into Liquid Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient LDPE deconstruction into liquid alkanes is feasible at near&#8208;room temperature with anhydrous aluminum chloride and gallium chloride. Carbenium ion initiation and hydride transfer govern the rates, conversion, and selectivity of cracking and alkylation reactions. The polar environment created by Lewis acids stabilizes carbenium ions and catalyzes hydride transfer, facilitating C&#8722;C bond cleavage in LDPE during cracking and promoting C&#8722;C bond formation during alkylation.







Abstract
Transforming polyolefin waste into liquid alkanes through tandem cracking&#8208;alkylation reactions catalyzed by Lewis&#8208;acid chlorides offers an efficient route for single&#8208;step plastic upcycling. Lewis acids in dichloromethane establish a polar environment that stabilizes carbenium ion intermediates and catalyzes hydride transfer, enabling breaking of polyethylene C&#8722;C bonds and forming C&#8722;C bonds in alkylation. Here, we show that efficient and selective deconstruction of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) to liquid alkanes is achieved with anhydrous aluminum chloride (AlCl3) and gallium chloride (GaCl3). Already at 60&#8201;&#176;C, complete LDPE conversion was achieved, while maintaining the selectivity for gasoline&#8208;range liquid alkanes over 70&#8201;%. AlCl3 showed an exceptional conversion rate of 5000 
, surpassing other Lewis acid catalysts by two orders of magnitude. Through kinetic and mechanistic studies, we show that the rates of LDPE conversion do not correlate directly with the intrinsic strength of the Lewis acids or steric constraints that may limit the polymer to access the Lewis acid sites. Instead, the rates for the tandem processes of cracking and alkylation are primarily governed by the rates of initiation of carbenium ions and the subsequent intermolecular hydride transfer. Both jointly control the relative rates of cracking and alkylation, thereby determining the overall conversion and selectivity.

Lewis acids in dichloromethane establish a polar environment that stabilizes carbenium ion intermediates and catalyzes hydride transfer, enabling breaking of polyethylene C&#8722;C bonds and forming C&#8722;C bonds in alkylation. Here, we show that efficient and selective deconstruction of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to liquid alkanes is achieved with anhydrous aluminum chloride (AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and gallium chloride (GaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Already at 60&#8201;&#176;C, complete LDPE conversion was achieved, while maintaining the selectivity for gasoline-range liquid alkanes over 70&#8201;%. AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; showed an exceptional conversion rate of 5000 
, surpassing other Lewis acid catalysts by two orders of magnitude. Through kinetic and mechanistic studies, we show that the rates of LDPE conversion do not correlate directly with the intrinsic strength of the Lewis acids or steric constraints that may limit the polymer to access the Lewis acid sites. Instead, the rates for the tandem processes of cracking and alkylation are primarily governed by the rates of initiation of carbenium ions and the subsequent intermolecular hydride transfer. Both jointly control the relative rates of cracking and alkylation, thereby determining the overall conversion and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Carbon Dioxide/Lithium Oxalate Regulation toward Advanced Aprotic Lithium Carbon Dioxide Battery</title>

The &#8220;trinity&#8221; strategy provides a new perspective for the development of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. The addition of a soluble mediator, TEM RM, was used to modulate the three&#8208;phase interface and facilitate the conversion of CO2 to Li2C2O4. This strategy avoids a series of issues associated with the Li2CO3 product, contributing to excellent cycling performance for Li&#8722;CO2 battery.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries have received significant attention owing to their advantages of combining greenhouse gas utilization and energy storage. However, the high kinetic barrier between gaseous CO2 and the Li2CO3 product leads to a low operating voltage (&lt;2.5&#8197;V) and poor energy efficiency. In addition, the reversibility of Li2CO3 has always been questioned owing to the introduction of more decomposition paths caused by its higher charging plateau. Here, a novel &#8220;trinity&#8221; Li&#8722;CO2 battery system was developed by synergizing CO2, soluble redox mediator (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidoxyl, as TEM RM), and reduced graphene oxide electrode to enable selective conversion of CO2 to Li2C2O4. The designed Li&#8722;CO2 battery exhibited an output plateau reaching up to 2.97&#8197;V, higher than the equilibrium potential of 2.80&#8197;V for Li2CO3, and an ultrahigh round&#8208;trip efficiency of 97.1&#8201;%. The superior performance of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries is attributed to the TEM RM&#8208;mediated preferential growth mechanism of Li2C2O4, which enhances the reaction kinetics and rechargeability. Such a unique design enables batteries to cope with sudden CO2&#8208;deficient environments, which provides an avenue for the rationally design of CO2 conversion reactions and a feasible guide for next&#8208;generation Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Reactivity of Superbasic Carbanions Generated via Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover in the Context of Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic reactions with a reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) involve intermediates with carbanionic reactivity. These are best described as free carbanions. Reactions with such carbanions depend on the balance between their nucleophilicity and basicity. Deprotonation of reaction partners and common organic solvents such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide is the main competing reaction to nucleophilic addition.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reactions involving a reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) generate intermediates with carbanionic reactivity. Many of these proposed intermediates resemble highly reactive organometallic compounds. However, conditions of their formation are generally not tolerated by their isolated organometallic versions and often a different reactivity is observed. Our investigations on their nature and reactivity under commonly used photocatalytic conditions demonstrate that these intermediates are indeed best described as free, superbasic carbanions capable of deprotonating common polar solvents usually assumed to be inert such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide. Their basicity not only towards solvents but also towards electrophiles, such as aldehydes, ketones, and esters, is comparable to the reactivity of isolated carbanions in the gas&#8208;phase. Previously unsuccessful transformations thought to result from a lack of reactivity are explained by their high reactivity towards the solvent and weakly acidic protons of reaction partners. An intuitive explanation for the mode of action of photocatalytically generated carbanions is provided, which enables methods to verify reaction mechanisms proposed to involve an RRPCO step and to identify the reasons for the limitations of current methods.

         <title>Ostwald ripening for designing time&#8208;dependent crystal hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable fibrous crystal networks form within hydrogels via a growing process involving polymer&#8208;induced mismatching nucleation, stiffening the hydrogels. These fibrous crystals would undergo Ostwald ripening and convert into stable bulk crystals. A remarkable reduction in material stiffness and interfacial adhesion is observed in this process, suggesting a time&#8208;dependent mechanism to program hydrogel properties.







Abstract
Ostwald ripening (OR), a classic solution theory describing molecular transfer from metastable crystal to stable one, is applied to design time&#8208;dependent crystal hydrogels that can automatically change their mechanical properties. Using a system made from crosslinked polyacrylamide (PAM) and sodium acetate (NaAc), we demonstrate that metastable fibrous crystal networks of NaAc preferably form in PAM hydrogels via a polymer&#8208;involving mismatch nucleation. These fibrous crystals would undergo OR and evolve into isolated bulk crystals, leading to a significant reduction in material rigidity (179&#8197;folds) and interfacial adhesion (20&#8197;folds). This transformation can be applied to program time&#8208;dependent self&#8208;recovery in shape and self&#8208;delamination. Since OR is a ubiquitous, robust feature of various crystals, the approach reported here represents a new direction for designing advanced transient soft materials.

         <title>Intramolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions Organize Bowl&#8208;Shaped, Luminescent Molecular Containers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular multiple cation&#8208;&#960; interactions and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8722; hydrogen bonds have been used to generate bowl&#8208;shaped molecular containers that show high binding affinities for halide ions and luminescent properties. This efficient approach opens up a new avenue for exploring the synthesis of functional molecules.







Abstract
Molecules with nonplanar architectures are highly desirable due to their unique topological structures and functions. We report here the synthesis of two molecular containers (1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3Br&#8722; and 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3Cl&#8722;), which utilize intramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions to enforce macrocylic arrangements and exhibit high binding affinity and luminescent properties. Remarkably, the geometry of the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction can be flexibly tailored to achieve a precise ring arrangement, irrespective of the angle of the noncovalent bonds. Additionally, the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8722; hydrogen bonds within the container are also conducive to stabilizing the bowl&#8208;shaped conformation. These bowl&#8208;shaped conformations were confirmed both in solution through NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by X&#8208;ray studies. 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3Br&#8722; shows high binding affinity and selectivity: F&#8722;&gt;Cl&#8722;, through C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X&#8722; (X=F, Cl) hydrogen bonds. Additionally, these containers exhibited blue fluorescence in solution and yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the solid state. Our findings illustrate the utility of cation&#8208;&#960; interactions in designing functional molecules.

         <title>Mechanochemical Approaches to Fundamental Studies in Soft&#8208;Matter Physics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TOC summary: The promise of polymer mechanochemistry to improve mechanical properties of polymers is widely recognized. This review highlights a complementary, so&#8208;far underexploited, potential of this emerging field to yield quantitative molecular insights into many complex physical problems in soft matter, of both practical and fundamental significance, including fractures of mechanically&#8208;loaded materials and dynamics of macromolecules in rapid flows.







Abstract
Stretching a segment of a polymer beyond its contour length makes its (primarily backbone) bonds more dissociatively labile, which enables polymer mechanochemistry. Integrating some backbone bonds into suitably designed molecular moieties yields mechanistically and kinetically diverse chemistry, which is becoming increasingly exploitable. Examples include, most prominently, attempts to improve mechanical properties of bulk polymers, as well as prospective applications in drug delivery and synthesis. This review aims to highlight an emerging effort to apply the concepts and experimental tools of mechanochemistry to fundamental physical questions in soft matter. A succinct summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;knowledge of the field, with emphasis on foundational concepts and generalizable observations, is followed by analysis of 3 recent examples of mechanochemistry yielding molecular&#8208;level details of elastomer failure, macromolecular chain dynamics in elongational flows and kinetic allostery. We conclude with reasons to assume that the highlighted approaches are generalizable to a broader range of physical problems than considered to date.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Directed Attachment of Hydroxylamines to Specific Lysines of IgG Antibodies for Bioconjugations with Acylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic peptide directs the covalent attachment of a hydroxylamine to specific lysine residues of the fragment crystallizable region of antibodies, and is cleaved upon potassium acyltrifluoroborate (KAT) ligation under physiological conditions in a traceless fashion. This convenient approach to the direct conjugation of commercial IgG antibodies is suitable for the formation of antibody&#8211;drug, antibody&#8211;protein, and antibody&#8211;DNA conjugates.







Abstract
The role of monoclonal antibodies as vehicles to deliver payloads has evolved as a powerful tool in cancer therapy in recent years. The clinical development of therapeutic antibody conjugates with precise payloads holds great promise for targeted therapeutic interventions. The use of affinity&#8208;peptide mediated functionalization of native off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf antibodies offers an effective approach to selectively modify IgG antibodies with a drug&#8211;antibody ratio (DAR) of 2. Here, we report the traceless, peptide&#8208;directed attachment of two hydroxylamines to native IgGs followed by chemoselective potassium acyltrifluoroborate (KAT) ligation with quinolinium acyltrifluoroborates (QATs), which provide enhanced ligation rates with hydroxylamines under physiological conditions. By applying KAT ligation to the modified antibodies, conjugation of small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides to off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf IgGs proceeds efficiently, in good yields, and with simultaneous cleavage of the affinity peptide&#8208;directing moiety.

         <title>Cyclic Amine Synthesis via Catalytic Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic amine synthesis has been achieved by a catalytic radical&#8208;polar crossover cycloaddition (RPCC) triggered from primary sulfonamide under photoredox condition. The newly developed disconnection allows to construct &#946;, &#946;&#8208;disubstituted and &#946;&#8208;monosubstituted cyclic amines. This study highlights the unique utility of primary sulfonamides as bifunctional reagents, which act as radical precursors and nucleophiles.







Abstract
The rapid assembly of valuable cyclic amine architectures in a single step from simple precursors has been recognized as an ideal platform in term of efficiency and sustainability. Although a vast number of studies regarding cyclic amine synthesis has been reported, new synthetic disconnection approaches are still high in demand. Herein, we report a catalytic radical&#8208;polar crossover cycloaddition to cyclic amine synthesis triggered from primary sulfonamide under photoredox condition. This newly developed disconnection, comparable to established synthetic approaches, will allow to construct &#946;, &#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclic amine and &#946;&#8208;monosubstituted cyclic amine derivatives efficiently. This study highlights the unique utility of primary sulfonamide as a bifunctional reagent, which acts as a radical precursor and a nucleophile. The open&#8208;shell methodology demonstrates broad tolerance to various functional groups, drug derivatives and natural products in an economically and sustainable fashion.

         <title>Redesigned Nylon 6 Variants with Enhanced Recyclability, Ductility, and Transparency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geminal disubstitution on &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam (nylon&#8197;6&#8217;s monomer) at different positions greatly modulates lactam monomer's reactivity and gem&#8208;nylon's performance properties, with dimethylation at the &#947; position yielding the most intriguing nylon that exhibits a combination of desired properties including enhanced chemical recyclability, mechanical ductility, and optical clarity, compared to commercial nylon&#8197;6.







Abstract
Geminal (gem&#8722;) disubstitution in heterocyclic monomers is an effective strategy to enhance polymer chemical recyclability by lowering their ceiling temperatures. However, the effects of specific substitution patterns on the monomer's reactivity and the resulting polymer's properties are largely unexplored. Here we show that, by systematically installing gem&#8208;dimethyl groups onto &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam (monomer of nylon&#8197;6) from the &#945; to &#1013; positions, both the redesigned lactam monomer's reactivity and the resulting gem&#8208;nylon&#8197;6&#8217;s properties are highly sensitive to the substitution position, with the monomers ranging from non&#8208;polymerizable to polymerizable and the gem&#8208;nylon properties ranging from inferior to far superior to the parent nylon&#8197;6. Remarkably, the nylon&#8197;6 with the gem&#8208;dimethyls substituted at the &#947; position is amorphous and optically transparent, with a higher Tg (by 30&#8201;&#176;C), yield stress (by 1.5&#8197;MPa), ductility (by 3&#215;), and lower depolymerization temperature (by 60&#8201;&#176;C) than conventional nylon&#8197;6.

         <title>Palladium (II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation with Bifunctional Ligands: From Curiosity to Industrialization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In 2001, our curiosity about the stereochemistry of Pd C&#8722;H metalation prompted our research into Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. Since then, we have developed many new strategies to solve the four central challenges of reactivity, site&#8208;selectivity, enantioselectivity, and practicality.







Abstract
In 2001, our curiosity to understand the stereochemistry of C&#8722;H metalation with Pd prompted our first studies in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation (RSC Research appointment: 020 7451 2545, Grant: RG 36873, Dec. 2002). We identified four central challenges: 1.&#8197;poor reactivity of simple Pd salts with native substrates; 2.&#8197;few strategies to control site selectivity for remote C&#8722;H bonds; 3.&#8197;the lack of chiral catalysts to achieve enantioselectivity via asymmetric C&#8722;H metalation, and 4.&#8197;low practicality due to limited coupling partner scope and the use of specialized oxidants. These challenges necessitated new strategies in catalyst and reaction development. For reactivity, we developed approaches to enhance substrate&#8211;catalyst affinity together with novel bifunctional ligands which participate in and accelerate the C&#8722;H cleavage step. For site&#8208;selectivity, we introduced the concept of systematically modulating the distance and geometry between a directing template, catalyst, and substrate to selectively access remote C&#8722;H bonds. For enantioselectivity, we devised predictable stereomodels for catalyst&#8208;controlled enantioselective C&#8722;H activation based on the participation of bifunctional ligands. Finally, for practicality, we have developed varied catalytic manifolds for Pd(II) to accommodate diverse coupling partners while employing practical oxidants such as simple peroxides. These advances have culminated in numerous C&#8722;H activation reactions, setting the stage for broad industrial applications.

         <title>Observation of Iron with Eight Coordination in Iron Trifluoride under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diminutive ionic radius of fluorine implies probable hypercoordination in Fe&#8722;F systems. Employing sophisticated crystal structure prediction and high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature experiments, a stable orthorhombic phase of FeF3 featuring rare 8&#8208;coordinated Fe is revealed under extreme conditions. This discovery advances comprehension of iron&#8208;based structure and contributes to exploring chemical hypercoordination phenomena.







Abstract
The chemistry of hypercoordination has been a subject of fundamental interest, especially for understanding structures that challenge conventional wisdom. The small ionic radii of Fe ions typically result in coordination numbers of 4 or 6 in stable Fe&#8208;bearing ionic compounds. While 8&#8208;coordinated Fe has been observed in highly compressed oxides, the pursuit of hypercoordinated Fe still faces significant challenges due to the complexity of synthesizing the anticipated compound with another suitable anion. Through first&#8208;principles simulation and advanced crystal structure prediction methods, we predict that an orthorhombic phase of FeF3 with exclusively 8&#8208;coordinated Fe is energetically stable above 18&#8197;GPa&#8212;a pressure more feasibly achieved compared to oxides. Inspired by this theoretical result, we conducted extensive experiments using a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell technique to investigate the crystal structures of FeF3 at high&#8208;pressure conditions. We successfully synthesized the predicted orthorhombic phase of FeF3 at 46&#8197;GPa, as confirmed by in situ experimental X&#8208;ray diffraction data. This work establishes a new ionic compound featuring rare 8&#8208;coordinated Fe in a simple binary Fe&#8208;bearing system and paves the way for discovering Fe hypercoordination in similar systems.

         <dc:description>
The first general method for accessing various potentially valuable and hitherto elusive trifluoromethyl carboxylic esters through the challenging O&#8208;trifluoromethylation of carboxylic acids is reported. The activation effect of ZnCl2 on acyloxy(phenyltrifluoromethyl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes has been studied by DFT calculations and control experiments. The reaction can be used for late&#8208;stage modification of drugs and bioactive carboxylic acids as well.







Abstract
Here we report the challenging O&#8208;trifluoromethylation of carboxylic acids via the formation and activation of acyloxy(phenyl)trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes. The method provides an easy access to various potentially valuable and hitherto elusive trifluoromethyl carboxylic esters. A remarkably wide range of substrates with commonly encountered functional groups are compatible with this reaction, including aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids, as well as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs and pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The reaction mechanism and the origins of the enhanced reactivity by zinc chloride (ZnCl2) were discussed from experimental evidence and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Oxo Electronic Tuning via In Situ CO Decoration for Promoting Methane Conversion to Oxygenates over Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ CO decoration can significantly tune the electronic state of metal&#8208;oxo center in single&#8208;atom catalysts for promoting oxygenates production. CO activated Pd1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 displays the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&#8722;1 and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H2O2 as oxidant at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Direct methane conversion (DMC) to oxygenates at low temperature is of great value but remains challenging due to the high energy barrier for C&#8722;H bond activation. Here, we report that in situ decoration of Pd1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 single atom catalyst (SAC) by CO molecules significantly promoted the DMC reaction, giving the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&#8722;1 ever reported at room temperature and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H2O2 as oxidant. Combined characterizations and DFT calculations illustrate that the C&#8208;atom of CO prefers to coordinate with Pd1, which donates electrons to the Pd1&#8722;O active center (L&#8722;Pd1&#8722;O, L=CO) generated by H2O2 oxidation. The correspondingly improved electron density over Pd&#8722;O pair renders a favorable heterolytic dissociation of C&#8722;H bond with low energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV. Applying CO decoration strategy to M1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 (M=Pd, Rh, Ru, Fe) enables improvement of oxygenates productivity by 3.2&#8211;11.3&#8197;times, highlighting the generalizability of this method in tuning metal&#8208;oxo electronic structure of SACs for efficient DMC process.

         <title>Depicting the Chemical Diversity of Bioactive Meroterpenoids Produced by the Largest Organism on Earth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids from Armillaria ostoyae in liquid and solid fermentations yielded 17 new and 21 known derivatives. A compound library enabled metabolomics, unveiling production patterns under varied culture conditions. Assessment of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, aided by innovative chemoinformatics, offered insight into structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
In this investigation, we explored the diversity of melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids produced by Armillaria ostoyae, one of the largest and oldest organisms on Earth, using extracts from liquid and solid fermentation media. The study unveiled three unprecedented dimeric bismelleolides and three novel fatty&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted congeners, along with 11 new and 21 known derivatives. The structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and HRESI&#8208;MS, and ROESY spectral analysis for relative configurations. Absolute configurations were determined from crystal structures and through ECD spectra comparison. A compound library of melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids facilitated metabolomics&#8208;wide associations, revealing production patterns under different culture conditions. The library enabled assessments of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, revealing that the &#916;2,4 double bond is not crucial for antifungal activity. Cytotoxicity was linked to the presence of an aldehyde at C1, but lost with hydroxylation at C13. Chemoinformatic analyses demonstrated the intricate interplay of chemical modifications on biological properties. This study marks the first systematic exploration of Armillaria spp. meroterpenoid diversity by MS&#8208;based untargeted metabolomics, offering insight into structure&#8211;activity relationships through innovative chemoinformatics.

         <title>Photoresponsive Covalent Organic Frameworks: Visible&#8208;Light Controlled Conversion of Porous Structures and Its Impacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of photoresponsive porous frameworks were created by integrating protruded tetrafluoroazobenzene units onto pore walls of 1D channels, constructing a broad spectrum of photoresponsive pores. The frameworks are highly sensitive to visible lights, convert pores into new ones via photoisomerization, and achieve benchmark changes in pore size, shape, number, and environment as well as gas uptake and release, opening a way to novel smart porous materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks are a novel class of crystalline porous polymers that enable molecular design of extended polygonal skeletons to attain well&#8208;defined porous structures. However, construction of a framework that allows remote control of pores remains a challenge. Here we report a strategy that merges covalent, noncovalent, and photo chemistries to design photoresponsive frameworks with reversibly and remotely controllable pores. We developed a topology&#8208;guided multicomponent polycondensation system that integrates protruded tetrafluoroazobenzene units as photoresponsive sites on pore walls at predesigned densities, so that a series of crystalline porous frameworks with the same backbone can be constructed to develop a broad spectrum of pores ranging from mesopores to micropores. Distinct from conventional azobenzene&#8208;based systems, the tetrafluoroazobenzene frameworks are highly sensitive to visible lights to undergo high&#8208;rate isomerization. The photoisomerization exerts profound effects on pore size, shape, number, and environment, as well as molecular uptake and release, rendering the system able to convert and switch pores reversibly and remotely with visible lights. Our results open a way to a novel class of smart porous materials with pore structures and functions that are convertible and manageable with visible lights.

Our results open a way to a novel class of smart porous materials with pore structures and functions that are convertible and manageable with visible lights.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Air&#8208;Promoted Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production from Bioethanol over Core/Shell Cr2O3@GaN Nanoarchitecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air is explored as a promoter rather than quencher for light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from bioethanol over a core/shell Cr2O3@GaN nanoarchitecture, showing an impressive H2 evolution rate by only feeding ethanol, air, and light without notable degradation over 180&#8197;hours operation. Value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds are simultaneously generated.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from biomass derivatives offers a path towards carbon neutrality. It is often however operated with the limitations of sluggish kinetics and severe coking. Herein, a disruptive air&#8208;promoted strategy is explored for efficient and durable light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from ethanol over a core/shell Cr2O3@GaN nanoarchitecture. The correlative computational and experimental investigations show ethanol is energetically favorable to be adsorbed on the Cr2O3@GaN interface, followed by dehydrogenation toward acetaldehyde and protons by photoexcited holes. The released protons are then consumed for H2 evolution by photogenerated electrons. Afterward, O2 can be evolved into active oxygen species and promote the deprotonation and C&#8722;C cleavage of the key C2 intermediate, thus significantly lowering the reaction energy barrier of hydrogen evolution and removing the carbon residual with inhibited overoxidation. Consequently, hydrogen is produced at a high rate of 76.9&#8197;mole H2 per gram Cr2O3@GaN per hour by only feeding ethanol, air, and light, leading to the achievement of a turnover number of 266,943,000&#8197;mole H2 per mole Cr2O3 over a long&#8208;term operation of 180&#8197;hours. Notably, an unprecedented light&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 17.6&#8201;% is achieved under concentrated light illumination. The simultaneous generation of aldehyde from ethanol dehydrogenation enables the process more economically promising.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Two&#8208;dimensional Nanofluidic Ionic Transistor for Neuromorphic Signal Processing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by voltage&#8208;gated ion channels in neurons, a two&#8208;dimensional nanofluidic ionic transistor was fabricated, which operates based on the response to transmembrane potential. The device demonstrates a high on/off ratio of ~2000 and can transition from ambipolar to unipolar behavior with a low subthreshold swing of 560&#8197;mV/decade. The successful implementation of ionic logic gate circuits, including &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, and &#8220;NOR&#8221; gates, paves a promising pathway towards ion&#8208;based brain&#8208;like computing.







Abstract
Voltage&#8208;gated ion channels prevalent in neurons play important roles in generating action potential and information transmission by responding to transmembrane potential. Fabricating bio&#8208;inspired ionic transistors with ions as charge carriers will be crucial for realizing neuro&#8208;inspired devices and brain&#8208;liking computing. Here, we reported a two&#8208;dimensional nanofluidic ionic transistor based on a MXene membrane with sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm interlayer channels. By applying a gating voltage on the MXene nanofluidic, a transmembrane potential will be generated to active the ionic transistor, which is similar to the transmembrane potential of neuron cells and can be effectively regulated by changing membrane parameters, e.g., thickness, composition, and interlayer spacing. For the symmetric MXene nanofluidic, a high on/off ratio of ~2000 can be achieved by forming an ionic depletion or accumulation zone, contingent on the sign of the gating potential. An asymmetric PET/MXene&#8208;composited nanofluidic transitioned the ionic transistor from ambipolar to unipolar, resulting in a more sensitive gate voltage characteristic with a low subthreshold swing of 560&#8197;mV/decade. Furthermore, ionic logic gate circuits, including the &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, and &#8220;NOR&#8221; gate, were implemented for neuromorphic signal processing successfully, which provides a promising pathway towards highly parallel, low energy consumption, and ion&#8208;based brain&#8208;like computing.

         <title>&#8220;Zero&#8221; Intrinsic Fluorescence Sensing&#8208;Platforms Enable Ultrasensitive Whole Blood Diagnosis and In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work reports a versatile strategy involving engineering long&#8208;wavelength rhodol derivatives by systematically regulating the open&#8208;loop/spirocyclic forms, thereby aiding in eliminating probe intrinsic fluorescence (PIF) of far&#8208;red to NIR II probes and creating ultra&#8208;sensitive fluorescence probes with a robust turn&#8208;on response (190 to 1300&#8208;fold). These novel probes enable accurate detection and quantification of biomarkers in abnormal physiological processes (p53 abnormalities) and diseases (tumor metastases).







Abstract
Abnormal physiological processes and diseases can lead to content or activity fluctuations of biocomponents in organelles and whole blood. However, precise monitoring of these abnormalities remains extremely challenging due to the insufficient sensitivity and accuracy of available fluorescence probes, which can be attributed to the background fluorescence arising from two sources, 1) biocomponent autofluorescence (BCAF) and 2) probe intrinsic fluorescence (PIF). To overcome these obstacles, we have re&#8208;engineered far&#8208;red to NIR II rhodol derivatives that possess weak BCAF interference. And a series of &#8220;zero&#8221; PIF sensing&#8208;platforms were created by systematically regulating the open&#8208;loop/spirocyclic forms. Leveraging these advancements, we devised various ultra&#8208;sensitive NIR indicators, achieving substantial fluorescence boosts (190 to 1300&#8208;fold). Among these indicators, 8&#8208;LAP demonstrated accurate tracking and quantifying of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) in whole blood at various stages of tumor metastasis. Furthermore, coupling 8&#8208;LAP with an endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting element enabled the detection of ERAP1 activity in HCT116 cells with p53 abnormalities. This delicate design of eliminating PIF provides insights into enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of existing fluorescence probes toward the detection and imaging of biocomponents in abnormal physiological processes and diseases.
