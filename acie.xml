         <title>Introducing Photochemical Action Plots as a Tool for Unlocking On&#8208;Off Switchable Behavior in a Polymeric Eosin Y Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for investigating the wavelength&#8208;dependent efficiency of photochemical processes. Herein, we apply the photochemical action plot methodology developed by the Barner&#8208;Kowollik team to a photocatalytic reaction, resulting in the first examples of photocatalytic action plots, paving the way for future in&#8208;depth explorations of the wavelength dependence of similar reactions. Specifically, we investigate the wavelength dependence of the catalytic oxidation capabilities of an Eosin Y functionalized polymer photocatalyst (P1) as well as a small molecule representative of the polymer bound Eosin Y moieties (EY) for the oxidation of triphenylphosphine. Introduction of zinc(II) ions into the system proved to drastically influence the optical absorption properties of both catalysts, accompanied by a pronounced influence on their wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity profiles which is not predictable based on the absorption spectra. For P1, these changes can be reversed by metal&#8208;mediated single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) formation upon base addition, giving access to a stimuli&#8208;responsive polymeric photocatalyst. Detailed analysis of the photocatalytic action plots enabled the identification of a suitable wavelength for the realization of an on&#8208;off switchable polymeric photocatalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to Arylethylamines Enabled by Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Hydroarylation of Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylethylamines are prevalent structural skeletons in bioactive molecules and have significant interest within the organic chemistry community. We report here a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, delivering a wide variety of valuable arylethylamines with complete regiocontrol under mild conditions. Key to the success of this protocol is the employment of bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as ligands. Furthermore, the use of chiral NHC ligands enables straightforward access to enantioenriched arylethylamines with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF Catalysts for Plastic Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depolymerization is a promising solution to address the escalating global plastic waste crisis, as a key enabler for emerging technologies in chemical upcycling and closed&#8208;loop recycling of plastics. By virtue of their unparalleled bottom&#8208;up designability for structural control, stability, reactivity and compatibility with catalytically&#8208;active metal nanoparticles and enzymes, MOFs have enormous potential as an emerging class of porous heterogeneous catalysts for plastics depolymerization. Herein, we highlight key considerations and advances in MOF catalyst development and design for a range of depolymerization reactions, including alcoholysis, hydrogenolysis, pyrolysis, photocatalytic oxidation and enzymatic hydrolysis. Other than enabling MOFs to efficiently depolymerize the most abundant plastics in production today, including those with unreacted C&#8208;C backbones (e.g. polyolefins) and polymers with cleavable backbone linkages (e.g. polyesters), their versatility also extends to emerging applications in microplastic capture and degradation from wastewater. These unique properties of MOFs position them as potentially scalable and reusable heterogeneous catalysts that can complement existing inorganic catalysts for practical depolymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Ion Channels To Engineer Zn2+ Ion Transport Mediated Chemical&#8208;to&#8208;Optical Signal Transduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial ion channels have significant potential for various applications, including molecular communication, bio&#8208;sensing, and constructing artificial cells. In this report, we demonstrated the development of a molecular communication system that transports ions across the lipid bilayers via the formation of supramolecular ion channels and harnesses chemical reactions to overcome the challenges of executing signal&#8208;processing functions at the molecular level. The potent ionophore self&#8208;assembles into nanochannels within the lipid bilayers and selectively transports Zn2+ ions. The movement of Zn2+ ions through these supramolecular ion channels enables the in&#8208;situ generation of a water&#8208;soluble catalytic system with tyrosine. This catalytic system promotes esterase&#8208;like activity, generating fluorescent reporters from non&#8208;fluorescent ester&#8208;based compounds within the intravesicular environment. Furthermore, this process indicates the formation of a three&#8208;input AND logic gate in the fluorescence mode, allowing the monitoring of the chemical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal amplification process akin to biological counterparts. Developing these molecular communication systems to replicate the complexity of natural cellular processes opens up exciting opportunities for designing advanced biomimetic tools and exploring the fundamental principles underlying cellular communication.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Excited Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Tuning in Carbon Dots via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high&#8208;efficiency time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials that can be activated under visible light with strong stability remains challenging. In this study, carbon dots (CDs) were confined in the boric acid matrix to activate surface crosslinking emissive clusters and modulate charge transfer (CT) interaction, facilitating green and red dual emissive centers to coexist in composites. The presence of halogen atoms strengthened the interactions between CDs and boric acid. Notably, the CT interaction can offer excitons in low energy level and allow for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, making the red emissive center more dominant under visible light excitation. The interplay of dual centers featuring sufficient color differentiation and different decay rates activated characteristic TDPC evolution resulting in dynamic afterglow evolution from red to white under visible light excitation.&#160;Moreover, the formation of rigid boric acid crystalloid network resulted in an ultra&#8208;strong confinement at high temperature, enabling the composites to emit long persistent afterglow at high temperature of up to 393 K under visible light excitation. The study provides new light on the design of TDPC materials and represents a significant advancement toward expanding the application in information security.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrabright and Water&#8208;stable Eu(III)&#8208;based MOF Scintillators Sensitized by Dual&#8208;antenna Ligands for Real&#8208;Time and Underwater X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ln&#8208;MOF) scintillators are promising for X&#8208;ray imaging owing to their structural tunability and high X&#8208;ray attenuation. However, achieving efficient triplet&#8208;sensitized scintillation remains challenging due to the inefficient energy transfer between organic ligand triplets and lanthanide centers, leading to weak radioluminescence and limited imaging resolution. Herein, we propose a dual&#8208;antenna ligand strategy by synergizing 4,4&#8217;&#8208;oxybis (benzoic acid) (Oba) and phenanthroline derivatives (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline = Phen; or Bathophenanthroline = Bphen) with Eu3+ ions, constructing ultrabright Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Phen and Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen scintillators. Notably, Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen demonstrated a record relative light yield of 60331 &#177; 528 photons MeV&#8208;1, outperforming Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Phen by 71%. This superior scintillation performance originates from an 86.3% photoluminescence quantum yield, attributed to enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer efficiency and the suppression of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking among organic chromophore ligands. Besides, the fabrication of flexible Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen films achieve a spatial resolution of 37.0 lp mm&#8208;1 in static imaging and enable real&#8208;time dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging at 60 fps (2K). Additionally, it exhibited exceptional water stability, with negligible performance degradation in water for over 100 days, allowing clear underwater visualization of circuit boards under X&#8208;ray irradiation. It provides a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance water&#8208;stable scintillators via ligand engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Nature of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Ionic Liquids by Combined Pulse EPR and 19F NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic liquids (ILs) are a unique class of compounds that have attracted interest for numerous and diverse applications, ranging from solvents for sustainable synthesis to sustainable electrolytes. Understanding their nanostructure and solute&#8208;solvent interactions is a prerequisite to harnessing the full potential of ILs. It has been proposed that ILs solvate non&#8208;polar solutes via their alkyl chains through the formation of nanoscale structures, such as micelles. Here, we determine the non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for such nanostructuring in ILs. We use pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE) NMR, Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations in combination with ILs tailored to probe specific interactions through spin and isotopic labelling. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular cation&#8208;anion interactions are probed by Electron&#8208;Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) and 19F PRE experiments and show that nitroxide solutes associate with the polar domains of the imidazolium cation through weak hydrogen bonding with the imidazolium ring protons, as supported by MD simulations. Thus, this study reveals a less structured nanostructure than a micellar picture might suggest, but with clear IL cation&#8208;solute interactions. Our methodology to reveal nanostructure not only has implications for ILs but is also applicable to other soft matter systems.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Insertion of Diazonium Salts into Ketone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new oxidative nitrogen insertion into cyclic ketones using readily available diazonium salts. In the case of indanones, the reaction is promoted by auto&#8208;catalytically generated Br&#248;nsted acid and proceeds via sequential &#945;&#8208;diazenylation and ring expansion through an N&#8208;iminoaziridinium intermediate. For less &#945;&#8208;acidic ketones, a complementary strategy employing silyl enol ethers was developed: catalyzed by HNTf2, efficient nitrogen insertion occurred into silyl enol ethers derived from a broad range of four&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones. The resulting N&#8208;aminoamides exhibit broad synthetic utility in various downstream transformations. Notably, a ring expansion, followed by N&#8208;N bond cleavage offers a powerful tool for skeletal editing, converting indanones into isoquinol&#8208;inones, as demonstrated by the scaffold modification of donepezil.</dc:description>

         <title>Xanthopinacol Boronate: A Robust, Photochemically Assembled and Cleavable Boronic Ester for Orthogonal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboronic acids impact numerous fields of application from organic synthesis to drug discovery and materials science. However, their highly polar nature makes them challenging to handle, purify, and characterize. Boronic esters help overcome these issues, and pinacol esters (Bpin) have become the dominant boronic acid surrogate in organic synthesis. Despite its popularity, Bpin is not without drawbacks. Its formation from pinacol is intrinsically reversible in the presence of water or alcohols, which may cause premature release leading to losses during reactions and purification. This reversibility complicates the hydrolytic regeneration of free boronic acids, which often requires additional steps to destroy the pinacol by&#8208;product. Although other boronyl protecting groups exist, their removal requires harsh pH conditions. To address these issues, we developed xanthopinacol boronates (Bxpin), a robust protecting group for boronic acids with excellent orthogonality in various chemical reactions, and mild irreversible removal under catalyzed photoredox conditions. Xpin boronates can be obtained directly by irradiation of a mixture of free boronic acid and xanthone with UV light, causing an in&#8208;situ dimerization of xanthone to the required xanthopinacol. The unique attributes of xpin boronates were further studied by UV&#8208;Vis spectrophotometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and various stability tests.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Promoted Activation of Light Alkanes at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs two Cu electrodes in the presence of oxygen gas to selectively convert ethane and propane into alkenes and oxygenates under ambient conditions, achieving excellent stability by periodically reversing the current direction. Our approach attains a combined selectivity for ethylene and acetic acid exceeding 96% and achieves acetic acid concentrations as high as 19&#160;mM during prolonged operation, establishing a new performance benchmark for the electrochemical activation of light alkanes.








Abstract
The electrochemical activation of light alkanes into value&#8208;added products represents a promising pathway for sustainable chemical synthesis and the storage of renewable energy. In this study, we introduce an electrochemically promoted system that employs copper plates as electrode and oxygen as oxidant, capable of converting ethane into ethylene and acetic acid with production rates of 6.9 and 6.2&#160;&#181;mol&#183;cm&#8722;2Cu&#183;h&#8722;1, respectively, with a combined selectivity exceeding 92%, under ambient conditions. Additionally, this system can convert propane to propylene at a rate of 11.6&#160;&#181;mol&#183;cm&#8722;2Cu&#183;h&#8722;1, with selectivity reaching up to 86%. A 10&#160;h run with ethane demonstrates consistent production of ethylene and acetic acid, with a sustained selectivity above 96%, and achieves an acetic acid concentration of 19&#160;mM. In situ spectroscopic analysis reveals the active surface and a critical reaction intermediate. Combining with partial pressure dependence study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a potential reaction mechanism involving the competitive adsorption of oxygen and alkane producing an alkyl group as a key reaction step in the reaction process.

         <title>Isolated and Paired Metal Sites in Zeolites Using Solid&#8208;State Ion Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal ions housed in the zeolitic micropore are broadly applied in catalysis. These model active sites provide a link between homogeneous, enzyme, and solid catalysts. The synthetic strategy used to generate these cationic sites has a significant influence on the catalytic activity. Here, we discuss an emerging synthesis technique, solid&#8208;state ion exchange, and its application in pursuit of isolated and paired metal sites within the confines of the zeolite.








Abstract
Isolated and paired extraframework transition metal cations in zeolites are emerging as top candidates for numerous applications, including, but not limited to, selective methane oxidation to methanol, selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, propane dehydrogenation, propylene epoxidation, and direct air capture of carbon dioxide. Importantly, these well&#8208;defined heterogeneous catalysts offer parallels with molecular and metalloenzyme catalytic active sites. Aqueous&#8208;phase ion exchange (APIE) is the most common synthesis technique to obtain these catalysts. Solid&#8208;state ion exchange (SSIE) is an often overlooked technique that offers synthetic advantages compared to APIE. Thus, recent advances in solid&#8208;state synthesis strategies merit contemporary contextualization. In this minireview, we describe the basic principles, methods, mechanisms, challenges, and advances in&#160;solid&#8208;state ion exchange in the context of&#160;well&#8208;defined transition metal cation&#160;active sites located in extraframework positions of the zeolite.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive AIE Photosensitizers for Enhanced Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infections significantly alter the local microenvironment, with acidic byproducts from bacterial metabolism leading to a pronounced pH reduction. Leveraging this characteristic, we synthesized and identified DHTPA, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent and pH&#8208;responsive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer, for enhanced photodynamic therapy against bacterial infections. DHTPA aggregates exhibit a 2.1&#8208;fold increase in ROS generation under weakly acidic conditions (pH 5.5) compared to neutral conditions (pH 7.4), attributed to its pH&#8208;dependent electronic structure modulation. Upon NIR light irradiation, DHTPA aggregates precisely respond to the acidic microenvironment, significantly boosting ROS production for efficient bacterial eradication. In vitro studies demonstrated that DHTPA achieved over 99.9% bactericidal efficiency against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. In a murine infected wound model, DHTPA treatment accelerated wound healing by 2.4 times, markedly reduced bacterial burden, and alleviated inflammatory responses, highlighting its therapeutic potential. By integrating NIR activation, pH responsiveness, and AIE properties, DHTPA presents a precise and efficient antibacterial therapeutic strategy, offering an innovative solution for the clinical management of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen (H2) production through water electrolysis is a promising route for sustainable energy storage. However, conventional water electrolysis faces several challenges, such as large thermodynamic potential gaps and sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics, which lead to high electricity consumption and limitations in H2 storage and transportation. A promising approach to overcoming these hurdles is hybrid water electrolysis, which integrates alternative, thermodynamically favorable reactions at the anode to enhance efficiency. In this study, we explore how peroxide redox electrocatalysis can address critical barriers in sustainable H2 production, storage, and transport. By leveraging a cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient peroxide redox electrocatalyst, we demonstrate various electrolysis configurations that significantly reduce the required cell voltage&#8212;from the standard 1.23 V down to &#8211;0.06 V, highlighting its potential for scalable and economically viable electrolysis methodologies for H2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Sodium Ion Conductivity in Pristine Na8SnP4: Synthesis, Structure and Properties of the Two Polymorphs LT&#8208;Na8SnP4 and HT&#8208;Na8SnP4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion conductors show great promise for use in rechargeable solid&#8208;state batteries due to the high natural abundance of sodium. As a pristine material, Na8SnP4 demonstrates relatively high ionic conductivity and offers significant room for further enhancement, owing to its structure built on well&#8208;known tetrahedral building blocks. Additionally, its existence as both high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature polymorphs provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;property relationship.








Abstract
Achieving high ionic conductivities in solid state electrolytes is crucial for the development of efficient all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries. Considering future availability and sustainability, sodium materials hold promises for an alternative for lithium materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, due to the higher abundance. Here, we report on a sodium phosphide ion conductor Na8SnP4 with a conductivity of 0.53&#160;mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature as a pristine material. Due to the simple tetrahedral SnP4 structure units, Na8SnP4 has potential for optimization through aliovalent substitution as successfully applied in sulfide&#8208;based materials. Na8SnP4 is easily accessible from exclusively abundant elements and forms a high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature polymorph, which further allows for a fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship. Both polymorphs are structurally characterized by synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and MAS&#8211;NMR spectroscopy. Ion conductivity and activation energy for ion mobility is determined by temperature dependent impedance spectroscopy and static 23Na&#8208;NMR measurements. Both MEM analysis of scattering densities as well as structure determination by Rietveld methods hint for ionic motion between special Na positions in the structure and that ion migration proceeds along pathways passing triangular faces of neighboring tetrahedral and octahedral voids. The specific voids filling in the disordered HT&#8208;phase are found to be a crucial parameter for ion migration.

         <title>Chiroptical Signal Inversion of Peptido&#8208;Coassemblies in Confined Parallel&#8208;Laminar Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality plays a vital role in material properties, and precise control of chiral signals is key to designing functional materials. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly offers an efficient means to integrate chiral building blocks with chromophores, yet controlling the assembly pathway remains challenging due to the complexity of non&#8208;covalent interactions. Here, we introduce a continuous parallel&#8208;laminar&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly strategy that exploits solvent ordering and solute diffusion in confined environments to regulate chiral signals in multi&#8208;component peptide co&#8208;assemblies. Notably, six nonpolar amino acids exhibit significantly enhanced chiroptical responses, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. Intriguingly, Fmoc&#8208;Ala and 1&#8208;aminopyrene (AP) co&#8208;assemblies formed in a microfluidic chip show a reversed chiroptical signal compared to those from batch reactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and COMSOL modeling suggest that velocity gradients and shear forces in microfluidics induce ordered non&#8208;covalent interactions, altering excimer stacking and modulating chiroptical properties. This study presents an effective strategy for controlling chiral optical signals in confined environments, offering an interesting approach for supramolecular chiral transfer and regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Atom Rearrangement Drives Potential&#8208;Adaptive Electrocatalytic Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic rearrangement of metal atoms at heterointerfaces by chemical bond conversion drives high efficiency electrocatalytic processes. It is of great significance to explore transformative catalytic systems that directly control the interfacial structure and function of atomic composition. As an emerging 2D carbon allotrope, graphdiyne (GDY) offers unprecedented advantages for heterointerface engineering. In particular, the uneven surface charge distribution, high distribution of active sites and customizable electronic structures of GDY provide unprecedented opportunities for developing new&#8208;generation catalytic systems. Here, we report a new idea to directly control the cooperative growth and drive metal atomic rearrangement on the interface of GDY/NiPd/GDY. Experimental results revealed two unique interfacial phenomena: (i) GDY&#8208;induced massive dislocation formation within NiPd nanoalloys and (ii) rearrangement of surface metal atoms from (111) to (200) facets. Detailed spectroscopic analysis further demonstrated the composition&#8208;dependent evolution of elemental valence states and stoichiometric ratios. This atomic&#8208;level restructuring establishes a charge&#8208;redistribution network featuring non&#8208;integer charge transfer, which improves the overall conductivity and intrinsic activity. What is even more encouraging is that this electrocatalytic olefin hydrogenation is carried out in an aqueous solution. The GDY/NiPd/GDY heterostructure achieves exceptional activity (turnover frequency: 6.8&#160;s&#8208;1), stability (&gt;5 cycles), and chemo&#8208;selectivity (~100%), which is superior to traditional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells via 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhanced Efficiency through Precision Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a class of porous polymers with tunable two&#8208; or three&#8208;dimensional structures, have drawn significant attention for their exceptional versatility across various applications. Recently, the integration of COFs into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has emerged as a promising strategy to address critical challenges, such as instability, interfacial recombination losses, and lead&#8208;associated environmental risks. Enhanced charge transport channels, passivation of defects, and customizable molecule architectures are some of the special benefits that COFs offer. In this study, we used Schiff base reactions to create two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs with an 8+2 connection motif, which were integrated into PSC self&#8208;assembled (SAM) layers. According to characterizations and theoretical calculations, COFs not only effectively optimize the energy level of the ITO/SAM substrate but also passivate perovskite defects and suppress defect&#8208;assisted recombination in PSC devices. These modifications significantly enhanced carrier transport and extraction, resulting in an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 22.57% to 25.20% (DP&#8208;BE) and 24.21% (DP&#8208;DBE). This work highlights the potential of COFs as multifunctional modifiers for interfacial engineering in PSCs, offering a promising route to improve device performance and stability.</dc:description>

In this study, we used Schiff base reactions to create two donor&#8211;acceptor (D-A) type COFs with an 8+2 connection motif, which were integrated into PSC self-assembled (SAM) layers. According to characterizations and theoretical calculations, COFs not only effectively optimize the energy level of the ITO/SAM substrate but also passivate perovskite defects and suppress defect-assisted recombination in PSC devices. These modifications significantly enhanced carrier transport and extraction, resulting in an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 22.57% to 25.20% (DP-BE) and 24.21% (DP-DBE). This work highlights the potential of COFs as multifunctional modifiers for interfacial engineering in PSCs, offering a promising route to improve device performance and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Arylative Dearomatization of Naphthols and Phenols for Constructing Quinazoline&#8208;Containing Spirocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective arylative dearomatization of phenols and naphthols, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. This approach enables the efficient construction of a diverse library of quinazoline&#8208;containing spirocyclic compounds, featuring enantioenriched, three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures through the strategic integration of quinazolinone and spirocyclic frameworks. The successful transformation of planar aromatic precursors into complex three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures using our developed methodology was further validated by Principal Moment of Inertia (PMI) calculations. Additionally, we systematically evaluated the antiproliferative potential of the synthesized compounds against two representative cancer cell lines: Mino (human mantle cell lymphoma) and MV4&#8208;11 (human acute myeloid leukemia),&#160;revealing that compound (S)&#8208;4ac,characterized by well&#8208;defined stereochemistry and structural novelty, exhibited significantly enhanced antiproliferative efficacy against both cancer cell lines, with IC50 values 0.94 &#956;M and 0.46 &#956;M, respectively. In addition,&#160;flow cytometry quantification and Western blot analysis showed that these compounds induced apoptosis through caspase activation and mitochondrial dysfunction.&#160;These results demonstrated(S)&#8208;4ac&#160;as a highly promising lead compound for further anticancer drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Fueled Active Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biology uses chemical potential differences from molecules like ATP to drive membrane pumps, transporting molecules across membranes even against concentration gradients. Here, we report a synthetic system that transports small molecules from an aqueous phase (the sender) to an aqueous receiver across a centimeter&#8208;sized immiscible solvent at the expense of chemical energy. Molecules with high chemical potential (fuels) in the sender phase transiently activate the transporter molecules, which enter the immiscible solvent and exit on the receiver phase side, thus allowing transport from sender to receiver against a concentration gradient. Importantly, we show this active transport mechanism transports molecules across a hydrophobic barrier without complex pumping machinery. Using a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, we identify the critical parameters that determine the efficiency of active transport. Selective transport enables the sorting of a mixture of different molecules. In future work, we will use these design criteria to actively transport molecules across membranes, e.g., of vesicles, at the expense of chemical fuel, thereby mimicking biological processes and enabling the feeding of synthetic cells.</dc:description>

A spiro&#8208;conformation&#8208;driven neutral ferroelectric coordination polymer, [Cd(MEO)(SCN)2], is reported by Zi&#8208;Yi Du, Weizhao Cai, Rui&#8208;Kang Huang, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202500027). This material features dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive phase transitions: a thermally activated ferroelectric transition via spiro&#8208;conformational flipping and a pressure&#8208;induced transition arising from helical chain deformation. This study showcases a rare example of a multi&#8208;responsive neutral ferroelectric system, advancing the design of molecular ferroelectrics via unconventional stimulus&#8211;response mechanisms.

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Induced Br&#248;nsted Acidity Enables Controllable Hydrocracking of Polyolefin Waste to Liquid Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient upcycling of polyolefin waste into liquid fuels remains challenging due to over&#8208;cracking and the lack of sufficient acidity in non&#8208;zeolitic catalysts. Here, we report a Ni/niobium oxide nanorod (Ni/NbOx) catalyst that achieves 95% selectivity to C5&#8208;20&#8203; alkanes at full polyethylene (PE) conversion under mild conditions (240 oC), with minimal gaseous byproducts (4%). The catalyst reaches a high liquid fuel formation rate of 1274 gliquid&#8203;&#183;gNi&#8722;1&#8203;&#183;h&#8722;1, rivaling noble metal systems. Its performance is governed by the morphology and crystallinity of NbOx nanorods, which provide sufficient acidity without micropore confinement, mitigating diffusion limitations and over&#8208;cracking. Detailed operando infrared spectroscopy and computational studies reveal, for the first time, that Br&#248;nsted acid sites, generated in situ via hydrogen spillover on the (110) facet, are the key catalytic sites in niobium oxide&#8208;based catalysts. The density of these acid sites exhibits a linear correlation with hydrocracking activity. The catalyst also demonstrates high efficiency across diverse polyolefin feedstocks and excellent reusability, offering a scalable and cost&#8208;effective solution for plastic upcycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Enable Spontaneous Singlet Oxygen Generation Without Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a widely used reactive oxygen species (ROS), making the development of new materials capable of efficiently generating it highly important. In this work, we report a series of isostructural MOFs (named JNU&#8208;300) that can spontaneously generate 1O2 by directly activating triplet oxygen (3O2) from the air without the need for additional light irradiation. The highly selective generation of 1O2 by JNU&#8208;300 is verified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and probe experiments for 1O2. The generated 1O2 can be employed for aerobic oxidation of sulfide and antibacterial application. Mechanism studies revealed that the framework structure, and the adsorption and polarization of O2 by the coordination units of JNU&#8208;300, are crucial for the 1O2 generation. To the best of our knowledge, MOFs JNU&#8208;300 are the first MOF material capable of producing 1O2 by activating 3O2 in the absence of light at room temperature. This work provides new insights into the design and construction of functional MOF materials capable of generating 1O2 via activating 3O2 without light irradiation, opening new possibilities for their application in specialized fields that require 1O2 in the dark.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Water Deprotonation Enables Potassium&#8208;Ion Chemistries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting is a key process in clean energy applications and usually occurs on the surface of catalytic materials. Here we report the anomalous partial water splitting, namely water deprotonation behavior within the lattice of hydrated materials modeled by Fe1&#8208;xMgx(C2O4) &#8226; 2H2O (x &#8776; 0.25&#8208;0.43), which triggers the otherwise inactive framework into an excellent cathode material for potassium ion storage. Density functional theory suggests that redox&#8208;active lattice Fe sites can split crystal water into hydroxyls and hydrogens in the initial charge, rendering thereafter reversible K&#8208;ion chemistries, whereas lattice Mg sites are inactive but stabilize the entire framework. Our experiments validated the as&#8208;predicted electrochemical behavior, and the isotopic tracing unambiguously confirmed the hydrogen evolution from crystal water. This intriguing &#8220;water deprotonation in lattice&#8221; phenomenon may open a new path for the design of cathode materials by electrolysis&#8208;assisted electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Trinuclear Units Based Covalent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of porous solids for gold recovery is highly desired from both an economical and environmental point of view, however the design of solid adsorbents with high overall performance is still challenging. Herein, we designed three copper(I) cyclic trinuclear units, Cu(I)&#8208;CTUs, based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs) by networking metal clusters with dynamic covalent linkages. These CMOFs deliver a high gold adsorption capacity of 3687 mg g&#8722;1, ultra&#8208;fast adsorption kinetics (i.e., removal efficiency &gt; 99% within 20s), excellent selectivity and reusability. In addition, it can be readily used for gold extraction from e&#8208;waste. Owing to the rich redox properties of Cu&#8208;CTUs, these CMOFs show three sorption mechanisms including adsorption, chemical reduction and photocatalytic reduction. Interestingly, the gold&#8208;loaded CMOFs can be used as catalysts for hydration of alkynes to ketones with high yields (e.g., up to ~ 95% for 6 examples).</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Bipolar Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Selective Acid Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric acid (HNO3) is a vital industrial chemical, and its recovery from complex waste streams is essential for sustainability and resource optimization. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of bipolar covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with tunable ionic site distributions as a solution for this challenge. The membranes are fabricated by layering anionic COF nanosheets on cationic COF layers, supported by a porous substrate. The resulting membranes exhibit significant rectifying behavior, driven by the asymmetric charge polarity and the intrinsic electric field, which enhances HNO3 transport. The transmembrane diffusion coefficient of 2.74 &#215; 10&#8211;5 cm2 s&#8211;1 exceeds the self&#8208;diffusion rate of NO3&#8211;, leading to increased HNO3 flux and selectivity compared to the individual anionic and cationic COF membranes. The optimized bipolar membrane configuration achieves remarkable separation factors, ranging from 22 to 242,000 for HNO3, in comparison to other solutes such as HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4, and various metal salts in an eight&#8208;component mixed waste stream. This results in a substantial increase in HNO3 purity, from 12.5% to 94.1% after a single membrane separation. With the broad range of COF materials and the versatility of the proposed membrane design, this work represents a significant advancement in chemical separation technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile N=N Bond Cleavage of cis&#8208;Azobenzene with Bis&#8208;silylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The very different features of cooperative disilicon(II)&#8208;mediated N=N bond activation of trans&#8208; versus cis&#8208;azobenzene are reported, employing two bis&#8208;silylenes with distinct intramolecular Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si distances, PhN(LSi:)&#8322; 1 (L = PhC(tBuN)&#8322;, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si: 2.9 &#197;) and XT(LSi:)&#8322; 2 (XT = 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si: 4.3 &#197;). While trans&#8208;azobenzene reacts with both bis&#8208;silylenes to form C&#8211;H and N=N p bond activation products, the cis&#8208;isomer undergoes only N=N bond scission. Thus, reaction of 1 with cis&#8208;azobenzene at room temperature affords the unprecedented N=N bond cleavage product 4, featuring a bis&#8208;silaimine with terminal and bridging Si=N moieties. In contrast, the reaction of 2 with cis&#8208;azobenzene at &#8211;30 &#176;C in THF allows for the isolation of the [1+2] cycloaddition intermediate 6, containing a three&#8208;membered SiN&#8322; ring (siladiazirane), which rearranges to the N=N bond cleavage product 8 at room temperature. Compound 6 reacts with one additional equivalent of cis&#8208;azobenzene to form bis&#8208;silaazirane 7 with two SiN&#8322; rings. Density Functional Theory calculations support stepwise Si(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Si(II) cooperative activation mechanisms and provide insights into the role of bis&#8208;silylenes for selective N=N cleavage reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Nitriles from Dinitrogen via N&#8208;Atom Transfer on Rhenium Nitride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal mediated dinitrogen (N2) splitting into terminal nitrido moiety followed by N&#8208;atom transfer is an attractive strategy for N2 fixation beyond ammonia. While the functionalization of N2&#8208;derived nitride complex has been widely investigated, their N&#8208;atom transfer reactions to provide N&#8208;containing organic compounds were rarely reported. Herein, we report the synthesis of a rhenium nitride complex [(acriPNP)Re(N)Cl] (acriPNP = 4,5&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)&#8208;2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;acridin&#8208;10&#8208;ide) via reductive N2 cleavage from either rhenium trichloride or rhenium oxo dichloride complexes. The rhenium nitride exhibits N&#8208;atom transfer reactivity with acyl triflates or chlorides under mild conditions, affording nitriles concomitant with the regeneration of the nitride precursors, rhenium oxo or trichloride complexes, respectively. This overall N&#8208;atom transfer from N2 to acyl electrophiles produced a series alkyl, aryl, and heterocyclic nitriles, in moderate to good yields, offering a versatile and practical strategy for accessing 15N&#8208;labeled nitriles. This work established a two&#8208;step synthetic cycle, offering valuable insights into transformations of N2 into nitrogenous products.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonbonding Electron Inversion&#8208;Driven Structural Engineering: Synergistic Enhancement of Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simultaneous optimization of large birefringence (&#916;n, a linear optical property) and strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG, a nonlinear optical (NLO) property) in a single crystal remains a significant challenge due to the inherently distinct structural requirements for these properties. While nonbonding electrons have been extensively studied in oxides and chalcogenides, research has predominantly focused on their role along polar axes, leaving their influence along [[EQUATION]] axes in tetrahedral stacking largely unexplored. Herein, we propose a nonbonding electron&#8208;inversion strategy to overcome phase&#8208;matching limitations in defect diamond&#8208;like structures. By incorporating T2&#8208;[Ga4S10] supertetrahedral motifs, we successfully synthesized [Ba4Cl2][CdGa4S10] (space group: I[[EQUATION]]), which exhibits a 219% enhancement in &#916;n compared to the non&#8208;phase&#8208;matching parent structure Cd2GaS4. The weakly bound nonbonding electrons, governed by atomic potentials, demonstrate strong SHG responses under optical fields.&#160; [Ba4Cl2][CdGa4S10] not only achieves a broad transmission range (0.28&#8211;18.6 &#956;m) and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (40.1 &#215; AgGaS2) but also optimally balances a wide bandgap (Eg = 3.58 eV) and a large SHG response (1.4 &#215; AgGaS2), representing one of the best&#8208;performing Cd&#8208;based materials to date. This work introduces the first phase&#8208;matching design strategy based on nonbonding electron&#8208;driven structure&#8208;property relationships, providing critical insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance NLO materials.</dc:description>

The weakly bound nonbonding electrons, governed by atomic potentials, demonstrate strong SHG responses under optical fields.&#160; [Ba4Cl2][CdGa4S10] not only achieves a broad transmission range (0.28&#8211;18.6 &#956;m) and a high laser-induced damage threshold (40.1 &#215; AgGaS2) but also optimally balances a wide bandgap (Eg = 3.58 eV) and a large SHG response (1.4 &#215; AgGaS2), representing one of the best-performing Cd-based materials to date. This work introduces the first phase-matching design strategy based on nonbonding electron-driven structure-property relationships, providing critical insights for the rational design of high-performance NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to create new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes would substantially advance bioengineering, medicine, and the chemical industry. Despite recent breakthroughs in protein design and structure prediction, designing biocatalysts with enzyme&#8208;like efficiency remains challenging. Here, we present AI.zymes, a modular platform integrating cutting&#8208;edge protein engineering algorithms within an evolutionary framework. By combining programs such as Rosetta, ESMFold, ProteinMPNN, and FieldTools in iterative rounds of design and selection, AI.zymes optimizes a broad range of catalytically relevant properties. In addition to enhancing transition state affinity and protein stability, AI.zymes can also improve properties that are not targeted by the employed design algorithms. For instance, AI.zymes enhanced electrostatic catalysis by iteratively selecting variants with stronger catalytic electric fields. Benchmarking AI.zymes on the promiscuous Kemp eliminase activity of ketosteroid isomerase led to a 7.7&#8208;fold activity increase after experimentally testing just 7 variants. Due to its modularity, AI.zymes can readily incorporate emerging design algorithms, paving the way for a unifying framework for enzyme design.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atmosphere&#8208;Responsive Protective Strategy Based on Deciphering the Anode Degradation Mechanism in Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries, with high theoretical energy density and CO2 utilization, are considered a promising candidate for Mars exploration. However, they continue to face challenges such as limited cycle life and significant polarization caused by anode degradation, which is often overlooked and whose underlying mechanism remains unclear. This work revealed the anode failure mechanism, identifying a water&#8208;triggered degradation process which depletes active lithium content, and developed an atmosphere&#8208;induced protective strategy. The degradation is triggered by trace water and sustained by CO2 component, which results in a spontaneous reaction transforming active lithium into Li2CO3. Thus, an atmosphere&#8208;induced protective strategy was provided respond to the water molecules brought by the semi&#8208;hermetic system and high charging voltage. The protective layer was in&#8208;situ polymerized and can interact with water molecules leading to further polymerization, thereby inhibiting side reactions, significantly extends the battery&#8217;s lifespan. The Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with protected anode can achieve stable cycling exceeding 1000 hours, more than twice of the time compared to the unprotected case. This study revealed the fundamental mechanism of anode degradation in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries, providing a theoretical basis for the development of subsequent anode protection strategies. Additionally, it offers a viable method for anode protection in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Proximity Biosensor via Constitutional Dynamic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Affinity binding&#8208;induced DNA assembly is a fundamental principle for designing proximity biosensors for sensitive and wash&#8208;free protein detection and imaging. However, current design strategies for these biosensors face an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between binding affinity and background signal. Here, we demonstrate that this intrinsic issue can be addressed by using constitutional dynamic chemistry as a guiding principle in the rational design of proximity biosensors. As exists in a dynamic equilibrium, the constitutional dynamic network (CDN)&#8208;based proximity biosensors can be adjusted to maximize the affinity to the target protein while minimize non&#8208;specific interactions that contribute to background signals. By further detecting the ratio of agonist to antagonist within the CDN, we also significantly improved assay robustness, enabling the sensitive detection of antibodies in complex matrices such as human serum. With the high affinity, low background, and high robustness, we anticipate that our CDN&#8208;based design strategy will find wide applications in biosensor development. Our study also opens the possibility to engineer protein&#8208;responsive synthetic systems with complex dynamic behaviors and function.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Highly Unsaturated Nickel(II) Sites into a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Simultaneous High C2H2 Adsorption and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) remains a challenge to achieve both high C2H2 uptake and selectivity for a single material. &#65279;Porous materials with&#160;routine OMSs often show the limitation in C2H2/CO2 separation due to the comparable binding affinity with the two gases. Herein, we report a new strategy of anchoring highly unsaturated nickel(II) sites into a large&#8208;pore MOF (Ni2+@NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2) for simultaneously improving C2H2 adsorption and selectivity. The coordination geometry of the anchored Ni2+ ion was&#160;determined by SCXRD studies, featuring a two&#8208;coordination model with highly unsaturated OMSs after the activation. This highly unsaturated Ni2+ ion can provide additional binding sites to improve C2H2 adsorption, and also enable highly selective binding of C2H2 over CO2 through the specific and strong &#960;&#8208;complexation, as revealed by gas&#8208;loaded SCXRD studies and theoretical simulations. This metalated MOF exhibits both significantly enhanced C2H2 uptake (201.4 cm3 g&#8722;1) and C2H2/CO2 selectivity (25.7) than the pristine NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2 (148.0 cm3 g&#8722;1 and 3.8) at ambient conditions, making an unprecedented balance between C2H2 adsorption and selectivity to overcome the trade&#8208;off challenge. Breakthrough experiments on equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixtures afford both the top&#8208;tier dynamic selectivity (14.4) and C2H2 productivity of 114.5 L kg&#8722;1 (&gt; 99.5% purity) at ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular access to aliphatic polycarbonates with tunable properties and dual closed&#8208;loop recyclability by polycondensation&#8722;depolymerization&#8722;repolymerization strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Great achievements have been made in CO2/epoxide copolymerization and dialkyl carbonate/diol polycondensation, however, efficient preparation of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (&gt; 100 kDa) aliphatic polycarbonates with tunable properties and recyclability under mild conditions still remain as a great challenge. Herein, we presented a &#8220;polycondensation&#8722;depolymerization&#8722;repolymerization&#8221; strategy for structurally diverse aliphatic polycarbonates. This involved a step growth polycondensation of dialkyl carbonate and diol to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (0.5 &#8722; 1.9 kDa) polycarbonates under atmosphere pressure, which are then utilized to produce cyclic carbonate monomers through catalytic depolymerization. The ring&#8208;opening polymerization of cyclic carbonate led to high molecular weight (&gt; 100 kDa) polymers, which can be converted back to cyclic monomer via ring&#8208;closing depolymerization or diol/dialkyl carbonate via alcoholysis, enabling chemical recycling of polycarbonates via dual closed loops. The thermal and mechanical properties of the polycarbonates can be widely adjusted by varying the substituent, and polycarbonate with four&#8208;membered spiro&#8208;cyclic substituent shows a recorded high melting temperature (217 &#176;C) and mechanical strength within the reported polycarbonate family. A(hard)&#8208;B(soft)&#8208;A(hard) triblock thermoplastic elastomers with good mechanical performance and elastic recovery were also created by sequential polymerization. The &#8220;polycondensation&#8722;depolymerization&#8722;repolymerization&#8221; strategy provided a powerful toolbox for developing high&#8208;performance aliphatic polycarbonates.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Cage Encapsulated within Metal Cluster&#8208;Based Open Frameworks: A Single&#8208;Crystal Host&#8208;in&#8208;Host Material with Inter&#8208;Host Charge Cooperation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating dissimilar building units of discrete organic cages and inorganic clusters into single&#8208;crystal supramolecular frameworks with tailored architectures and synergistic functions presents a significant challenge. Here, we presented our discovery of achieving such hybrids through electrostatically driven self&#8208;assembly of cationic ammonium organic cages with anionic lead iodide clusters. Notably, by carefully modulating the size, shape and composition of cationic organic cages, we have constructed an integrated porous host&#8208;in&#8208;host architecture. In this system, the internal cationic cage snugly resided, encapsulated within the external network constructed from anionic lead iodide clusters. This unique nested hierarchy showcased enhanced interhost interactions facilitated by electrostatic forces, which intricately tailored the electronic structure of the outer lead iodide moiety. As a result, the hybrid demonstrated distinguished photophysical properties, including efficient oxygen activation and enhanced photothermal conversion capability, as confirmed by comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses. The critical role of interhost electrostatic interactions was further demonstrated through a systematic comparison with a structurally similar host&#8208;in&#8208;host architecture comprising lead iodide clusters and neutral amine cages. Furthermore, the integrated and compartmentalized dual&#8208;host served as spatially isolated dual active sites for cascade reactions, exhibiting 33~47 folds enhancement in activity compared to structural counterparts lacking charge cooperation.</dc:description>

Notably, by carefully modulating the size, shape and composition of cationic organic cages, we have constructed an integrated porous host-in-host architecture. In this system, the internal cationic cage snugly resided, encapsulated within the external network constructed from anionic lead iodide clusters. This unique nested hierarchy showcased enhanced interhost interactions facilitated by electrostatic forces, which intricately tailored the electronic structure of the outer lead iodide moiety. As a result, the hybrid demonstrated distinguished photophysical properties, including efficient oxygen activation and enhanced photothermal conversion capability, as confirmed by comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses. The critical role of interhost electrostatic interactions was further demonstrated through a systematic comparison with a structurally similar host-in-host architecture comprising lead iodide clusters and neutral amine cages. Furthermore, the integrated and compartmentalized dual-host served as spatially isolated dual active sites for cascade reactions, exhibiting 33~47 folds enhancement in activity compared to structural counterparts lacking charge cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bridging the Oxo Wall: A New Perspective on High&#8208;valent Metal&#8208;Oxo Species and Their Reactivity in Mn, Fe, and Co Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel perspective on high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species, particularly in Mn, Fe, and Co complexes. It reveals a surprising quantum mechanical mixture of CoIV=O and CoIII&#8211;O&#8226; species influenced by ligand design and symmetry. Additionally, the study uncovers correlations between oxyl radical character and C&#8722;H bond activation kinetics, challenging existing theories on reactivity.







Abstract
The &#8220;oxo&#8208;wall&#8221; is a well&#8208;established concept in the area of bioinorganic chemistry, which refers to the instability of the terminal metal&#8208;oxo complexes in the +4 oxidation state, with tetragonal C4v symmetry beyond group 8 elements. This leads to a diverse and highly reactive chemistry of Co&#8208;oxo complexes, as evidenced in the literature, ranging from challenging C&#8722;H bond activation to efficient water oxidation. Despite extensive research on first&#8208;row terminal metal&#8208;oxo complexes and the &#8220;oxo&#8208;wall&#8221; concept, studies correlating the reactivity of these species across the periodic table remain scarce. In this work, using a combination of DFT and ab initio CASSCF calculations, we have explored the structure, bonding, and reactivity of [MIV/V(15&#8208;TMC)(O)(CH3CN)]m+ (M= Mn, Fe and Co) species. Our study reveals several intriguing outcomes: (i) while existing literature typically indicates the presence of either CoIV=O or CoIII&#8211;O&#8226; species beyond the wall, we propose a quantum mechanical mixture of these two species (termed as CoIV=O 
 CoIII&#8211;O&#8226;), with the per cent of mixing dictated by ligand architecture and symmetry considerations; (ii) we observe that the oxyl radical character increases beyond the wall, correlating with larger Ntrans&#8208;M&#8722;O tilt angles; and (iii) we identify an inverse relationship between the percentage of M&#8211;O&#8226; character and the kinetic barriers for C&#8722;H bond activation. These findings offer a new perspective on the roles of oxidation states, spin states, and the nature of the metal ion in reactivity.

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Throughput Microarrays of Peptidoglycan Fragments as a Novel Sero&#8208;Diagnostic Tool for Patient Antibody Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel on&#8208;chip synthesis technology, microarrays of peptidoglycan fragments were generated comprising 864 variants derived from Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. These were used to map monoclonal antibody specificity and to screen samples from patients with the autoimmune disease epidermolysis bullosa, revealing distinct antibody responses. This highlights the platform's potential for profiling microbiome&#8208;associated diseases.







Abstract
Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a complex biopolymer crucial for cell wall integrity and function of all bacterial species. While the strong inflammatory properties of PGN and its derived muropeptides are well&#8208;documented in human innate immune responses, adaptive immunity, including antibody responses to PGN, remain inadequately characterized. Microarray technology represents a cost&#8208; and time&#8208;efficient method for studying such interactions. Our laser&#8208;based technology enables the high&#8208;throughput synthesis of biomolecules on functionalized glass slides. Here, this on&#8208;chip synthesis was developed for PGN fragments, to generate a variety of 216 stem peptides and attach six different glycan moieties that are major structural components of bacterial cell walls. Thereby, 864 PGN fragments from different Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive species were generated. The arrays were validated with four different monoclonal antibodies against PGN or poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine and identified their epitopes. Finally, proof of concept for antibody profiling in patient samples was performed by comparing a panel of well&#8208;characterized plasma samples of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) patients suffering from (chronic) wounds with Staphylococcus aureus infection. EB patients show an increased response to the muramyl dipeptide. Therefore, this novel high&#8208;throughput PGN glycopeptide microarray technology promises to identify distinct antibody profiles against human microbiomes in diseases, notably in those involving the intestine.

         <title>Tailoring Molecular Diffusion in Core&#8208;Shell Zeolite Imidazolate Framework Composites Realizes Efficient Kinetic Separation of Xylene Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8211;shell construction strategy enables precise heterogeneous diffusion control, facilitating the kinetic separation of xylene isomers. The distinctive heterogeneous pore channels in the core&#8211;shell ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67 composite allow the shell layer to effectively exclude larger isomers while selectively screening PX. Simultaneously, the inner core provides rapid diffusion kinetics for PX, ensuring efficient separation.







Abstract
The separation of xylene isomers is a critical and energy&#8208;intensive process in the petrochemical industry, primarily due to their closely similar molecular structures and boiling points. In this work, we report the synthesis and application of a novel core&#8211;shell zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) composite, ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67, designed to significantly enhance the kinetic separation of xylene isomers through a synergistic &#8220;shell&#8208;gated diffusion and core&#8208;facilitated transport&#8221; strategy. The external ZIF&#8208;67 shell selectively restricts the diffusion of larger isomers (MX and OX), while the internal ZIF&#8208;65 core accelerates the diffusion of PX, thereby amplifying the diffusion differences among the isomers. This architecture yields remarkable improvements in both selectivity and diffusion rates, as demonstrated by vapor&#8208;phase adsorption studies and molecular dynamics simulations. The ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67 composite exhibits up to 12.5 times higher PX/OX selectivity in liquid&#8208;phase adsorption and 3.4 times higher dynamic selectivity in fixed&#8208;column breakthrough experiments compared to the individual ZIF components. Theoretical simulations further corroborate the heterogeneous diffusion control mechanism, revealing the time&#8208;dependent diffusion regulation within the core&#8211;shell architecture. This work underscores the great potential of core&#8211;shell MOF composites in optimizing molecular sieving processes for industrially significant separations and highlights a new route for enhancing kinetic separation efficiency in complex multicomponent systems.

         <title>Chemical Proteomics Reveals Human Off&#8208;Targets of Fluoroquinolone Induced Mitochondrial Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic overview of the adverse effects of Ciprofloxacin related to mitochondrial toxicity. AIFM1 plays a role in the MIA40&#8208;mediated import into the IMS and oxidative folding of nuclear&#8208;encoded proteins, including ETC complexes I and IV subunits. Ciprofloxacin disrupts the IMS import machinery, impairing ETC function. Dysfunction, especially of complex I, leads to a reduction in the NAD+/NADH ratio. This alteration in redox homeostasis, coupled with a shortage of NAD+, a crucial cofactor for the TCA cycle, can trigger metabolic reprogramming involving IDH2.







Abstract
Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are an important class of potent broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics. However, their general use is more and more limited by adverse side effects. While general mechanisms for the fluoroquinolone&#8208;associated disability (FQAD) have been identified, the underlying molecular targets of toxicity remain elusive. In this study, focusing on the most commonly prescribed FQs Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin, whole proteome analyses revealed prominent mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells, specifically of the complexes I and IV of the electron transport chain (ETC). Furthermore, global untargeted chemo&#8208;proteomic methodologies such as photo&#8208;affinity profiling with FQ&#8208;derived probes, as well as derivatization&#8208;free thermal proteome profiling, were applied to elucidate human protein off&#8208;targets of FQs in living cells. Accordingly, the interactions of FQs with mitochondrial AIFM1 and IDH2 have been identified and biochemically validated for their contribution to mitochondrial dysfunction. Of note, the FQ induced ETC dysfunction via AIFM1 activates the reverse carboxylation pathway of IDH2 for rescue, however, its simultaneous inhibition further enhances mitochondrial toxicity. This off&#8208;target discovery study provides unique insights into FQ toxicity enabling the utilization of identified molecular principles for the design of a safer FQ generation.

Furthermore, global untargeted chemo-proteomic methodologies such as photo-affinity profiling with FQ-derived probes, as well as derivatization-free thermal proteome profiling, were applied to elucidate human protein off-targets of FQs in living cells. Accordingly, the interactions of FQs with mitochondrial AIFM1 and IDH2 have been identified and biochemically validated for their contribution to mitochondrial dysfunction. Of note, the FQ induced ETC dysfunction &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; AIFM1 activates the reverse carboxylation pathway of IDH2 for rescue, however, its simultaneous inhibition further enhances mitochondrial toxicity. This off-target discovery study provides unique insights into FQ toxicity enabling the utilization of identified molecular principles for the design of a safer FQ generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atropisomerism in Triarylboranes: Lewis Base Assisted Rotation at C&#8722;B Stereogenic Axis in Asymmetrical Boron Lewis Acids</title>

From decades to minutes: regulation of the rotation speed at the C&#8722;B chirality axis by peri&#8208;substituents and Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions in unprecedented triarylboranes with a C&#8722;B stereogenic axis enabled to reach atropostable and enantiopure triarylboranes.







Abstract
The synthesis, properties and structural requirements for atropisomerism at the C&#8722;B bond in boron Lewis acids such as triarylboranes have been understudied so far. We report the first series of atropisomeric triarylboranes constituted of a naphthyl rotor and a dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;bora&#8208;anthracenyl stator subunits, connected by a C&#8722;B stereogenic axis. Through systematic crystallographic, kinetic, photophysical and quantum chemical studies, the mechanisms, rates and barriers of diastereomerization and enantiomerization were determined. The orthogonal arrangement between the naphthyl and the dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;bora&#8208;anthracenyl scaffold moiety hamper the rotation of these two moieties around their Csp2&#8722;B bonds, enabling chiral resolution leading to enantiopure triarylboranes of high configurational stability. Furthermore, we fully elucidated a Lewis&#8208;base assisted pathway controlling the rotation speed at the C&#8722;B stereogenic axis, enabling the atropisomerical behavior of these triarylboranes be controlled by a Lewis base.

         <title>Solvent Chemistry Manipulated Iodine Redox Thermodynamics For Durable Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aprotic solvents with strong electron&#8208;donating properties facilitates charge transfer with iodine and promotes complexation with iodide ions as solvent&#8901;I3&#8722; species, which leads to a two&#8208;step transformation (I2 &#8596; I3&#8722; &#8596; I&#8722;) in aprotic solvents. However, protic solvents form additional hydrogen bonds with iodine, alleviating polarization and reducing interaction with iodide ions, which results in one&#8208;step conversion reaction (I2 &#8596; I&#8722;).







Abstract
The diverse valences of iodine enable it with multi&#8208;electron transfer capability for energy dense batteries. However, previous studies indicate that the primary I&#8722;/I2 redox couple exhibits distinct behaviors depending on electrolyte choice, with the mechanistic basis of aqueous versus nonaqueous systems remaining unclear. Here, we elucidated the solvent effect on iodine redox, particularly focusing on polyiodide formation and their molecular interaction correlations. We validate that a thermodynamically one&#8208;step conversion reaction (I2 &#8596; I&#8722;) occurs in the protic solvents, while it is a two&#8208;step transformation (I2 &#8596; I3&#8722; &#8596; I&#8722;) in aprotic solvents. This distinction arises from strong electron&#8208;donating properties in aprotic solvents that facilitate charge transfer with iodine, promoting complexation with iodide as solvent&#8901;I3&#8722; species. Conversely, protic solvents form additional hydrogen bonds with iodine, alleviating polarization and reducing interaction with iodide. Furthermore, to address the limitations of single protic electrolytes &#8211; characterized by sluggish dissolution&#8208;precipitation and slow ion migration rates &#8211; we propose a hybrid electrolyte combining water and ethylene glycol. These hybrids enhance iodine redox kinetics, inhibits I3&#8722; generation, and modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure to mitigate zinc anode corrosion and dendrite. The Zn&#8722;I2 batteries demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability in a wide temperature range, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

         <title>The Substituent&#8208;Effect in NHCP&#8208;Plumbylenes with a Phosphaplumbene Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of aryl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted NHCP&#8208;plumbylenes is achieved through metathesis reactions. Based on computational studies, the substituent effect and the potential double bond character in these species are discussed. A formal [2+2] cycloaddition at a P&#8722;Pb bond demonstrates the synthetic equivalence to double bonds.







Abstract
This work explores the use of plumbylene&#8208;phosphinidenes to address the challenge of isolating P=Pb bonds. Herein, we report the synthesis of three N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene phosphinidene (NHCP) substituted chlorotetrylene dimers [(IDipp)PECl]2 (E=Ge, Sn, Pb; IDipp=C([N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)CH]2)). Substituent attachment via salt metathesis (E=Sn, Pb) enables the isolation of NHCP&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted stannylene (IDipp)PSn(SiTms2SiTol3) as well as NHCP&#8208;silyl&#8208; and NHCP&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted plumbylenes (IDipp)PPb(SiTms2SiTol3) and (IDipp)PPb(mTer) (mTer=2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3, Tms=Trimethylsilyl). Access to these structures not only expands this chemistry to the heaviest of group 14 elements but also provides a deeper understanding of the substituent effect on NHCP&#8208;tetrylene bonding. Computational studies demonstrate that both silyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted species exhibit partial multiple bond character, with the silyl&#8208;substituted species showing higher bond orders and reduced polarization. This is further supported by the short P&#8722;E bond lengths observed in their solid&#8208;state structures. Finally, the formal [2+2] cycloaddition of diphenylketene to (IDipp)PPb(mTer) provides experimental evidence for the ability of NHCP&#8208;plumbylenes to serve as synthetic equivalents of P=Pb double bonds.

Abstract
Regioselective and enantioselective C&#8208;H functionalization is a valuable method for synthesizing chiral and complex molecules. However, it often requires large amounts of toxic oxidants and high temperature, making it environmentally and economically adverse. Additionally, these traditional approaches generally suffer from regioselectivity and enantioselectivity issues. To overcome these limitations, a new mechanism is needed to control both of these simultaneously. Herein, we report the first Pd catalyzed regioselective distal and atroposelective olefination of simple arenes/biaryls via an electrooxidative reaction pathway. This unique electro&#8208;oxidative strategy with Pd(II) catalysis demonstrates unprecedented access to &#8216;regio&#8208;resolved&#8217; reactions, furnishing chiral molecule synthesis under dynamic kinetic resolution without the conventional requirement of metal&#8208;based oxidants and thermal energy. Both electroanalytical studies and DFT calculations suggest the involvement of a Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalytic cycle via a crucial Pd(III) intermediate that initiates both the distal and atroposelective olefination reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regioselective and enantioselective C-H functionalization is a valuable method for synthesizing chiral and complex molecules. However, it often requires large amounts of toxic oxidants and high temperature, making it environmentally and economically adverse. Additionally, these traditional approaches generally suffer from regioselectivity and enantioselectivity issues. To overcome these limitations, a new mechanism is needed to control both of these simultaneously. Herein, we report the first Pd catalyzed regioselective distal and atroposelective olefination of simple arenes/biaryls &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; an electrooxidative reaction pathway. This unique electro-oxidative strategy with Pd(II) catalysis demonstrates unprecedented access to &#8216;regio-resolved&#8217; reactions, furnishing chiral molecule synthesis under dynamic kinetic resolution without the conventional requirement of metal-based oxidants and thermal energy. Both electroanalytical studies and DFT calculations suggest the involvement of a Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalytic cycle &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a crucial Pd(III) intermediate that initiates both the distal and atroposelective olefination reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Facet&#8208;Controlled Internal Electric Field in MOF/COF Heterojunction Towards Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalently connected NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti)/TpBpy&#8208;COF heterojunction with a strong internal electric field was constructed to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting performance. The results show that the co&#8208;exposure of the (001) and (111) crystal faces in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) forms the strongest internal electric field with TpBpy&#8208;COF, promoting the effective separation of photogenerated charges in the S&#8208;scheme path.







Abstract
Covalently integrating two type of crystalline porous materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to form heterostructure photocatalysts inheriting their structural merits has shown inherent advantages in hydrogen evolution reaction. However, how to control the internal electric field in aimed MOF/COF heterojunction to achieve an improved photocatalytic activity is still ambiguous. Herein, for the first time, we report a rational control of the internal electric field in MOF/COF heterojunction by engineering the crystal facet of MOFs to achieve enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) activity. A new type of covalently connected MOF/COF photocatalytic system based on NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) and TpBpy&#8208;COF was synthesized. As confirmed, the exposed crystal facet of MOFs greatly affected the resultant activity of MOF/COF system. The combination of decahedron NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) and TpBpy&#8208;COF shows an optimal OWS activity with the H2 and O2 evolution rates of 331.6 and 165.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, respectively, which is the best performance in COFs or COF&#8208;based photocatalyst at present. The great influence of formed anisotropic facets on internal electric field of the S&#8208;scheme MOF/COF heterojunction interface is fully confirmed by various characterizations, and the active crystal facet of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) for water oxidation reaction is further proved.

         <title>Copper(I) Halide Complex Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Aggregate Induced Emission for Efficient X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I) halide complex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging performance, which is resulted from the joint effect of effective X&#8208;ray absorption of the heavy Cu2I2 core, high exciton utilization efficiency facilitated by the fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and the effective suppression of non&#8208;radiative transitions in solid state.







Abstract
Developing solution&#8208;processable and stable scintillators with high light yields, low detection limits and high imaging resolutions holds great significance for flexible X&#8208;ray imaging. However, attaining an optimal equilibrium among X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, exciton utilization efficiency, and decay lifetime of scintillators remains a substantial challenge. Here, a new Cu(I) halide complex was synthesized in a mild condition. It exhibits intense blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristic, as well as good water&#8208;oxygen stability and photochemical stability. Notably, the complex shows excellent radiation resistance and efficient radioluminescence (RL) with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 42.5&#8197;nGyairs&#8722;1. This superior scintillation performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of effective X&#8208;ray absorption by the heavy Cu2I2 core, the high radiation&#8208;induced exciton utilization rate in TADF process, and the remarkable suppression of non&#8208;radiative transitions by the restriction of intramolecular motions in solid state. Furthermore, the favourable solution processability of the complex facilitates the successful fabrication of a flexible film, achieving high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging with a resolution of 17.3&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of hybrid Cu(I) halides with AIE&#8208;TADF effects for high&#8208;energy radiation detection and imaging, opening up new avenues for the exploration of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance scintillators.

         <title>Tuning Zn2+ Deposition Kinetics towards Deep&#8208;Reversible Zinc Metal Batteries with All&#8208;Climate Adaptability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steric hindrance effect of reduced glutathione (RGSH) tunes Zn2+ electrochemical reduction kinetics to match Zn2+ migration, suppressing the concentration polarization. RGSH with abundant hydrogen bond donors and acceptors reconfigures H&#8208;bond networks for all&#8208;climate adaptability, eliminating &#8220;dead Zn&#8221; at low temperature and HER corrosion at high temperature. Thus, ultra&#8208;long lifespan and wide service temperature AZMBs are achieved.







Abstract
Uncontrollable Zn dendrites and severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) hamper the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries, which closely related to the deposition kinetics and thermodynamic stability of Zn anode. In this work, we returned to the classic perspectives of kinetics and thermodynamics, introducing a small amount of reduced glutathione (RGSH) to reshape the kinetic behavior of Zn2+ deposition and increasing the thermodynamic energy barrier of HER. Specifically, the steric hindrance effect of RGSH tuned the electrochemical reduction kinetics to match Zn2+ migration and increased the proportion of Zn2+ in the bulk phase migration, thereby inducing dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior with ordered (002) texturing. Meanwhile, RGSH with abundant hydrogen bond donors and acceptors reconfigures the coordination network of water molecules for all&#8208;climate adaptability, eliminating the accumulation of &#8220;dead Zn&#8221; at low temperature and the HER corrosion at high temperature. As a result, the advanced Zn||Zn symmetric cells deliver an extra&#8208;long cycling performance (over 4600&#8197;h) and a wide temperature tolerance (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C~70&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, the NH4V4O10||Zn full cell can operate stably for over 1000 cycles with 84.3&#8201;% capacity retention. Surprisingly, the practical NH4V4O10||Zn pouch cell with limited N/P ratio (2.3) reserved 84.1&#8201;% capacity after 150 cycles.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Ketenimine Intermediates as Active Catalysts in the Michael Addition of Unactivated Nitriles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PCNHCP Manganese hydride complex [(PCNHCP)Mn(CO)2H] (1) is able to reversibly activate unactivated nitriles. The resulting manganese&#8208;ketenimine complexes have proven to be competent catalysts for the Michael addition of unactivated nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile, propionitrile, and butyronitrile) to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The reaction occurs under mild conditions, exhibits a wide substrate scope, and is easily scalable.







Abstract
The Michael addition of unactivated nitriles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is a challenging yet desirable strategy for installing alkyl cyano&#8208;groups (R&#8208;CN) in organic molecules. However, despite formidable efforts, using acetonitrile as a Michael donor in these reactions has remained a significant challenge. Herein, we report a highly active manganese(I) complex [(PCNHCP)Mn(CO)2H] (1), which chemoselectively catalyzes the 1,4&#8208;addition of unactivated nitriles (incl. acetonitrile) to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The developed methodology operates under mild conditions, does not require any additives or bases, features low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%), fast reaction times (2&#8211;8&#8197;hours), and is compatible with a wide variety of functional groups, including halides, trifluoromethyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and (hetero)aryl groups. Extensive mechanistic studies revealed that after base&#8208;free activation of the nitrile, either the N&#8208;bound manganese&#8208;ketenimine (propionitrile or benzyl cyanide) or the C&#8208;bound manganese&#8208;cyanoalkyl (acetonitrile) complex is formed. The difference in stability of these two species explains why more sterically hindered and presumably less activated nitriles (i.e., propionitrile, and butyronitrile) show higher reactivity than their corresponding more activated congeners (i.e., acetonitrile). Finally, the practicality of our approach was demonstrated through a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent derivatizations of the obtained product into important organic motifs such as ene&#8208;lactams and tetrahydropyridines.

&lt;p&gt;PC&lt;sub&gt;NHC&lt;/sub&gt;P Manganese hydride complex [(PC&lt;sub&gt;NHC&lt;/sub&gt;P)Mn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is able to reversibly activate unactivated nitriles. The resulting manganese-ketenimine complexes have proven to be competent catalysts for the Michael addition of unactivated nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile, propionitrile, and butyronitrile) to &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketones. The reaction occurs under mild conditions, exhibits a wide substrate scope, and is easily scalable.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michael addition of unactivated nitriles to &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketones is a challenging yet desirable strategy for installing alkyl cyano-groups (R-CN) in organic molecules. However, despite formidable efforts, using acetonitrile as a Michael donor in these reactions has remained a significant challenge. Herein, we report a highly active manganese(I) complex [(PC&lt;sub&gt;NHC&lt;/sub&gt;P)Mn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), which chemoselectively catalyzes the 1,4-addition of unactivated nitriles (incl. acetonitrile) to &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketones. The developed methodology operates under mild conditions, does not require any additives or bases, features low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%), fast reaction times (2&#8211;8&#8197;hours), and is compatible with a wide variety of functional groups, including halides, trifluoromethyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and (hetero)aryl groups. Extensive mechanistic studies revealed that after base-free activation of the nitrile, either the N-bound manganese-ketenimine (propionitrile or benzyl cyanide) or the C-bound manganese-cyanoalkyl (acetonitrile) complex is formed. The difference in stability of these two species explains why more sterically hindered and presumably less activated nitriles (&lt;i&gt;i.e&lt;/i&gt;., propionitrile, and butyronitrile) show higher reactivity than their corresponding more activated congeners (&lt;i&gt;i.e&lt;/i&gt;., acetonitrile). Finally, the practicality of our approach was demonstrated through a gram-scale reaction and subsequent derivatizations of the obtained product into important organic motifs such as ene-lactams and tetrahydropyridines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Highly Reversible Mn2+/MnO2 Conversion Reaction in Electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries via Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical Process Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiO2 and FeSO4 are introduced into the electrolyte to construct a colloidal electrolyte, which synergistically promotes efficient conversion of MnO2/Mn2+. During charging, SiO2 promotes efficient deposition of Mn2+ and Mn3+, while during discharge, the introduction of Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs facilitate efficient dissolution of MnO2. The synergistic effect enhances the reversibility of MnO2/Mn2+ reaction.







Abstract
Despite the widespread interest in electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries with excellent output voltage and high theoretical capacity, the spontaneous disproportionation reaction of free Mn3+ along with the disorderly deposited inactive MnO2 results in the low Mn2+/MnO2 conversion reversibility, which seriously affects their cycling stability. Here, we propose a novel aqueous SiO2 colloidal electrolyte with FeSO4 mediator (denoted as SF electrolyte) based on a bidirectional electrochemical&#8208;chemical model to achieve dual regulation of the MnO2 deposition/dissolution process. During the charging process, the SiO2 colloidal particles located at the carbon felt interface and the electrolyte bulk phase simultaneously provide sufficient disproportionation sites for the diffused Mn3+ to guide the orderly rapid deposition of MnO2. Meanwhile, the introduction of Fe2+ mediators during the discharge process can sufficiently react with MnO2 on the SiO2 particles in the electrolyte, thereby further enabling the efficient conversion of Mn2+/MnO2. Consequently, electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery with SF electrolyte can stably run for 550&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieve superior reversibility at a high area capacity of 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of colloidal electrolytes in modulating electrochemical&#8208;chemical processes to stabilize electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries.

         <title>Direct Observation of Electron Donation onto the Reactants and a Transient Poisoning Mechanism During CO2 Electroreduction on Ni Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ techniques reveal key insights into the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Ni single atom catalysts. Through poisoning studies, we reveal that the reduction of the system does not result in a metal&#8208;based reduction, rather it is associated with donation of electrons onto a combination of the support and the reactants. We demonstrate the suitability of these catalysts for application to CO2 waste streams which have unavoidable impurities.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are an important class of materials that mediate chemical reduction reactions, a key subset of which is Ni within a carbon support for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, how the metal atom/clusters and the carbon&#8208;based support act in concert to catalyze CO2RR is not well understood, with most reports attributing activity solely to the Ni&#8208;Nx/C moieties. To address this gap, we have undertaken a mechanistic investigation, employing in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with electrochemical studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to further understand how Ni single atoms work in conjunction with the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix to promote CO2RR to CO, and how the presence of impurities such as those present in CO2&#8208;containing waste flue gases (including NOx, and CN&#8722;) changes the catalyst upon reduction. In contrast to previous works, we do not find strong evidence for a purely metal&#8208;based reduction upon application of negative reductive potentials. Instead, we present evidence for an increase in the equatorial vs. axial splitting of Ni, consistent with electrons moving onto the reactants via the Ni single atom 3dz2 orbital. In addition, we demonstrate a transient poisoning mechanism of the Ni SAC by nitrite and thiocyanate, explaining the recovery of activity during CO2RR. These insights can aid the design of practical CO2 valorization technologies.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Boron Enolates to Construct Acyclic All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a mild and convenient method for the synthesis of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates via the 1,2&#8208;hydroboration of ketenes with boranes. The asymmetric allylic alkylation of boron enolates was also developed, providing efficient access to diverse valuable chiral aldehydes in good yields and with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Enolates are ubiquitous intermediates in organic synthesis. Among them, boron enolates exhibit distinctive reactivity patterns and selectivities due to the presence of a boron atom, making their synthesis highly attractive. Although methods for accessing ketone&#8208; or ester&#8208;derived boron enolates are well&#8208;developed, much less progress has been made in the development of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates due to aldehydes&#8242; high tendency toward self&#8208;condensation. Therefore, the practical applications of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates are significantly hindered. We present herein an efficient method for the preparation of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates via the 1,2&#8208;hydroboration of ketenes with boranes, avoiding the use of acidic R2BCl/R2BOTf and bases and leading to improved functional group tolerance. Utilizing this convenient protocol, we developed an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of boron enolates, yielding a wide array of chiral aldehydes bearing acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, which are prevalent in various natural products and bioactive molecules. The synthetic utility and practicality of this method are demonstrated through gram&#8208;scale reactions and asymmetric syntheses of the ent&#8208;5HT1&#8197;A antagonist as well as biological activity studies in inhibiting the growth of plant pathogens.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Assembly of Enzyme&#8208;Micelle Systems for Semi&#8208;Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>

This study introduces a bio&#8208;hybrid assembly inspired by lipid&#8208;protein interactions in nature by utilizing photosensitized surfactants that self&#8208;assemble into light&#8208;absorbing micellar scaffolds capable of interfacing with hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases. This semi&#8208;artificial approach enabled benchmark turnover numbers for solar H2 production and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion, establishing a versatile platform for future photocatalytic transformations.







Abstract
Supramolecular surfactants provide a versatile platform to construct systems for solar fuel synthesis, for example via the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic photosensitizers and catalysts into diverse supramolecular structures. However, the utilization of amphiphilic photosensitizers in solar fuel production has predominantly focused on yielding gaseous products, such as molecular hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) with turnover numbers (TONs) of synthetic catalysts typically in the range of hundreds to thousands. Inspired by biological lipid&#8208;protein interactions, we present herein a bio&#8208;hybrid assembly strategy that utilizes photosensitizers as surfactants to form micellar scaffolds that interface with enzymes, namely hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases, for semi&#8208;artificial photosynthesis. Specifically, surfactants with a tris(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine)ruthenium(II) head group provide high photocatalytic activity upon association with the enzymes as their positively charged [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex electrostatically interacts with the enzymes favorably to enable direct electron transfer at the micelle&#8208;enzyme interface. Time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy support the beneficial charge carrier dynamics of the reductively quenched [Ru(bpy)3]+ species when the enzymes are introduced in the micellar solution. Thus, a biohybrid concept is introduced for solar fuel synthesis using a biomimetic enzyme&#8208;micellar system, providing also a platform for other photocatalytic transformations using enzymes in the future.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Mediated Lattice Oxygen Redox Design for Perovskite Oxide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>

SrFeO3&#8211;&#948; with Sr vacancies (SFO&#8208;Srv) undergoes a hole&#8208;mediated lattice oxygen redox mechanism during CO oxidation reaction. The holes in SFO&#8208;Srv are reversibly consumed and regenerated via highly covalent Fe(4&#8211;x)+&#8208;O(2&#8211;x)&#8211; sites during the entire lattice oxygen redox process.







Abstract
Present design and application of perovskite oxide catalysts assume lattice oxygen redox (LOR) mechanisms that depend on lattice oxygen activity without consideration of the entire redox cycle. Herein, using in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we uncover a hole&#8208;mediated LOR cycle on p&#8208;type Sr&#8208;deficient SrFeO3&#8211;&#948; (SFO&#8208;Srv) perovskites in CO oxidation reaction. Sr vacancies activate surface lattice oxygen of SFO&#8208;Srv and promote formation of highly covalent Fe(4&#8211;x)+&#8208;O(2&#8211;x)&#8211; sites. In situ electrical conductivity measurement demonstrates that holes directly participate in the entire LOR cycle, and are reversibly consumed and regenerated in reducing/oxidizing atmosphere via Fe(4&#8211;x)+&#8208;O(2&#8211;x)&#8211; sites of SFO&#8208;Srv. Hole&#8208;mediated LOR in SFO&#8208;Srv, as revealed by in situ soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, occurs through changing in covalency of Fe&#8722;O bonds, O 2p hole state, and electron density of Fe sites. 18O2 labeling experiment further confirms an improved Mars&#8211;van Krevelen pathway in the hole&#8208;mediated LOR cycle, which accounts for a ten&#8208;times enhancement of SFO&#8208;Srv for CO reaction rate over that of SFO alone.

         <title>Robust Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles via Ethynyl Bonding for High&#8208;Fidelity Bioanalytical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, rapid and user&#8208;friendly strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;functionalized AuNP conjugates via stable Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bonds was developed, which showed better resistance to biothiols than Au&#8722;S conjugates, enhancing detection signal fidelity and reliability in cell imaging, especially in complex physiological environments. This strategy addresses the longstanding issue of stability towards biothiols, thereby making it a valuable tool for a broad range of biological applications.







Abstract
While Au&#8722;S bonds have been widely applied in preparing gold nanoparticle (AuNP) bioconjugates for biosensing, cell imaging, and biomedical research, biothiols in complex biological environments can seriously interfere with the stability of the conjugates due to ligand exchange. Herein, we communicate a robust and fast strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;functionalized AuNP conjugates (PFCs) using the Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond, which can be completed within two minutes. The resulting Au&#8722;C&#8801;C PFCs exhibited better stability and resistance to biothiols than the corresponding Au&#8722;S PFCs, and also demonstrated excellent stability in high salt concentration, a wide range of pH values, and varying temperatures. The mechanism of Au&#8722;C&#8801;C conjugation was confirmed using molecular dynamics simulation and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Au&#8722;C&#8801;C PFCs significantly improved the signal fidelity in an intracellular caspase imaging assay. Overall, the developed strategy provides a promising approach for constructing AuNP nanoprobes, allowing reliable detection and broadening the potential for diverse biological applications.

         <title>Promoting Li+&#8208;Solvents Desolvation by Engineering Nickel Single Atoms into Graphene Membrane toward Fast Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni single atom anchored on the graphene membrane (Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G) was prepared by an in situ electrochemical doping coupled with a self&#8208;assembly strategy. The Ni single atom sites can accelerate the dissociation process of the Li+&#8208;solvent complex and obtain a large number of Li+, which delivers fast sulfur redox kinetics. Furthermore, the large&#8208;sized solvent molecules and polysulfides were largely sieved and restricted when passing through the specific nano&#8208;channels of the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries featuring high energy density are expected to be next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, but are severely impeded by the suppressive Li+&#8208;solvents desolvation process at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, a novel electrochemical in situ doping coupled with a self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed to fabricate the graphene membrane anchored by Ni single atoms (Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G), aimed at promoting the dissociation kinetics of Li+&#8208;solvents complex by combining electrocatalysis and nanochannel sieving effect. Theoretical simulation and in situ Raman spectroscopy characterizations revealed that the Ni&#8208;O5 configuration within the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane is capable of lowering the Li+&#8208;solvent dissociation energy barrier and promoting free Li+ migration, thereby delivering the fast sulfur redox kinetics. In addition, taking advantage of the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane with a special transport channel, the large&#8208;sized solvent molecules and polysulfides were sieved and confined to a great degree. As a result, the Li&#8722;S batteries with the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G on separator as cathode front&#8208;faces exhibit a high capacity of 1169&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a good rate performance and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability, where a capacity decay of only 0.024&#8201;% per cycle after 700 cycles can be achieved. Furthermore, the cell with a sulfur loading of 4.78&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 delivers a high areal capacity of 4.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;C.

         <title>A Sequential Release Micro&#8208;nano System for Colitis Therapy via Gut Microbiota and Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>

The micro&#8208;nano system achieves the sequential release of drugs in response to gut microbiota and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inulin prebiotics restore gut microbiota balance. Selenium compounds scavenge ROS and promote macrophage polarization, while 3&#8208;oxolithocholic acid suppresses TH17&#8208;cell differentiation. As a multifactorial therapeutic approach, inulin microspheres containing nanomicelles target the gut microbiome and immune responses for treating acute colitis.







Abstract
Commencing with the breakdown of the intestinal barrier, various pathogenic factors, such as dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, harmful inflammatory cytokines, and immune system imbalance, collectively contribute to the development of colitis. Numerous interventions focusing on single factors have been developed to provide short&#8208;term therapeutic benefits, but the continued existence of unresolved pathogenic factors can lead to disease exacerbation. Here we have designed a multicomponent system&#8208;inulin microspheres encapsulating selenium&#8208;containing nanomicelles, aiming to tackle the multiple factors associated with colitis. This micro&#8208;nano drug delivery platform achieves sequential release of drugs in the inflamed colon, with each component of the system functioning independently and jointly. The outer layer of inulin supplies nutrients for probiotics. The inner core comprises selenocystamine and 3&#8208;oxolithocholic acid, which polarize macrophages towards an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype and regulate adaptive immunity by inhibiting TH17&#8208;cell differentiation, respectively. In an acute colitis mouse model, this therapeutic system ameliorates colonic inflammation, enhances the abundance of gut microbiota, and modulates the mucosal immune system, showing potential in preventing colitis.

         <title>Dominant Face&#8208;On Oriented Perylene&#8208;Diimide Interlayers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry has been used to synthesize a non&#8208;ionic cathode interlayer (PDIBr&#8208;TOT). The dominant face&#8208;on orientation arising from the bulky and extended side chains affords a solar cell efficiency of 19.52&#8201;%, out&#8208;performing typical self&#8208;doping interlayers. Furthermore, the weak electron&#8208;donating side chains in the PDIBr&#8208;TOT interlayers remarkably enhance the device stability.







Abstract
Electron transport properties of cathode interlayers are crucial to high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). We propose a novel approach to enhance electron transport of cathode interlayers through controlling a preferential face&#8208;on molecular orientation of non&#8208;ionic perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208; (PDI) based cathode interlayers with restricted n&#8208;doping effects. 1&#8208;(2,5,8&#8208;trioxadec&#8208;10&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole (TOT) units as bulky and extended side chains were incorporated into brominated&#8208;PDIs via click chemistry to yield PDIBr&#8208;TOT. TOT side chains impart PDI&#8208;based interlayers with a dominant face&#8208;on orientation, meanwhile leading to a negligible doping effect due to their weak electron&#8208;donating properties. Impressively, at a slight doping level, higher electron mobility is gained through efficient vertical charge transport channels built by preferred face&#8208;on molecular orientations of PDIBr&#8208;TOT, beating the results acquired through strong doping effects of traditional PDIBr&#8722;N with an edge&#8208;on orientation. Thus, PDIBr&#8208;TOT can suppress exciton recombination and lower the surface energies for good contact with active layers, consequently leading to increases in fill factor and short&#8208;circuit current. Integrating PDIBr&#8208;TOT with various active layers, a remarkable efficiency of 19.52&#8201;% is obtained. Moreover, device stability is enhanced by restrained doping effects. Modulating face&#8208;on orientations of cathode interlayers prescribed here will encourage further innovative designs of high&#8208;performance cathode interlayers towards OSC advances.

         <title>Tandem Switch&#8208;Triggered On&#8208;Demand Synthesis of Aromatic Amines in High Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a tandem switch strategy that transforms the site and component incompatibilities commonly observed in tandem synthesis into strengths. By using a kinetic switch with phosphotungstic acid&#8208;modified Ni&#8722;Ni(Al)O heterojunction catalyst and a thermodynamic switch via competitive adsorption of ethanol, hydrogen, and acrylonitrile, we achieve on&#8208;demand synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary aromatic amines, all with yields over 96&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tandem catalysis stands as a beacon of chemical sustainability. Although bifunctional catalysts have achieved wide success in two&#8208;step tandem reactions, achieving multi&#8208;step catalysis with three or more distinct and potentially incompatible catalytic sites and components remains an ambitious challenge. Here, we present a &#8220;tandem switch&#8221; strategy that transforms these incompatibilities into functional advantages, enabling on&#8208;demand production of primary, secondary, and tertiary aromatic amines, all with yields exceeding 96&#8201;%. A kinetic switch, enabled by phosphotungstic acid functionalization of the Ni&#8722;Ni(Al)O heterojunction catalyst, modulates the Ni&#8722;Ni and Ni&#8722;O boundary microenvironment to simultaneously accelerate the rate&#8208;determining steps in nitrobenzene hydrogenation, N&#8208;alkylation, and aza&#8208;Michael addition. Meanwhile, a thermodynamic switch, controlled by the competitive adsorption of ethanol, hydrogen, and acrylonitrile, stepwise minimizes Gibbs free energy to ensure a seamless reaction cascade. Hence, by toggling these tandem switches on or off, we achieve selective regulation of nitrobenzene conversion pathways into the production of targeted aromatic amine. Techno&#8208;economic analysis shows the developed process significantly reduces material and energy consumption for sustainable amine production.

         <title>Discovery of Covalent and Cell&#8208;Active ALKBH5 Inhibitors with Potent Antileukemia Effects In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by a non&#8208;catalytic C200&#8208;covalent strategy, a series of maleimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as covalent ALKBH5 inhibitors. Compound 18&#8201;l exhibited good ALKBH5 inhibitory activity, and excellent in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects. Furthermore, 18&#8201;l also had intracellular targeting at the proteomic level.







Abstract
The N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase ALKBH5 is the only other identified m6A eraser except for FTO, and dysregulated ALKBH5 functions were closely associated with leukemogenesis. However, the development of ALKBH5 inhibitors is slow compared to FTO inhibitors. Inspired by a non&#8208;catalytic C200&#8208;covalent strategy, a series of maleimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as potent and covalent ALKBH5 inhibitors in this work. The analog 18&#8201;l exhibited excellent inhibitory effects on ALKBH5 (IC50=0.62&#8197;&#956;M), and exerted a strong antiproliferative effect on NB4 cells with IC50 of 0.63&#8197;&#956;M. The Kd value of 18&#8201;l binding to ALKBH5 was 804&#8197;nM, while no binding was observed with FTO. This result indicated that 18&#8201;l was a highly selective inhibitor of ALKBH5 rather than FTO. Additionally, proteomic experiments showed that 18&#8201;l directly targeted ALKBH5 in cells and altered m6A levels on mRNA, blocked the related downstream signal pathways, promoted differentiation, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, 18&#8201;l exerted excellent in vivo antitumor activity with TGITV values of 66.3&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mg/kg in NB4 tumor xenograft models.

         <title>Maximizing the Accessibility of Acid Sites Within Zeolite Catalysts for Syngas Conversion</title>

By introducing the effective diffusion length into the relationship between the Thiele modulus and effectiveness factors of reaction rates, a 12MR channel length of 60&#8197;nm is identified to approach the threshold length for full access to the 8MR acid sites of MOR zeolite in direct syngas conversion. Consequently, MOR60 exhibits remarkable catalytic performance with CO conversion reaching 33&#8201;% and ethylene selectivity 69&#8201;%.







Abstract
Mass transport within zeolites is pivotal in determining the accessibility of active sites to reactants and hence the catalytic performance. However, there lacks of quantitative guidance for synthesis of desired zeolites with reduced diffusion limitation. Herein, we take mordenite (MOR) zeolite as a model, which is characterized by 12&#8208;membered rings (MR) channels as transport path towards the active sites within the 8MR side pockets for syngas conversion to light olefins. By correlating the effective diffusion lengths (

) with the Thiele modulus and the effectiveness factors of reaction rates over a composite catalyst ZnAlOx&#8208;MOR, we determine that the shortest 12MR channel length (

) of 60&#8197;nm in this study is close to the threshold length necessary for full access to the 8MR acid sites. As a result, it exhibits excellent catalytic performance with CO conversion reaching 33&#8201;% and ethylene selectivity 69&#8201;%. Furthermore, the methodology is general and essential for further development of efficient zeolite catalysts with fully accessible active sites.

         <title>Integration of Through&#8208;Space Conjugation of an Adjacent Arene with a Nitrogen/Carbonyl Framework for Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space conjugated (TSC) materials with highly efficient device performance and narrowband emission are still challenging. Introducing two bulky TSC blocks restrains the vibrational transitions of the multi&#8208;resonance nitrogen/carbonyl core, with full widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19 and 25&#8197;nm in solution. A record&#8208;high electroluminescent efficiency for a nitrogen/carbonyl system of 26.7&#8201;% with a FWHM of 23&#8197;nm was obtained within the blue spectrum.







Abstract
Organic luminescent materials featuring noncovalent through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) have attracted considerable attention. However, the presence of multiple vibrational energy levels and weak spatial electron delocalization typically results in broad emission peaks for TSC&#8208;based emitters, significantly impeding their extensive application in optoelectronic technologies. Herein, two TSC emitters, TSFQ&#8208;TRZ and TSFQ&#8208;Ph, were synthesized by integrating a fused nitrogen/carbonyl skeleton with various adjacent arene 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TPTRZ) and phenyl group segments through a rigid spiro spacer. These emitters exhibited narrow emissions, with full widths at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#8197;nm and 25&#8197;nm, respectively. Experimental and theoretical investigations unveiled that the TPTRZ segment introduces steric hindrance, while simultaneously suppressing molecular vibrations through intramolecular interactions&#8212;a key factor in achieving narrow emissions. Leveraging this narrow blue emission, electroluminescent devices employing TSFQ&#8208;TRZ as the emitter achieved an impressive maximum external quantum efficiency of 26.7&#8201;%, which further increased to 28.3&#8201;% when sensitized by phosphorescent emitter. This work demonstrates highly efficient, narrowband emissions from TSC&#8208;based emitters, thereby expanding their potential applications in the electroluminescence field.

         <title>Can Electroactive Tracer Molecules Reveal Viscoelastic Structure by Measuring Non&#8208;Fickian Diffusion?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Voltage scans of duration t electrolyze reducer R to oxidizer O yielding peak&#8208;currents (Ip). The ensuing concentration gradient of R induces a diffusion rate towards the electrode that peaks at Ip and decays as 1/t1/2. Plotting log of Ip2 vs. 1/t&#945; introduces diffusion exponent &#945; as slope indicator of &#8220;free&#8221; Fickian diffusion (&#945;=1) in viscous liquids and &#8220;hindered&#8221; Non&#8208;Fickian sub&#8208;diffusion (&#945;&lt;1) in viscoelastic hydrogels.







Abstract
We find that viscous and viscoelastic fluids are distinguishable by gauging Non&#8208;Fickian diffusion of dissolved electroactive molecules. Typically, such fluids are differentiated by measuring the mean&#8208;squared&#8208;displacement &lt;&#916;r2&gt; of embedded tracer particles (~1&#8197;&#956;m) diffusing over time (t). From the relationship &lt;&#916;r2&gt;=6Dt&#945; (D=particle diffusivity), log plots of &lt;&#916;r2&gt;vs.t&#945; reveal regimes encoded in the slope &#945;. For Fickian diffusion &#945;=1, whereas &#945;&lt;1 and &#945;&gt;1, indicate Non&#8208;Fickian sub&#8208; and super&#8208;diffusion, respectively. Here, we electrolyzed redox reporters as molecular tracers in selected fluids. The current (I) relationship I

 ${\propto }$



v1/2 (v=scan&#8208;rate) was recast as I2vs.1/t&#945; to introduce &#945; as Non&#8208;Fickian quantifier in log plots. When viscosity increased at high concentration of small&#8208;molecules, D for the redox reporter declined but &#945; remained constant at ~1 (Fickian). In contrast, both D and &#945;(&lt;1) decreased in viscoelastic hydrogels confirming a molecular sub&#8208;diffusive regime. These results agree with particle microrheology on the same fluid types using optical methods that are inapplicable to molecules. By quantifying Non&#8208;Fickian diffusion of electroactive molecular tracers, our method can uncover diffusion&#8208;structure relationships to identify regulators in neurodegenerative liquid&#8208;solid transitions of protein aggregates. Unlike tracer particles, the diffusivity of tracer molecules is controlled by the applied potential and electrode size.

         <title>Pathway Engineering in Pd&#8208;Based Supramolecular Cage Synthesis via Inner&#8208;Outer Steric Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of ligand LA with palladium can selectively generate three types of assemblies: Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4. By changing the reaction conditions, the three assemblies can be transformed into each other. Based on this, introducing ligand LB can prepare Pd2LA3LB through 10 pathways, and the synthesis path of trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 can reach up to 16.







Abstract
For artificial supramolecular architectures designed to mimic biological systems, achieving different pathway synthesis is challenging due to the requirement of multiple stable and interconvertible intermediates. Here, we propose a novel &#8220;inner&#8208;outer steric synergy&#8221; strategy and investigate controllable pathway engineering for the synthesis of specific structures. Firstly, three structures (Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3 and Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4) with interconversion properties were selectively formed by assembling externally modified ligand LA with Pd(II). Furthermore, Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2 can further assemble with the ligand LB with inner steric hindrance to generate heteroleptic trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 cage, while Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, as an intermediate, can assemble with LB to form Pd2LA3LB. It is noteworthy that Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, and Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4 can interconvert under specific conditions, enabling the synthesis of Pd2LA3LB and trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 through 10 and 16 pathways, respectively. This research not only introduces a novel strategy for constructing heteroleptic cages but also demonstrates the achievement of pathway engineering.

&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; can reach up to 16.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For artificial supramolecular architectures designed to mimic biological systems, achieving different pathway synthesis is challenging due to the requirement of multiple stable and interconvertible intermediates. Here, we propose a novel &#8220;inner-outer steric synergy&#8221; strategy and investigate controllable pathway engineering for the synthesis of specific structures. Firstly, three structures (&lt;b&gt;Ring&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Bowl&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Cage&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) with interconversion properties were selectively formed by assembling externally modified ligand &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with Pd(II). Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;Ring-Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; can further assemble with the ligand &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with inner steric hindrance to generate heteroleptic &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;trans&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; cage, while &lt;b&gt;Bowl-Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, as an intermediate, can assemble with &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; to form &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. It is noteworthy that &lt;b&gt;Ring-Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Bowl-Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Cage-Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; can interconvert under specific conditions, enabling the synthesis of &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;trans&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; through 10 and 16 pathways, respectively. This research not only introduces a novel strategy for constructing heteroleptic cages but also demonstrates the achievement of pathway engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Low&#8208;Cytotoxic and Highly Efficient Type I Photoinitiators for Visible LED&#8208;/Sunlight&#8208;Induced Photopolymerization and High&#8208;Precision 3D Printing</title>

         <dc:description>
This study develops new photoinitiators (PIs) for photopolymerization, combining high efficiency, low toxicity, and compatibility with 3D printing. The C5 compound, designed via molecular modeling, outperforms commercial PIs, improving initiation by 40&#8211;132&#8201;% under LED and sunlight. Its efficiency, photochemical mechanism, and low toxicity are experimentally confirmed.







Abstract
The development of photoinitiators (PIs) combining high initiation ability, low&#8208;toxicity, and availability for high&#8208;precision 3D printing is a key challenge and an urgent problem to be solved nowadays in photopolymerization. In this study, carbazole chalcone glyoxylate oxime ester derivatives (denoted as Cs, C1&#8722;C5) containing both glyoxylate and oxime ester moieties with good light absorption properties in the visible range have been designed as type I PIs for the free radical photopolymerization (FRP) of trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) under 405&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) as well as sunlight irradiation. The reaction properties and mechanism of Cs are firstly predicted by molecular modeling/molecular design, which anticipate that C5 could exhibit the best photoinitiation ability, this structure being more prone to decarboxylation. Subsequent experimental results clearly show that the photoinitiation ability of C5 outperforms that of the benchmark commercial PIs (methyl benzoylformate (MBF), diphenyl (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO)), and phenylbis (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)&#8208;phosphine oxide (BAPO) under the same conditions. Compared to TPO, the photoinitiation ability of C5 improved by 40&#8201;%, 132&#8201;%, and 47&#8201;% exposed to LED@405&#8197;nm, LED@450&#8197;nm, and sunlight. In addition, C5 is successfully applied to 3D printing for the manufacture of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;resolution object. The photochemical mechanism of C5 is systematically and comprehensively analyzed using a combination of steady state photolysis, decarboxylation reaction, fluorescence experiments, and electron spin resonance&#8208;spin trapping (ESR&#8208;ST) technology. It is found that both glyoxylate and oxime ester in C5 are highly active and capable of undergoing decarboxylation reactions to produce CO2 and free radicals, which is consistent with the results predicted by molecular modeling. Furthermore, the low&#8208;toxicity of C5 is evidenced by cytotoxicity assays. The comprehensive molecular modeling and experimental approach adopted in this research has led to the development of novel PIs that are highly efficient and low&#8208;toxic, and can be used for high&#8208;precision 3D printing, which offers broad application prospects in the fields of environmental sustainability, visible light curing, and biomedical science.

         <title>Terpyridine&#8208; and Quarterpyridine&#8208;Based Cationic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Catalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>

Terpyridine&#8208; and quarterpyridine&#8208;based vinylene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor cationic COFs are synthesized, which exhibit considerably high visible&#8208;light catalytic efficiency with the H2O2 production rate (HPR) is as high as 7955&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in water and O2 atmosphere. Even though in air, its HPR value still reaches 6249&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The revealed structure&#8211;property relationship presents new insights into the engineering of multipyridine&#8208;based cationic COFs for highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.







Abstract
This paper presents multipyridine&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with precisely defined position and number of pyridinium cationic groups. Specifically, three terpyridine&#8208; and quarterpyridine&#8208;based trialdehydes were synthesized, and utilized as the starting monomers to polymerize with trimethylpyridinium bromide to yield vinylene&#8208;linked iTPy&#8208;COF, iTPPy&#8208;COF and iQPPy&#8208;COF, respectively. Thus constructed donor&#8208;acceptor cationic COFs exhibit considerably high visible&#8208;light catalytic efficiency for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis by the dual&#8208;channel mechanisms of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR). In pure water and O2 atmosphere, the H2O2 production rate (HPR) of iTPPy&#8208;COF after 1&#8197;h reaction is as high as 7955&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Even though in air, its HPR value still reaches 6249&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Moreover, it is found that changing the arm lengths and ratios of pyridine to benzene ring in the frameworks significantly affects the photocatalytic capability. The structure&#8211;property relationship is investigated in terms of the variations of electronic structures through the theoretical simulations and measurements of photophysical parameters such as fluorescence lifetimes, photocurrent intensities, and impedances of charge transfer, which offers new insights into the engineering of multipyridine&#8208;based cationic COFs for highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>Manipulating &#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions in Halogenated Additives for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells with 19.8&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two halogenated volatile solid additives DBB and DFBB selected to improve photovoltaic performance has been systematically studied. Our results demonstrate that the addition of DFBB with a higher electrostatic potential extremum and stronger &#963;&#8208;holes compared to DBB can regulate the multi&#8208;scale morphology to achieve a superior efficiency of 19.2&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO and 19.8&#8201;% for D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO. This work provides valuable insights to develop volatile additives for high performance OSCs.







Abstract
The incorporation of volatile solid additives has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the influence of the electronic structure of these additives on morphological evolution remains insufficiently understood. Herein, 1,4&#8208;Dibromobenzene (DBB) and 1,4&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;2,5&#8208;dibromobenzene (DFBB) are introduced as volatile additives into OSCs. Theoretical calculations indicate that DFBB has a higher electrostatic potential extremum and stronger &#963;&#8208;holes interaction compared to DBB, enabling more robust intermolecular interactions with acceptors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two halogenated volatile solid additives DBB and DFBB selected to improve photovoltaic performance has been systematically studied&lt;/b&gt;. Our results demonstrate that the addition of DFBB with a higher electrostatic potential extremum and stronger &#963;-holes compared to DBB can regulate the multi-scale morphology to achieve a superior efficiency of 19.2&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO and 19.8&#8201;% for D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO. This work provides valuable insights to develop volatile additives for high performance OSCs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of volatile solid additives has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the influence of the electronic structure of these additives on morphological evolution remains insufficiently understood. Herein, 1,4-Dibromobenzene (DBB) and 1,4-Difluoro-2,5-dibromobenzene (DFBB) are introduced as volatile additives into OSCs. Theoretical calculations indicate that DFBB has a higher electrostatic potential extremum and stronger &#963;-holes interaction compared to DBB, enabling more robust intermolecular interactions with acceptors. The synergistic halogen interactions between DFBB and the active layer matrix balances the differences in crystallinity between the donor and acceptor during the film formation process, promotes the formation of dense molecular packing and ordered orientation, optimizes the vertical composition distribution, and promotes the formation of domain sizes close to the exciton diffusion distance. Consequently, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO-based device treated with DFBB achieves an efficiency of 19.2&#8201;% with a fill factor (FF) of 80.8&#8201;%, which is superior to the control and DBB. Further validation across various systems, including PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP-eC9, and D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO, highlights similar efficiency enhancements, with the D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO system achieving an outstanding PCE of 19.8&#8201;%. This work demonstrates that the modulation of &#963;-hole interactions in volatile additives can effectively optimize multi-scale morphology for high-performance OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Gold Recycling from Electronic Waste Using a Highly Stable Porous Aromatic Framework/Polymer and Its Application for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous aromatic framework/polymer composite, PAF&#8208;147/polydopamine (PDA), is constructed via a mild in situ polymerization method for rapid and selective gold recovery from electronic waste leachate. Leveraging the redox adsorption mechanism and the unique microenvironment of PAF&#8208;147/PDA, the adsorbent post&#8208;adsorption is directly applicable for highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Recycling gold from electronic waste represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy for both resource recovery and waste reduction. In this study, we designed an innovative and highly stable porous aromatic framework (PAF)/polymer composite, PAF&#8208;147/polydopamine (PDA), as an efficient adsorbent for selective gold recovery for the first time. The maximum gold adsorption capacity of PAF&#8208;147/PDA reached 1700&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, it could rapidly extract over 95&#8201;% of gold from solutions in a pH range of 0&#8211;10 within just 2&#8197;minutes. Importantly, as a real application demonstration, the PAF&#8208;147/PDA composite selectively recovered 99&#8201;% of gold from the leachate of discarded central processing units. When the recovered Au&#8208;containing composite was applied to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, the Faradaic efficiency for CO production exceeded 95&#8201;% across acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, outperforming most reported gold&#8208;based catalysts due to the cooperation effect of the composite and Au. This work opens a new way for the combination of selective gold recovery from electronic waste with highly efficient CO2 conversion.

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation of Allyl Ethers: Optimization, Scope, Mechanism and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl ethers has been developed by using ketones as the C&#8208;nucleophiles. Linear vinyl ethers or branched allyl ethers were readily formed in high yield with excellent regioselectivity by changing the reaction conditions. Bimetallic synergistic catalysis with an achiral Pd(0) catalyst and a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;Ni(II) complex enabled the synthesis of a variety of enantioenriched allyl ethers.







Abstract
Vinyl ethers and allyl ethers are important motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods toward their synthesis, direct allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl ethers is one of the most efficient approaches. In this study, one of two regioisomers, a vinyl ether or an allyl ether, could be obtained, depending on whether a Lewis acid co&#8208;catalyst was present. Furthermore, branched allyl ethers were smoothly prepared in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 b/l, 99&#8201;% ee) by synergistic catalysis with an achiral Pd(0) complex and a chiral Lewis acid catalyst.

         <title>High&#8208;Connectivity 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with pdp Net for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>

Two novel high&#8208;connectivity 3D COFs, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662, are constructed using a combination of D2h&#8208;symmetric 8&#8208;nodal and D3h&#8208;symmetric 6&#8208;nodal building blocks. These COFs feature an unprecedented [8+6]&#8208;c pdp net with rare mesoporous polyhedral cages and exhibit outstanding C2H2/CO2 separation capabilities.







Abstract
High&#8208;connectivity 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention due to their structural complexity, stability, and potential for functional applications. However, the synthesis of 3D COFs using mixed high&#8208;nodal building units remains a substantial challenge. In this work, we introduce two novel 3D COFs, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662, which are constructed using a combination of D2h&#8208;symmetric 8&#8208;nodal and D3h&#8208;symmetric 6&#8208;nodal building blocks. These COFs feature an unprecedented [8+6]&#8208;c pdp net with rare mesoporous polyhedral cages (~3.9&#8197;nm). Remarkably, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662 exhibit outstanding separation capabilities, achieving adsorption selectivities of 4.3 and 5.9, respectively, for C2H2/CO2 (1/1, v/v) mixtures. Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm their excellent separation capability, maintaining this performance even under conditions of 100&#8201;% humidity. Monte Carlo simulations and DFT calculations indicate that the exceptional adsorption performance is attributed to the well&#8208;defined pore cavities of the COFs, with fluorination of the building unit further enhancing C2H2 selectivity through improved electrostatic and host&#8211;guest interactions. This study expands the structural diversity of COFs and highlights their potential for low&#8208;energy separation processes.

         <title>Tandem Assembly and Etching Chemistry towards Mesoporous Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Sodium Storage Over 50,000 Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range ion transport in microporous channels severely limits the application of two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) in energy storage. We establish a bi&#8208;functional modulator manipulated tandem assembly and etching chemistry to incorporate perpendicularly aligned mesopores into the microporous cMOFs, which offers two orders of magnitude shorter micropore channels, enabling a remarkable rate cyclability over 50,000 cycles at 50&#8197;C.







Abstract
Despite two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) being attractive due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity and redox activity for energy applications, alleviating the constrained mass transfer within long&#8208;range micropore channels remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a tandem assembly and etching chemistry, to incorporate perpendicularly aligned mesopores into the micropores of cMOFs, via a bi&#8208;functional modulator. Synchrotron spectral and morphological analyses demonstrate that the elaborate ammonia modulator first coordinates with Zn2+ forming defects during the initial self&#8208;assembly of cMOF oligomers, which then initiates mesoporous cMOFs via in situ etching. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations further reveal that such a unique perpendicular mesoporous structure shorts the micropore channels by two orders of magnitude and relaxes the inherent ion stacking within micropores, leading to five times faster Na+ transport and a remarkable rate capability at 250&#8197;C and sodium storage lifespan over 50,000 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Long-range ion transport in microporous channels severely limits the application of two-dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) in energy storage. We establish a bi-functional modulator manipulated tandem assembly and etching chemistry to incorporate perpendicularly aligned mesopores into the microporous cMOFs, which offers two orders of magnitude shorter micropore channels, enabling a remarkable rate cyclability over 50,000 cycles at 50&#8197;C.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite two-dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) being attractive due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity and redox activity for energy applications, alleviating the constrained mass transfer within long-range micropore channels remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a tandem assembly and etching chemistry, to incorporate perpendicularly aligned mesopores into the micropores of cMOFs, via a bi-functional modulator. Synchrotron spectral and morphological analyses demonstrate that the elaborate ammonia modulator first coordinates with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; forming defects during the initial self-assembly of cMOF oligomers, which then initiates mesoporous cMOFs via in situ etching. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations further reveal that such a unique perpendicular mesoporous structure shorts the micropore channels by two orders of magnitude and relaxes the inherent ion stacking within micropores, leading to five times faster Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and a remarkable rate capability at 250&#8197;C and sodium storage lifespan over 50,000 cycles. Our protocol opens up a new avenue for introducing mesopores into microporous cMOFs for advanced energy applications and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Photopatterning of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks via Photoinduced Fluorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a mild UV exposure dose (10&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&#8722;2), fluorinated azide molecules covalently bind to ZIFs via hydrocarbon insertion, resulting in fluorination and significantly increasing their stability in water. This method successfully realizes large&#8208;area, high&#8208;resolution direct lithography by selective exposure and water immersion.







Abstract
Precise and effective patterning strategies are essential for integrating metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into microelectronics, photonics, sensors, and other solid&#8208;state devices. Direct lithography of MOFs with light and other irradiation sources has emerged as a promising patterning strategy. However, existing direct lithography methods often rely on the irradiation&#8208;induced amorphization of the MOFs structures and the breaking of strong covalent bonds in their organic linkers. High&#8208;energy sources (such as X&#8208;rays or electron beams) and large irradiation doses &#8211; conditions unfavorable for scalable patterning &#8211; are thus required. Here, we report a photoinduced fluorination chemistry for patterning various zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) under mild UV irradiation. Using UV doses as low as 10&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&#8722;2, light&#8208;sensitive fluorine&#8208;containing molecules covalently bond to ZIFs and enhance their stability in water. This creates a water&#8208;stability contrast between ZIFs in exposed and unexposed regions, enabling scalable direct photolithography of ZIFs with high resolution (2&#8197;&#956;m) on 4&#8208;inch wafers and flexible substrates. The patterned ZIFs preserve their original crystallinity and porous properties while gaining increased hydrophobicity. This allows for the demonstration of a water&#8208;responsive fluorescent MOFs array with implications in sensing and multicolor information encryption.

Diels&#8211;Alder bond&#8208;crosslinked liquid crystal elastomers with low nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures and high reprogrammability were developed, enabling low&#8208;energy, self&#8208;sustained actuators through material&#8208;structure synergy. These actuators achieve high strain rates around 30&#8201;&#176;C, facilitating self&#8208;sustaining motion powered by ambient/body heat or solar energy, with potential in biomedical and environmentally powered applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;sustained actuators powered by natural, low&#8208;energy sources based on liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are attractive as they offer high safety, abundant energy availability, and practicality in applications. However, achieving stable self&#8208;sustaining motion with low&#8208;energy sources requires high actuation strain rates within a narrow temperature range near ambient conditions &#8211; a great challenge as LCEs with low nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures (Tni) generally exhibit reduced actuation strain and strain rates. To address this, we synthesized a carbon nanotube&#8208;doped LCE with a low Tni and reversible Diels&#8211;Alder crosslinks, termed DALCE, and readily (re)fabricated it into specific structures (e.g., twisted&#8208;and&#8208;coiled or bimorph shapes). By leveraging material&#8208;structure synergy, we achieved both low Tni and high actuation strain rates, enabling self&#8208;rolling, self&#8208;breathing and autonomous twisting&#8208;untwisting movements powered by ambient/body temperature or natural sunlight. This low&#8208;energy, self&#8208;sustained actuator design opens new possibilities for LCE&#8208;based biomedical applications and naturally powered automatic devices.

         <title>Trade&#8208;Off Between Toxicity and Efficiency in Tin&#8208; versus Lead&#8208;Based Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites are considered promising alternatives to overcome the toxicity in their Pb&#8208;based counterparts. However, it was found that there is a trade&#8208;off between toxicity and efficiency. Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites are intrinsically limited by much stronger nonradiative recombination. Future research should go beyond the Pb and Sn bases.







Abstract
Toxicity remains one of the major challenges that prevent Pb&#8208;based halide perovskites from widespread utilization. Ideally, non&#8208;toxic alternatives can be identified while still maintaining the superior power conversion efficiency of the Pb&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Using the currently most promising candidate, the Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites, as an example, we show that a trade&#8208;off exists between toxicity and efficiency in the Sn&#8208; versus Pb&#8208;based halide perovskites. Indeed, the dominant nonradiative recombination center in the Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites differs from the one in its Pb&#8208;based counterparts, resulting in the nonradiative capture coefficient in CsSnI3 being an order of magnitude higher than that in CsPbI3. We attribute this difference to the band alignment. Our results indicate that development of halide perovskites beyond the Pb and Sn bases is essential for efficient yet environmentally friendly perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Triple&#8208;Targeted Radiosensitizer Enhances Hypoxic Tumor Targeting and Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>

A triple&#8208;targeted, nitroimidazole&#8208;bearing radiosensitizer that self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles (A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs) has been developed for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging&#8208;guided on&#8208;demand radio&#8208;immunotherapy of hypoxic tumors.







Abstract
Targeted delivery of radiosensitizers and real&#8208;time monitoring of hypoxia are crucial for overcoming radiotherapy resistance in hypoxic tumors. Here, we report A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD, a triple&#8208;targeted nitroimidazole (Ni)&#8208;linked radiosensitizer that self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles (A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs) for bimodal near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR FL) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided radio&#8208;immunotherapy. A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs specifically accumulate in &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;positive tumors, where they are hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to form Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs, with enhanced FL at 710&#8197;nm and dual PA signals at 680 and 730&#8197;nm. Under hypoxic conditions, nitroreductase (NTR) further reduces these NPs, covalently labeling endogenous proteins and increasing NP size. This process partially alleviates aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, increasing the FL710 signal and decreasing the PA730 signal, enabling real&#8208;time tracking of tumor&#8208;specific delivery and hypoxia. Following low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation (2&#8197;Gy), elevated NTR expression promotes further Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs reduction, enhancing proteins labeling and causing DNA damage. Moreover, radiosensitization with A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs triggers robust immunogenic cell death, stimulating antitumor immunity that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, significantly prolonging survival in mice with orthotopic 4T1 tumors. This work underscores the potential of self&#8208;assembling, triple&#8208;targeted radiotheranostic agents for improving tumor targeting, imaging, and radiotherapy efficacy in hypoxic tumors.

Following low-dose X-ray irradiation (2&#8197;Gy), elevated NTR expression promotes further Cy-Ni-RGD NPs reduction, enhancing proteins labeling and causing DNA damage. Moreover, radiosensitization with A-Cy-Ni-RGD NPs triggers robust immunogenic cell death, stimulating antitumor immunity that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, significantly prolonging survival in mice with orthotopic 4T1 tumors. This work underscores the potential of self-assembling, triple-targeted radiotheranostic agents for improving tumor targeting, imaging, and radiotherapy efficacy in hypoxic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Polyester&#8208;Derived Alcohol into Value&#8208;Added Chemicals by Engineering Atomically Dispersed Pd Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs atomically dispersed Pd species on TiO2 catalyst for photoreforming polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;derived ethylene glycol into value&#8208;added glycolaldehyde. The Pd single atoms can greatly promote the photocatalytic performance by enriching the photogenerated holes and promoting ethylene glycol adsorption, achieving a high glycolaldehyde yield of 5072&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% and long&#8208;term durability.







Abstract
Photoreforming presents a promising strategy for upcycling waste polyester&#8208;derived alcohol into valuable chemicals. However, it remains a great challenge due to its low performance and unsatisfactory selectivity toward high&#8208;value C2 products. Here, we report the highly efficient and selective conversion of ethylene glycol (EG, a monomer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) to glycolaldehyde using atomically dispersed Pd species supported on TiO2 catalyst. A glycolaldehyde production rate of 5072&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% and long&#8208;term durability can be achieved. Experimental and theoretical results show that Pd single atoms can enhance the photocatalytic activity by enriching the photogenerated holes, which are the dominant species for the selective oxidation of EG to glycolaldehyde. More importantly, the adsorption of EG molecules on the catalysts is significantly promoted, which is subsequently transformed into RO&#8901; radicals, a crucial intermediate in producing glycolaldehyde. Additionally, Pd single atoms on TiO2 enable the reduction of the glycolaldehyde desorption barrier, thereby facilitating high selectivity and inhibiting further oxidation to C1 products. This work provides new insights into the photocatalytic conversion of polyester wastes by atomic engineering.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced Inversion and Amplification of Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) in Supramolecular Assemblies of Axially Chiral Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented control of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in two axially chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated fluorescent enantiomers is achieved through supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The naphthalene monoimide (NMI) fluorophores (R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI), each equipped with two pyridyl functionalities, show solvent&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and enhanced chiroptical properties through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Co&#8208;assemblies with chiral diacids (D&#8208; and L&#8208;tartaric acids) produce hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical structures, resulting in inversion and amplification of CD and CPL properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly and chiroptical properties of two axially chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminogens, R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI, each equipped with two pyridyl moieties for hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding with chiral diacids. The two enantiomers display aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and increased CD and CPL signals in the self&#8208;assembled state with a high glum value of 1.5 (&#177;0.06)&#215;10&#8722;2 in 1:9 dioxane:methylcyclohexane. Crystallographic analysis confirmed mirror&#8208;image helical structures for R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, leading to elongated hexagonal platelets. Supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of R&#8208;NMI with D&#8208; and L&#8208;tartaric acids (D&#8208;TA and L&#8208;TA) could remarkably modulate and invert the chiroptical properties of R&#8208;NMI, which is unachievable with control chiral monoacids. The co&#8208;assembled structures were driven by pyridine&#8208;carboxylic acid H&#8208;bonding as revealed from the crystal structure analysis, which was also supported by computational studies. Strikingly, R&#8208;NMI+D&#8208;TA leads to an exceptionally high fourfold amplification in the glum value [5.4 (&#177;0.04)&#215;10&#8722;2] with an inverted sign, which additionally demonstrates intriguing temperature&#8208;dependent switching. In contrast, R&#8208;NMI+L&#8208;TA results in a threefold reduction in the glum value [0.54 (&#177;0.015)&#215;10&#8722;3], also with an inverted sign compared to R&#8208;NMI alone, establishing a clear strategy for chiral discrimination between the two enantiomers of TA.

         <title>Selective Hydrogenolysis of Biomass&#8208;Derived Aromatic Alcohols over 2D&#8208;Mo2COx MXene by a Reversible Redox&#8208;Relay Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;Mo2COx with strong CH2&#8722;OH affinity and H2 activation ability shows a selective hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural to 5&#8208;methyl furfural at a mild reaction temperature. The catalyst shows a great catalytic stability and broad universality for various furfuryl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, and hydroxycyclopentenone substrates.







Abstract
Selective CH2&#8722;OH hydrogenolysis of biomass&#8208;derived aromatic alcohols to produce methyl aromatics is crucial for synthesizing sustainable fuels and chemicals; yet traditional metal&#8211;acid bifunctional catalysis possesses significant challenges owing to its complex reaction network. Herein, a 2D&#8208;Mo2COx MXene was fabricated, demonstrating an efficient hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural into 5&#8208;methyl furfural, achieving an impressive yield (99.5&#8201;%) at the mild reaction temperature of 90&#8201;&#176;C. Catalytic mechanism investigations reveal that 2D&#8208;Mo2COx facilitate the activation and cleavage of the CH2&#8722;OH bond through a redox mechanism, driven by the strong CH2&#8722;OH affinity of the Mo&#8211;Mo metallic plane. In the absence of H2, hydrogen from O&#8722;H group is the source for methyl formation from CH2&#8722;OH. Under a H2 atmosphere, H2 is activated to remove residual oxygen species, boosting selective hydrogenolysis while suppressing furan and CH=O hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited broad universality for synthesizing methyl aromatics from various furfuryl alcohols, benzyl alcohols, and hydroxycyclopentenones. This study presents a novel redox&#8208;relay mechanism in advanced MXene catalysis, offering a straightforward hydrogenolysis pathway for challenging substrates.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated TEMPO&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photo&#8208;Induced Hydrogen Peroxide Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitroxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF) was synthesized using a one&#8208;pot strategy for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The involvement of the TEMPO active site accelerates photogenerated charge separation. It promotes O2 adsorption in the Yeager&#8208;type two&#8208;electron O2 reduction pathway, resulting in an H2O2 yield of 10066&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a water&#8208;benzyl alcohol system.







Abstract
Molecular engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offers an alternative approach to conventional anthraquinone oxidation via photo&#8208;induced H2O2 production from O2 reduction. Despite their potential, reported photocatalysts suffer limited proton mobility, low selectivity, and insufficient charge separation and utilization. Herein, we report a nitroxyl radical (TEMPO) decorated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;COF photocatalyst via a one&#8208;pot strategy. Under visible light irradiation, highly crystalline TAPP&#8208;TPDA&#8208;TEMPO&#8208;COF (TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF) exhibits a remarkable photocatalytic H2O2 yield of 10066&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in two&#8208;phase water&#8208;benzyl alcohol (10&#8201;% BA) system through direct two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) pathway. The mechanistic study by DFT calculations and in situ DRIFT spectra suggests Yeager&#8208;type adsorption of *O2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate on the nitroxyl radical site (N&#8722;O&#8901;). The efficient photocatalytic performance and stability of TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF are attributed to the involvement of the nitroxyl radical, which enhances selective O2 adsorption, establishes a distinct electron density distribution, and facilitates photogenerated charge separation compared to TT&#8208;HT&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF counterparts. This study uncovers a new perspective for constructing metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;mediated radical&#8208;based COFs for sustainable energy conversion, storage, and biomedical applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Spillover Promotes Stable Synthesis of Vinyl Chloride on Ru Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric O/N co&#8208;doped Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst was synthesized by a sequential oxygen etching strategy to overcome the over&#8208;chlorination of Ru atoms during acetylene hydrochlorination. This single&#8208;atom Ru thus induced an unconventional oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen spillover based on the electrostatic potential difference, which resulted in enhanced kinetics to proceed the reaction via Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism with a reduced energy barrier.







Abstract
Ru single&#8208;atom catalysts hold great promise for the robust synthesis of vinyl chloride through acetylene hydrochlorination. However, the easy over&#8208;chlorination of Ru atoms during reaction suppress the catalytic activity and stability. Herein, we have synthesized an oxygen doped Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst by a sequential oxygen etching strategy, which delivers the remarkable yield of vinyl chloride monomer (&gt;99.38&#8201;%) and stability (&gt;900&#8197;h, 180&#8197;h&#8722;1), far beyond those reported Ru counterparts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the asymmetric structure of single&#8208;atom Ru promotes an unconventional oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen spillover after the activation of hydrogen chloride, which enables the reaction to proceed through Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism with a reduced energy barrier of acetylene hydrochlorination compared to the traditional Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathway. As a result, the enhanced reaction kinetics further restrict over&#8208;chlorination of single&#8208;atom Ru, thereby ensuring the excellent durability. This work offers a strategy for designing multifunctional catalysts with enhanced performances for acetylene hydrochlorination.

         <title>3D Cluster&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based COFs, utilizing multicore Cu clusters with specific stereochemical configurations as building blocks, were first synthesized through a stepwise assembly strategy. In comparison to isolated Cu4 clusters, the well&#8208;ordered porous framework structure of Cu4COFs exhibits a narrower band gap, enhanced structural integrity, and more efficient charge transfer characteristics. These features endow Cu4COFs with greatly enhanced performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Copper clusters exhibit superior catalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and their defined structures endow them with unique advantages for modeling the catalytic mechanism at the atomic level. Additionally, the construction of highly stable and regularly structured covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on copper clusters still presents significant challenges. Herein, we reported two highly stable and reactive cluster&#8208;based COFs (termed Cu4COF&#8208;1 and Cu4COF&#8208;2) constructed via a stepwise assembly strategy. The epitaxially amino&#8208;modified Cu4 cluster (Cu4&#8208;NH2) was initially synthesized based on coordination bonds. Then, Cu4COFs were obtained by the covalent linkage of Cu4&#8208;NH2 clusters and organic linkers. Compared with isolated Cu4 clusters, the Cu4COFs exhibit greater stability, a narrower band gap, a larger specific surface area, and better charge transfer ability, which endow them with superior photocatalytic CO2RR performance under visible light. In&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the covalently linked Cu4COFs could efficiently lower the energy barrier for the formation of the critical *COOH intermediate, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity. This study offers a solid basis for the atomically precise construction of novel metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based COF catalysts.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area, Ultra&#8208;thin Organic Films with Both Photochromic and Phosphorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The doped materials used the most common plastic polymers (terephthalate, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride) as hosts exhibited visible photochromic and room temperature phosphorescence phenomena simultaneously. A large&#8208;scale industrial&#8208;grade film that exhibited excellent photostability was successfully fabricated, enabling direct application.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the most commonly used polymers in plastic products. Therefore, endowing these polymers with unique optical properties would significantly enhance their overall technological value. Herein, we synthesized a phosphorescent molecule, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzofuran (DBF), with notable reversible photochromic properties (switching between colorless and deep red) as the guest and constructed a doped system with the above polymers as the hosts. All doped materials exhibited both room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and reversible photochromic properties. The guest molecule exhibited strong reversible cyclization activity and small conformational changes during the reaction process, as well as moderate rigidity of the host matrix, which enabled the uncommon coexistence of these two properties in the doped system. Finally, DBF/PET was successfully formed into a transparent and uniform film with a length of 200&#8197;m, a width of 20&#8197;cm, a thickness of only 60&#8211;70&#8197;&#956;m. This film exhibited excellent thermal&#8208;stability, sensitivity, and resistance to photo&#8208;fatigue, indicating its applicability in industrial production.

         <title>Silver Molybdate Nanoparticles for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy through Pyroptosis Conversion and Ferroptosis Induction</title>

AMO is synthesized via a rapid solvothermal method. After entering tumor cells, AMO consumes GSH and degrades H2O2 to generate ROS, while also produces MoO42&#8722; and Ag+. The intracellular GSH consumption and ROS induction lead to ferroptosis. In addition, MoO42&#8722; upregulates intracellular GSDME, and in combination with the stimuli of ROS and Ag+, the cells undergo caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Further, ferroptosis and pyroptosis synergistically enhance the immune response.







Abstract
Pyroptosis holds great potential in tumor therapy due to its strong immunogenicity. Several strategies, including ion interference therapy (IIT), are developed to induce pyroptosis. However, the mechanism by which metal oxoanions induced pyroptosis remained unclear. It was reported that MoO42&#8722; ions could stimulate immune responses, but their pyroptosis&#8208;inducing mechanisms were not fully understood. Herein, we synthesized uniform and dispersed silver molybdate (Ag2MoO4) nanoparticles (AMO) via a solvothermal method. AMO responded to H2O2 and glutathione (GSH) stimuli, releasing Ag+ and MoO42&#8722; ions, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and depleting GSH, thereby inducing ferroptosis and pyroptosis. The MoO42&#8722; also inhibited cell migration and upregulated GSDME expression, converting apoptosis into caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Additionally, DNA damage and ROS activated the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, enhancing innate immunity. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of AMO and the immune checkpoint inhibitor &#945;PD&#8208;1 significantly inhibited tumor growth. This combination promoted dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, increased effector T cell numbers, induced M1 macrophage polarization, and alleviated immunosuppression. This study contributed to a deeper understanding of metal oxoanion&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, supporting its potential application in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Gas Sensor of Mixed&#8208;dimensional Heterostructures Combining Borophene and BC2N Quantum Dots: Enhanced Detection through Binary Cooperative Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our research introduces a significant advancement in gas sensor technology by decorating two&#8208;dimensional borophene with zero&#8208;dimensional BC2N quantum dots. Integrating theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, our study demonstrates substantial enhancements in NO2 gas sensing performance, with sensors detecting concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;ppm and achieving a sensitivity of 1170&#8201;% at 30&#8197;ppm, surpassing current technologies.







Abstract
The emergence of mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures has inspired worldwide interests in recent years, opening up new avenues for potential nanotechnology applications. Herein, we proposed a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterostructure composed of borophene sheets and BC2N quantum dots. The gas sensing performance of the heterostructure was evaluated through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental methods. Specifically, first&#8208;principles calculation results show that NO2 is the most strongly interacting molecule and induces the largest amount of charge transfer between the molecule and the heterostructure, suggesting exceptional sensitivity and selectivity of the heterostructure to NO2 gas. Following the theoretical insights, a borophene&#8208;BC2N heterostructure gas sensor was developed and its gas detection abilities were assessed with exposure to various gases at room temperature. Remarkably, this sensor displayed a sensitivity of 1170&#8201;% to 30&#8197;ppm NO2 and remain a high sensitivity of 108&#8201;% even to 0.2&#8197;ppm NO2. These results highlight borophene&#8208;BC2N heterostructure as a superior NO2 gas sensor, demonstrating enhanced sensing via BC2N quantum dots and integrated theoretical&#8208;experimental approaches.

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic Cycle of Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graph illustrates the complete electrochemical ammonia oxidation catalytic cycle by a ruthenium complex, capturing most intermediates. The pathways bifurcate at [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuII(N2H4)]2+, highlighting competitive steps including dimerization, nucleophilic attack, and disproportionation.







Abstract
This study presents a mechanism of ammonia oxidation catalyzed by [RuII(NH3)][PF6]2 (Ru=Ru(tpy)(dmabpy)) complexes. All intermediates, including the elusive [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuIV(NH)]2+, were detected, with several intermediates characterized spectroscopically. The catalytic cycle follows multiple reaction pathways branching at the key intermediates [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuII(N2H4)]2+. The competition between the pathways is influenced by ammonia concentration and the local proton concentration generated during electrooxidation at the anode. In the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming steps, dimerization of [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and nucleophilic attack of [RuIV(NH)]2+ by ammonia compete, while in the subsequent [RuII(N2H4)]2+ oxidation, direct oxidation competes with proton&#8208;catalyzed disproportionation. These findings provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the catalytic cycle and offer guidance for developing more efficient ruthenium&#8208;based ammonia oxidation catalysts.

A new &#8220;atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst&#8221; system comprising single&#8208;atom MNx and local sp3 carbon defects is proposed, which marries the advantages of typical single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts while addressing their respective weaknesses, thus synergistically achieves high electrocatalytic activity and battery efficiency.







Abstract
Atomic&#8208;level designed electrocatalysts, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts, have attracted extensive interests due to their maximized atom utilization efficiency and increased activity. Herein, a new electrocatalyst system termed as &#8220;atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst&#8221;, that marries the advantages of typical single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts while addressing their respective weaknesses, was proposed. In atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst, single&#8208;atom MNx and local carbon defects formed under a specific thermodynamic condition, act synergistically to achieve high electrocatalytic activity and battery efficiency. This symbiotic&#8208;catalyst shows greater structural precision and preparation accessibility than those of dual&#8208;atom catalysts owing to its reduced complexity in chemical space. Meanwhile, it outperforms the intrinsic activities of conventional single&#8208;atom catalysts due to multi&#8208;active&#8208;sites synergistic effect. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, an atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst comprising single&#8208;atom MnN4 moieties and abundant sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon defects was constructed for low&#8208;temperature zinc&#8208;air battery, which exhibited a high peak power density of 76&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with long&#8208;term stability at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, representing a top&#8208;level performance of such batteries.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Fence Effect in Au Nanoparticle&#8208;Loaded UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Chemoselective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;fence strategy for tailoring the electrostatic interaction between metal&#8211;organic framework structure and nitroarenes substrate molecules for boosting selective hydrogenation, leading to an excellent conversion (100&#8201;%) of 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene to 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene along with high selectivity and ultra&#8208;high catalytic efficiency (3880&#8197;h&#8722;1 turnover frequency), which provides a novel method to construct efficient catalyst for selective hydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
The chemoselective reaction are vital for fine chemicals, which requires economical and environmentally friendly catalysts. In order to improve the selectivity of multi&#8208;reaction competition, herein, we propose a novel ionic&#8208;fence strategy to synthesize heterogeneous catalyst for efficient hydrogenation. Practically, UIO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) modified with pyridinium&#8208;linker has been constructed through post&#8208;synthetic chains with paired anion via quaternization and ion exchange to form ionic&#8208;fence MOF (IFMOF&#8208;Cl), which can manage the adsorption mode of nitro substrate, further confine the formation of metal nanoparticles with high dispersity. The optimal Au@IFMOF&#8208;Cl catalyst demonstrates satisfactory selectivity for hydrogenation of nitro group compared to acetylene group in 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene. Specifically, it owns a high yield of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene (~97&#8201;%) with ultra&#8208;high catalytic efficiency (3880&#8197;h&#8722;1 TOF) and long stability, far superior to other catalysts without ionic fence effect. Adsorption experiments and density functional theory studies reveal that the incorporation of ionic fence could modulate the adsorption energy of nitro group, which is responsible for the high selectivity enhancement. Notably, this ionic&#8208;fence strategy exhibits comprehensive universality towards a wide range of substrates (23 kinds in total), providing a promising avenue for precisely engineering the internal microenvironments of catalysts to achieve highly selective synthesis of fine chemicals.

         <title>Light&#8208;intersecting Photoclick Reactions for Bioorthogonal Labeling on Single Cells: Dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine&#8208;11,11&#8208;dioxide as a Photoswitchable Reporter</title>

Harnessing T&#8208;type photoswitching (&#955;1) of dibenzothiadiazepine&#8208;dioxide (DBTDD), a dual&#8208;&#955; intersecting&#8208;controlled photoclick system is established, synchronizing with photolysis of sydnone (&#955;2) to enable cycloaddition. The photoswitching of DBTDD is pivotal in enabling bioorthogonal decoration of phospholipids on live cell membranes, increasing efficacy in line with elevated 445&#8197;nm laser power density with subcellular spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
The advancement of ring&#8208;strain preloaded dipolaro&#8208;/dienophiles plays a crucial role in bioorthogonal chemistry, enabling multiple high&#8208;precision conjugations toward biomolecules simultaneously. However, durability of these ring&#8208;strain preloaded reagents in vivo is a concern, as the ring&#8208;strain is not reloadable once released during delivery process. In situ conversion of light&#8208;energy into ring&#8208;strain is a promising approach to ensure both biostability and spatiotemporal control endowed by light. Herein, we advance a seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzene photoswitch, dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine&#8208;11,11&#8208;dioxide (DBTDD), bridged by a sulphone moiety. The photoisomerization from Z&#8208;DBTDD to ring&#8208;strain&#8208;loaded E&#8208;DBTDD enables an accelerated cycloaddition with various photogenerated dipoles to establish novel photoclick reactions, featuring a dual&#8208;&#955; (405&#8197;nm+445&#8197;nm) synergistic control. In reactions with monoarylsydnones, a higher photo&#8208;stationary ratio of E&#8208;DBTDD, achieved by varying the power density of 445&#8197;nm laser, presented an ultrafast cycloaddition rate (kE=6.6&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) with a 13.8&#8208;fold acceleration compared with Z&#8208;DBTDD, which is superior to established ring&#8208;strain reporters (e.g., BCN&#8208;OH, sTCO&#8208;OH, DBTD). Then, bioorthogonal photoclick labeling of DBTDD tagged artificial phospholipid on living cell membranes was realized at subcellular resolution via an essential dual&#8208;&#955; intersecting lithography with an elevated efficiency by adjusting the 445&#8197;nm power density.

         <title>Unveiling the Intrinsic Superior SHG Performance of Ce4+ Fluoride Masked by Subtle Ce3+ Impurity and Its Effective Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high performance pure Ce4+&#8208;fluoride, Na2(Ce4+)F6, and demonstrate that the presence of subtle Ce3+ impurity significantly reduces the properties. Being aware of this fact and carefully controlling the synthetic conditions are the key to ensuring the successful synthesis of superior Ce4+&#8208;compounds.







Abstract
Owing to its unique electronic configuration [Xe]4f0, Ce4+&#8208;compound is a highly desired in the field of advanced nonlinear optical materials, yet its synthesis remains a great challange. Herein, we report a series of cerium fluorides, including a pure Ce4+&#8208;fluoride, high&#8208;performance Na2(Ce4+)F6; three mixed valance state samples, (Mix1&#8211;3, with increasing Ce3+ concentration); and a fully reduced pure Ce3+&#8208;fluoride Na1.5(Ce3+)1.5F6. In particular, Na2(Ce4+)F6, shows an SHG response (4&#215;KDP), and a wide band gap (4.77&#8197;eV), which are the strongest and widest among all Ce&#8208;containing materials to date. With systematic studies, we demonstrate that the subtle Ce3+ impurity significantly reduces performance. By being aware of this fact and consciously controlling experimental conditions, we can ensure the synthesis of pure Na2(Ce4+)F6, which exhibits excellent overall performance and shows great potential for future applications. This work not only reinforced the crucial role of Ce4+ in significantly enhancing the key performance, but also provided invaluable experimental evidence and theoretical support for the future design of more efficient and superior functional materials.

         <title>Mixing Functionality in Polymer Electrolytes: A New Horizon for Achieving High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a supramolecularly extended/cross&#8208;linked polymer electrolyte (PCPE) by introducing an elaborate MBO plasticizer in polymer matrix for ASSLMBs. This innovative PCPE system possesses unique topological cross&#8208;linking structure and Lewis&#8208;acid interaction driven MBO&#8208;salt assembly superstructure, effectively overcomes the discrepancy between accelerating Li+ migration kinetics and enhancing mechanical robustness, thus achieving excellent electrochemical performances of practical ASSLMBs.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are a key materials component for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). In these membrane&#8208;like films, accelerating Li+ migration while enhancing the mechanical strength of SPEs is challenging. Herein, we introduce a new concept of supramolecularly organized, cross&#8208;linked polymer electrolyte (PCPE) by mixing an ion&#8208;conducting, multi&#8208;arm boron&#8208;containing oligomer (MBO) solid plasticizer into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;lithium salt matrix. Studies reveal that the Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction between the Lewis&#8208;acidic boron sites of MBO and lithium&#8208;salt anions induces an amorphous MBO&#8208;salt assembly subphase with percolating nanochannels for rapid Li+ transport. Meanwhile, due to the structural compatibility of the multiple linear arms of MBO with PEO, a supramolecular polymer network is obtained which partly crystallizes around the ionic nanodomains, offering an PCPE with improved mechanical strength hosting interconnected ion transport pathways. The resulting PCPE shows simultaneously enhanced ionic conductivity, improved mechanical properties, and film interface stability, which enable a dendrite&#8208;free Li/Li symmetric cell which could be cycled over 2600&#8197;h. Excellent electrochemical performance is also demonstrated in a close&#8208;to&#8208;practical high capacity ASSLMBs.

This innovative PCPE system possesses unique topological cross-linking structure and Lewis-acid interaction driven MBO-salt assembly superstructure, effectively overcomes the discrepancy between accelerating Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration kinetics and enhancing mechanical robustness, thus achieving excellent electrochemical performances of practical ASSLMBs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are a key materials component for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). In these membrane-like films, accelerating Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration while enhancing the mechanical strength of SPEs is challenging. Herein, we introduce a new concept of supramolecularly organized, cross-linked polymer electrolyte (PCPE) by mixing an ion-conducting, multi-arm boron-containing oligomer (MBO) solid plasticizer into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)-lithium salt matrix. Studies reveal that the Lewis acid-base interaction between the Lewis-acidic boron sites of MBO and lithium-salt anions induces an amorphous MBO-salt assembly subphase with percolating nanochannels for rapid Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. Meanwhile, due to the structural compatibility of the multiple linear arms of MBO with PEO, a supramolecular polymer network is obtained which partly crystallizes around the ionic nanodomains, offering an PCPE with improved mechanical strength hosting interconnected ion transport pathways. The resulting PCPE shows simultaneously enhanced ionic conductivity, improved mechanical properties, and film interface stability, which enable a dendrite-free Li/Li symmetric cell which could be cycled over 2600&#8197;h. Excellent electrochemical performance is also demonstrated in a close-to-practical high capacity ASSLMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards Ultra&#8208;Stable Wide&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries by Using Ion&#8208;Sieving Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conducting COF&#8208;based separator (COF&#8208;Zn) was developed to enhance the performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) under challenging conditions. By integrating the COF&#8208;Zn separator with limited electrolyte, this approach achieves exceptional cycling stability across both organic and inorganic cathode&#8208;based batteries, presenting a versatile strategy for constructing ultra&#8208;stable AZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) offer notable advantages in safety and cost&#8208;efficiency, but Zn dendrite growth and unstable interfacial reactions hinder their commercial viability. A crucial factor in addressing these challenges lies in optimizing the separator to regulate ion transport and stabilize electrode interfaces. Herein, we propose a covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based separator with quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conduction, specifically a Zn2+&#8208;substituted sulfonate COF (COF&#8208;Zn) membrane, designed to tackle these issues. Featuring a high Zn transference number (0.87) and a thin 25&#8197;&#956;m profile, the COF&#8208;Zn separator allows for reduced electrolyte usage (20&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1) while effectively minimizing cathode dissolution. Its quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conductivity and electronegative properties improve Zn anode's stability by lowering water activity. This separator enables ultra&#8208;stable AZIBs, as demonstrated in various full cells including Zn//4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrenetetrone (PTO), Zn//I2 and Zn//V2O5. Remarkably, the Zn//PTO cell achieves an energy density of 260&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, 100&#8201;% capacity retention under reduced electrolyte conditions, and stable all&#8208;weather cycling from &#8722;40 to +100&#8201;&#176;C with a customized electrolyte.

         <title>Straightforward Formation of Borirenes from Boroles and Dialkynes</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of unsymmetrical perarylated aromatic borirenes through a straightforward reaction between 1,3&#8208;diynes and boroles is reported. The study encompasses substrate scope exploration, X&#8208;ray studies and computational analysis. This work represents an illustration of the use of simplified reactions for the construction of three&#8208;membered systems containing boron.







Abstract
We report a selective one&#8208;step synthesis of perarylated borirenes by reaction of antiaromatic boroles with 1,4&#8208;diarylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynes. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, reveal key intermediates, including boranorbornadiene and 7&#8208;borabicyclo[4.1.0]heptadiene species, which are all in equilibrium with each other, ultimately leading to borirene formation by migration of the boranediyl bridge from the cyclohexadiene ring to the remaining exocyclic alkyne residue.

         <title>Elucidating the Role of Electric Fields in Fe Oxidation via an Environmental Atom Probe</title>

Field&#8208;Assisted Fe Oxidation imaged by Environmental Atom Probe. The oxidation of iron (Fe) at the tip of a sharp needle under high electrostatic fields has been visualized using an Environmental Atom Probe (EAP) and corroborated through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and a mean&#8208;field model applied to a multi&#8208;faceted catalytic grain, alongside statistical&#8208;mechanical analyses. EAP observations underscore the impact of surface structures, revealing that Fe oxidation predominantly occurs on exposed facets such as Fe{244} and Fe{112}, while facets with higher coordination numbers like Fe{024}, Fe{013}, and Fe{011} exhibit comparatively lower levels of oxidation. Intense electrostatic fields exert a significant influence on Fe oxidation by polarizing and attracting gas molecules toward the surface, thereby effectively raising the local pressure via enhanced electric field concentrations at the tip&#8216;s apex.







Abstract
We quantify the effects of intensely applied electric fields on the Fe oxidation mechanism. The specimen are pristine Fe single crystals exposing a variety of surface structures identified by field ion microscopy. These crystals are simultaneously exposed to low pressures of pure oxygen gas, on the order of 10&#8722;7&#8197;mbar, while applying intense electric fields on their surface of several tens of volts per nanometer. The local composition of the different surface structures is probed directly and in real time using an Environmental Atom Probe and successfully compared with first principles&#8208;based models. We found that rough Fe{244} and Fe{112} facets are more reactive toward oxygen than compact Fe{024} and Fe{011} facets. Results demonstrate that the influence of an electric field on the oxidation kinetics depends on the timescales that are involved as the system evolves toward equilibrium. The initial oxidation kinetics show that strong increases in electric fields facilitate the formation of an oxide. However, as one approaches equilibrium, high field values mitigate this formation. Ultimately, this study elucidates how high externally applied electric fields can be used to dynamically exploit reaction dynamics at the nanoscale towards desired products in a catalytic reaction at mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Engineering Oxygen Intermediates Adsorption on Amorphous NiFe Alloys for Highly Active and Selective Electrochemical Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple doping strategy is developed to engineer reactive intermediates adsorption on amorphous NiFe alloy catalysts. Mn&#8208;doping into amorphous NiFe alloy can significantly reduce the onset potential to generate active Ni3+ species, which spontaneously react with HMF via nucleophile dehydrogenation to form FDCA.







Abstract
Electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (HMFOR) offers a promising route to transform biomass into value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) greatly limits the HMFOR selectivity. Herein, we report a facile doping strategy to engineer oxygen intermediates adsorption on amorphous NiFe alloys to boost highly selective electrochemical HMF oxidation to produce 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), among which, amorphous Mn&#8208;doped NiFeB alloy displays a low HMFOR onset potential of 1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE, achieving 100&#8201;% HMF conversion with 88&#8201;% FDCA selectivity at an applied potential of 1.4&#8197;V vs. RHE, outperforming amorphous NiFeB (73&#8201;% FDCA selectivity) and Mo&#8208;doped NiFeB (65&#8201;% FDCA selectivity) alloys. Experimental characterizations suggest that the introduction of Mn/Mo into amorphous NiFeB alloy can increase/decrease its electronic density and thus strengthen/weaken oxygen intermediates adsorption. Operando experiments indicate that the amorphous Mn&#8208;doped NiFeB alloy can significantly reduce the onset potential to form active Ni3+ species, which spontaneously react with HMF via nucleophile dehydrogenation to form FDCA. Furthermore, in situ infrared spectroscopy measurements verify that the HMF oxidation pathway follows the 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) route rather than the 2,5&#8208;diformyfuran (DFF) route.

         <title>Super&#8208;Concentrated Alkali Hydroxide Electrolytes for Rechargeable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>

Saturating water with potassium hydroxide revives the grand old alkaline batteries in a rechargeable mode. A triggered proton hopping process break the stability&#8208;conductivity tradeoff for super&#8208;concentrated electrolytes.







Abstract
Increasing the salt concentration of an electrolyte to over 10&#8197;M brings new solute&#8208;solvent interactions that define an emerging class of super&#8208;concentrated electrolytes for rechargeable batteries. To this class we introduce a super&#8208;concentrated alkaline electrolyte. Nearly saturated with KOH (at 15&#8197;M), the aqueous solution displays a broad electrochemical stability window (&gt;2.5&#8197;V on Au) while retaining an exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&gt;0.27&#8197;S/cm at 25&#8201;&#176;C). Without a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, we can confirm the role of electron transfer kinetics in determining the stability as opposed to the thermodyanmic effect computed based on activity coefficients. The compositionally simple solution also allows spectroscopies and ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulation to identify a novel mechanism of OH&#8722; structural diffusion, where unlike the conventional Grotthuss mechanism through hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, electrostatic forces sustain proton hopping and break the common stability&#8208;conductivity tradeoff. A high ZnO solubility in the electrolyte further mitigate the issue of passivation when a Zn anode is deeply discharged. These unique properties enable a NiOOH||Zn battery to deliver a cumulative capacity &gt;10&#8197;Ah/cm2 at 40&#8197;mA/cm2 to meet practical needs of safe, inexpensive energy storage.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Accelerated Discovery Coupled with Precise Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Robust and Efficient Water Purification</title>

Abstract
The development of advanced catalysts frequently employs trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods and is lack of highly controlled synthesis, resulting in unsatisfactory development efficiency and performance. Here we propose a data&#8208;driven prediction coupled with precise synthesis strategy to accelerate the development of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for efficient water purification. The data&#8208;driven approach enables the rapid screening and prediction of high&#8208;performance SACs from 43 metals&#8208;N4 structures comprising transition and main group metal elements, followed by validation and structural modulation for improved performance through a highly controllable hard&#8208;template method. Impressively, a well&#8208;designed Fe&#8208;SAC with a high loading of Fe&#8208;pyridine&#8208;N4 sites (~3.83&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and highly mesoporous structure, exhibits ultra&#8208;high decontamination performance (rate constant of 100.97&#8197;min&#8722;1 g&#8722;2), representing the best Fenton&#8208;like activities for sulfonamide antibiotics to date. Furthermore, the optimized Fe&#8208;SAC shows excellent robust environmental resistance and cyclic stability with almost 100&#8201;% degradation efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics for 100&#8208;h continuous operation. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Fe&#8208;pyridine&#8208;N4 sites can reduce the energy barrier of intermediate O* formation, the rate&#8208;determining step, resulting in highly selective generation of singlet oxygen. The integration of data&#8208;driven method with precise synthesis strategy provides a novel paradigm for the rapid development of high&#8208;performance catalysts for environmental field as well as other important fields including sustainable energy and catalysis.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Marine Diterpenoids Caucanolide E and F by Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation: Rigorous Reassignment of Two Almost Indistinguishable Diastereomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of gem&#8208;hydrogenation, which exploits the electrophilic character of the ruthenium carbene intermediates transiently formed, to natural product total synthesis allowed the stereostructure of a pair of diastereomeric seco&#8208;cembranoids that are almost indistinguishable by NMR to be rigorously assigned. Computational analysis of the data by the CP probabilistic method provided independent confirmation.







Abstract
As the spectra of the diastereomeric marine seco&#8208;cembranoids caucanolide E and F are almost identical, the isolation team had not been able to firmly assign their stereostructure. The puzzle has now been solved by a synthetic approach predicated on biogenetic considerations, which suggested that both natural products are 10S configured but differ in the configuration of their C8 stereocenter. Under this proviso, they can be distinguished by comparison with synthetic samples that are deliberately 8S,10S and 8S,10R configured: only one natural product can match sign and magnitude of the [&#945;]D of one of these reference compounds; this particular caucanolide must be the 8S,10S isomer. Both reference compounds needed for this benchmarking exercise were accessible from a single precursor via ruthenium catalyzed gem&#8208;hydrogenation of an enyne to furnish an alkoxyfuran in the first place, followed by hydrolysis; this key transformation leverages the electrophilic character of the pianostool ruthenium carbene intermediates passed through. The recorded data showed that the assignment proposed in the literature is incorrect and needs to be reversed; this conclusion was independently confirmed by a combined NMR/DFT approach using a CP3 probability analysis.

         <title>GOAT: A Global Optimization Algorithm for Molecules and Atomic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present GOAT, a new global optimization algorithm that hops over the potential energy surface until it finds the global minimum and conformational ensembles. The algorithm does not rely on molecular dynamics, which makes it useful to run even with hybrid DFT and deal with systems withs complicated electronic structures.







Abstract
In this work, we propose a new Global Optimization Algorithm (GOAT) for molecules and clusters of atoms and show how it can find the global energy minima for both systems without resorting to molecular dynamics (MD). This avoids the potential millions of time&#8208;consuming gradient calculations required by a long MD run. Because of that, it can be used with any regular quantum chemical method, even with the costlier hybrid DFT. We showcase its accuracy by running it on various systems, from organic molecules to water clusters, metal complexes, and metal nanoparticles, comparing it with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods such as the Conformer&#8208;Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST). We also discuss its underlying theory and mechanisms for succeeding in challenging cases. GOAT is, in general, more efficient and accurate than previous algorithms in finding global minima and succeeds in cases where others cannot due to the free choice for the Potential Energy Surface (PES).

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Heli(aminoborane)s with Highly Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three &#960;&#8208;extended heli(aminoborane)s (E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C) were synthesized to find a balance between fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;lum) and absorption/luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs/glum). These molecules exhibited remarkable photophysical properties, including high &#934;lum and narrowband emission (full width at half maximum, FWHM=16&#8197;nm), in which E[10]HAB&#8208;A boosted circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) up to 583&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Helical molecular carbons (HMCs) possess high absorption/luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs/glum) and significant luminescence quantum yield (&#934;lum), resulting in a high circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness (BCPL), which is essential for the development of CPL materials for practical applications. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN)&#8208;doped HMCs, named &#960;&#8208;extended heli(aminoborane)s (E[10]HAB&#8208;A, E[10]HAB&#8208;B and E[10]HAB&#8208;C), consisting of laterally &#960;&#8208;extended [10]helicene skeleton with alternating N and B atoms at the inner rim. The aromaticity, electronic structures, and photophysical properties of E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C were systematically investigated through experiments and theoretical calculations. E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C displayed remarkable photophysical properties, including high molar extinction coefficient and bright narrowband emission. The isolated enantiomers of E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C exhibited intense circular dichroism (CD) and CPL, in which E[10]HAB&#8208;A shows gabs and glum values up to 0.024 and 0.017, simultaneously with high &#934;lum of 82&#8201;% and a narrow full width at half maximum of 16&#8197;nm. Accordingly, E[10]HAB&#8208;A exhibits a BCPL as high as 583&#8197;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, which is the largest value among the reported BN&#8208;doped HMCs. Our study indicates that inner rim BN&#8208;doping and &#960;&#8208;extension are effective strategies to achieve high &#934;lum and balanced glum values in HMCs.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Enhanced Selectivity in Aerobic Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol over TiO2 Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO2) facilitates the activation of molecular oxygen (O2) through a two electron reduction process instead of a single&#8208;electron reduction. This effectively suppresses the generation of superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;), thereby reducing the unwanted &#8901;O2&#8722;&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening reaction of aromatics to significantly enhance selectivity.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol using molecular oxygen (O2) is a promising alternative to the traditional cumene process. However, the selectivity toward phenol is often poor due to the ring&#8208;opening reaction induced by the superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;), which is predominantly produced from the single&#8208;electron reduction of O2. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO2) facilitates the activation of O2 through a two&#8208;electron reduction process instead of a single&#8208;electron reduction. This effectively suppresses the generation of &#8901;O2&#8722;, thereby reducing phenol decomposition and significantly enhancing the selectivity. In addition, these OVs can trap the electrons to promote chare separation and serve as the adsorption sites for O2 activation. As a result, the introduction of abundant OVs on the surface of TiO2 not only enhances phenol yield but also importantly improves selectivity toward phenol. This finding enriches our understanding of how OVs influence reaction pathways and product selectivity, providing valuable insights for the design and tailoring of OV&#8208;rich photocatalysts for selective organic oxygenations.

Environmental atom probe tomography and multi&#8208;scale modeling reveal electric field effects in iron oxidation, as demonstrated by Sten V. Lambeets, Jean&#8208;Sabin McEwen et al. in their Research Article (e202423434). The inhomogeneous field on an iron tip (grey/black spheres) creates an uneven oxygen distribution. The field gradient, shown as an intensity grid, is strongest near the tip. Surface composition is probed upon exposure to oxygen (red spheres) by collecting emitted iron oxide cations, which are then compared to field&#8208;based oxidation calculations.

A data&#8208;driven prediction coupled with precise synthesis strategy is proposed to accelerate the development of advanced catalysts. This strategy enables rapid screening of catalytic sites, followed by precise structural modulation for optimistic activity.

Molecular crystals that belong to non&#8208;centrosymmetric space groups demonstrate piezoelectricity by interconverting electrical and mechanical energy. The cover image shows molecular crystal unit cells interlocking into a crystalline electrified assembly. As Pierre&#8208;Andr&#233; Cazade, Sarah Guerin et al. demonstrate in their Research Article (e202501232), the unit cell can be studied using computational chemistry to predict the piezoelectric response of a crystal and screen for sustainable materials in sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting.

         <title>Frontispiece: Enabling Unconventional &#8220;Alternating&#8208;Distal&#8221; N2 Reduction Pathway for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternating&#8211;distal hybrid pathway is achieved by shifting the *NHNH2&#8594;*NH2NH2 step to an *NHNH2&#8594;*NH+NH3 step with an amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst, as reported by Qingyu Yan et al. in their Research Article (e202502957). In this unconventional process, N2 activation is realized through &#960; back&#8208;donation on the Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites can regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid by&#8208;product formation, thus boosting NH3 synthesis.

         <title>Frontispiece: Chiral Communication between Enantiomeric Sergeants and Achiral Soldiers in Racemic Triblock Copolymers with Heterochiral Cores for Triggering Multiple Helicity Inversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the racemic sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S) effect that achieved precise control over both the intensity and sign of global chirality was presented by Wei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202500444). Distinct chiral communication pathways between enantiomeric sergeants and achiral soldiers in this racemic liquid crystalline S&amp;S system were found to further in situ drive multiple transitions of chiroptical properties in racemic copolymer assemblies.

         <title>Water in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in &#8220;water science&#8221; within the field of electrocatalysis, which covers the fundamental understanding of the dynamic structure and nature of water under electrochemical conditions, the specific roles of water in typical electrocatalytic reactions, and effective strategies for manipulating water to optimize the performance of electrocatalytic systems.







Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered electrocatalysis technologies occupy a central position in clean energy conversion and the pursuit of a net&#8208;zero carbon emission future. Water can serve multiple roles in electrocatalytic reactions, for instance, as a reaction medium, reactant, modifier, promoter, etc. This significantly influences the mass transport, active site, intermediate adsorption and reaction kinetics, ultimately determining the electrocatalytic performance (e.g., activity, selectivity, and stability) as well as device efficiency. As the heart location where electrocatalytic reactions occur, the typical electrical&#8208;double layer is established at a water&#8208;electrode interface. Therefore, the comprehension and regulation of water are crucial topics in electrocatalysis, which encourages us to organize this review. We begin with the fundamental understanding on structure of water and its behavior under electrochemical conditions. Subsequently, we delve into the &#8220;water effect&#8221; by elucidating specific functions of water in electrocatalysis. Recent advances in manipulating water to enhance electrocatalytic efficiency of representative reactions such as hydrogen evolution/oxidation, oxygen evolution/reduction, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction and organic electrosynthesis, are also highlighted. We finally discuss the remaining challenges and future opportunities in this field.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Circular Photogalvanic Effects in Two&#8208;dimensional Perovskite Ferroelectric&#8208;based Transistor toward Multi&#8208;state Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implement multi&#8208;state memory behavior through gate&#8208;tunable circular photogalvanic effects in the transistor device based on a two&#8208;dimensional perovskite ferroelectric, which highlights the potential of perovskite ferroelectrics for further exploration toward multi&#8208;state memory in the field of integrated devices.







Abstract
Spintronics has long been an exciting branch of condensed matter science, among which the spin splitting of energy bands in an inversion asymmetric material endows the circular photogalvanic effects (CPGE) toward high&#8208;performance spin&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;We implement multi-state memory behavior through gate-tunable circular photogalvanic effects in the transistor device based on a two-dimensional perovskite ferroelectric, which highlights the potential of perovskite ferroelectrics for further exploration toward multi-state memory in the field of integrated devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spintronics has long been an exciting branch of condensed matter science, among which the spin splitting of energy bands in an inversion asymmetric material endows the circular photogalvanic effects (CPGE) toward high-performance spin-based optoelectronic devices. Here, we have successfully achieved gate-tunable CPGE in a biaxial perovskite ferroelectric (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-HA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-HA is &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-heptanamine), involving the broken symmetry from its spontaneous polarization. Strikingly, under left- and right-circularly polarized light, this CPGE acquires a large anisotropy factor for photocurrents up to ~1.04, far beyond most organic semiconductors and chiral counterparts (&amp;lt;0.2). It is the large splitting coefficient along the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; direction (~1.476&#8197;eV &#197;) that contributes to the significant realization of CPGE in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Notably, this spin-based CPGE of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; has been modulated via the gate-voltage manipulation in its transistor-type devices, leading to multi-state memory behaviors. That is, six distinct conductance states are obtained under circularly polarized light, containing the original, high/low-state responses &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;(-1,0,1) to the left circularly polarized light, as well as three right components &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;(-1,0,1).

         <title>Cascade Lanthanide&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer for Nanocrystal&#8208;Sensitized Organic Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide nanocrystal&#8208;sensitized organic upconversion is reported, which produced various upconversion luminescence with wavelength ranging from 600&#8197;nm to 475&#8197;nm under 808&#8197;nm excitation. The crucial energy transfer step from lanthanides to organic triplet states has been extensively investigated, demonstrating the promise of nanocrystal&#8208;sensitization for upconversion applications.







Abstract
Sensitized organic photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) shows significant potential for energy conversion and photocatalysis, but achieving efficient upconversion across multiple wavelengths with single&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitation remains a daunting challenge. Here, we report a strategy utilizing lanthanide&#8208;doped nanocrystals (LnNCs) to sensitize TTA upconversion in multiple organic emitters under NIR excitation, achieving an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of up to 1.1&#8197;eV. This approach leverages a cascade lanthanide&#8208;triplet energy transfer design, adopting an interfacial energy transfer pathway via lanthanide ions to surface energy relay molecules for extended triplet sensitization. It allows consecutive transfer of photon energy from LnNCs to TTA emitters, mitigating energy mismatch between the triplet levels of emitters and excitation photon energies. The use of LnNCs enhances energy transfer efficiency through the unique spin&#8208;orbital coupling and narrow&#8208;band absorption properties of lanthanide ions. Our approach offers tunable upconversion emission, minimized energy loss during sensitization, and improved chemical stability of LnNCs. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of this system in NIR&#8208;induced photopolymerization, showcasing its potential for applications such as 3D printing and photocatalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Heteroaryl Ketones by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Carbonylation of Alkenes and N&#8208;Alkenyl Heteroarenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;heteroaryl ketones by nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarbonylation of N&#8208;alkenyl arenes and alkenes is reported. The success of this reaction relies on the sorting of two different alkenes along with the control of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aminoketones serve as important substructures in life science and precursors for the synthesis of diverse value&#8208;added targets in organic and biochemistry. However, direct access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aminoketones from simple and readily available starting materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report an unprecedented nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling protocol for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;heteroaryl ketones from alkenes and enamines in the presence of a carbon monoxide surrogate. The success of this reaction relies on the sorting of two different alkenes along with the control of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This reductive&#8208;oxidative carbonylation of enamines and unactivated alkenes featuring the use of a carbon monoxide surrogate allows for the gas&#8208;free streamlined assembly of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;heteroaryl ketones from two distinct alkenes.

         <dc:description>
A general strategy to prepare water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridyl organoboron reagents has been developed. The merger of the reagents with a neutral Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling condition enables a robust and efficient 2&#8208;pyridylation reaction of aryl halides.







Abstract
The stability of 2&#8208;pyridylation reagents is a long&#8208;standing issue in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry due to hydrolysis. However, as the use of pyridine&#8208;based pharmaceuticals continues to increase, there is a high demand for stable and reactive 2&#8208;pyridylation reagents. Herein, a general strategy to prepare water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridylboron reagents has been developed. The application of the water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridylboron reagents in a neutral Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling with a halide scavenger enables an efficient 2&#8208;pyridylation reaction of aryl halides.

         <title>Chiral Communication between Enantiomeric Sergeants and Achiral Soldiers in Racemic Triblock Copolymers with Heterochiral Cores for Triggering Multiple Helicity Inversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different chiral communication pathways were found between the chiral sergeant and achiral soldier units in racemic S&amp;S system, which further in situ driven the multiple transitions of globally chiroptical properties of the racemic copolymer assemblies.







Abstract
Amplification of asymmetry in complex supramolecular/polymer system results from the delicate interplay of chiral and achiral structures. Here, a novel approach to the racemic sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S) effect, using enantiomeric sergeants (Sgt.) and achiral soldiers (Sold.), achieves unique precise control over both intensity and sign of global chirality. Chiroptical assemblies of different dimensions in racemic S&amp;S copolymers can be constructed in situ via polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA). We systemically investigated chiral communication pathways between chiral&#8208;chiral, chiral&#8208;achiral, and two oppositely configured azobenzene (Azo) segments, which robustly affect the global chiroptical activity of the racemic S&amp;S assemblies. Chain length&#8208;, Sgt./Sold. ratios&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;dependent CD/UV/Vis, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) results provided insights into the kinetics for chiroptical inversions. LC phase transitions, the helical preferences of the Sgt. and Sold. units, and the stability of the &#8220;chiral core&#8221; allow racemic S&amp;S copolymer assemblies to exhibit chiral conflict between heterochiral blocks in an enantioselective fashion.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Initiated N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Polymerization for the Design of Stereostructural Dobby Polypeptides with Jellyfish&#8208;Type Architecture</title>

Dobby polypeptides with unique jellyfish&#8208;type stereochemical structures are synthesized via &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;initiated, 1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetramethylguanidine&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydride. Their biocompatible building blocks, efficient synthesis, well&#8208;defined structures and excellent self&#8208;assembling capacities render the jellyfish&#8208;type polypeptides as promising candidates for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Strict criteria of biomedical materials in synthesis efficiency, structure determinacy, and biological safety pose formidable challenges for the synthesis of dobby polypeptides. Herein we reported a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;initiated, 1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetramethylguanidine (TMG)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;step N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) strategy to synthesize a series of dobby polypeptides that fulfill the criteria of biomedical materials. By leveraging TMG's catalytic mechanisms in nucleophilicity enhancement for CD hydroxyl groups and active center creation for NCA monomers, this strategy achieves efficient NCA polymerization within 2&#8197;hours and high monomer conversion up to 93.5&#8201;%. Meticulous characterizations illustrate that CD&#8208;centric polypeptides present jellyfish&#8208;type stereochemical structures, in which the arm number, length, orientation and initiation sites are precisely determined. Simultaneously, CD&#8208;centric polypeptides possess excellent self&#8208;assembling capacities to guide nanostructure fabrication, exhibiting broad&#8208;spectrum small&#8208;molecule drug encapsulation. Additionally, natural CD applied in multipoint initiation of core&#8208;first NCA ROP fundamentally improves the biodegradability and biosafety of dobby polypeptides, thus facilitating their biomedical applications.

         <title>Ring Expansion via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryne Insertion into C&#8722;C Bonds of Benzocyclobutenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first insertion of arynes into non&#8208;enolizable ketones is demonstrated in this ortho&#8208;phenylene ring expansion of benzocyclobutenones using 2&#8208;haloaryl boronates as the coupling partner. In this transformation, Pd plays a dual role in both aryne formation and C&#8722;C activation.







Abstract
Insertion of arynes into cyclic C&#8722;C bonds provides a straightforward approach for ring expansion with an ortho&#8208;phenylene moiety; however, the current scope of substrates has been restricted to enolizable ketones. Here we report the first example of aryne&#8208;insertion into non&#8208;enolizable ketones through Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond activation of benzocyclobutenones. 2&#8208;Haloaryl boronates were employed as an unconventional aryne precursor. The reaction shows a wide substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. The mechanistic studies reveal an interesting dual role of the Pd catalyst for both aryne generation and C&#8722;C bond activation.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Computational Screening of Small Molecular Crystals for Sustainable Piezoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a high&#8208;throughput computational screening of organic molecular crystals for piezoelectric applications. Using DFT calculations, the study identifies key organic materials with significant piezoelectric responses and introduces CrystalDFT, a comprehensive database for scalable analysis, providing a data&#8208;driven foundation for future material discovery in organic piezoelectrics. These sustainable materials can be used for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting applications.








Abstract
Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next&#8208;generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor&#8208;made solid&#8208;state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles and techniques such as cocrystallization, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterized by methods such as X&#8208;ray diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here, we present our database of small molecular crystals and their density functional theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring (unpoled) longitudinal piezoelectric response (d11/d22/d33). This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.

         <title>Enabling Unconventional &#8220;Alternating&#8208;Distal&#8221; N2 Reduction Pathway for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 18, April 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; hybrid pathway is achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH2NH2&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH + NH3&#8221; step with an amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N2 activation is realized through &#960; back donation on Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites can regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the by&#8208;product formation for boosting NH3 synthesis.








Abstract
The general understanding on the reaction path is that the electrocatalytic&#160;N2 reduction follows either individual associative alternating or distal pathways, where efficient N2 activation and selective NH3 production are very challenging. Herein, an unconventional &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; pathway was achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH2NH2&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH&#160;+&#160;NH3&#8221; step to boost NH3 synthesis with an amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N2 activation was realized through &#960; back donation on the Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites could regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the nitrogen&#8208;containing by&#8208;product formation. Such &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; pathway was affirmed by in situ spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations. In a neutral media, an average ammonia production rate of 82.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and an outstanding Faradaic efficiency of 37.3% were attained. This work validated an unconventional mechanism in electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis, which might be extended to other catalytic process with multiple possible reaction paths.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation was realized through &#960; back donation on the Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites could regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the nitrogen-containing by-product formation. Such &#8220;alternating-distal&#8221; pathway was affirmed by in situ spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations. In a neutral media, an average ammonia production rate of 82.8&#160;&#181;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an outstanding Faradaic efficiency of 37.3% were attained. This work validated an unconventional mechanism in electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis, which might be extended to other catalytic process with multiple possible reaction paths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Built&#8208;in Electric Field of Thickness&#8208;Insensitive Small Molecule Cathode Interlayers for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is proposed as a critical design parameter for optimizing small&#8208;molecule cathode interlayer materials (SM&#8208;CIMs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). By strategically transforming imidazole&#8208;functionalized triads from a D&#8208;A&#8208;D to an A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration and replacing the A unit with a more electron&#8208;deficient moiety, we developed three triads: (TBT)2NDI, (NDI)2TBT, and (PDI)2TBT, each exhibiting progressively enhanced BEF, along with improved conductivity, work function adjustability, energy level alignment, and crystallinity. Additionally, the A&#8208;D&#8208;A triads facilitate superior electronic communication with both non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and polymer donors, enhancing photoexcitation utilization and reducing triplet state formation. Consequently, transitioning from (TBT)2NDI to (NDI)2TBT and then to (PDI)2TBT significantly boosts OSC efficiency and operational stability. Notably, devices with (PDI)2TBT and (NDI)2TBT retain 85.0% and 82.3% of their peak efficiencies, respectively, far exceeding the (TBT)2NDI&#8208;based device (65.9%) at an interlayer thickness of approximately 105 nm. Furthermore, (PDI)2TBT exhibits excellent compatibility with various active layers and an outstanding performance of 20.10% is recorded in the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9 system. This comprehensive study, encompassing molecular design, theoretical simulation, device fabrication, and fundamental device physics highlights the importance of strategic D&#8208;A electronic framework modifications to enhance BEF, thereby advancing the development of sophisticated SM&#8208;CIMs for OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective and Low&#8208;Carbon Scalable Recycling of Waste Polyethylene Terephthalate Through Bio&#8208;Based Guaiacol&#8208;Enhanced Methanolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global plastic waste crisis, particularly from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), demands sustainable recycling solutions. PET methanolysis offers a promising route to recover high&#8208;purity dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), but achieving scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly processes under mild conditions remains challenging. This study introduces a bio&#8208;based catalytic system using guaiacol and potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) under mild conditions (120&#176;C, 0.6 MPa), achieving 94% DMT and 98% ethylene glycol (EG) yields within 2 hours. Unlike conventional acid&#8208;catalyzed or co&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted methanolysis methods, the phenolic hydroxyl group of guaiacol critically stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency. The system demonstrates broad versatility across various polyesters and real&#8208;world PET waste streams, including mixed textiles and colored plastics, while enabling selective depolymerization. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) confirm its low carbon footprint, energy efficiency, and industrial viability. This cost&#8208;effective and scalable strategy offers a sustainable solution for PET recycling, addressing both environmental and economic challenges while advancing resource circularity in the plastic industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Oscillatory Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction in Pd/TiO2 under Redox Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis, with its encapsulation configuration being highly dependent on the chemical environments. However, the dynamic behavior of SMSI under redox conditions remains insufficiently understood. Here, environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) revealed that SMSI overlayers form stably on the surface of Pd/TiO2 nanocatalysts under pure O2 and pure H2 conditions, and exhibit oscillatory behavior under a redox condition with a 5:1 O2/H2 ratio at 0.05 Pa. Specifically, the outer layer of the SMSI overlayer, characterized primarily by typical oxidative SMSI, undergoes oscillations between formation and retraction near the Pd&#8208;TiO2 interface. The SMSI oscillations locally modify the morphology of the TiO2 support, with the SMSI overlayer serving as a temporary reservoir for Ti species to drive the tip&#8208;growth of the support protrusion. Our work expands the understanding of the dynamic behavior of SMSI under reaction conditions and provides new insights into the solid&#8208;state growth mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Designing Based on the Nucleation Rate of Prussian Blue Analogues for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc Ions Batteries with Glycerol&#8208;Water Hybrid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A magical heterostructures of M&#8208;PBAs (M= Co, Cu, and Zn) encapsulated by V&#8208;PBA have been successfully obtained by a facile one&#8208;pot coprecipitation method based on the difference in the binding energies of between these metal ions and ligands, and the nucleation rates of different M&#8208;PBAs. Hence, due to the multiple redox pairs, open frameworks, ordered channels, and synergistic effect of two components, the obtained VM&#8208;PBAs have been tested as cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). To further inhibiting the hydrolysis of vanadium ions and the collapse of PBAs structures, a series of glycerol&#8208;water hybrid electrolyte with different content of glycerol were designed. Benefiting from the multiple hydroxyl groups, appropriate viscosity and accurate proportion of glycerol, the as&#8208;assembled AZIBs with VMn&#8208;PBAs cathode can exhibit excellent cycling performance (~73% capacity retain of stable capacity) after 1000 cycles. This work provides a sight of preparation of PBAs nanomaterials and a strategy of improve the cycling stability and rate capacity of PBAs&#8208;based cathodes in AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Heterointerface Engineering and Non&#8208;Equilibrium Carrier Dynamics for Enhanced Photocatalysis in Halide Perovskite/MoS2 Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis holds promise for fuel production, with halide perovskites leading owing to superior light absorption and carrier diffusion. However, precise control and understanding of interfacial charge separation dynamics in their heterostructures remain challenging. Using formamidinium lead bromide/molybdenum disulfide (FAPbBr3/MoS2) as a model, we engineered Pb&#8208;rich, Pb&#8208;neutral, and Pb&#8208;deficient surfaces via precursor stoichiometry tuning, modulating interface coupling through Pb&#8208;S bonds. High&#8208;density atomic bridging in Pb&#8208;rich interfaces boosts photogenerated charge separation efficiency from 29% to 63%, yielding a 98&#8208;fold hydrogen production increase and record 8.69% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the long carrier diffusion length and high photogenerated charge density of perovskites create a steep charge density gradient at the interface. This gradient directly induces a non&#8208;equilibrium internal electric field, which governs the charge transport dynamics. This work demonstrates the feasibility of sophisticated heterointerface tailoring and advances the understanding of the driving forces behind interfacial charge separation for perovskite photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron and Oxygen Coordination on Ruthenium Clusters for Industrial&#160;Water Splitting in Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alteration in the coordination environment of metal atoms can manipulate their electronic structure and regulate the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. In this work, the coordination environment of ruthenium clusters was successfully modulated by introducing the appropriate boron (B) and oxygen (O) elements into the reduced graphene oxide host. The electrochemical tests demonstrate that this unique structure electrocatalyst presents an overpotential of 12 mV in 1 M KOH condition and for over 120 h at the current of &#8722;1 A cm&#8208;2, indicating potential practical applications.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The alteration in the coordination environment of metal atoms can manipulate their electronic structure and regulate the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. In this work, the coordination environment of ruthenium clusters was successfully modulated by introducing the appropriate boron (B) and oxygen (O) elements into the reduced graphene oxide host. The electrochemical tests demonstrate that this unique structure electrocatalyst presents an overpotential of 12 mV in 1 M KOH condition and for over 120 h at the current of &#8722;1 A cm-2, indicating potential practical applications. The alteration of the types of adsorbed water by B-O dual doping and its subsequent enhancement of ion migration efficiency was proved by in-situ infrared spectroscopy and in-situ Raman spectroscopy. The first principle calculation further proves that B-O dual doping is beneficial to reducing the desorption barrier of H* and enhancing the stability of the catalytic site. This study discloses the significance of the synergistic effect of two anions to enhance the catalytic activity of the catalyst by altering the coordination environment of ruthenium clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inverted Chiroptical Properties of Hybrid Metal Halides through Reversible Chiral Induction Driven by External and Internal Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) are commonly constructed by introducing pairs of enantiomorphic chiral precursors through a single chirality transfer pathway, which may limit the regulation of chiral structrual diversity and chiroptoelectronic properties. Herein, we propose a new strategy for achieving reversible chiral induction of OIHMHs with inverted chiroptical properties through external and internal chirality transfer pathways, by utilizing a single chiral reagent R&#8208;/S&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA). Specifically, R&#8208;MBA can externally induce chiral enrichment of M&#8208;DMA4(Bi0.486In0.511Sb0.003)Cl7 (M&#8208;DMA4(Bi&#8208;In&#8208;Sb)Cl7, DMA = dimethylammonium cation) without integrating into structure. Conversely, R&#8208;MBA can insert into structure, internally inducing the formation of DMA(R&#8208;MBA)2(Bi0.634In0.362Sb0.004)Cl6 (DMA(R&#8208;MBA)2(Bi&#8208;In&#8208;Sb)Cl6), which reverse the structural arrangements and inverts both linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. Both externally and internally induced chiral OIHMHs exhibit significant chiroptical responses with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and second harmonic generation (SHG). Moreover, the externally induced centimeter&#8208;sized rhombic single crystal enables morphology&#8208; and angle&#8208;dependent inverted circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor of ~0.02, through single crystal anisotropy. The internal induction enhances SHG intensity by 9&#8208;fold and increases PLQY to 98.9%. This multi&#8208;path chirality transfer, based on a single chiral reagent, can significantly broaden the structural scope of functional chiral OIHMH materials and facilitate the regulation of chiroptoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>A Biodegradable Radical Polymer Enables High&#8208;Performance, Physically Transient Organic Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic devices often demand high reliability and longevity, but they also contribute significantly to electronic waste. Physically transient electronics have thus emerged as a promising alternative in future electronics, particularly in wearable and implantable bioelectronics. In these applications, memristive materials have gained significant attention for their potential to realize neuromorphic systems that offer energy&#8208;efficient, hardware&#8208;based parallel processing. By integrating memristive capabilities with transient behavior, this study bridges these two cutting&#8208;edge fields, creating materials that not only enable advanced computing but also dissociate sustainably. Additionally, we leverage the unique features of soft materials for their tunability, biocompatibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, which collectively enhance this integration. In this work, we first illustrate molecular engineering strategy on a radical polymer; We then proceed to two&#8208;terminal devices therefrom, which exhibit exceptional memory performance of &gt;106 on/off ratio, &gt;104 s state retention, and stability over 250 DC sweep cycles. A flexible, optically transparent, and physically transient crossbar arrays are also developed, which maintain the performance through &gt;3,000 bending cycles and fully dissociate in water at room temperature. This work represents an advancement toward a biorealistic platform with substantial multifunctionality, making it readily translatable to future wearable and implantable neuromorphic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Lithium&#8208;Mediated Green Ammonia Synthesis with Water Electrolysis Boosted by Membrane Electrolyzer with Polyoxometalate Proton Shuttles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating water electrolysis (WE) with lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction (Li&#8208;NRR) offers a sustainable route for green ammonia production by directly utilizing protons from water oxidation, eliminating reliance on grey or blue hydrogen. Here, polyoxometalates (POMs) function as electron&#8208;coupled proton buffers (ECPBs) to seamlessly link WE with Li&#8208;NRR in a three&#8208;compartment flow reactor comprising an aqueous anode, an organic cathode, and a gas feed chamber. POMs serve as proton shuttles while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), facilitating efficient ammonia synthesis. The addition of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) enhances catholyte hydrophobicity, mitigating water contamination. By optimizing ECPB concentration, a dynamic balance is achieved between lithium nitride intermediates (LiNxHy) formation and consumption, yielding ammonia at 573.7 &#177; 5.2 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 54.2%. This design advances flow reactor technology by uniquely utilizing water oxidation as a direct proton source, bypassing conventional hydrogen oxidation methods. The use of POMs as proton shuttles establishes a new benchmark for green ammonia production, reinforcing its potential in sustainable chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Triple Synergy Engineering via Metal&#8208;free Dual&#8208;Atom Incorporation for Self&#8208;sustaining Acidic Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) for ammonia synthesis under acidic conditions offers significant advantages, like direct fertilizer production and prevention of ammonia volatilization. However, three critical challenges persist: instability of metal&#8208;based catalysts, competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and proton depletion leading to species imbalance. Here, we developed a novel metal&#8208;free heteronuclear diatomic&#8208;based catalyst that simultaneously addresses these challenges through atomic&#8208;level triple synergy engineering. Silicon&#8208;iodine dual&#8208;atom are precisely anchored on nickel oxide ultrathin nanosheets supported on carbon cloth (Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC) via a gradient&#8208;heating co&#8208;loading method. Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC establishes a self&#8208;sustaining catalytic system, achieving a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% at &#8208;0.3 V vs. RHE and record&#8208;breaking operational stability of 420&#8208;h in acidic electrolyte, surpassing the performance of all reported acid NO3RR electrocatalysts to date. Advanced in situ spectroscopic characterization combined with electrochemical evaluation reveals the triple synergy mechanism: electron&#8208;deficient Ni&#948;+ and oxygen vacancies generate abundant active sites while mitigating HER competition, iodine&#8208;mediated proton reservoir dynamically regulate H* coverage to maintain species balance, and covalent Si&#8211;O&#8211;Ni interfacial bonding inhibits metal leaching and stabilize the catalytic system. This work establishes a constructive guideline for the rational engineering of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for selective acidic NO3RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Peptide Nanofibers from A Structured Motif within Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are ubiquitous in pro&#8208;teins, orchestrating complex cellular signaling through high&#8208;er&#8208;order protein assemblies. However, the properties and functions of intrinsically disordered peptide (IDP) assemblies are largely underexplored. This work unveiled a facile strategy for engineering IDP assemblies. We demonstrate that conjugating a structured motif derived from a protein's phosphorylation site to a self&#8208;assembling tripeptide unexpectedly yields self&#8208;assembled nanofibers with intrinsic disorder. Specifically, by using glycine linker to attach a pentapeptide derived from a phosphorylation site within a random coil region of SRC kinase to the C&#8208;terminus of a widely used self&#8208;assembling enabler, we generated a phosphorylated octapeptide. The octapeptide exhibits cell compatibility and forms a hydrogel upon dephosphorylation. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy structural analysis of the nanofibers reveals that the peptides adopt two types of helical arrangements, but exhibit intrinsic disorder at the periphery of the nanofibers. The hydrogels exhibit decreased protein adsorption with increasing peptide concentration. This study represents the first instance of a structured random coil within a protein transitioning into an intrinsically disordered state within self&#8208;assembled peptide nanofibers, expanding the pool of peptide sequences for IDPs and providing valuable insights for engineering of peptide nanofibers with intrinsic disorder for the development of cell compatible biomaterials.</dc:description>

We have uncovered an unprecedented dynamic response in the diamondoid MOF SHF&#8208;62, (Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NHC(O)Me)2] (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), by using pressure as a stimulus. SHF&#8208;62 exhibits two distinct framework &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions involving changes in (1) cross&#8208;section and (2) length of its 1D pores. Our study using synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in sapphire&#8208;capillary (p&lt;0.15 GPa) and diamond&#8208;anvil (0.15&lt;p&lt;5 GPa) cells reveals that different pressure regimes trigger positive and negative correlation between these two motions, requiring an unprecedented mechanical decoupling. Specifically, the DMF&#8208;solvated framework SHF&#8208;62&#8208;DMF, in DMF as pressure&#8208;transmitting medium, undergoes initial hyperexpansion of pore cross&#8208;section (p&#8804;0.9 GPa), due to DMF ingress, followed by reversal/reduction at p&gt;0.9 GPa while pore length contracts for all pressure increases, revealing decoupling of the two framework deformations. By contrast, non&#8208;penetrating medium FC&#8208;70 imposes correlated compression (p&lt;1.4 GPa) of pore cross&#8208;section and length, resembling framework activation/desolvation motions but of greater magnitude. Similar behaviour occurs for SHF&#8208;62&#8208;CHCl3 in CHCl3 (p&lt;0.14 GPa), suggesting minimal ingress of CHCl3. These findings change our understanding of MOF dynamic responses and provide a platform for future responsive materials development.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the Hofmeister Effect for Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;regulating gel&#8211;sol&#8211;gel transition with tunable transition time and hydrogel stiffness have been realized by coupling the Hofmeister effect&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly with a simple enzymatic reaction. This new finding not only furthers the understanding of specific ion effect in control of biological functions but also offers a new opportunity for the creation of lifelike self&#8208;regulating soft materials.








Abstract
Dynamic regulation of intermolecular interactions is essential for the creation of dynamic supramolecular materials with lifelike self&#8208;regulating functions. Yet specific ion effect, which is known to possess potent effect on intermolecular interactions, has remained unexplored for such a purpose. Here, we demonstrate our access to dynamic self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular hydrogels by orchestrating the Hofmeister effect through a simple enzymatic reaction. The involved gelators containing carboxylate moieties self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel1) at acidic pH and dissolve at basic pH. We surprisingly find that the dissolved gelators at basic pH can be driven to self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel2) by kosmotropic ions through the disruption of gelator&#8211;water interactions. By coupling to the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea, Gel1 gradually disintegrates over time because of the production of basic NH3. However, interestingly, with the accumulation of kosmotropic ions, NH4+ and CO32&#8722;, the dissolved gelators are driven to self&#8208;assemble into Gel2, realizing a self&#8208;regulating gel&#8211;sol&#8211;gel transition process. The transition rate and stiffness of Gel2 are tunable by adjusting the concentrations of urea or urease. This work may shed light on the creation of lifelike self&#8208;regulating supramolecular materials using Hofmeister effect for many enticing applications such as ion&#8208;programmed biosensing and drug delivery.

         <title>Self&#8208;Photosensitizing Cobalt Complexes for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupled with CH3OH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;photosensitizing non&#8208;noble metal complexes achieve CO2 photoreduction coupled with CH3OH photooxidation, simultaneously synthesizing formic acid in the absence of any additional photosensitizers and electron sacrificial reductants.








Abstract
The use of metal complexes as homogeneous molecular catalysts has attracted considerable attention regarding photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Enhancing these complexes with photosensitivity and photooxidation capabilities, aiming to create multifunctional molecular devices, presents significant challenges. In response to these challenges, we successfully designed and synthesized three innovative metal complexes. The complexes demonstrate a remarkable ability to perform CO2 photoreduction in tandem with methanol photooxidation, allowing for the simultaneous production of formic acid without requiring additional photosensitizers and electron sacrificial reductants. An optimal turnover number (TON) value of 855 was obtained under simulated sunlight. Even under natural sunlight, the TON can reach 207, much higher than the value of the physical mixture of the photocatalytic reductive and oxidative moieties. Spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that integrating reduction and oxidation sites in one molecular catalyst can promote charge transfer kinetics and enhance activity for CO2 reduction and methanol oxidation. This is the first report that non&#8208;noble metal homogeneous catalysts can simultaneously possess photosensitivity, photoreduction, and photo&#8208;oxidation functions, offering new insights into designing homogeneous catalysts for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Regioselective Hydrocyanation of Internal Alkynes Enabled by a Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free dual&#8208;catalytic hydrocyanation of internal, electronically non&#8208;activated alkynes has been developed. The methodology merges base&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;allene isomerization and phosphine&#8208;catalyzed HCN transfer, affording high chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity in synthesis of diverse vinyl nitriles in excellent yields, demonstrating broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions.








Abstract
Since its discovery in 1954, the hydrocyanation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds has emerged as a powerful strategy for the synthesis of nitriles. However, the elusive control of selectivity and typical reliance on expensive and toxic transition metal (TM) based catalysts significantly hinder the utility of this process. Here, we report an exclusively regioselective hydrocyanation of unbiased alkynes, driven by base&#8208;catalyzed reversible alkyne&#8208;allene isomerization and phosphine&#8208;catalyzed HCN transfer to the allene. This TM&#8208;free, dual&#8208;catalytic approach introduces a novel mode of selectivity control via regioselective hydrocyanation of the allene intermediate. The methodology secures a cost&#8208;effective access to a broad range of vinyl nitriles (40 examples) with yields up to 97% and Z/E stereoselectivity up to 20:1, including complex natural product derivatives. A comparison with TM&#8208;based systems highlighted a 2500&#8208;fold cost reduction, as well as the elimination of the troublesome separation of the regioisomers. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway, shedding light on the achieved regioselectivity. By altering one catalyst in a dual&#8208;catalytic system, we demonstrated the regioselectivity switch, thereby facilitating regiodivergent hydrocyanation (eight examples). In a broader context, this approach offers a foundation for developing the next generation of TM&#8208;free strategies for the regioselective hydrofunctionalizations of unbiased alkynes.

         <title>Stable Mg2+ Dication Weakly Stabilized/Coordinated in Solution: Synthesis, Structure, Reactivity, and Use in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable Mg2+ dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating carborates was first prepared and structurally characterized as a soluble salt in organic solvents. Combined experimental and theoretical data provided valuable insights into its behavior/reactivity in solution. All data agree with a strong Lewis acidic Mg2+ center, readily coordinating alkenes and alkynes and effectively catalyzing alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation and imine hydrogenation.








Abstract
The first soluble and stable Mg2+ dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating and chemically robust carborate anions [HexCB11Cl11]&#8722; is described. Mg[HexCB11Cl11]2 (1), prepared by reaction of Mg(nBu)2 with 2 equiv of [Ph3C][HexCB11Cl11], consists, in the solid state, of a central Mg2+ surrounded by two [HexCB11Cl11]&#8722; anions. In solution, experimental and classical molecular dynamics simulations (cMD) agree with cation/anion association being retained, reflecting the high electrophilicity of the Mg center. Yet, reflecting only weak anion/cation interactions, species 1 polymerizes 1&#8208;hexene and coordinates alkynes. However, 1 displays no reaction with HSiEt3 at room temperature, consistent with a low hydridicity of the hard (HSAB) Mg2+ center. Contrasting with 1 (FIA&#160;=&#160;264&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1; FIA: Fluoride Ion Affinity), salt Mg[(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]2 (2), incorporating the more basic ammoniododecaborate [(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]&#8722; anion, is significantly less Lewis acidic (FIA&#160;=&#160;214.7&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) and unreactive with alkenes and alkynes. Salt 1 effectively catalyzes alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation via an initial alkene/alkyne coordination/initiation, as suggested by experimental and computational data. It also efficiently catalyzes (with a catalyst loading down to 0.1 mol%) the hydrosilylation of CO2 to CH4 in the presence of HSiEt3. Salt 1 smoothly promotes the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, and it is also an active imine hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of H2.

&lt;p&gt;Stable Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating carborates was first prepared and structurally characterized as a soluble salt in organic solvents. Combined experimental and theoretical data provided valuable insights into its behavior/reactivity in solution. All data agree with a strong Lewis acidic Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; center, readily coordinating alkenes and alkynes and effectively catalyzing alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation and imine hydrogenation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first soluble and stable Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating and chemically robust carborate anions [HexCB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is described.

In solution, experimental and classical molecular dynamics simulations (cMD) agree with cation/anion association being retained, reflecting the high electrophilicity of the Mg center.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Massive Production of Dimerized Imine in Aqueous Phase via an Atomically Engineered Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically engineered photocatalyst efficiently weakens the interfacial energy barrier, thus resulting in promoted charge separation for imine production coupled with H2 evolution in aqueous media. Moreover, the spatially separated redox sites suppress the severe hydrogenation side reaction of imine, achieving excellent photocatalytic activity and &gt;&#160;99% imine selectivity.








Abstract
Photocatalytic selective oxidation of organics coupled with green H2 evolution represents a promising avenue for the sustainable production of value&#8208;added chemicals, but suffers from sluggish charge separation and difficult selectivity manipulation. In particular, the Schottky barrier&#8208;induced adsorption of expected organic products at reduction sites tends to trigger the hydrogenation side reaction, which is more pronounced in the ideal aqueous environment due to distinct polarity. Here, we report a precise cocatalyst strategy on ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) photocatalyst at the atomic level to eliminate the Schottky barrier between ZIS and cocatalyst, thus achieving exceptional activity (565&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1) and selectivity (99%) for photocatalytic dimerized imine production in aqueous media, which is five times more effective than ZIS loaded with Pt nanoparticles. The excellent performance is achieved by effectively attenuating the accumulation of photogenerated holes near the Pt sites and then suppressing the unwanted hydrogenation side reaction. We further demonstrate that our system can be directly scaled up to 0.5&#160;m2 for scalable outdoor experiment and achieve solar&#8208;driven production of benzylimine with 125&#160;mL yield and 97&#160;wt% purity for two weeks under solar irradiation. This study presents an interfacial atomical design strategy for photocatalysts to efficiently produce high&#8208;value imine coupled with H2 under mild and green conditions.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Circumtetracene: Unraveling Structure&#8208;Property Relationships of Circumacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable circumtetracene derivative has been successfully synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. A comparison of its electronic properties (both experimentally and by theoretical calculations) with those of previously reported circumacene analogues, led to elucidation of a significant transition in the electronic structure from a closed&#8208;shell global aromatic to a singlet open&#8208;shell local aromatic configuration upon &#960;&#8208;extension.








Abstract
Circumacenes have garnered significant interest in both fundamental science and nanoelectronics due to their unique electronic structures. However, their synthesis and investigations into the structure&#8211;property relationships present considerable challenges. In this work, we report the successful synthesis and characterization of a stable circumtetracene derivative in crystalline form. For comparison, a new circumanthracene derivative was also prepared. The electronic properties of both compounds were systematically investigated using both various experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. It was found that circumtetracene exhibits a dominant local aromatic nature with small open&#8208;shell diradical character, while circumanthracene displays a closed&#8208;shell global aromatic character. Both compounds show amphoteric redox behavior with narrow energy gaps. The dication of circumtetracene and the dianions of circumtetracene and circumanthracene can be obtained experimentally through chemical oxidation and reduction, all displaying intense NIR absorptions. Furthermore, the electronic properties of these derivatives were compared with those of previously reported circumacene analogues, revealing a transition in electronic structure from closed&#8208;shell global aromatic to singlet open&#8208;shell local aromatic configurations upon &#960;&#8208;extension. This work provides a comprehensive exploration of the structure&#8208;property relationships within the circumacene series, offering valuable insights for the design and synthesis of novel multizigzag&#8208;edged nanographenes with tunable electronic properties.

Vertically aligned sulfur&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres achieve outstanding 2e&#8315;&#8208;ORR performance with &gt;99% H&#8322;O&#8322; selectivity, &#8722;3.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 current density, and 25&#160;mol&#160;g&#8315;&#185;&#160;h&#8315;&#185; yield. The sp2/sp3 hybrid network synergized with S&#8208;induced charge redistribution creates electron&#8208;deficient hotspots for *OOH stabilization, combining metal&#8208;like efficiency, chemical robustness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness.

Abstract
As a paradigm&#8208;shifting material platform in energy catalysis, precisely engineered ordered mesoporous carbon spheres emerge as supreme metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts, outperforming conventional carbon&#8208;based counterparts through synergistic structural and electronic innovations. Herein, we architecturally design vertically aligned cylindrical mesoporous carbon spheres with atomic&#8208;level sulfur doping (S&#8208;mC) that establish unprecedented performance benchmarks in the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) to hydrogen peroxide. Systematic comparative studies reveal that the S&#8208;mC catalysts achieve exceptional H2O2 selectivity (&gt;99%) and activity at current density of &#8722;3.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;free catalysts in current density. Impressively, the optimized S&#8208;mC electrocatalyst in a flow cell device achieves an exceptional H2O2 yield of 25&#160;mol&#160;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. The carbon matrix's unique sp2/sp3 hybrid network coupled with S&#8208;induced charge redistribution generates electron&#8208;deficient hotspots that selectively stabilize *OOH intermediates, as evidenced by in situ spectroscopic characterization and DFT calculations. This structural&#8211;electronic synergy endows the carbon framework with metal&#8208;like catalytic efficiency while maintaining inherent advantages of chemical robustness and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The marriage of S&#8208;doping engineering with mesoscopic pore architecture control opens a new way for developing efficient carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen selective reduction to H2O2.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uniformly dispersed Cu single atoms on the In2O3 enable efficient photothermal CO2 conversion through modulating the synergy with induced oxygen vacancies. The catalyst exhibits an optimal reactivity (1108&#160;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 CO with selectivity &gt;99%) at a moderate Cu loading (2.4&#160;wt%). 








Abstract
Photothermal catalysis under mild conditions represents a promising and sustainable approach for CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals, thereby enabling efficient carbon recycling. However, precise manipulation of active sites and their coordination environments at the atomic level to enhance catalyst performance still remains a challenge. Here, we present a single&#8208;atom doping strategy for oxygen vacancy engineering to facilitate efficient CO2 conversion. Specifically, an In2O3&#8208;based catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies induced by homogeneously dispersed Cu single atoms is constructed, exhibiting a competent CO2 reduction performance in photothermal reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction. The optimal Cu&#8208;In2O3 catalyst achieves a CO yield rate of 46.17&#160;mol&#160;gCu&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with near&#8208;unity selectivity (&gt;99%) and demonstrates stability over 450 h under 3&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 full&#8208;spectrum light illumination. Comprehensive spectroscopic characterization and computational simulations elucidate that the Cu single atoms synergistically interact with oxygen vacancies to promote H2 dissociation and CO2 activation under photoexcitation. This work provides insights into the design of photothermal catalysts, emphasizing the transformative potential of atomic&#8208;site engineering for efficient CO2 conversion and sustainable energy technologies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh&#8208;affinity aqueous molecular recognition pairs are pivotal for biotechnology and chemical applications, yet their rational design remains a significant challenge. This minireview explores recent advances in synthetic receptors with binding affinities exceeding the nanomolar range and highlights their transformative potential in biomedical applications. By bridging supramolecular chemistry and biomedical materials, it inspires the development of next&#8208;generation molecular recognition systems to address real&#8208;world biomedical challenges. 








Abstract
Aqueous&#8208;phase molecular recognition pairs with ultrahigh binding affinity hold immense value in biotechnology and chemical applications. However, the rational design of synthetic pairs with such exceptional binding strength has long remained a significant challenge, with notable progress achieved only in recent years. In this minireview, we begin by defining the term &#8220;ultrahigh&#8208;affinity&#8221; through a comprehensive analysis of available data on aqueous&#8208;phase molecular recognition by water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic hosts. Based on this foundation, we provide a detailed overview of the latest advancements in various classes of ultrahigh&#8208;affinity receptors, extracting key design principles that drive their remarkable performance. We further highlight emerging applications of ultrahigh&#8208;affinity molecular pairs in biomedical materials, spanning bioorthogonal chemistry, biosensing, bioimaging, drug delivery, and toxin sequestration. These examples underscore the transformative potential of ultrahigh&#8208;affinity recognition in addressing real&#8208;world biomedical challenges. Finally, we offer a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the future of this rapidly evolving field, exploring potential directions for designing more diverse and functional ultrahigh&#8208;affinity molecular recognition tools. By bridging the gap between fundamental science and practical applications, this minireview aims to inspire the development of next&#8208;generation molecular recognition systems and foster deeper integration between supramolecular chemistry and biomedical materials, paving the way for innovative solutions to pressing biomedical needs.

         <title>Staggered ABC&#8208;Stacking Cobalt&#8208;Triptycene Framework for Accelerating CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;triptycene framework with a staggered ABC&#8208;stacking arrangement was synthesized in the aqueous phase with a 90% yield. The framework exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance, achieving a CO production rate of 4.43&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and MD simulations provided insights into its low activation energy and enhanced reaction rates, while principal component analysis (PCA) analysis identified key factors influencing catalytic performance in CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly efficient photocatalysts due to their highly tunable structures and favorable electronic properties. However, achieving control over framework stacking arrangements, such as the staggered ABC&#8208;stacking, presents significant challenges. This difficulty arises from the inherently unfavorable energetics of the ABC arrangement and weaker &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions compared to other stacking modes. Herein, a cobalt&#8208;triptycene framework with a staggered ABC&#8208;stacking arrangement was successfully synthesized in the aqueous phase, achieving a 90% yield. Experimental evaluations revealed that this framework achieved a CO production rate of 4.43&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, which is comparable to the most reported MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that the ABC&#8208;stacking cobalt&#8208;triptycene framework exhibits lower activation energy (0.079&#160;eV) for water molecules, reduced Gibbs free energies for key intermediates *COOH (0.76&#160;eV) and *H (0.73&#160;eV), and the highest reaction rate increment (7.488 times). Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) reveals a strong correlation between the CO production rate and factors such as the Ik value, optical bandgap, and &#916;G*H, revising the previous held notion that &#916;G*COOH is the primary determinant of catalytic performance. These results offer valuable insights into the design principles of advanced photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Pore Engineering in Isoreticular Titanium&#8208;Isophthalate Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we designed titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination polymers with functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. We conducted extensive investigations to explore how pore engineering influences adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings address the synthesis challenge of isostructural Ti&#8208;coordination polymers and offer insights into structure&#8211;property relationships through modulation of their chemical environments.








Abstract
Pore engineering through chemical environment modification is vital for developing industrial porous materials. Understanding the effects of substitutions in isoreticular porous coordination polymers&#8212;such as steric hindrance, vibrational capabilities, electronic influences, and hydropathy&#8212;is key to elucidating structure&#8211;property relationships. However, accurately assessing the impact of functional groups on properties remains challenging due to limitations in current methodologies. In this study, we designed a series of titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination&#8208;polymers with various functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. The unique spatial arrangement and electronic distribution of isophthalate and its functional groups provide an ideal platform to address these challenges. We conducted extensive investigations combining experimental methods with computational simulations to explore how pore engineering affects adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings not only tackle the synthesis challenge of isostructural titanium&#8208;coordination polymers but also offer new insights into understanding structure&#8211;property relationships achieved through modulation of their chemical environments.

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfacial Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Mediated Mass Transfer Toward Industrial Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated catalytic process that bridges the inherent gap at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, thereby overcoming the barrier for the migration of reactant ions to catalytic sites. We implemented the aforementioned concept by a library of oxyanions functionalized NiCo OOH and formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated water electrolysis.








Abstract
The rapid migration of reactive ions across the electrolyte&#8211;catalytic sites interface is crucial in various catalytic processes. Herein, we introduce hydrogen bonds to bridge the intrinsic gap at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, mediating the diffusion of hydroxide ions. We implemented the aforementioned concept by a library of oxyanions functionalized NiCo OOH, wherein the oxygen atom within the oxyanions established hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules in the electrolyte. Operando spectroscopy indicated that both water electrolysis activity and hydroxide concentration exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped dependence on the electrostatic potential of functionalized group, which formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated catalysis. The sulfate&#8208;modified NiCo OOH achieved an ultralow energy consumption of 4.23&#160;kWh m&#8722;3 H2 in the industrial electrolyzers, predicting that the electricity consumption can be reduced by 16&#160;000&#160;TWh.

Operando spectroscopy indicated that both water electrolysis activity and hydroxide concentration exhibited a volcano-shaped dependence on the electrostatic potential of functionalized group, which formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond-mediated catalysis. The sulfate-modified NiCo OOH achieved an ultralow energy consumption of 4.23&#160;kWh m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H2&lt;/sub&gt; in the industrial electrolyzers, predicting that the electricity consumption can be reduced by 16&#160;000&#160;TWh.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Structured Composite Solid Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Rate All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell structured composite SE is designed and synthesized, which exhibits high oxidative stability, superior ionic conductivity and enhanced mechanical strength. By using this SE as both the catholyte and SE layer, a mechanically robust and homogeneous battery design was created, which could mitigate the chemomechanical contact loss. As a result, rapid ion transport is achieved across the multi&#8208;scale interfaces, enabling superior rate performance that surpasses the best&#8208;reported ASSSBs.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) have emerged as the promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage; however, they still face challenges related to ionic transport across multi&#8208;scale interfaces, which leads to suboptimal battery performances. In this study, we propose a core&#8208;shell structured composite electrolyte with Na3PS4 sulfide solid electrolyte (SE) as the core and Na2.25Y0.25Zr0.75Cl6 halide SE as the shell. This design strategy boosts high SE's oxidative stability (4.0&#160;V), ionic conductivity (0.44 mS cm&#8722;1) and mechanical strength (Young's modulus of 9.19&#160;GPa). These properties enable the composite SE to effectively mitigate the chemo&#8208;mechanically&#8208;induced multi&#8208;interfacial contact losses at the cathode side. Additionally, the homogeneous full&#8208;cell configuration, utilizing the core&#8208;shell structured composite electrolyte as both catholyte and SE layer, demonstrates superior rate capability, achieving a discharge capacity of 76.4 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 2.0 C, significantly outperforming the conventional sandwich&#8208;like designs. This work not only provides a novel design strategy for functional SE but also offers valuable insights into the chemo&#8208;mechanical failure mechanism at multiscale interfaces of ASSSBs.

         <title>An Autonomously Liquefied Hydrogel Adhesive for Programmable Bioelectronic Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present transient hydrogel adhesives driven by antagonistic enzyme reaction networks for programmable bioelectronic interface, which collects high&#8208;quality electrophysiological signals on hairy skins without hair removal. The autonomous liquefication of hydrogel adhesives allows easy removal of bioelectrode from hairy skins after usage without any damages to hairy skins and electrode.








Abstract
Hydrogel adhesives have many important applications in the fields of drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and bioelectronics. The detachment of hydrogel adhesives under the benign conditions is vital to the definitive surgical repair and implanted devices. Although stimuli&#8208;mediated detachment of hydrogel adhesives has been achieved, it is still a grand challenge to develop a transient adhesive with programmable adhesion and autonomous detachment from the substrate, especially the hairy skins. Here, we report a transient hydrogel adhesive driven by antagonistic enzyme reaction networks for programmable bioelectronic interface. The transient hydrogel shows tunable mechanical properties, adjustable adhesive strength, and autonomous sol&#8208;gel&#8208;sol transition with a programmable lifetime. Moreover, the transient hydrogel adhesive enables conformable and stable adhesion to various materials. In particular, the bioelectrode coated by the transient hydrogel adhesive allows to record stable and high&#8208;quality electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and electroencephalogram signals directly on the hairy skins without hair shaving. Notably, the autonomous liquefication of the hydrogel adhesives enables the easy removal of bioelectrode from hairy skins after usage without any noticeable damages to the hairy skins and electrode. This work paves a new avenue in the innovative development of hydrogel adhesives for the conformable and detachable bioelectronic interface.

         <title>Adaptive Defluoroamination of Aryl Fluorides: Harnessing the Catalytic Potential of a Unique Zinc Amide Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed an effective and adaptable catalytic protocol for the radical&#8208;mediated defluoroamination of fluoroarenes, utilizing a redox&#8208;active amide ligand&#8208;supported zinc(II) compound. Intriguingly, this accommodative protocol offers several advantages, e.g., the mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope (covering most types of fluoroarenes and diverse N&#8208;nucleophiles) with excellent functional group tolerance, selective C&#9472;F bond functionalization, and access to tertiary aryl amines in one&#8208;pot manner starting from the primary amine itself via double C&#9472;N bond formations.








Abstract
The activation and functionalization of C&#9472;F bonds, the strongest bonds between carbon and any other element, via C&#9472;N bond formation to generate complex molecules has remained a compelling challenge. Herein, we present a ligand&#8208;centered redox&#8208;controlled effective strategy employing a zinc amide catalyst (C) to achieve facile defluoroamination of fluoroarenes with several N&#8208;nucleophiles (&gt;90 substrates) under mild conditions. Notably, this adaptable protocol works readily with most types of fluoroarenes and a diverse range of N&#9472;H moieties that include secondary and primary amines, indoles, azoles, and&#160;amides under the same reaction conditions and encouragingly offers excellent functional group compatibility. Intriguingly, we also demonstrated its application in one&#8208;pot synthesis of (un)symmetrical triaryl amines from primary amine itself and the selective activation of C&#9472;F bonds to access F&#8208;containing amines, relevant to drug synthesis. Finally, detailed mechanistic probes via active&#8208;intermediate&#8208;capture, EPR analysis, and various control experiments indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical&#8208;mediated C&#9472;N coupling pathway. Importantly, use of Zn(II) center as a template to hold the two amide moieties together in C enables facile intramolecular electron transfer to generate the radical intermediates for the present protocol. Finally, the practical utility of this methodology was&#160;showcased by synthesizing various drug derivatives.

         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;ethynylation of oxindoles is realized by virtue of spiropyrrolidine amide (SPA)&#8208;triazolium organocation catalysis. Taking advantage of this methodology and development of 1,6&#8208;aza&#8208;Michael additions with and without an aminolysis process, the collective total synthesis of two types of indole alkaloids was also accomplished.








Abstract
The all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center of oxindoles is a crucial structural element of a broad spectrum of indole alkaloids, imparting these molecules with rigid three&#8208;dimensional configurations essential for their biological activities. Here, we present a catalytic asymmetric &#945;&#8208;ethynylation reaction of oxindoles taking advantage of the catalysis of a spiropyrrolidine amide (SPA) triazolium. This transformation enables the enantioselective construction of the C3 quaternary carbon stereocenter of oxindoles while introducing a versatile ethynyl functionality. Employment of this methodology has been demonstrated in the divergent total synthesis of indole alkaloids (&#8208;)&#8208;corynoxine, (&#8208;)&#8208;isorhynchophylline, (&#8208;)&#8208;aspidospermidine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;limaspermidine, featuring a protecting group&#8208;dependent 1,6&#8208;Michael addition or an aminolysis/1,6&#8208;Michael addition sequence to generate two distinct types of spiro&#8208;indoles, tailored for different late&#8208;stage synthetic purposes.

         <title>Leaching&#8208;Induced Ti Trapping Stabilizes Amorphous IrOx for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir/TiN evolves into Ti&#8208;trapped IrOx, owing to the TiN leaching&#8208;induced Ti trapping effect under long&#8208;term oxygen evolution conditions, which helps to stabilize the Ir(III) and lattice oxygen sites on the amorphous IrOx while realizing self&#8208;thickening of the ultrathin catalyst layer in the realistic device, benefiting low&#8208;Ir based water electrolysis.








Abstract
Transition metal nitrides are promising conductive support materials in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas it is unclear if their electrochemical oxidation during prolonged test would affect the OER catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that the leaching&#8208;induced Ti trapping effect from TiN supports effectively stabilizes the electrochemically oxidized amorphous IrOx catalyst. Structural characterizations reveal that the TiN support experiences severe leaching during OER test, leaving minor amounts of Ti&#8211;O species trapping on IrOx clusters, which mitigate the overoxidation of Ir(III) species and elongate the Ir&#8211;O bonds. This leads to 70% reduction of lattice oxygen oxidation and the substantially reduced Ir leaching. Additionally, self&#8208;thickening of the catalyst layers is found during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), enabling an ultralow catalyst loading of 87 &#181;gIr cm&#8722;2 to obtain a stable operation at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 for 500&#160;h. This work deepens the understanding of TiN&#8208;supported catalysts for long&#8208;term stable OER electrocatalysis.

         <title>Structural Insight Into a Human H Ferritin@Gold&#8208;Monocarbene Adduct: Aurophilicity Revealed in a Biological Context</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human H ferritin (HuHf) is a nanocarrier for anticancer metal drugs. By cryo&#8208;EM, a 1.51&#160;&#197; structure of its adduct with Au(NHC)Cl was solved, showing a novel tetranuclear gold(I) cluster bound to Cys90 and Cys102. Short inter&#8208;metal distances indicate aurophilic interactions. This study highlights the power of cryo&#8208;EM in examining metal&#8208;drug&#8211;protein interactions using the strong signal of transition metal ions.








Abstract
Human H ferritin (HuHf) has excellent potential as a nanocarrier for the selective delivery of anticancer metal&#8208;based drugs to tumor cells. Here, we addressed the interaction of the gold monocarbene compound Au(NHC)Cl with HuHf by electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS)&#160;measurements, which provide the metalation state of the protein subunits and demonstrate the involvement of protein cysteines in gold binding. The adduct between Au(NHC)Cl and HuHf was studied by cryo&#8208;EM measurements, resulting in a high&#8208;resolution 3D density map at 1.51&#160;&#197;. The cryo&#8208;EM structure shows a novel tetranuclear gold(I) cluster, located in a surface pocket of each subunit where it is bound to Cys90 and Cys102. The short inter&#8208;metal distances are diagnostic of the occurrence of aurophilic interactions. The present work demonstrates the usefulness of cryo&#8208;EM to investigate the interactions between metal&#8208;based drugs and their protein targets/carriers, also leveraging the strong signal of transition metal ions.

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722; Revisited: The Surprisingly Stable Uncoordinated Pentaphospholide Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intriguing cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722; anion, which is isolobal to the well&#8208;known cyclopentadienide anion, was characterized for the first time crystallographically in the salts [M([2.2.2]cryptand)][cyclo&#8208;P5] (M&#160;=&#160;Na, K). The compounds were further characterized by UV/Vis spectroscopy in solution and in the solid state by Raman and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy.








Abstract
The addition of [2.2.2]cryptand to alkali metal heptaphosphides M3P7 (M&#160;=&#160;Na, K) leads to the formation of [M([2.2.2]cryptand)][cyclo&#8208;P5] salts. Although the cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722; anion is spectroscopically known since the 1980s, it was so far prepared and handled only in solution. By complexing the alkali metal cation with [2.2.2]cryptand, the product was found to be surprisingly stable in the solid state. Cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722;, which is isolobal to the well&#8208;known cyclopentadienide anion, was now characterized crystallographically for the first time in its uncoordinated form and in the presence of the weakly coordinating cations [M(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Na, K). The structural elucidation proves its planar D5&#160;h symmetry, not only as ligand in different sandwich complexes but also in its uncoordinated form. Cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722; was further characterized by UV/Visis spectroscopy in solution and in the solid state by Raman and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy. The reaction of [Na([2.2.2]cryptand)][cyclo&#8208;P5] with LiCp* and FeCl2 yields the ferrocene derivative [Cp*Fe(cyclo&#8208;P5)].

         <title>p&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen in Two&#8208;dimensional Amorphous RuOx for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient Ru&#8208;based catalysts is crucial in reducing reliance on costly Ir for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, these Ru&#8208;based catalysts face a fundamental stability challenge due to the highly reactive nature of lattice oxygen. In this work, we propose an effective strategy to stabilize lattice oxygen in two&#8208;dimensional amorphous RuOx through p&#8208;p orbital hybridization by incorporating dopants such as Al, Ga, and In. Notably, Ga doping exhibits remarkable acidic OER performance, leads to a 137 mV reduction in overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and a 125&#8208;fold improvement in stability compared to undoped RuOx. This also surpasses the performances of most reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. In contrast, doping with other elements from the same period, such as Mn, Co, or Cu, shows negligible improvements in catalytic performance. In&#8208;situ electrochemical spectroscopic analysis, couples with theoretical calculations, reveals that the p&#8208;p orbital hybridization in the Ga&#8208;O coordination within Ga&#8208;RuOx effectively reduces the reactivity of lattice oxygen, suppresses the overoxidation of Ru, and switches the reaction pathway from the lattice oxygen mechanism to the adsorbate evolution mechanism. This novel p&#8208;p orbital hybridization strategy holds great potential for the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts for OER and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Waste Plastic Hydrogenolysis on Ru/CeO2 through Concurrent Incorporation of Fe Single Atoms and FeOx Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ru&#8208;based catalysts have exhibited significant promise in converting waste plastics into valuable long&#8208;carbon chain products. However, their efficiency is hindered by the uncontrollable cascade hydrogenation, which stems from their exceptional reactivity for C&#8208;C cleavage. Herein, we reported a multi&#8208;scale regulation strategy by selectively anchoring Fe single atoms (SAs) and FeOx nanoclusters (NCs) by Ru NCs&#8208;decorated CeO2 substrates. This catalyst demonstrates an extraordinary performance, achieving nearly 100% low density polyethylene (LDPE) conversion under the conditions of 250 &#176;C and 2 MPa hydrogen after 1 hour, along with remarkably&#8208;improved liquid product selectivity of 86.4% compared to that of bare Ru/CeO2 (59.8%). Through a variety of spectroscopic studies, we revealed the unique interactions between FeOx NCs and Ru NCs, which leads to an increased Ru0 content. More significantly, we also confirmed the crucial role of Fe SAs in adsorbing active hydrogen species, thereby increasing the hydrogen coverage. Such precise regulations towards both the intrinsic surface state of Ru and its adjacent chemical environment successfully inhibited the cascade hydrogenation, ultimately resulting in a significant enhancement in the selectivity of liquid products.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Reductive Arylation and Alkenylation of Sulfinylamines to Access Sulfinamides Enabled by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed&#160; enantioselective reductive arylation and alkenylation of sulfinylamines, facilitating the efficient synthesis of enantiopure sulfinamides. By employing a cobalt/chiral diphosphine and tridentate ligand system, a range of diverse aryl and alkenyl iodides were successfully transformed into sulfinamides, achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivity. This methodology underscores the utility of sulfinylamines as versatile electrophilic sulfur sources. Detailed mechanistic insights from density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the key step involves migratory insertion into the sulfilimine group, which plays a crucial role in enantioselectivity. These findings offer a sustainable approach for the development of biologically relative enantiopure sulfur&#8208;containing compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Current Density of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction using Metal&#8208;Enzyme Hybrid Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of promising solutions to global warming, electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to liquid fuel has attracted great attention. A primary challenges in industrializing CO2RR technologies for producing liquid fuel is the mass transfer limitation of CO2, which significantly reduces the current density of CO2RR. This study proposes a new enzyme&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis platform for boosting CO2RR current density. This platform integrates an enzyme of bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA), stabilized on carbon nanotubes (bCA@CNT), into formate/formic acid selective metal catalysts such as tin (Sn) and bismuth (Bi) to prepare Metal&#8208;bCA (M&#8208;bCA) hybrid cathodes. The incorporation of bCA&#160;enhances both the CO2&#160;hydration and the reversible&#160;dehydration of bicarbonate to CO2 in the cathode. This dynamic catalysis of bCA facilitates rapid local regeneration of dissolved CO2 from bicarbonate at the catalyst surface, thereby boosting the current density of CO2RR. Consequently, the formate current density of the Sn&#8208;bCA cathode was 3.3 times higher than that of the bare Sn cathode in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA)&#8208;type cell. Furthermore, the Bi&#8208;bCA&#160; cathode achieved an excellent&#160;current density of&#160;442 mA/cm2,&#160;1.5 times higher&#160;than&#160;the bare Bi cathode,&#160;for direct production of highly concentrated (3.4 mol/L) formic acid&#160;in a 3&#8208;compartment cell.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8211;alkane &#963;&#8208;complexes are key intermediates in C&#8208;H activation and, until now, analysis of these species has been restricted to either the solution OR the solid state. Here we present a synthetic methodology that converts Mn2(CO)10 in a non&#8208;coordinating solvent environment to [Mn(CO)5]+ at room temperature, and this species binds n&#8208;pentane as the strongest interacting ligand available. Three isomers of the n&#8208;pentane &#963;&#8209;complexes were studied in detail by solution NMR&#8208;spectroscopy at low temperature. Two isomers of [Mn(CO)5(n&#8208;pentane)]+ crystallize from solution at room temperature and their structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The oxidation of metal complex dimers in solution to ge&#173;ne&#173;rate reactive metal cations, which bind alkanes as the stron&#173;gest available ligand, is a new and probably general approach to generate metal&#8208;alkane &#963;&#8209;complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrative  Lattice and Surface Engineering of Nanoscale Fe0 for Superior Dechlorination of Trichloroethene in Groundwater: Coordination in Reactivity, Selectivity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nFe0) materials hold great promise in environmental remediation, yet achieving high reactivity, selectivity, and stability in reduction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we address this challenge by innovatively employing Ni lattice and FeS surface engineering to fabricate novel nFe0&#8208;based nanomaterials (dubbed as FeNix@FeSy), featuring FeNi as the core and FeS as the shell. The FeNi5@FeS10 delivered approximately 242.7&#8208; and 81.2&#8208;times higher reactivity and selectivity, respectively, over unmodified nFe0 for the remediation of trichloroethene (a notorious environmental pollutant), while maintaining high stability in groundwater remediation. We found that the core composition (i.e., Ni/Fe ratio) of FeNix@FeSyprimarily determined reactivity, governed by a tradeoff between the galvanic effect and lattice strain, while shell properties mainly controlled selectivity, despite some interactions between them. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the FeS surface served as a favorable adsorption site for TCE, and the low energy barriers (TS2, 0.19 eV) of FeNi5@FeS10 facilitated the cleavage of the first chlorine from TCE. Moreover, the core&#8208;shell structure promoted electron transfer from the core to the shell and TCE. This integrative lattice and surface engineering strategy provides a new avenue for designing advanced functional materials for environmental remediation and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Interfacial Chemistry and Ion&#8208;Solvent Interactions to Enable Reversible Magnesium Metal Anode in Chloride&#8208;Free Mg(TFSI)2 Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2) electrolyte, the 1&#8208;propylimidazole (PrIm) can not only restructure the solvation sheath of Mg2+, but also act as a dynamic protective shield to repel TFSI&#8722; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) away from the Mg surface, supporting reversible Mg plating/stripping.








Abstract
Passivation of magnesium (Mg) anode in the chloride&#8208;free magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2) electrolyte is a key challenge for Mg metal batteries. Tailoring solvation structure and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been considered an effective strategy. Herein, a series of imidazole co&#8208;solvents with different branched&#8208;chain structures (methyl, ethyl, and propyl) are introduced into the Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;ether electrolyte to address the passivation issue. The ion&#8208;solvent interaction, interfacial adsorption effect, and SEI formation are comprehensively studied by theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations. Through molecular structure analysis, the long&#8208;chain 1&#8208;propylimidazole (PrIm) exhibits a strong coordination ability to Mg2+ and a favorable parallel adsorption configuration on the Mg surface. As a result, PrIm co&#8208;solvent can not only restructure the solvation sheath of Mg2+, but also act as a dynamic protective shield to repel a part of TFSI&#8722; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) away from the Mg surface. Benefiting from the synergistic regulation effect of interfacial chemistry and ion&#8208;solvent interactions, the chloride&#8208;free Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;DME&#160;+&#160;PrIm electrolyte ensures minimal interface passivation and achieves highly reversible Mg plating/stripping. This work provides a guiding strategy for solvation structure regulation and interface engineering for rechargeable Mg metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Passivation of magnesium (Mg) anode in the chloride-free magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electrolyte is a key challenge for Mg metal batteries.

Herein, a series of imidazole co-solvents with different branched-chain structures (methyl, ethyl, and propyl) are introduced into the Mg(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ether electrolyte to address the passivation issue. The ion-solvent interaction, interfacial adsorption effect, and SEI formation are comprehensively studied by theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations. Through molecular structure analysis, the long-chain 1-propylimidazole (PrIm) exhibits a strong coordination ability to Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and a favorable parallel adsorption configuration on the Mg surface.

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of a Ground&#8208;State Electron Donor Through Water Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents catalytically generated phosphine oxide radical anions, derived from commercial phosphines and water as potent single&#8208;electron reductants capable of reducing electron&#8208;rich aryl chlorides at&#160;potentials as low as &#8722;3.3&#160;V (vs. SCE). Cyclic voltammetry studies and DFT calculations offer insights into these P&#8208;based ground&#8208;state electron donors, broadening the scope of phosphoranyl radical chemistry. This work highlights the potential of in situ generated reductants, achieving redox potentials comparable to elemental potassium.








Abstract
Electron donors that can be excited to higher energy states through light absorption can achieve oxidation potentials as low as &#8722;3.0&#160;V (vs. SCE). However, ground&#8208;state organic electron transfer reagents operating at such potentials remain underdeveloped, often necessitating multi&#8208;step syntheses and elevated reaction temperatures for activation. The longer lifetime of ground&#8208;state reagents is an advantage compared to most photoexcited single&#8208;electron reductants, which typically have relatively short lifetimes. In this study, catalytically generated phosphine oxide radical anions derived from phosphines and water applying redox catalysis are introduced as highly efficient single&#8208;electron reductants. The in situ generated radical anions are capable of reducing electron&#8208;rich aryl chlorides at potentials as low as &#8722;3.3&#160;V (vs. SCE). Cyclic voltammetry studies and DFT calculations provide valuable insights into the behavior of these phosphorus&#8208;based ground&#8208;state electron donors. These findings do not only expand the chemistry of phosphoranyl radicals but also unlock the potential of in situ generated organic ground state electron donors that reach potentials comparable to elemental potassium.

         <title>Probing the Catalytic Degradation of Unsaturated Polyolefin Materials via Fe&#8208;Based Lewis Acids&#8208;Initiated Carbonyl&#8211;Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic degradation of unsaturated polyolefins using iron&#8208;based Lewis acids in solution was systematically studied. This carbonyl&#8211;olefin cross&#8208;metathesis strategy was proved to be highly effective in cleaving polymers containing carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds into short segments, even basic molecules for other compounds, e.g., pharmaceutical synthesis, confirming its universal applicability.








Abstract
Degradation and recyclability of polymeric materials, including extensively used polyolefins, are becoming increasingly necessary. Chemically stable saturated polyolefin backbones make their degradation frustratingly challenging. The current effective strategy is to create cleavable defects, e.g., C&#9552;C double bonds along the backbone, and subsequently depolymerize them via cross&#8208;metathesis reaction with olefins. High&#8208;value chemicals or reusable polymeric segments are obtained. This two&#8208;step protocol provides operable means for alleviating plastics problems. There are several approaches to introduce unsaturation into a polymer backbone, like dehydrogenation or copolymerization of olefins and conjugated dienes. However, for the second step, to conduct a cross&#8208;metathesis reaction, only noble metal catalysts can be used most of the time. Regardless of their limited availability, the fact that these organometallics are unfavorably sensitive to impurities would raise barriers in industrial practices. Herein we employed earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive iron&#8208;based Lewis acids to initiate carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis reactions between ketone/aldehyde reagents and unsaturated polyolefins. After explorations in poly(diene)s and industrial thermoplastic elastomers, we extended this protocol to degrade low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). Low&#8208;molecular weight PE wax&#8208;like products were obtained as useful chemicals. This catalytic degradation system is expected to enable the development of more efficient metathesis strategies to promote degradation of polyolefins and pave sustainable ways for reuse of polymeric materials.

         <title>Fullerene Network&#8208;Buffered Platinum Nanoparticles Toward Efficient and Stable Electrochemical Ammonia Oxidation Reaction for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using covalently bonded two&#8208;dimensional fullerene (C60) polymeric network (PNW&#8208;C60) as unique support of Pt nanoparticles (NPs), we succeed in modulating the binding strengths of the key intermediates in the AOR process owing to the electron transfer between PNW&#8208;C60 and Pt NPs, which can enhance the recombination of NxHy species, avoiding the poisoning of adsorbed nitrogen&#8208;containing species. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Pt NPs/PNW&#8208;C60 exhibits a high mass activity of 118&#160;A gPt&#8722;1 for the AOR as well as remarkable long&#8208;term durability, which is much superior to the commercial Pt/C and graphene&#8208;supported Pt NPs.








Abstract
Green ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier due to its well&#8208;established production, storage, and transportation infrastructure. Moreover, hydrogen production via electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) requires a significantly lower theoretical potential than water electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor stability of AOR hinder the industrial application of ammonia electrolysis. Herein, we report the construction of two&#8208;dimensional covalently bonded fullerene polymeric network (PNW&#8208;C60) supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) as a highly active and stable AOR electrocatalyst. The unique electron buffering effect of PNW&#8208;C60 enhances the desorption of nitrogen&#8208;containing species and prevents their poisoning on the Pt NPs surface. Consequently, the as&#8208;obtained PNW&#8208;C60&#8208;buffered Pt NPs exhibits a high mass activity of 118&#160;A gPt&#8722;1 as well as good stability, outperforming commercial Pt/C and graphene&#8208;supported Pt NPs AOR catalysts.

         <title>Day&#8208;Long Organic Persistent Luminescence in Flexible Polymeric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A day&#8208;long organic afterglow (28&#160;+&#160;h) is achieved via electron donor/acceptor exciplexes, where polyethylene naphthalate serves dual roles as acceptor/charge&#8208;storage unit and spirobifluorene&#8208;carbazole acts as donor, enabling efficient UV/sunlight&#8208;triggered charge separation.








Abstract
The progress in organic afterglow materials has drawn significant attention due to their extensive applications in fields such as optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bioimaging. Nonetheless, a general limitation of organic afterglow materials is their short emission lifetimes, typically spanning from milliseconds to seconds, which creates a substantial challenge in developing day&#8208;long organic afterglow (DOA). In this study, a DOA system is demonstrated through the incorporation of electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. Polyethylene naphthalate is used for both the electron acceptor and charge storage units, coupling with a spirobifluorene&#8208;carbazole derivative as the electron donor, providing effective charge separations under UV&#8208;light and sunlight excitation. The resulting DOA polymers demonstrate an exceptional bluish&#8208;green afterglow that endures for over 28&#160;h under ambient conditions, setting a new record for the longest afterglow duration in polymeric materials. Moreover, the DOA&#8208;doped polymers, as both films and fibers, exhibit outstanding flexibility and transparency, making them highly suitable for flexible technologies and wearable devices.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogenation of CO2 Using Cationic Cu Atomically Dispersed on 2D &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring cationic Cu atomically dispersed on &#947;&#8208;Al&#8322;O&#8323; nanosheets has been developed, demonstrating exceptional thermal stability and catalytic activity for CO&#8322; hydrogenation. Compared to traditional Cu/ZnO/Al&#8322;O&#8323; systems, this catalyst achieves higher methanol (CH3OH) and dimethyl ether (DME) production rates, driven by the unique substitution of Cu for pentacoordinated Al sites. This innovative design enhances H&#8322; activation and methanol synthesis, offering new insights into single&#8208;atom catalysis for sustainable CO&#8322; utilization.








Abstract
The continuous development of novel catalytic approaches is crucial for advancing efficient CO2 hydrogenation processes. Drawing inspiration from single&#8208;atom catalysis and 2D materials, we designed a new 2D single&#8208;atom catalyst with excellent thermal stability by thermally treating Cu&#8208;adsorbed &#947;&#8208;AlOOH nanosheets, which yielded a Cu/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst with high activity in the hydrogenation of CO2&#8208;yielding methanol (CH3OH), dimethyl ether (DME), and CO as products. The active Cu sites are monodispersed and highly stable due to their cationic oxidation state and their substitution for pentacoordinated aluminum (AlP) sites on particle surfaces. This study demonstrates an efficient approach for achieving a high CO2 hydrogenation rate (30.45&#160;mol mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) using a catalyst system that lacks metallic Cu centers, traditionally considered essential for H&#8322; dissociation, and employs what was previously thought to be an inert metal oxide (&#947;&#8208;Al2O3) for CO and CH3OH production. Ongoing mechanistic studies aim to elucidate the synergy between cationic Cu single atoms and &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, a Lewis acid support, in facilitating hydrogen (H2) activation and methanol formation.

Compared to traditional Cu/ZnO/Al&#8322;O&#8323; systems, this catalyst achieves higher methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) and dimethyl ether (DME) production rates, driven by the unique substitution of Cu for pentacoordinated Al sites. This innovative design enhances H&#8322; activation and methanol synthesis, offering new insights into single-atom catalysis for sustainable CO&#8322; utilization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuous development of novel catalytic approaches is crucial for advancing efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation processes. Drawing inspiration from single-atom catalysis and 2D materials, we designed a new 2D single-atom catalyst with excellent thermal stability by thermally treating Cu-adsorbed &#947;-AlOOH nanosheets, which yielded a Cu/&#947;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with high activity in the hydrogenation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-yielding methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH), dimethyl ether (DME), and CO as products. The active Cu sites are monodispersed and highly stable due to their cationic oxidation state and their substitution for pentacoordinated aluminum (Al&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;) sites on particle surfaces. This study demonstrates an efficient approach for achieving a high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation rate (30.45&#160;mol mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) using a catalyst system that lacks metallic Cu centers, traditionally considered essential for H&#8322; dissociation, and employs what was previously thought to be an inert metal oxide (&#947;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) for CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH production. Ongoing mechanistic studies aim to elucidate the synergy between cationic Cu single atoms and &#947;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a Lewis acid support, in facilitating hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) activation and methanol formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Nonadjacent Stereocenters Through Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Hydroheteroarylation of Cyclopentenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iridium catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective C&#9472;H addition of diverse heterocycles including furan, benzofuran, thiophene, and indole to cyclic alkenes. This process occurs diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectively, delivering enantioenriched cyclopentane structures containing 1,3&#8208;tertiary&#8211;tertiary and 1,3&#8208;quaternary&#8211;tertiary stereocenters.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8211;catalyzed direct addition of (hetero)aryl C&#9472;H bond to an alkene provides an expedited route to construct benzylic stereocenter from readily available arene and alkene feedstocks with complete atom&#8208;economy. However, creation of more than one stereocenter through enantioselective C&#9472;H (hetero)arylation remains a challenging goal. Here we report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydroheteroarylation of cyclopentenes to construct 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. A series of heteroaryl C&#9472;H bonds were cleaved site&#8208;selectively and added regio&#8208; and enantioselectively to an unactivated alkene containing an amide coordinating group, delivering valuable enantioenriched cyclopentane scaffolds containing 1,3&#8208;tertiary&#8211;tertiary or 1,3&#8208;quaternary&#8211;tertiary stereocenters with exclusive diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity.

         <title>Asymmetric Electrochemical Alkenylation by Synergistic Chiral Primary Amine and Naphthalene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic dual chiral primary amine and naphthalene catalysis was identified through enamine&#8208;redox mediator mapping (e&#8208;RM2) to enable effective electrochemical singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO)&#8208;type coupling with alkenyl trifluoroborate. Mechanistic studies reveal ion&#8208;pair interactions between the protonated aminocatalyst and anionic substrate, leading to exceptional enantioselectivity.








Abstract
External tuning of enamine intermediate has significantly expanded reaction space of typical aminocatalysis. Notwithstanding the progress of chemo&#8208; and photo&#8208;oxidation of enamine intermediate, electro&#8208;oxidation was left as a much less explored area, in stark contrast to the prosperous renaissance of electrochemistry in recent years. Challenges mainly come from the reactivity barrier as a consequence of heterogeneous electron transfer and subtle stereocontrol in ionic electrolyte solution under the influence of electric field. Herein, we report asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of carbonyl compounds using potassium alkenyl trifluoroborate as a model reaction to demonstrate the capability of primary amine catalysis under electrochemical conditions. By employing enamine redox mediator mapping (e&#8208;RM2) strategy, a new organic mediator, dimethoxyl naphthalene, was found to greatly enhance reactivity. Mechanistic studies uncover an ion&#8208;pair interaction between protonated aminocatalyst and anionic substrate that accounts for the exceptional enantioselectivity. This catalytic system demonstrates the best level of enantioselectivities in electro&#8208;oxidative enamine transformations so far.

         <title>Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Copper(I) Alkynyl Nanoclusters with Exposed Polyoxomolybdate Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic active sites located on the periphery of the Mo&#8211;Cu heterometallic nanoclusters significantly contributed to their exceptional photocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction reaction, demonstrating an impressive selectivity of nearly 100% toward CO.








Abstract
The directed synthesis of copper(I) nanoclusters with atomically precise active sites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses notable challenges. By carefully regulating the acidity of the reaction system, a set of five atomically precise Mo&#8211;Cu heterometallic nanoclusters were effectively synthesized. The adjustment of the reaction system's acidity stimulates the polymerization of molybdate, consequently influencing the encapsulation structure of the outer copper(I) shell and thereby controlling the number of catalytically active sites located at the periphery of these nanoclusters. When subjected to xenon lamp irradiation, the synthesized Mo&#8211;Cu nanoclusters, which showcase exposed polyoxomolybdates, exhibit significantly activity in the conversion of CO2 to CO (up to 160.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) while maintaining an impressive selectivity of up to 99.9% without any additional sacrificial agent, cocatalyst or photosensitizer. When sacrificial agent and photosensitizer were added to the CO2RR system, the maximum CO production rates for Mo16Cu36&#8208;1 and Mo22Cu30 were 5672.1&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and 7370.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, with CO selectivities of 90.3% and 90.6%. The Mo&#9472;O&#9472;Cu active sites play a dual role in enhancing both CO2 adsorption and activation, as well as facilitating charge separation. This study not only elucidates the synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity Mo&#8211;Cu nanoclusters with potent photocatalytic activity in CO2RR but also contributes to advancing our comprehension of the structure&#8208;property relationship inherent in nanocluster photocatalysts.

         <title>Reactive Cysteines in Proteins are the Dominant Reductants for Platinum(IV) Prodrug Activation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8208;Luc was developed as a pioneering bioluminescent reporter for real&#8208;time monitoring of Pt(IV) reduction in live cells. Using this advanced reporter, we identified that reactive cysteines in proteins, rather than those in small molecules, predominantly mediate the reduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs. Furthermore, the thiol&#8208;mediated reduction of Pt(IV) complexes was corroborated in vivo.








Abstract
The intracellular reduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs is crucial for their anticancer efficacy. However, the major components responsible for the reduction of Pt(IV) complexes within live cells remain elusive. Herein, we developed an aminoluciferin&#8208;functionalized Pt(IV) complex, Pt&#8208;Luc, that can be used as a bioluminescent reporter for real&#8208;time monitoring of Pt(IV) reduction in live cancer cells by capturing immediate bioluminescent signals from the released aminoluciferin. Utilizing this powerful reporter, we found that the reduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs in live cancer cells significantly slows down when cysteine levels are reduced, while the levels of glutathione do not impact the reduction rate. Further investigation reveals that reactive cysteines in proteins, rather than small&#8208;molecule thiols, play a primary role in reducing the Pt(IV) complex. In vivo studies reveal a substantial 63% decrease in bioluminescence from Pt&#8208;Luc in thiol&#8208;blocking tumors in mice, reinforcing the pivotal role of reactive cysteines in Pt(IV) reduction. This study provides valuable insights into the activation mechanisms of Pt(IV) prodrugs in live cells and in vivo, enhancing our understanding of prodrug activation beyond buffer systems or fixed cells.

         <title>Structural Basis of Sequential Enantioselective Epoxidation by a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenase in Lasalocid A Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lsd18 is a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase from Streptomyces lasalocidi that performs two enantioselective epoxidations during lasalocid A biosynthesis. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of Lsd18 bound to a substrate and product analogue illuminate how this enzyme performs multiple epoxidations on the same substrate molecule and how it controls stereoselectivity.








Abstract
Polyether polyketides are a structurally diverse group of natural products known for their antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. Lasalocid A is a canonical natural polyether produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces lasalocidi. In lasalocid A biosynthesis, a polyene polyketide intermediate is converted into a bisepoxide by the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase enzyme Lsd18. Remarkably, Lsd18 acts on two distinct C&#9552;C groups in the substrate molecule, forming two (R,R) epoxides. We have determined the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of Lsd18 in the substrate&#8208;free, substrate&#8208;bound, and product&#8208;bound forms. Our work has revealed that Lsd18 has an extra&#8208;large substrate&#8208;binding pocket that allows the polyene to adopt different conformations within the enzyme pocket. This feature enables Lsd18 to epoxidate both of the C&#9552;C groups. Additionally, a subpocket located near the Lsd18 active site controls stereoselectivity by dictating which face of the C&#9552;C group is placed next to the flavin. Molecular understanding of how Lsd18 transforms a polyene into a bisepoxide during lasalocid A biosynthesis lays the foundation for the production of designer polyethers for drug development.

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Multi&#8208;Interface Chemistry by Functional Carbon Dots for High&#8208;Performance Composite Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of synergistic multi&#8208;interfacial regulation is proposed to construct high&#8208;performance composite solid electrolytes, and N,S,F&#8208;codoped carbon dots play the key role in regulating multi&#8208;interfacial structures, including the conversion of surface residual alkali of LLZTO into ionic conductor interlayer and the formation of bridging interlayer between PEO and LLZTO.








Abstract
Low ionic conductivity, poor mechanical strength, and unstable interface structure are still the main factors hindering the practical application of polymer solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). In this work, we have developed a unique composite filler (LLZTOCDs) for solid polymer electrolytes to address these challenges through synergistic regulation of multi&#8208;interface chemistry. The LLZTOCDs is prepared via thermal treatment of N,S,F&#8208;codoped carbon dots (NSFCDs) and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) inorganic electrolyte. Here, the detrimental Li2CO3 on the LLZTO surface is converted into a fast ion&#8208;conducting and an electron&#8208;insulating interlayer of LiF and Li3N, and the carbon dots self&#8208;assemble into a functional organophilic coating on the outermost layer, which acts as a bridge between the LLZTO and the polymer. This unique structure enhances the compatibility and ion&#8208;exchange kinetics between the LLZTOCDs and the polymer, significantly improving the mechanical strength and Li+ transport. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies formed in situ at the LLZTOCDs interface provide an anion confinement effect, increasing lithium salt dissociation, and enhancing the Li+ transference number to 0.85. Therefore, the solid battery constructed with LLZTOCDs exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, long&#8208;cycle life, and high ionic conductivity (1.96&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), providing a feasible strategy for practical applications.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Enable Improved Performance and Stability of Dion&#8208;Jacobson Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The undesired phase distribution and intrinsic residual lattice strain remain the bottleneck for high&#8208;performance and stable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) or Q&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for the Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) type Q&#8208;2D PSCs. Here, we showcase employing halogen bonds to stabilize the halide anions and fine&#8208;tuning the residual lattice strain by introducing perfluorodecyl iodide (PFI). It reduces the density of iodide species defects and releases the residual tensile strain, leading to more homogenous phase distribution, suppressed carrier recombination, promoted charge transport, enhanced efficiency and stability. Therefore, DJ PSCs maintain over 81% of initial efficiency after thermal&#8208;light aging (i.e., under 85&#8201;&#176;C and 1 sun illumination) for 952 h, and remain over 91% of initial efficiency after under reverse bias (&#8208;2.5 V, under ISOS&#8208;V aging tests) for over 21 h, representing one of the most bias&#8208;stable Q&#8208;2D PSCs reported so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Umpolung Difluoroalkylation of Imines Enables General Access to &#946;&#8208;Difluoroalkylated Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed umpolung difluoroalkylation of Imines has been developed. By inverting the polarity of imines, this approach enables the coupling of various readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides. The rapid fluorine replacement of bioactive molecules by the efficient synthesis of difluorinated analogs of key amine moieties present in these molecules, including amphetamine, using the current approach, demonstrates the promising potential of this protocol in advancing drug discovery and development.








Abstract
Fluoroalkylated amines play a pivotal role in medicinal chemistry, yet the general and efficient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;difluoroalkylated amines remains elusive. Here, we developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed umpolung strategy that enables the difluoroalkylation of 2&#8208;azaallyl anions generated from aliphatic and aromatic imines, effectively overcoming the previous limitations. By inverting the polarity of imines, this strategy allows for the coupling of a variety of readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides. This approach is characterized by its high efficiency, broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and ease of synthesis. The rapid modification of bioactive molecules by the efficient synthesis of difluorinated analogs of key amine moieties present in bioactive molecules, including amphetamine, using the current approach shows the promising potential of this protocol in advancing drug discovery and development.

         <title>Identification, Characterization, and Catalytic Mechanism of Regioselective UbiA Prenyltransferases in Morus Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MaPT21, MaPT24, MaPT25, MaPT27, MaPT29, and MaPT30 enzymes catalyze regioselective prenylation and geranylation at the C5, C7, C2&#8242;, and C4&#8242; sites of moracin M. Rational mutation guided by molecular docking and dynamics simulation altered the site preference of MaPT27 from C7 to C5.








Abstract
UbiA prenyltransferases (PTs) play an indispensable role in the prenylation of plant metabolites, yielding numerous natural products with enhanced pharmacological activities, such as cannabinoids, polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols, prenylated flavonoids, and stilbenoids. These enzymes typically target specific carbon atoms or hydroxy groups of aromatic substrates. Despite the recent identification of dozens of plant&#8208;derived UbiA PTs, their catalytic mechanism remains poorly understood, particularly regarding the precise control of regioselectivity. In this study, we identified and characterized a total of 10 members that catalyzed the regioselective prenylation and geranylation of moracin substrates through comprehensive analysis of the UbiA superfamily in Morus alba. Molecular dockings, dynamics simulations, and quantum chemical calculations revealed the substrate&#8208;induced conformational changes leading to the formation of the hydrophobic reaction pocket, as well as the differential binding between various MaPTs and moracin M. Additionally, the recognition of prenyl donors by MaPT27 and the potential mechanism underlying the reversal of regioselectivity induced by different donors are discussed. Finally, structure&#8208;based rational mutation altered the site preference from C7 to C5. These findings suggest that the regioselectivity of plant UbiA PTs is governed by both the inherent chemoselectivity of reaction sites and intricate protein&#8211;substrate interactions.

         <title>Photogenerated Holes Induced Deep Sodium Storage of TiO2/CdSe/NFPP Cathode for High&#8208;Efficiency Photorechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;functional TiO2/CdSe/NFPP cathode was designed for photorechargeable sodium batteries. Photogenerated holes from CdSe migrate to NFPP, facilitating efficient sodium deintercalation. The holes&#8208;absorbed film&#8208;forming agent FEC on NFPP causes a thin NaF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase, which effectively suppresses electron tunneling and electrolyte decomposition. The PRSBs deliver high capacity and conversion efficiency (4.34%).








Abstract
Resource&#8208;friendly photorechargeable sodium batteries (PRSBs) integrate energy storage devices with solar cells, offering a promising path for sustainable energy. Herein, a novel TiO2/CdSe/Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7 (NFPP) cathode was prepared layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer utilizing resource&#8208;abundant commercialized NFPP and photoactive CdSe. The aligned energy levels with type II band structure ensure effective transfer of photogenerated holes from CdSe (&#8722;5.71&#160;eV) to higher valence band of NFPP (&#8722;5.10&#160;eV). Experimental results reveal that, during charging, the induced holes in NFPP accelerate the transition of Fe2+ to Fe3+ with a change of O&#8211;Fe hybrid orbitals. The calculations of bond valence sum and energy distribution reveal that NFPP&#8208;holes possesses broad Na+ transport path with reduced transport barrier (from 0.512 to 0.428&#160;eV), improving Na+ extraction efficiency. Additionally, photogenerated holes could regulate surface charge distribution on NFPP and thus form a film&#8208;forming agent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)&#8208;dominated electric double layer. Finally, it converts to a thinner (9.75&#160;nm illumination) NaF&#8208;rich cathode interphase layer, avoiding subsequent excessive electrolyte decomposition. As a result, the NFPP under illumination delivers high capacity of 119.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, showing 41.11% improvement compared to dark conditions.

         <title>Hierarchically Self&#8208;Assembled Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Gels for Guest Segregation and Electrical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of gels formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;aniono&#8221; helicates were developed that can be utilized as filling material in columns and showed the ability to selectively encapsulate and release choline. The host&#8208;guest properties could also be monitored in real time by electrical characterization. This study introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation.








Abstract
The search for macroscopic materials with differentially addressable spaces based on molecular containers has long been driven by their great potential for diverse practical applications pertaining guest selective capture and release. Herein, we report a class of gels (G1&#8208;NH2, G1&#8208;UPy, G2&#8208;NH2, and G2&#8208;UPy) that are formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of anion&#8208;coordinated architectures. The well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of the cavities within anion&#8208;coordinated architectures endow the gels with different internal phases, which is beneficial to differentiate the release profiles of guest molecules (dimethylethanolamine, choline, and propyl trimethylammonium) depending on their binding affinity. This study also introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation. The process of guest binding could be also monitored in real time via electrical characterization. This work may thus provide a useful strategy for selective solid&#8208;phase molecular separation.

         <title>Porous Aromatic Frameworks Filler with Anion&#8208;Constrained Centers in Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designed cationic imidazolium&#8208;based units to prepare PAF&#8208;142 containing anion&#8208;constrained centers and fast diffusion channels for Li+, thus facilitating the dissociation of Li+ and its rapid transport. The composite polymer electrolyte PAF&#8208;142&#8208;CPE, exhibited high Li+ conductivity and remarkable suppression of lithium dendrite formation, achieving excellent long cycle stability.








Abstract
The widespread use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) based on solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is hindered by their low Li+ conductivity and safety risks posed by the growth of lithium dendrites. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we designed a cationic porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;142) and introduced it as a filler into SPEs to obtain a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;CPE. The cationic imidazolium sites could effectively constrain the movement of anions through electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the design of the imidazolium&#8208;based building units allowed the cationic sites to be located within the framework, which promoted the transport of Li+. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which PAF&#8208;142 promoted the dissociation of lithium salts and enhanced Li+ transport. Benefiting from these advantages, the Li+ conductivity of quasi&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (QCPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE reached 8.77&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C. Additionally, a stable interface with abundant inorganic components was formed between PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE and the lithium electrode, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites, thereby achieving stable long cycle of the Li//PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE//Li cell for more than 8500&#160;h. The Li//PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE//LFP cell demonstrated excellent cycle life exceeding 1400 cycles. This study proposes a promising SPEs performance&#8208;enhancing solution, advancing cutting&#8208;edge lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 9.7&#160;&#181;m ultra&#8208;thin solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;network polymer electrolyte with a decent voltage tolerance, improved tensile strength, and higher thermal stability was manufactured for safer sodium&#8208;metal batteries, in which the ether&#8208;oxygen segments were complexed with sodium ions, and the electronegative channels formed by the carbonyl and cyanogen groups acted as sodium ion transport channels to accelerate ion migration.








Abstract
Identifying ultrathin and flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance is crucial for scale&#8208;up production of solid&#8208;state sodium (Na) metal batteries (SSMBs). However, the challenges of poor processing scalability, insufficient intrinsic mechanical strength, and limited ionic transport capacity remain unaddressed. Herein, an ultrathin 9.7&#160;&#181;m solid&#8208;state electrolyte membrane featuring a dual&#8208;polymer entangled network is meticulously engineered through an arrayed multi&#8208;nozzle electrospinning technique with a swelling and hot pressing process using polyacrylonitrile and poly(ether&#8208;block&#8208;amide), which exhibits an exceptional voltage tolerance, enhanced tensile strength, and superior thermal stability. The soft ether oxygens segments in multiblock copolymers complex with Na+ to promote the rapid hopping transport of Na+. Meanwhile, interconnected electronegative channels based on carbonyl and cyanogen groups serve as Na+ conduits to smooth ion fluctuations and accelerate Na+ selective conduction simultaneously. The obtained inorganic&#8208;organic composite solid electrolyte interface with the improved mechanical strength of ultrathin solid&#8208;state electrolytes effectively suppresses Na dendrites with low overpotential over 500&#160;h. The solid&#8208;state cells paired with layered oxides deliver a capacity retention of over 91.1% between 25&#160;&#176;C and 65&#160;&#176;C, and assembled pouch cells exhibit impressive energy density over 100 cycles, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale application of ultrathin structure in the SSMBs.

         <title>An A&#8208;T Hoogsteen Base Pair in a Naked DNA Hairpin Motif: A Protein&#8208;Recognized Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In duplex DNA, base pairs are Watson&#8208;Crick, with Hoogsteen pairing only dominating upon protein binding or DNA damage. Using NMR, we find an A&#8208;T Hoogsteen base pair in transposon DNA hairpins even without TnpA protein. The Hoogsteen conformation is specific to DNA, and its propensity depends on the length and sequence of apical loop residues. Hoogsteen base pairs may shape genomic structures during replication and transcription.








Abstract
In duplex DNA, A&#8208;T and G&#8208;C form Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs, and Hoogsteen pairing only dominates upon protein binding or DNA damage. Using NMR, we show that an A&#8208;T Hoogsteen base pair previously observed in crystal structures of transposon DNA hairpins bound to TnpA protein forms in solution even in the absence of TnpA. This Hoogsteen base pair, located adjacent to a dinucleotide apical loop, exists in dynamic equilibrium with a minor Watson&#8208;Crick conformation (population &#8764;11% and lifetime &#8764;55 &#181;s). Extending the apical loop to three residues inverted the equilibrium, making Watson&#8208;Crick the dominant state and the Hoogsteen conformation recognized by TnpA a minor state (population &#8764;14% and lifetime &#8764;28 &#181;s). The propensity for Hoogsteen pairing depended on apical loop residues, which form contacts directly or indirectly stabilizing the Hoogsteen conformation. A structure survey did not reveal Hoogsteen pairing near RNA apical loops making them unique to DNA. Our results demonstrate that Hoogsteen can be the dominant state even in naked unmodified duplex DNA and identify 5&#8242;&#8208;CTT(T/C)AG&#8208;3&#8242; as a DNA&#8208;specific apical loop motif stabilized by Hoogsteen pairing. Hoogsteen base pairs may be prevalent in DNA hairpins forming during replication and transcription, with broad implications for the genomic landscape.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Cation Effects in Electrolytes for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cations play a pivotal role in controlling electrocatalytic reaction pathways, selectivity, and kinetics. A deeper mechanistic understanding of cation effects offers opportunities to overcome the activity&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off in electrocatalytic reactions, enabling the rational design of more efficient electrolyte systems.








Abstract
Traditional understanding of electrocatalytic reactions has primarily focused on the covalent interactions between adsorbates and catalyst surfaces, often overlooking the significant influence of the electrolyte on the catalytic process. Recently, researchers have highlighted the pivotal role of cations in the electrolyte, demonstrating their capability to modulate the reaction pathways and thus the activity and selectivity. These findings underscore the need for a deeper, atomic&#8208;level understanding of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. This perspective presents the mechanisms through which cations affect electrocatalysis, with a focus on the hydrogen&#8208;bond network, the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, the electric field within the electrochemical double layer, and the local electronic properties of catalysts. It provides a summary of the influences of cations on various electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). At the end, future research directions are provided to maximize the potential of leveraging the cation effects in the design of more efficient electrolyte systems.

         <title>Intramolecular Thiol&#8208;Promoted Decomposition of Cysteine Ester (ITPDC): A General Platform for Controllable Release of Reactive Sulfur Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive sulfur species (RSS) are important endogenous molecules relevant to human health, but general approaches for the controllable release of distinct RSS are still lacking. In this work, we report a well&#8208;defined and safety donation platform for developing triggered RSS donors with sulfur oxidation states ranging from &#8722;2 to +4. This work should extend the applicable chemical space for RSS delivery and research.








Abstract
Endogenously generated reactive sulfur species (RSS) play critical roles in various physiological processes. RSS donors can enhance our understanding of RSS chemical biology and open new avenues for treating RSS&#8208;associated diseases. Nevertheless, general strategies for the controllable release of distinct RSS remain lacking. Herein, we present the first general platform for controllable release of RSS with sulfur oxidation states ranging from &#8722;2 to +4, based on the intramolecular thiol&#8208;promoted decomposition of cysteine ester (ITPDC). We first rationally designed ITPDC&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donors that avoid electrophilic byproducts and exhibit high H2S release efficiencies (&gt;50%). Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations elucidated the detailed pathways of pH&#8208;controllable H2S release from ITPDC, and computational studies also predicted other H2S&#8208;related RSS release from the ITPDC&#8208;based motifs. Importantly, we developed a series of ITPDC&#8208;based donors capable of releasing various RSS, including persulfide, hydrogen persulfide, sulfenic acid, sulfinic acid, and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Moreover, fluorescent imaging demonstrated the successful cellular delivery of H2S, persulfide, and SO2 from these donors, and the ITPDC&#8208;based motif was employed to create a light&#8208;triggered donor. We anticipate that these innovative chemistries will provide valuable tools for studying sulfur biology and for developing new RSS donors and bio&#8208;orthogonal cleavage techniques.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer Across Phospholipid Bilayers in Anaerobic and Aerobic Atmospheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven transmembrane electron transfer across a biomimetic lipid bilayer membrane in aerobic and anaerobic atmospheres is achieved using an organic transmembrane oriented chromophore. The transmembrane molecule is designed symmetrically and easy to synthesize. This model system enables light&#8208;driven oxidation and reduction in the different compartments of the liposome, mimicking the photosynthesis system.








Abstract
In natural photosynthesis, light&#8208;driven electron transfer across the thylakoid membrane enables efficient charge separation and the confinement of reaction spaces for generating NADPH and CO2 and oxidation of water. These reactions are complementary redox reactions and require different reaction conditions for optimal performance. However, current artificial photosynthesis studies only take place in the bulk and are sensitive toward oxygen and air, which limits their applicability under aerated and water&#8208;splitting conditions. Herein, we report light&#8208;driven electron transfer across a lipid bilayer membrane of liposome vesicles via a rigid oligoaromatic molecular wire that allows to electronically connect an oxidation and reduction reaction which are spatially separated by the membrane. The molecular wire has a simple, symmetric, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize design based on benzothiadiazole and fluorene units and absorbs in the visible spectrum which makes it suitable for solar energy conversion. The model reactions in this study are light&#8208;driven NADH oxidation on one side of the membrane and light&#8208;driven reduction of an organic water&#8208;soluble dye in the bulk phase of liposomes. Additionally, the system is active in both aerobic and anaerobic atmospheres, rendering it ideal for aerobic conditions or reactions that produce oxygen such as solar&#8208;driven water splitting and artificial photosynthesis applications.

These reactions are complementary redox reactions and require different reaction conditions for optimal performance.

Herein, we report light-driven electron transfer across a lipid bilayer membrane of liposome vesicles via a rigid oligoaromatic molecular wire that allows to electronically connect an oxidation and reduction reaction which are spatially separated by the membrane. The molecular wire has a simple, symmetric, easy-to-synthesize design based on benzothiadiazole and fluorene units and absorbs in the visible spectrum which makes it suitable for solar energy conversion. The model reactions in this study are light-driven NADH oxidation on one side of the membrane and light-driven reduction of an organic water-soluble dye in the bulk phase of liposomes.

         <title>Restricting Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction via Secondary Coordinated Sulfur Enabling Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (4e&#8722; ORR) critically governs efficiency and lifespan in metal&#8208;air batteries and fuel cells, yet selectively suppressing competitive 2e&#8722; and stepwise 2e&#8722; pathways that generate corrosive hydrogen peroxide remains a major challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the strategic incorporation of secondary coordinated sulfur atoms into transition metal&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts to effectively promote direct 4e&#8722; ORR and simultaneously suppress undesirable 2e&#8722; pathways. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando spectroscopy reveal that enhanced adsorption of key intermediate *OOH facilitates efficient O&#8722;O bond cleavage, underpinning altered catalytic selectivity. Importantly, this approach is universally applicable to various carbon&#8208;based catalysts, including Co&#8208;N@C, Ni&#8208;N@C, Mn&#8208;N@C, and N@C. Specifically, a sulfur&#8208;mediated Co&#8208;N/Co@C catalyst, comprising Co&#8208;N4 sites and Co nanoparticles, dramatically lowers the 2e&#8722; O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 rate constant to merely 0.05&#8208;fold of its original value at 0.78 V. Consequently, Zn&#8208;air batteries using Co&#8208;N/Co@C&#8208;S as cathode exhibits an outstanding peak power density of 220 mW cm&#8722;2, remarkable lifespan over 2500 h and outstanding rate performance from 5 to 50 mA cm&#8211;2. This work paves a generalizable route for designing highly active and selective electrocatalysts suitable for advanced long&#8208;life energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural Sunlight&#8208;Driven Activation of Inert Aryl Halides Using Plasmonic Cu@CdS with Polysulfide Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light photoredox catalysis has become a rapidly emerging area owing to its potential of using sunlight to tame previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;harness radicals for organic synthesis. At present, such blueprint faces a significant challenge, namely how to accomplish thermodynamically demanding reactions with sunlight encompassing a wide range of low energy photons. Here, we report a new reaction framework to overcome this bottleneck through decoupling the thermodynamic limits of photoreduction from photoexcitation. This is fulfilled based on the construction of a heterogeneous photocatalyst Cu@CdS possessing in situ&#8208;formed surficial polysulfide species (including S3&#8226;&#8208; and S42&#8208;), which can efficiently harvest solar energy via plasmonic absorption of Cu, whilst manifest sufficient redox potential for activating inert aryl bromides/chlorides enacted by excited polysulfides. Our findings introduce a straightforward yet viable way to progress toward the century&#8208;long dream of leveraging natural sunlight to produce structurally complex organic molecules, just like plants on Earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Controlled Enantiodivergent Tandem Rearrangement to Synthesize 2H&#8208;Azirines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;controlled enantiodivergent rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto oxime ethers has been developed. Switching the metal catalyst from Co(II) to Fe(II) with an identical ligand completely reverses the asymmetric induction. Both enantiomers of chiral 2H&#8208;azirines and its derivatives are accessible under thermal or photolytic conditions. The cobalt&#8208;based reaction is highly efficient even at 0.05 mol% catalyst loading. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments and density functional theory calculations, reveal that distinct electronic properties of cobalt and iron modulate intermediate conformations, thereby altering the enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Poly(adipate)Esters via Catalytic Isomerizing Dual Hydroesterificative Polymerization of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(adipate)esters, are attracting substantial attention as sustainable materials due to their degradability, recyclability, and versatility in various applications. However, the conventional production of poly(adipate)esters relies on energy&#8208;intensive processes and petroleum&#8208;derived adipic acid (AA), whose synthesis poses environmental concerns, including nitrous oxide emissions. Herein, we introduce a novel Pd&#8208;catalyzed isomerizing dual hydroesterificative polymerization (IDHP) strategy for direct poly(adipate)ester synthesis from readily available feedstocks of 1,3&#8208;butadiene, diols, and carbon monoxide. Key to success lay in the utilization of an electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligand with bulky steric hindrance, which efficiently facilitated linear&#8208;selective isomerizing hydroesterification. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the isomerizing hydroesterificative polymerization exhibited remarkable efficiency in producing poly(adipate)esters. The resulting poly(adipate)esters possess a similar structure compared to those produced by traditional polycondensation. &#160;With abundant feedstocks and atom&#8208;economy, this methodology provides a practical and eco&#8208;friendly approach to the production of poly(adipate)esters with varied microstructures.</dc:description>

         <title>De&#8208;novo Design of Structure&#8208;tunable Multivalent Chimeras for Tumor&#8208;Targeted PD&#8208;L1 Degradation and Potentiated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD) technology holds significant potential for modulating protein homeostasis and treating diseases. However, current methods for degrading membrane protein highly depend on the lysosome&#8208;targeting ligands or membrane receptors. In this study, we present a set of multivalent targeting chimeras (multi&#8208;TACs) for tumor&#8208;specific degradation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on the surface of tumor cell membrane. The multi&#8208;TACs are synthesized by copolymerization of small molecule PD&#8208;L1 inhibitor BMS&#8208;1 with acid&#8208;responsive monomers. The chemical structures of the multi&#8208;TACs are optimized by investigating the correlation between PD&#8208;L1 degradation efficacy and the key parameters including acid&#8208;sensitive moieties, BMS&#8208;1 valences and spacer lengths. Mechanistic study reveals that the multi&#8208;TACs highly efficiently degrade PD&#8208;L1 on the surface of tumor cells via the adsorption&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation pathways, which differ significantly from the reported strategies for membrane protein degradation. The outperformed multi&#8208;TAC GG56 with tumor extracellular acidity and enzyme&#8208;sensitivity dramatically reduces PD&#8208;L1 levels and suppresses tumor growth in mouse models of B16&#8208;F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast tumors. Furthermore, GG56 serves as a versatile nanoplatform for combinatory chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and radio&#8208;immunotherapy of 4T1 breast tumor by co&#8208;delivery of chemotherapeutic and radio&#8208;sensitizer, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoconfined Ultrathin Polymer Membrane for Ultrafast Separation of Biobutanol from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging dissolution&#8211;crosslinking competition of linear polymer during an interfacial cross&#8208;linking reaction, a sub&#8208;10 nm thick polymer membrane was fabricated and precisely confined within the permanent voids of alumina supporting nanolayer. Through this nanoconfined ultrathin polymer membrane, 1.0&#160;wt% of aqueous n&#8208;butanol can be concentrated 14.2&#8208;fold, with a record&#8208;breaking liquid flux of 110&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Efficient recovery of biobutanol, a next&#8208;generation biofuel, from fermentation liquor remains challenging due to its low concentration and volatility. This study introduces ultrathin rubbery polymer membranes developed through an interfacial dissolution&#8211;crosslinking method, with cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane confined within the permanent nanovoids of ceramic alumina substrates. The resulting membranes, which are less than 10&#160;nm thick, achieve unparalleled performance: concentrating 1.0&#160;wt% aqueous n&#8208;butanol 14.2&#8208;fold with a record&#8208;high liquid flux of 110&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#8212;one to two orders of magnitude greater than those of previously reported membranes. These advancements suggest significant reductions in the membrane area and operational costs for large&#8208;scale biobutanol separation, establishing a sustainable and economical solution for biofuel production.

         <title>Acidic CO2 Electrolysis With Near&#8208;Ideal Selectivity and Carbon Efficiency Enabled by Overcoming Its Inherent Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherent trade&#8208;off exists in acidic CO2 electrolysis: increasing cation concentrations improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward CO2R products but comes at the expense of reduced single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency (SPCE). Modifying SnO2 with polyimide achieved a near&#8208;ideal SPCE of 95.7% and FE of 96% (toward HCOOH) at pH 1.36 with potassium ions down to even 0.1&#160;M. 








Abstract
Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2R) in acid tends to be a promising route to avoid CO2 loss in alkaline and neutral electrolytes; however, high alkali cation concentrations (typically &#8805;3&#160;M) are required to activate CO2 and suppress water electroreduction, causing carbonate formation and thus unsatisfied single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency (SPCE). Based on theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that an inherent trade&#8208;off exists: increasing cation concentrations improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward CO2R products but comes at the expense of reduced SPCE. We demonstrate a polyimide&#8208;modification strategy to overcome this trade&#8208;off by taking advantage of the amino groups that can effectively capture protons, creating a local alkaline microenvironment surrounding the electrode surface. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, SnO2 nanoparticles were modified with polyimide and acted as a CO2R catalyst, which achieved, simultaneously, near&#8208;ideal SPCE of 95.7% and FE of 96% (toward HCOOH) at pH 1.36 with dilute potassium ions down to even 0.1&#160;M. We expect that these findings will accelerate the development of carbon&#8208; and electron&#8208;efficient acidic CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>S&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced &#8220;Proton Fence Effect&#8221; Enables Selectivity Switching between CH4 and CO in Photo&#8208;Assisted CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective switching of C1 product between CH4 and CO during photo&#8208;assisted CO2 electroreduction is realized by a &#8220;proton fence&#8221; effect resulting from sulfur vacancies (SV). CO2 undergoes complete hydrogenation to CH4 (93.6% FE) over CuInS2/CuS stabilized by photo&#8208;generated holes, while *OH anchored on Sv of CuInS2/CuS1&#8208;x hinders local proton migration with preferential *CO desorption, exclusively furnishing CO (95.3% FE).








Abstract
Upcycling CO2 into high&#8208;value C1 products is impressive for achieving carbon neutrality and energy sustainability, while rational modulation of C1 product selectivity is one of the biggest challenges in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) due to the competing reaction pathways and thermodynamic limitation. Here, we showcase a &#8220;proton fence&#8221; strategy enabled by in situ adsorbed *OH on sulfur vacancies (SV) to ultraselectively switch the C1 product between CH4 and CO during CO2RR, with Faraday efficiency of 93.6% and 95.3%, respectively. In situ measurements uncover that the photo&#8208;generated holes counteract Cu2+ electroreduction to retain the intact structure of CuInS2/CuS, while *OH dissociated from water can spontaneously anchor toward SV to hinder the local proton migration, completely circumventing multiproton products. Meanwhile, the preferential desorption of *CO from Cu centers adjacent to the *OH&#8208;anchored SV renders the exclusive formation of CO. In the absence of SV, *CO can be further hydrogenated in a lower free energy/even spontaneously to afford CH4. The proposed proton confinement effect furnishes a promising reference for the selectivity control of eCO2RR, and the photo&#8208;assisted electroreductive protocol demonstrates a paradigm of in situ stabilization of electron&#8208;intolerant catalytic structures.

         <title>A General Strategy for Enhanced Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging Through Intramolecular Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a strategy to enhance single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging through the development of intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) cassettes, optimizing both photostability and photon budget. The cassettes, incorporating rhodamine as the donor and Si&#8208;rhodamine as the acceptor, achieve an impressive 94.8% energy transfer efficiency and a 670% increase in survival time compared to rhodamine alone at the single&#8208;molecule level.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule imaging demands fluorophores with exceptional photostability and photon budget. This study presents an intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) strategy to enhance these critical properties. We developed xanthene&#8208;based IMET cassettes by covalently linking donor and acceptor, achieving significant improvements in single&#8208;molecule imaging performance. While extensive spectral overlap is generally beneficial in bulk systems, single&#8208;molecule imaging necessitates careful optimization to minimize direct acceptor excitation at the high excitation powers typically used. Our optimized cassettes, featuring rhodamine as donor and Si&#8208;rhodamine as acceptor, exhibit 94.8% energy transfer efficiency. This configuration effectively minimizes direct excitation&#8208;induced acceptor bleaching, as 94.9% of molecules exhibit donor photobleaching prior to acceptor photobleaching. This efficient energy management leads to a 670% enhancement in photostability, arising from the competition between IMET and photobleaching pathways, which effectively channels excitation energy away from photo&#8208;destructive processes. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that IMET occurs on a picosecond timescale, significantly faster than both fluorescence relaxation (nanoseconds) and photobleaching (seconds). Notably, these IMET cassettes demonstrated superior performance in single&#8208;molecule tracking applications, including on supported lipid bilayers and in live&#8208;cell tracking of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dynamics, highlighting the broad potential of the IMET strategy for advancing single&#8208;molecule imaging.

         <title>Development of Chiral Bisphosphine Ligands with a Terminal Olefin Enables Asymmetric Orthogonal Auto&#8208;Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an innovative catalytic strategy, orthogonal auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (OATC), which seamlessly integrates transition&#8208;metal catalysis with organocatalysis in a single reactor. By rationally designing novel chiral bisphosphine ligands with a terminal olefin (TOPhos), we have accomplished the first one&#8208;pot asymmetric OATC involving four distinct catalytic cycles, achieving excellent yield and enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (ATC) leverages the multiple roles of the catalyst, facilitating the direct synthesis of complex molecules from simple starting materials in a highly efficient and step&#8208;economical manner. However, in conventional ATC, employing a single catalyst imposes significant limitations on the variety of catalyzed reactions. Herein, we present a novel catalysis strategy termed &#8220;orthogonal auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (OATC)&#8221;, which provides the unique opportunity to develop more efficient chemical transformations that cannot be achieved with existing catalytic modes. An unprecedented tandem annulation process involving four different catalytic cycles via asymmetric OATC is demonstrated. The enantio&#8208;determining step is a previously unrealized Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic lactonization. The key to the whole success lies in the development of a new class of chiral bisphosphine ligands with a terminal olefin (TOPhos) that addressed not only the racemization issue of allylic ester products in classic &#960;&#8208;allylmetal chemistry, but also the inherent compatibility challenges in transition&#8208;metal/organo dual catalytic system.

     alt="Development of Chiral Bisphosphine Ligands with a Terminal Olefin Enables Asymmetric Orthogonal Auto-Tandem Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present an innovative catalytic strategy, orthogonal auto-tandem catalysis (OATC), which seamlessly integrates transition-metal catalysis with organocatalysis in a single reactor. By rationally designing novel chiral bisphosphine ligands with a terminal olefin (TOPhos), we have accomplished the first one-pot asymmetric OATC involving four distinct catalytic cycles, achieving excellent yield and enantioselectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auto-tandem catalysis (ATC) leverages the multiple roles of the catalyst, facilitating the direct synthesis of complex molecules from simple starting materials in a highly efficient and step-economical manner. However, in conventional ATC, employing a single catalyst imposes significant limitations on the variety of catalyzed reactions. Herein, we present a novel catalysis strategy termed &#8220;orthogonal auto-tandem catalysis (OATC)&#8221;, which provides the unique opportunity to develop more efficient chemical transformations that cannot be achieved with existing catalytic modes. An unprecedented tandem annulation process involving four different catalytic cycles via asymmetric OATC is demonstrated. The enantio-determining step is a previously unrealized Pd(0)-catalyzed asymmetric allylic lactonization. The key to the whole success lies in the development of a new class of chiral bisphosphine ligands with a terminal olefin (TOPhos) that addressed not only the racemization issue of allylic ester products in classic &#960;-allylmetal chemistry, but also the inherent compatibility challenges in transition-metal/organo dual catalytic system. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the vital role of the terminal olefin in TOPhos, enabling the differentiation of competitive enantioselective pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722; Using CH4 in Homogenous Rhenium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a Re catalysis of one&#8208;pot synthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722; using CH4 as a reductant under UV light irradiation. We are able to directly convert NO3&#8722;, leading to several environmental issues, to NH3, an essential compound as a fertilizer and industrial raw material, by means of CH4, which has a high affinity with renewable resource/energy, as a reductant under light, a renewable energy.








Abstract
We present Re catalysis of one&#8208;pot synthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722; using CH4 as a reductant under UV light irradiation at room temperature. NO3&#8722; leads to environmental issues such as water contamination, eutrophication, and biodiversity loss. In a natural system and a sewage facility, NO3&#8722; can be detoxified to N2 using hydrogen donors by a microbial process. However, it is better to convert NO3&#8722; to NH3 rather than N2. To develop a desirable process of NO3&#8722; to NH3 for a sustainable society, it is required that the reducing agent is derived from a renewable resource/energy. Thus, we turned our attention to CH4, which has a high affinity with renewable resource/energy since it can be produced from livestock waste. Therefore, our system reported here is to directly convert NO3&#8722; to NH3 using CH4 with light energy.

         <title>Aqueous Self&#8208;Assembly of Cylindrical and Tapered Bottlebrush Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic tapered bottlebrush block copolymers with cone&#8208;shaped architectures using a combination of experiments and simulations. Results revealed two distinct self&#8208;assembly pathways leading to diverse nanostructures, including vesicles formed via semivesicle intermediates. The findings highlight the critical role of bottlebrush block copolymer shape in determining their self&#8208;assembly behavior.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BCPs), featuring backbones densely grafted with two types of side chains, is less well understood compared to linear BCPs. In particular, the solution self&#8208;assembly of tapered bottlebrush BCPs&#8212;cone&#8208;shaped BCPs with hydrophilic or hydrophobic tips&#8212;remains unexplored. This study investigates eight tapered and four cylindrical bottlebrush BCPs with varied ratios of hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) and hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) side chains, synthesized via sequential addition of macromonomers using ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (SAM&#8208;ROMP). Self&#8208;assembled nanostructures formed in water were analyzed using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small&#8208;angle neutron scattering, and dynamic light scattering. Most BCPs generated multiple nanostructures with surface protrusions, including spherical micelles, cylindrical micelles, and vesicles, alongside transitional forms like ellipsoids and semi&#8208;vesicles. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations supported the experimental findings, which revealed two distinct self&#8208;assembly pathways. The first involved micelle fusion, producing elliptical and cylindrical aggregates, sometimes forming Y&#8208;junctions. The second pathway featured micelle maturation into semivesicles, which developed into vesicles or large compound vesicles. This work provides the first experimental evidence of vesicle formation via semivesicles in bottlebrush BCPs and demonstrates the significant influence of cone directionality on self&#8208;assembly behavior in these cone&#8208;shaped polymeric amphiphiles.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Stable Gold Nanoparticles with Tunable Surface Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;stable gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were achieved through in situ free&#8208;radical polymerization, resulting in a single&#8208;loading structure with controllable morphology and tunable surface properties. The crosslinked polymer shell surrounding the nanoparticles contributes to enhanced stability, excellent biocompatibility, and prolonged blood circulation in mice.








Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), as a class of functional nanomaterials, have attracted considerable interest for biomedical applications owing to their unique chemical and physical properties. However, colloidal solutions of Au NPs are thermodynamically unstable because of their high surface energy, resulting in poor stability and biocompatibility in physiological environments. Herein, we present a novel strategy for coating Au NPs using in situ polymerization to form a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network polymer shell around each particle. This approach enables the creation of an ultra&#8208;stable core&#8208;shell structure that effectively improves biocompatibility and stability, even in complex biological environments. The surface characteristics of the polymer shell can also be precisely tailored by carefully selecting the monomers to meet biomedical application requirements. These properties enable prolonged circulation within the bloodstream and enhanced tumor targeting in mice. This strategy offers an ultra&#8208;stable, aqueous&#8208;based, and biocompatible polymer shell for Au NPs, paving the way for the surface modification of gold nanomaterials in biomedical applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks at the Edge of Stability: Mediating Node Distortion to Access Metastable Nanoparticle Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ total scattering during nanoscale TiO2 formation from a MOF precursor shows that the local MOF node geometry is preserved in the nanoparticles formed under mild conditions. The node geometry depends on the chemical environment of the MOF, which can be tuned to increase the yield of nano&#8208;brookite, a TiO2 polymorph that is difficult to synthesize by traditional methods. Thus, this offers a new strategy to control nanoparticle synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as unconventional precursors for nanoparticle synthesis, with potential to leverage their tunable structures and chemistry to achieve nanomaterials with structures and compositions inaccessible via traditional synthetic routes. Here, we use in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) measurements to investigate how the dynamic structure of MOFs at the edge of stability influences their transformation into different metastable polymorphs. Our study reveals that the local structural features of metal&#8208;oxo MOF nodes at elevated temperatures are linked to the resulting nanoparticle structures formed under mild conditions. Focusing on the titanium&#8208;based MOF MIL&#8208;125, we demonstrate that manipulating the chemical environment to facilitate transformation of the Ti8 node geometry promotes formation of metastable, nanometer&#8208;scale TiO2 brookite rather than the more common anatase and rutile TiO2 polymorphs typically produced through MOF pyrolysis at high temperature. These findings highlight the potential to harness the MOF topology and chemical environment to design and control node distortions and enable access to exotic metastable nanoparticle states.

         <title>Organic Cation Modulation in Hybrid Zirconium Halides for High&#8208;Performance Flexible X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the molecular design based on the steric hindrance effect and hydrogen bond, a new hybrid material with high&#8208;quality 0D structure, better lattice stability, and fewer defects is obtained, and finally achieves the excellent large&#8208;area detection performance with a high spatial resolution of 21.35&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1 and a low detection limit of 2.270&#160;&#181;Gyair&#160;s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Exploiting novel materials featuring high&#8208;quality zero&#8208;dimensional structure, remarkable lattice stability, and minimal defects represents an efficacious strategy for enhancing the detection performance of X&#8208;ray scintillators. Here, we design and synthesize two novel zirconium&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs), C14H40N4ZrCl8 and C6H16N2ZrCl6. Based on the steric hindrance effect of organic cations, the distance between [ZrCl6]2&#8722; polyhedra was designed, and the electronic coupling interactions among polyhedra were adjusted, thus precisely engineering excellent zero&#8208;dimensional materials. Simultaneously, the stronger N&#9472;H+&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8722; bond is introduced to avoid structural instabilities and more defects due to the bigger organic cation in C14H40N4ZrCl8. As expected, C14H40N4ZrCl8 exhibits more remarkable luminescence behavior compared to C6H16N2ZrCl6. The photophysics process involving self&#8208;trapped excitons and defects is elaborately expounded using first&#8208;principles calculations, luminescence properties, and stabilities. Finally, a flexible and large&#8208;area scintillation screen based on C14H40N4ZrCl8 is fabricated and attains a high spatial resolution of 21.35&#160;lp mm&#8722;1 and a lower limit of detection of 2.270&#160;&#181;Gyair&#160;s&#8722;1, outperforming the resolution of most blue&#8208;emitting scintillation screens. These results imply that the zirconium&#8208;based OIMHs possess significant potential applications for medical diagnostics, security scanning, and non&#8208;destructive testing.

         <title>Generation, Capture, Storage and Release of Singlet Oxygen from A Perylene Diimide&#8208;Based Metallacage for Oxygen Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled generation and utilization of singlet oxygen (1O2) are crucial for its diverse applications but remain challenging due to its high reactivity and short&#8208;lived nature. Here, we report a box&#8208;shaped metallacage prepared via multicomponent coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly using tetrapyridyl perylene diimide (PDI) and tetracarboxylate anthracene as building blocks. Upon photo&#8208;irradiation, the PDI faces act as photosensitizers to generate 1O2, which reacts with the anthracene pillars to form a peroxidized metallacage, where 1O2 is captured and stored as anthracene peroxides. Heating releases 1O2 quantitatively, restoring the original metallacage structure. Both states are stable at room temperature, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Additionally, photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from anthracene pillars to PDI faces quenches the emission of the metallacage, while oxidation of anthracene inhibits PET, yielding bright fluorescence for the peroxidized metallacage. This reversible emission change enables the metallacage to function as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for dissolved oxygen, with a detection limit of 1.1&#215;10&#8208;3 mg/L. This study demonstrates a metallacage that can generate, capture, store, and release 1O2 for oxygen sensing, offering insights for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;Embedded Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Quasi&#8208;Honeycomb Lattice for High&#8208;Capacitance Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a unique class of framework electronic materials, two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) exhibit intrinsic porosity, superior electrical conductivity, and abundant active sites. These properties endow them with great potential in electrochemical lithium&#8208;ion storage. However, the development of 2D c&#8208;MOF&#8208;based capacitors has encountered a bottleneck in enhancing Li&#8208;ion storage capacitance, and the design of high&#8208;capacitance MOF electrode materials has remained a challenge. Herein, we synthesize a Cu&#8208;OHDDQP (octahydroxy&#8208;dibenzo[a,c]dibenzo[5,6:7,8]quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;i]phenazine) 2D c&#8208;MOF with a quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice by employing a non&#8208;planar D2&#8208;symmetric conjugated ligand embedding redox&#8208;active pyrazine moieties. The quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice features a dual&#8208;porous tessellation of C6&#8208;symmetric and C3&#8208;symmetric pores. Notably, when utilized as active material for electrochemical lithium storage, Cu&#8208;OHDDQP achieves a record&#8208;high gravimetric specific capacitance among reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs of 452 F g&#8208;1 in aqueous lithium electrolyte, along with a decent cycling stability of 90% after 1000 cycles. Such high capacitance is attributed to both the quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice leading to higher surface area, and the redox&#8208;active pyrazine moieties offering extra lithium&#8208;adsorption sites and associated pseudocapacitance. This work demonstrates that rational ligand design enables high&#8208;capacitance MOF electrodes materials, highlighting the potential of conductive MOFs for electrochemical energy technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Control Over S(VI)&#8208;Stereogenic Center: NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Cyclic Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of aza&#8208;sulfur(VI) compounds holds significant potential in pharmaceuticals owing to their broad spectrum of biological properties. Herein, we report the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;organocatalyzed enantioselective synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides (SIAs). The free N&#8208;H containing SIAs often exhibit configurational lability through tautomerization. We investigated this by demonstrating their non&#8208;symmetric nature in both solid state and solution. The in situ generated chiral acylazolium intermediates from easily accessible aldehydes in the presence of NHC and oxidant were trapped with the prochiral cyclic SIA anions allowing the enantioselective synthesis of configurationally stable N&#8208;acyl cyclic SIAs. Mechanistic studies reveal that the present strategy proceeds via the desymmetrization of the prochiral SIA anions. Moreover, the derivatization of the synthesized N&#8208;acyl SIAs highlights the practical utility of the present methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures of Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthase PhaC from Aeromonas caviae, Producing Biodegradable Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a biodegradable polyester that can serve as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics which present a serious source of pollution. PHA synthase (PhaC) is a key enzyme responsible for producing a wide variety of PHAs in microorganisms. Here we present crystal structures of full&#8208;length PhaC from&#160;Aeromonas caviae, a high&#8208;performance PhaC employed for industrial use. The structure reveals an N&#8208;terminal helical domain that mediates head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization and stabilizes the C&#8208;terminal &#945;/&#946; catalytic domain to form a tunnel that connects the catalytic center embedded inside the protein to the protein surface. We showed that this tunnel is a putative egress tunnel for the product PHA chain. Our results establish a fundamental understanding of the PhaC machinery that should lead to improvement of this enzyme in industrial applications.</dc:description>
