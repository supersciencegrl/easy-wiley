         <title>Sampling and analysis in flow: the keys to smarter, more controllable and sustainable fine&#8208;chemical manufacturing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Process analytical technology (PAT) is a system designed to help chemists better understand and control manufacturing processes. PAT systems operate through the combination of analytical devices, reactor control elements, and mathematical models to ensure the quality of the final product  via  a quality by design (QbD) approach. The expansion of continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industry involves the development of PAT tools suitable for continuous operation and flow reactor environment. This requires innovative approaches to sampling and analysis from flowing media to maintain the integrity of the reactor content and the analyte of interest. The following review discusses examples of PAT tools implemented in flow chemistry for the preparation of small organic molecules, and applications of self&#8208;optimisation tools.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Counting and Superresolution Mapping of Tetraspanins on Exosomes using a Single&#8208;Molecule Sensitive Flow Technique and Transistor&#8208;like Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we describes a method for high&#8208;throughput counting and superresolution mapping of surface proteins on exosomes, using a combination of a single&#8208;molecule sensitive flow technique and an adaptive superresolution imaging method. Exosomes stained with membrane dye and dye&#8208;conjugated antibodies were analyzed using a microfluidic platform at a flow rate of 100 exosome/s to determine size and protein copy number. Superresolution mapping was performed with exosomes labeled with novel transistor&#8208;like, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), which exhibit spontaneous blinking with &lt;5 nm localization error and a broad range of optical&#8208;adjustable duty cycles. Based on the copy numbers extracted from the flow analysis, the switch&#8208;on frequency of the Pdots were fine adjusted so that structures of hundreds of exosomes can be obtained within five minutes. The high throughput and high sensitivity of this method offer clear advantages for characterization of exosomes and similar biological vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Leading to Efficient Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable progress being achieved in recent years, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) still need working to approach the balance among the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;cost correlation. Herein, two fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors, PTB4F and PTB4Cl are developed via two&#8208;step synthesis from single aromatic units. The introduction of two&#8208;dimensional chain and halogenated terminals for these non&#8208;fused acceptors plays synergistic roles in optimizing their solid stacking and orientation, thus promoting an elongated exciton lifetime and fast charge transfer rate in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends. As results, PTB4Cl, upon blending with PBDB&#8208;TF polymer, has enabled single&#8208;junction OPVs with power conversion efficiencies of 12.76%, representing the highest values among the reported fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Polymer&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte and Fully Infiltrated 3D Electrode for Integrated Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs) are very promising due to their enhanced safety and high energy density, but greatly plagued by the relatively low ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;state electrolytes and large electrolyte&#8208;electrode interfacial resistance. Herein, we design a&#160;poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (1.24&#215;10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  ) and construct a model integrated TiO  2  /Li SSLB with 3D fully infiltration of solid electrolyte. With forming aggregated ion clusters, unique ionic channels are generated in the PISSE, providing much faster Li  +  transport than common polymer electrolytes. Moreover, the integrated device simultaneously achieves maximized interfacial contact and electrochemical and mechanical stability, presenting high performance close to that with liquid electrolyte. A pouch cell made of 2 SSLB units in series shows high voltage plateau (3.7 V) and volumetric energy density comparable to many commercial thin&#8208;film batteries (microbatteries), which also exhibits robust flexibility and brilliant safety under abuse tests.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformable Nanosensitizer with Tumour Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Sonodynamic Process and Calcium Release for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the promise of sonodynamic process in cancer therapy, existing sonosensitizers often fail to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) against tumor, potentially leading to off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. Herein, we report a transformable core&#8208;shell nanosonosensitizer (TiO  2  @CaP) that not only reinvigorates the ROS generation but also dissolves its CaP shell to release Ca  2+  in acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) under ultrasound activation. Thus, TiO  2  @CaP acts as the smart nanosonosensitizer that specifically induces mitochondrial dysfunction via overloading intracellular Ca  2+  ions to synergize with sonodynamic process in TME. Such a synergetic effect of TME&#8208;activated sonodynamic ROS generation and Ca  2+  release is revealed to substantially enhance immunogenic cell death, resulting in enhanced T cell recruitment and infiltration into the immunogenetic cold tumor (4T1). In conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy (anti&#8208;PD 1), TiO  2  @CaP&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy elicits systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity, leading to regression of non&#8208;treated distant tumors and inhibition of lung metastasis. This work thus paves the way to develop &#8220;smart&#8221; TME&#8208;activatable sonosensitizer with tempospatial control over antitumor responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Using a Hybrid Hypercrosslinked Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method enables the encapsulation of organic and inorganic phase change materials (PCMs) simultaneously has not been reported though a range of research has been dedicated to solving the leakage problems of PCMs during energy storage process. In this work, an organic/inorganic hybrid silioxyl functional group containing polymer was synthesized and applied to encapsulate PCMs. Owing to the mild hypercrosslinking reaction conditions, which only require the addition of catalytic amount of aqueous alkali solution, renders it to be tolerance towards both organic and inorganic PCMs. It is noteworthy that the initial homogeneous state of the reaction mixture allowed the ultimate PCMs encapsulation rate and the uniform blending of the third nano&#8208;additives with the aim of thermal conductivity enhancement. Further study reveals that the presence of this hybrid polymers endows a unique self&#8208;cleaning property to the obtained phase change composite that it displays a good hydrophobicity to water droplets. More importantly, this novel PCMs encapsulation protocol displays good tolerance towards varies of nanoparticles, including carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles and inorganic oxide nanoparticles, which enables an utmost 600% thermal conductivity enhancement and 93.7% light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with a latent heat of 180 J/g without leakage.</dc:description>

Further study reveals that the presence of this hybrid polymers endows a unique self&#8208;cleaning property to the obtained phase change composite that it displays a good hydrophobicity to water droplets. More importantly, this novel PCMs encapsulation protocol displays good tolerance towards varies of nanoparticles, including carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles and inorganic oxide nanoparticles, which enables an utmost 600% thermal conductivity enhancement and 93.7% light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with a latent heat of 180 J/g without leakage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;term tracking and dynamically quantifying of reversible changes of extracellular Ca2+ in multiple brain regions of freely moving animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding physiological and pathological processes in the brain requires tracking the reversible changes in chemical signals with long&#8208;term stability. We developed a new anti&#8208;biofouling microfiber array to real&#8208;time quantify extracellular Ca 2+  concentrations together with neuron activity across many regions in the mammalian brain for 60 days, in which the signal degradation was &lt; &#8764;8%. The developed microarray with high tempo&#8208;spatial resolution (&#8764;10 &#956;m, &#8764;1.3 s) was implanted into 7 brain regions of free&#8208;moving mice for monitoring the reversible changes of extracellular Ca 2+  upon ischemia&#8208;reperfusion processes. It was discovered that the changing sequence and rate of Ca 2+  in 7 brain regions were different during the stroke. We also found that ROS scavenger could protect Ca 2+  influx and neuronal activity after stroke, suggesting the significant influence of ROS on Ca 2+  overload and neuron death. Finally, we demonstrated this microarray is a versatile tool for investigating brain dynamic during pathological processes and drug treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Pinning Effect Enhanced Structural Stability toward a Zero&#8208;Strain Layered Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered oxides as the cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries are receiving extensive attention due to their high capacity and flexible composition. However, the layered cathode tends to be thermodynamically and electrochemically unstable during sodiation and de&#8208;sodiation. Herein, we for the first time propose the &#8220;pinning effect&#8221; and controllable &#8220;pinning point&#8221; in sodium storage layered cathodes to enhance the structural stability and achieve the optimal electrochemical performance. 0%, 2.5% and 7.3% transition&#8208;metal (TM) occupancies in Na&#8208;site as pinning points are obtained through adjusting the feeding ratio of iron in Na  0.67  Mn  0.5  Co  0.5&#8208;  x  Fe  x  O  2  system. Results show that 2.5% TM pinning is beneficial to restrain the potential slab sliding and enhance the structural stability, resulting in an ultra&#8208;low volume variation of 0.6% and maintaining the smooth two&#8208;dimensional channel for Na&#8208;ion transfer. Finally, the Na  0.67  Mn  0.5  Co  0.4  Fe  0.1  O  2  cathode with the optimal TM pinning delivers outstanding cycling performance of over 1000 cycles and superior rate capability up to 10C.</dc:description>

         <title>Na&#8230;B Bond in NaBH3&#8211;: Solving the Conundrum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bonding in the recently synthesized NaBH  3  &#8211;  cluster is investigated using the high level Valence Bond BOVB method. Contrary to earlier conclusions, the Na&#8211;B bond is found to be neither a genuine dative bond, nor a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond at equilibrium. It is rather revealed as a split and polarized weakly coupled electron&#8208;pair, which allows this cluster to be more effectively stabilized by a combination of (major) dipole&#8208;dipole electrostatic interaction and (secondary) resonant one&#8208;electron bonding mechanism. Our analysis of this unprecedented bonding situation extends to similar clusters, and the VB model unifies and articulates the previously published variegated views on this exotic &#8220;bond&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Color Switchable Photonic Crystal Silicone Elastomer Kirigami</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioinspired dynamic structural color has great potential for use in dynamic displays, sensors, cryptography, and camouflage. However, it is quite rare for artificial structural color devices to withstand thousands of cycles. Male hummingbird&#8217;s crowns and gorgets are brightly colored, demonstrating color switching frequently that is induced by regulating the orientation of the feathers through movement of skin or joint. Inspired by this unique structural color modulation, we demonstrate a flexible, mechanically triggered color switchable sheet based on a photonic crystal&#8208; (PhC) coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) kirigami (PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami) made by laser cutting. Finite element modeling (FEM) simulation reveals that the thickness of PDMS kirigami and the chamfer at the incision induced by laser cutting both dominate the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformation through in&#8208;plane stretching. The bioinspired PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami shows precisely programmable structural color and keeps the color very well after recycling over 10,000 times. This bioinspired PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami also shows excellent viewability even in bright sunlight, high readability, robust functionality, technical flexibility, and mechanical durability, which are readily exploitable for applications, such as chromic mechanical monitors for the sports industry or for medical applications, wearable camouflage, and security systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation of Alkenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive carboxylation of organo (pseudo)halides with CO  2  is a powerful method to provide carboxylic acids quickly. Notably, the catalytic reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons via CO  2  fixation is a highly challenging but desirable approach for structurally diverse carboxylic acids. However, there are only a few reports but no examples of alkenes via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, we report the first asymmetric reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO  2  via nickel catalysis. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides, such as aryl bromides, aryl triflates and inert aryl chlorides of particular note, undergo the reaction smoothly to give important oxindole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. This transformation features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, facile scalability, good to excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivities. Importantly, the method  is highlighted by the  formal synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;Esermethole, (&#8208;)&#8208;Physostigmine and (&#8208;)&#8208;Physovenine, as well as the total synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;Debromoflustramide B, (&#8208;)&#8208;Debromoflustramine B and (+)&#8208;Coixspirolactam A, opening an avenue for the total synthesis of chiral natural products with CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Top&#8208;down fabricated nanoantenna architectures of both metallic and dielectric materials demonstrated powerful functionalities for Raman and fluorescence enhancement with relevance to single molecule sensing, while inducing directionality of chromophore emission with implications for single photon sources. Herein, we synthesize the smallest bowtie nanoantenna by selective tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip fusion of two tetrahedral colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) forming a dimer. While the tetrahedral monomers emit non&#8208;polarized light, the bowtie architecture manifests nanoantenna functionality of enhanced emission polarization along the bowtie axis as predicted theoretically and revealed by single particle spectroscopy. Theory also predicts the formation of an electric&#8208;field hotspot at the bowtie epicenter. This is utilized for selective light induced photocatalytic metal growth at that location, unlike growth on the free tips in dark conditions thus demonstrating the bowtie dimer functionality as a photochemical reaction center. Our findings pave a path for additional bottom&#8208;up bowtie architectures applicable in optics, sensing and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>The Boundary of Lithium Plating in Graphite Electrode for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphite has been the dominant anode material for practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, uncontrolled Li plating in graphite electrodes remains the main bottleneck that endangers battery life and safety, which have driven tremendous efforts aiming to eliminate Li plating. Herein we systematically investigate the boundary of Li plating in graphite electrodes for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries. On one hand, the cell exhibits superior safety performance than that with Li dendrites by defining the endurable amount of uniform Li plating in graphite anode. On the other hand, the presence of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; can be eliminated owing to the uniform distribution of Li plating, and the average Coulombic efficiency for deposited Li during the reversible plating/stripping process is decoupled as high as ~99.5%. Attributing to the limited Li plating with superior Coulombic efficiency, the LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite cell achieves a high capacity retention of 80.2% over 500 cycles. This work sheds a different light on further improving the fast&#8208;charging capability, low&#8208;temperature performance, and energy density of practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Microscale Thermophoresis for Simultaneous Measurement of Binding Affinity and Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a versatile technique to measure binding affinities of binder&#8208;ligand systems, based on the directional movement of molecules in a temperature gradient. In this study, we extended MST to measure binding kinetics as well as binding affinity in a single experiment by increasing the thermal dissipation of the sample. The kinetic relaxation fingerprints were derived from the fluorescence changes during thermodynamic re&#8208;equilibration of the sample after local heating. Using this method, we measured DNA hybridization on&#8208;rates and off&#8208;rates in the range 10  4  &#8208;10  6&#160;  M  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  and 10  &#8208;4  &#8208;10  &#8208;1  s  &#8209;1  , respectively. We observed the expected exponential dependence of the DNA hybridization off&#8208;rates on salt concentration, strand length and inverse temperature. The measured on&#8208;rates showed a linear dependence on salt concentration and weak dependence on strand length and temperature. For biomolecular interactions with large enthalpic contributions, the kinetic MST technique offers a robust, cost&#8208;effective and immobilization&#8208;free determination of kinetic rates and binding affinity simultaneously, even in crowded solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescent Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing of Acute Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Early and rapid diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is of exceptional significance in the control of cardiovascular diseases. Herein we report the development of a highly sensitive ratiometric fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (RFLFIA) strip for rapid and accurate detection of AMI biomarker, namely heart&#8208;type fatty acid binding protein (H&#8208;FABP). The RFLFIA strip works in terms of ratiometric change of fluorescence signal, arising from blending of fluorescence emitted by two composite nanostructures conjugated to capture and probe antibodies and inner filter effect of gold nanoparticles. In conjunction with using custom smartphone&#8208;based analytical device and tonality analysis, quantitative detection of H&#8208;FABP was achieved with a low limit of detection at 0.21 ng mL  &#8722;1  . In addition, the RFLFIA strip can generate a visually distinguishable green&#8208;to&#8208;red color change around the threshold concentration of H&#8208;FABP (6.2 ng mL  &#8722;1  ), thus allowing the semi&#8208;quantitative diagnosis by the naked eye with a high accuracy and reproducibility. Thanks to unique advantages of the ratiometric fluorescence strategy, the RFLFIA strip shows analytical performance superior to conventional fluorescence strip and comparable to clinical latex agglutination test, thus holding the potentiality in point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing and at&#8208;home self&#8208;testing diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino&#8208;Functionalised Hybrid Ultramicroporous Materials that Enable Single&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from a Ternary Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid ultramicroporous materials in which aminopyrazine ligands substitute pyrazine ligands are the first physisorbents that enable polymer&#8208;grade (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) ethylene production from ternary C2&#8208;CO2 gas mixtures under ambient conditions thanks to coadsorption of both C2H2 and CO2.







Abstract
Pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous (pore size &lt;7&#8197;&#197;) materials (HUMs) offer benchmark performance for trace carbon capture thanks to strong selectivity for CO2 over small gas molecules, including light hydrocarbons. That the prototypal pyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs are amenable to crystal engineering has enabled second generation HUMs to supersede the performance of the parent HUM, SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn, mainly through substitution of the metal and/or the inorganic pillar. Herein, we report that two isostructural aminopyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs, MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni (17=aminopyrazine; M=Si, Ti), which we had anticipated would offer even stronger affinity for CO2 than their pyrazine analogs, unexpectedly exhibit reduced CO2 affinity but enhanced C2H2 affinity. MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni are consequently the first physisorbents that enable single&#8208;step production of polymer&#8208;grade (&gt;99.95&#8201;% for SIFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni) ethylene from a ternary equimolar mixture of ethylene, acetylene and CO2 thanks to coadsorption of the latter two gases. We attribute this performance to the very different binding sites in MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni versus SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn.

         <title>Selectivity Map for the Late Stages of CO and CO2 Reduction to C2 Species on Copper Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selectivity map is provided for the late stages of CO2 reduction to C2 molecules based on computational models and electrochemical experiments. Sites with moderate coordination are efficient for ethylene production, with Cu(100) being more active than defective surfaces. Conversely, kinks and steps are more active for ethanol production.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO and CO2 reduction reactions (CORR and CO2RR) using copper catalysts and renewable electricity hold promise as a carbon&#8208;neutral route to produce commodity chemicals and fuels. However, the exact mechanisms and structure sensitivity of Cu electrodes toward C2 products are still under debate. Herein, we investigate ethylene oxide reduction (EOR) as a proxy to the late stages of CORR to ethylene, and the results are compared to those of acetaldehyde reduction to ethanol. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that ethylene oxide undergoes ring opening before exclusively reducing to ethylene via *OH formation. Based on generalized coordination numbers (CN), a selectivity map for the late stages of CORR and CO2RR shows that sites with moderate coordination (5.9 &lt; CN &lt; 7.5) are efficient for ethylene production, with pristine Cu(100) being more active than defective surfaces such as Cu(311). In contrast, kinks and edges are more active for ethanol production, while (111) terraces are relatively inert.

         <title>Decoding the Complex Free Radical Cascade by Using a DNA Framework&#8208;Based Artificial DNA Encoder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA framework&#8208;based artificial DNA encoder for the complex free radical cascade was developed. Unlike time&#8208;consuming and vulnerable genome&#8208;encoded systems, it can actively sense and actuate information communications in real time, with enhanced environmental tolerance, broad decoding activities, and concurrent blocking of adverse communications between free radicals and inflammatory signaling, contributing to its anti&#8208;obesity effects.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular communications (DMC) are critical for regulating biological networks to maintain stable organismic functions. However, the complicated, time&#8208;consuming information transmission process involved in genome&#8208;coded DMC and the limited, vulnerable decoding activity generally lead to communication impairment or failure, in response to external stimuli. Herein, we present a conceptually innovative DMC strategy mediated by the DNA framework&#8208;based artificial DNA encoder. With the free&#8208;radical cascade as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, the artificial DNA encoder shows active sensing and real&#8208;time actuation, in&#8197;situ and broad free radical&#8208;decoding efficacy, as well as robust resistance to environmental noise. It can also block undesirable short&#8208;to&#8208;medium&#8208;range communications between free radicals and inflammatory networks, leading to a synergistic anti&#8208;obesity effect. The artificial DNA encoder&#8208;based DMC may be generalized to other communication systems for a variety of applications.

         <title>Frequency&#8208;Upconverted Stimulated Emission by Up to Six&#8208;Photon Excitation from Highly Extended Spiro&#8208;Fused Ladder&#8208;Type Oligo(p&#8208;phenylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient frequency&#8208;upconverted fluorescence and stimulated emission have been demonstrated in spiro&#8208;fused ladder&#8208;type oligo(p&#8208;phenylene)s through multiphoton absorption with an absorbed photon number up to six. The results demonstrate an effective molecular design strategy for exploring highly efficient MPA fluorophores for multiphoton optical applications.







Abstract
Frequency&#8208;upconverted fluorescence and stimulated emission induced by multiphoton absorption (MPA) have attracted much interest. As compared with low&#8208;order MPA processes, the construction of high&#8208;order MPA processes is highly desirable and rather attractive, yet remains a formidable challenge due to its inherent low transition probability. We report the observation of the first experimental frequency&#8208;upconverted fluorescence and stimulated emission by simultaneous six&#8208;photon excitation in an organic molecular system. The well&#8208;designed organic conjugated system based on cross&#8208;shaped spiro&#8208;fused ladder&#8208;type oligo(p&#8208;phenylene)s (SpL&#8722;z, z=1&#8211;3) manifests reasonably high MPA cross&#8208;sections and brilliant luminescence emission simultaneously. The six&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section of SpL&#8208;3 with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation was evaluated as 8.67&#215;10&#8722;169&#8197;cm12&#8201;s5&#8201;photon&#8722;5. Exceptionally efficient 2&#8208; to 6&#8208;photon excited stimulated emission was achieved under near&#8208;infrared laser excitation.

         <title>Efficient Amino&#8208;Sulfhydryl Stapling on Peptides and Proteins Using Bifunctional NHS&#8208;Activated Acrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Michael acceptors and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide activated esters stand among the most used reagents in the peptide functionalization toolbox. These two types of functional groups are merged in NHS&#8208;activated acrylamide reagents for efficient chemoselective amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling on native peptides and proteins. This is a versatile strategy for orthogonal dual&#8208;modification and late&#8208;stage design of functional bioconjugates.







Abstract
Widely used reagents in the peptide functionalization toolbox, Michael acceptors and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activated esters, are combined in NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides for efficient chemoselective amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling on native peptides and proteins. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides allow for a fast functionalization of N&#8208;terminal cysteines (k2=1.54&#177;0.18&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) under dilute aqueous conditions, enabling selectivity over other nucleophilic amino acids. Additionally, the versatility of these new bioconjugation handles was demonstrated in the cross&#8208;linking of in&#8208;chain or C&#8208;terminal cysteines with nearby lysine residues. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides are compatible with the use of other cysteine selective reagents, allowing for orthogonal dual&#8208;modifications. This strategy was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides and proteins with a PEG unit, fluorescent probe, and cytotoxic agent. The level of molecular control offered by NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides is expected to promote amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling technology as a powerful strategy to design functional bioconjugates.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Pot Template Reaction Towards a Manganese&#8208;Based T1 Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a single&#8208;pot template synthesis strategy for a manganese&#8208;based MRI contrast agent, MnLMe. MnLMe is highly inert toward zinc&#8208;transmetallation and displays enhanced T1 relaxivity upon non&#8208;covalent interaction with serum albumin. In&#8197;vivo studies show higher contrast enhancement in the liver and longer blood half&#8208;life than that of the commercially available contrast agent Magnevist. MnLMe shows great potential for use as a blood pool agent.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based contrast agents (MnCAs) have emerged as suitable alternatives to gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GdCAs). However, due to their kinetic lability and laborious synthetic procedures, only a few MnCAs have found clinical MRI application. In this work, we have employed a highly innovative single&#8208;pot template synthetic strategy to develop a MnCA, MnLMe, and studied the most important physicochemical properties in&#8197;vitro. MnLMe displays optimized r1 relaxivities at both medium (20 and 64&#8197;MHz) and high magnetic fields (300 and 400&#8197;MHz) and an enhanced r1b=21.1&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (20&#8197;MHz, 298&#8197;K, pH&#8197;7.4) upon binding to BSA (Ka=4.2&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1). In&#8197;vivo studies show that MnLMe is cleared intact into the bladder through renal excretion and has a prolonged blood half&#8208;life compared to the commercial GdCA Magnevist. MnLMe shows great promise as a novel MRI contrast agent.

A fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated and conductive 2D metallophthalocyanine framework with cobalt tetraaza[14]annulene linkages (see structure) exhibited high electrical conductivity of up to 0.52&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 and a high carrier mobility of 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8201;s&#8722;1. Thin films of the material with thicknesses of 100&#8211;1000&#8197;nm functioned as efficient chemiresistors and displayed high sensitivity and selectivity towards gases at low concentrations.







Abstract
The poor electrical conductivity of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystalline frameworks greatly limits their utilization in optoelectronics and sensor technology. Herein, we describe a conductive metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based NiPc&#8208;CoTAA framework with cobalt(II) tetraaza[14]annulene linkages. The high conjugation across the whole network combined with densely stacked metallophthalocyanine units endows this material with high electrical conductivity, which can be greatly enhanced by doping with iodine. The NiPc&#8208;CoTAA framework was also fabricated as thin films with different thicknesses from 100 to 1000&#8197;nm by the steam&#8208;assisted conversion method. These films enabled the detection of low&#8208;concentration gases and exhibited remarkable sensitivity and stability. This study indicates the enormous potential of metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based conductive frameworks in advanced stand&#8208;off chemical sensors and provides a general strategy through tailor&#8208;make molecular design to develop sensitive and stable chemical sensors for the detection of low&#8208;concentration gases.

         <title>Hierarchical Metal&#8211;Polymer Hybrids for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8211;polymer hybrids constructed from various metals and different polymers showed outstanding performance for the electroreduction of CO2 with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. The 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes were found to be critical for high performance.







Abstract
The design of catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability is key to the electroreduction of CO2. Herein, we report the synthesis of 3D hierarchical metal/polymer&#8211;carbon paper (M/polymer&#8208;CP) electrodes by in situ electrosynthesis. The 3D polymer layer on CP (polymer&#8208;CP) was first prepared by in situ electropolymerization, then a 3D metal layer was decorated on the polymer&#8208;CP to produce the M/polymer&#8208;CP electrode. Electrodes with different metals (e.g. Cu, Pd, Zn, Sn) and various polymers could be prepared by this method. The electrodes could efficiently reduce CO2 to desired products, such as C2H4, CO, and HCOOH, depending on the metal used. For example, C2H4 could be formed with a Faradaic efficiency of 59.4&#8201;% and a current density of 30.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 by using a very stable Cu/PANI&#8208;CP electrode in an H&#8208;type cell. Control experiments and theoretical calculations showed that the 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes are critical for the excellent performance.

         <title>Preparation of a Multicarbazole&#8208;Based Nanocapsule Capable of Largely Modulating Guest Spectroscopic Properties in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels was formed from bent carbazole&#8208;based amphiphiles in water. The capsule displayed enhanced emissivity, improved electrochemical stability, and unique host abilities toward substituted dyes. Notably, a highly blue&#8208;shifted absorption band from twisted coumarin dyes and two absorption bands from boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dimers stacked in an unusual L&#8208;shaped fashion were observed in the cavity.







Abstract
A nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels (ca. 12 panels) was quantitatively generated from bent carbazole&#8208;based amphiphiles in water. Unlike previously reported macrocycles and coordination cages bearing several carbazole panels, the resultant nanocapsule displays enhanced emissivity and improved electrochemical stability as compared with the monomeric amphiphile. The spectroscopic properties of substituted coumarin and boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dyes can be modulated upon encapsulation by the nanocapsule in water. In the cavity, a highly blue&#8208;shifted absorption band is observed from largely twisted coumarin dyes and two absorption bands are found from boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dimers stacked in an unusual L&#8208;shaped fashion. Moreover, the encapsulated dimers exhibit unique excimer&#8208;like emission.

         <title>Tunable Hydrophobicity via Dimensionally Confined Polymerization of Organometallic Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By restricting polymerization in the native pores of pre&#8208;packed undercooled particles, organometallic adducts were autonomously generated on either flat&#8208; or pre&#8208;textured particle beds. These adducts&#8217; fine structures successfully turned the Wenzel wetting state of metal rose into the Cassie state of composite lotus.







Abstract
Fabrication of tunable fine textures on solid metal surfaces often demands sophisticated reaction/processing systems. By exploiting in&#8197;situ polymerization and self&#8208;assembly of inorganic adducts derived from liquid metals (the so&#8208;called HetMet reaction) with concomitant solidification, solid metal films with tunable texture are readily fabricated. Serving as a natural dimensional confinement, interparticle pores and capillary&#8208;adhered thin liquid films in a pre&#8208;packed bed of undercooled liquid metal particles lead to the expeditious surface accumulation of organometallic synthons, which readily oligomerize and self&#8208;assemble into concentration&#8208;dictated morphologies/patterns. Tuning particle size, particle packing (flat or textured), and reactant concentration generates diverse, autonomously organized organometallic structures on a metal particle bed. Concomitant solidification and sintering of the underlying undercooled particle bed led to a multiscale patterned solid metal surface. The process is illustrated by creating tunable features on pre&#8208;organized metal particle beds with concomitant tunable wettability as illustrated through the so&#8208;called petal and lotus effects.

         <title>Ag44(EBT)26(TPP)4 Nanoclusters With Tailored Molecular and Electronic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9038-9044, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the synthesis and total structure determination of a novel Ag44(EBT)26(TPP)4 nanocluster, the first analogue of [Ag44(SR)30]4&#8722;, are reported. The identical size as well as similar core&#8208; and different surface&#8208;structures of these two nanoclusters enable the study of the structural effect on the optical and photophysical properties. The novel surface structure plays a crucial role in the enhancement of NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence.







Abstract
Although atomically precise metalloid nanoclusters (NCs) of identical size with distinctly different molecular structures are highly desirable to understand the structural effects on the optical and photophysical properties, their synthesis remains highly challenging. Herein, we employed phosphine and thiol capping ligands featuring appropriate steric effects and synthesized a charge&#8208;neutral Ag NC with the formula Ag44(EBT)26(TPP)4 (EBT: 2&#8208;ethylbenzenethiolate; TPP: triphenylphosphine). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals that this NC has a hollow metal core of Ag12@Ag20 and a metal&#8211;ligand shell of Ag12(EBT)26(TPP)4. The presence of mixed ligands and long V&#8208;shaped metal&#8211;ligand motifs on this NC has resulted in an enhancement of the NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence quantum yield by &gt;25&#8208;fold compared to an all&#8208;thiolate&#8208;stabilized anionic [Ag44(SR)30]4&#8722; NC (SR: thiolate). Time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional calculations show that our Ag44 NC is an 18&#8208;electron superatom with a modulated electronic structure as compared to the [Ag44(SR)30]4&#8722; anion, significantly influencing its optical properties.

         <title>A Solid&#8208;State Intramolecular Wittig Reaction Enables Efficient Synthesis of Endofullerenes Including Ne@C60, 3He@C60, and HD@C60</title>

Solid&#8208;state filling of a stable phosphorus ylid open&#8208;cage fullerene is followed by heating, inducing an in&#8197;situ intramolecular Wittig reaction to reduce the size of the cage opening and trapping a single gas atom or molecule inside. Expensive gases can be compressed to high pressure, leading to high incorporation of the endohedral species. Cage closure steps allow preparation of gram&#8208;scale endohedral fullerenes including 3He@C60, HD@C60, and Ne@C60.







Abstract
An open&#8208;cage fullerene incorporating phosphorous ylid and carbonyl group moieties on the rim of the orifice can be filled with gases (H2, He, Ne) in the solid state, and the cage opening then contracted in&#8197;situ by raising the temperature to complete an intramolecular Wittig reaction, trapping the atom or molecule inside. Known transformations complete conversion of the product fullerene to C60 containing the endohedral species. As well as providing an improved synthesis of large quantities of 4He@C60, H2@C60, and D2@C60, the method allows the efficient incorporation of expensive gases such as HD and 3He, to prepare HD@C60 and 3He@C60. The method also enables the first synthesis of Ne@C60 by molecular surgery, and its characterization by crystallography and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;sorting of Giant Cubic [8+12] Salicylimine Cage Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8896-8904, April 12, 2021. </description>

Highly selective chiral self&#8208;sorting. The chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds was investigated, revealing a high selectivity for the most symmetric cage compounds, for which an explanation is presented. The properties of the isolated enantiopure and meso cage compounds were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas sorption measurements showing high porosities and selectivities.







Abstract
Chiral self&#8208;sorting is intricately connected to the complicated chiral processes observed in nature and no artificial systems of comparably complexity have been generated by chemists. However, only a few examples of purely organic molecules have been reported so far, where the self&#8208;sorting process could be controlled. Herein, we describe the chiral self&#8208;sorting of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds based on a chiral TBTQ precursor. Out of 23 possible cage isomers only the enantiopure and a meso cage were observed to be formed, which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, by careful choice of solvent the formation of meso cage could be controlled. With internal diameters of din=3.3&#8211;3.5&#8197;nm these cages are among the largest organic cage compounds characterized and show very high specific surface areas up to approx. 1500&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 after desolvation.

         <title>Free&#8208;Radical Membrane Protein Footprinting by Photolysis of Perfluoroisopropyl Iodide Partitioned to Detergent Micelle by Sonication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8867-8873, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;mediated free&#8208;radical footprinting of an integral membrane protein (IMP) is described. Compared to canonical footprinting, the approach exploits tip sonication to ensure efficient transport of a highly hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl iodide to footprint transmembrane domains. This approach, which is amenable to native IMP structures, yields 100&#8201;% coverage for tyrosine, and it is compatible with standard proteomic mass spectrometric analysis.







Abstract
A free&#8208;radical footprinting approach is described for integral membrane protein (IMP) that extends, significantly, the &#8220;fast photochemical oxidation of proteins&#8221; (FPOP) platform. This new approach exploits highly hydrophobic perfluoroisopropyl iodide (PFIPI) together with tip sonication to ensure efficient transport into the micelle interior, allowing laser dissociation and footprinting of the transmembrane domains. In contrast to water soluble footprinters, PFIPI footprints both the hydrophobic intramembrane and the hydrophilic extramembrane domains of the IMP vitamin&#8197;K epoxide reductase (VKOR). The footprinting is fast, giving high coverage for Tyr (100&#8201;%) and Trp. The incorporation of the reagent with sonication does not significantly affect VKOR's enzymatic function, and tyrosine iodination does not compromise protease digestion and the subsequent analysis. The locations for the modifications are largely consistent with the corresponding solvent accessibilities, recommending this approach for future membrane protein footprinting.

         <title>Surface Functionalization of Black Phosphorus with Nitrenes: Identification of P=N Bonds by Using Isotopic Labeling</title>

A mild, surface&#8208;specific method for the surface functionalization of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets is developed using a family of photolytically generated nitrenes (RN) from the corresponding azides. By embedding spectroscopic tags in the organic backbone, a multitude of techniques can be used to investigate the chemical structure of the modified nanosheets.







Abstract
Surface functionalization of two&#8208;dimensional crystals is a key path to tuning their intrinsic physical and chemical properties. However, synthetic protocols and experimental strategies to directly probe chemical bonding in modified surfaces are scarce. Introduced herein is a mild, surface&#8208;specific protocol for the surface functionalization of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets using a family of photolytically generated nitrenes (RN) from the corresponding azides. By embedding spectroscopic tags in the organic backbone, a multitude of characterization techniques are employed to investigate in detail the chemical structure of the modified nanosheets, including vibrational, X&#8208;ray photoelectron, solid state 31P&#8197;NMR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. To directly probe the functional groups introduced on the surface, R fragments were selected such that in conjunction with vibrational spectroscopy, 15N&#8208;labeling experiments, and DFT methods, diagnostic P=N vibrational modes indicative of iminophosphorane units on the nanosheet surface could be conclusively identified.

         <title>Robust Biological Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Post&#8208;Functionalized Rhenium(I) Sites for Efficient Heterogeneous Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>

A robust porous biological HOF with bpy docking groups has been designed, prepared, and post&#8208;modified to precisely load Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl as molecular catalyst on the basis of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking metal&#8208;free G&#8208;quadruplex moieties. With the help of the sensitizer, the post&#8208;functionalized HOF promotes efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in a heterogeneous system under the visible&#8208;light irradation.







Abstract
A robust 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;derived biological hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HOF&#8208;25) has been realized depending on guanine&#8208;quadruplex with the assistance of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which reacts with Re(CO)5Cl to give a post&#8208;functionalized HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic study on HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re confirms the covalent attachment of Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl segments to this HOF. Robust and recycled HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re bearing photocatalytic Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl centers displays good heterogeneous catalytic activity towards carbon dioxide photoreduction in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 and triisopropanolamine in CH3CN under visible&#8208;light irradiation, with both high CO production rate of 1448&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of 93&#8201;%. Under the same conditions, the experimental turnover number of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re (50) is about 8 times as that of the homogeneous control Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl. The sustainably regenerated HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re via crystallization and post&#8208;modification processes shows recovered photocatalytic performance.

&lt;p&gt;A robust porous biological HOF with bpy docking groups has been designed, prepared, and post&#8208;modified to precisely load Re(bpy)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl as molecular catalyst on the basis of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking metal&#8208;free G&#8208;quadruplex moieties. With the help of the sensitizer, the post&#8208;functionalized HOF promotes efficient and selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in a heterogeneous system under the visible&#8208;light irradation.

         <title>&#8220;NAD&#8208;display&#8221;: Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput in Vitro Screening of NAD(H) Dehydrogenases Using Bead Display and Flow Cytometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9015-9021, April 12, 2021. </description>

A detection system was devised to screen dehydrogenase enzymes (DH) at ultrahigh&#8208;throughput in in vitro droplet compartments. An NAD(H) analogue and a DH DNA library were co&#8208;immobilised on beads. Water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets containing cell&#8208;free expression mix and substrate allow compartmentalised protein production and catalysis. A fluorescent sensor of NAD(H) redox state was loaded onto beads, allowing bulk sorting of 2&#215;104 DH variants in a day by flow cytometry.







Abstract
NAD(H)&#8208;utiliing enzymes have been the subject of directed evolution campaigns to improve their function. To enable access to a larger swath of sequence space, we demonstrate the utility of a cell&#8208;free, ultrahigh&#8208;throughput directed evolution platform for dehydrogenases. Microbeads (1.5 million per sample) carrying both variant DNA and an immobilised analogue of NAD+ were compartmentalised in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets, together with cell&#8208;free expression mixture and enzyme substrate, resulting in the recording of the phenotype on each bead. The beads&#8217; phenotype could be read out and sorted for on a flow cytometer by using a highly sensitive fluorescent protein&#8208;based sensor of the NAD+:NADH ratio. Integration of this &#8220;NAD&#8208;display&#8221; approach with our previously described Split &amp; Mix (SpliMLiB) method for generating large site&#8208;saturation libraries allowed straightforward screening of fully balanced site saturation libraries of formate dehydrogenase, with diversities of 2&#215;104. Based on modular design principles of synthetic biology NAD&#8208;display offers access to sophisticated in vitro selections, avoiding complex technology platforms.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Cages with Missing Linker Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9099-9105, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahedral and hexahedral coordination cages with one or two missing linkers, as well as regular trigonal prismatic cages, are synthesized by employing steric hindrance of organic linkers to manipulate coordination modes of lanthanide(III) ions. The defective cages, especially the hexahedral cage, are conformationally flexible and adapt its structure to accommodate various guest molecules with sizes comparable or much larger than the cavity portals that are not accessible to the non&#8208;defective cage.







Abstract
We present here the controlled synthesis of defective coordination cages by employing steric hindrance of organic linkers to manipulate coordination modes of the assembled metal ions. Three chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) derived bis&#8208;tridentate ligands L1&#8211;L3 with pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamides (pcam) chelating moieties are therefore designed and synthesized, among which L3 has a smaller steric hindrance on the coordinating sites relative to the other two linkers. Complexes of L1 and L2 with lanthanides afford the irregular Ln8(L1)10 hexahedra with two missing edges and Ln4(L2)5 tetrahedra with one missing edge, respectively, both of which contain a 1:1 mixture of Ln(pcam)2 and Ln(pcam)3. In contrast, complex of L3 produces the regular twisted Ln6(L3)9 trigonal prisms without missing edges that contain only Ln(pcam)3 vertices. The defective cage has more freedom to adjust its structural conformation, affording adaptable cavity to accommodate a range of guest molecules with sizes comparable or much larger than the cavity portals.

         <title>High&#8208;Silica CHA Zeolite Membrane with Ultra&#8208;High Selectivity and Irradiation Stability for Krypton/Xenon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9032-9037, April 12, 2021. </description>

High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes show ultra&#8208;high Kr/Xe selectivity and superior hydrothermal stability. Together with their irradiation stability, high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes can pave the way to enrich radioactive 85Kr from xenon for a notable decrease in the volatile nuclear waste volume.







Abstract
Capture and storage of the long&#8208;lived 85Kr is an efficient approach to mitigate the emission of volatile radionuclides from the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities. However, it is challenging to separate krypton (Kr) from xenon (Xe) because of the chemical inertness and similar physical properties. Herein we prepared high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes with ultra&#8208;high selectivity and irradiation stability for Kr/Xe separation. The suitable aperture size and rigid framework endures the membrane a strong size&#8208;exclusion effect. The ultrahigh selectivity of 51&#8211;152 together with the Kr permeance of 0.7&#8211;1.3&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 of high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes far surpass the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric membranes. The membrane is among the most stable polycrystalline membranes for separation of humid Kr/Xe mixtures. Together with the excellent irradiation stability, high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes pave the way to separate radioactive Kr from Xe for a notable reduction of the volatile nuclear waste storage volume.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8938-8947, April 12, 2021. </description>

Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death and holds promise for tumor inhibition. However, it is difficult to remotely control the initiation and execution of ferroptosis in specific sites. This study reports a biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymeric nanoplatform for tumor&#8208;targeted ferroptosis therapy, of which the pro&#8208;ferroptotic activities could be activated in an on&#8208;demand manner using near&#8208;infrared light as the triggering signal.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death that shows promise for tumor treatment. Most current ferroptosis tumor therapies are based on the intrinsic pathological features of the malignancies, and it would be of clinical significance to develop ferroptosis&#8208;inducing strategies with improved tumor specificity and modulability. Here we report a polydopamine&#8208;based nanoplatform (FeIIPDA@LAP&#8208;PEG&#8208;cRGD) for the efficient loading of Fe2+ and &#946;&#8208;lapachone (LAP), which could readily initiate ferroptosis in tumor cells upon treatment with near&#8208;infrared light. PDA nanostructures could generate mild hyperthermia under NIR irritation and trigger the release of the ferroptosis&#8208;inducing Fe2+ ions. The NIR&#8208;actuated photothermal effect would also activate cellular heat shock response and upregulate the downstream NQO1 via HSP70/NQO1 axis to facilitate bioreduction of the concurrently released &#946;&#8208;lapachone and enhance intracellular H2O2 formation to promote the Fe2+&#8208;mediated lipid peroxidation.

         <title>Activation of Pyroptosis by Membrane&#8208;Anchoring AIE Photosensitizer Design: New Prospect for Photodynamic Cancer Cell Ablation</title>

Membrane anchoring photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics were designed for cancer cell ablation via photo&#8208;activated pyroptosis.







Abstract
Pyroptosis as a lytic and inflammatory form of cell death is a powerful tool to fight against cancer. However, pyroptosis is usually activated by chemotherapeutic drugs, which limits its anti&#8208;tumor applications due to drug resistance and severe side effects. Herein, we demonstrate that membrane targeting photosensitizers can induce pyroptosis for cancer cell ablation with noninvasiveness and low side effects. A series of membrane anchoring photosensitizers (TBD&#8208;R PSs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics were prepared through conjugation of TBD and phenyl ring with cationic chains. Upon light irradiation, cytotoxic ROS were produced in situ, resulting in direct membrane damage and superior cancer cell ablation. Detailed study revealed that pyroptosis gradually became the dominant cell death pathway along with the increase of TBD&#8208;R PSs membrane anchoring capability. This study offers a photo&#8208;activated pyroptosis&#8208;based intervention strategy for cancer cell ablation.

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Tuning Electron Distribution of Single&#8208;Atomic Iron Sites</title>

A single iron atom catalyst composed of atomically&#8208;dispersed iron sites anchored on a N,O&#8208;doped carbon matrix with an inverse opal structure is developed to accelerate nitrogen reduction reaction kinetics for efficient conversion of N2 into NH3.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) plays a vital role for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, the NRR kinetics is still limited by the sluggish hydrogenation process on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a hybrid catalyst with atomic iron sites anchored on a N,O&#8208;doped porous carbon (FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C) matrix of an inverse opal structure, leading to a remarkably high NH3 yield rate of 31.9&#8197;&#956;g
&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and Faradaic efficiency of 11.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V for NRR electrocatalysis, outperformed almost all previously reported atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the observed high NRR catalytic activity for the FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C catalyst stemmed mainly from the optimized charge&#8208;transfer between the adjacent O and Fe atoms homogenously distributed on the porous carbon support, which could not only significantly facilitate the transportation of N2 and ions but also effectively decrease the binding energy between the isolated Fe atom and *N2 intermediate and the thermodynamic Gibbs free energy of the rate&#8208;determining step (*N2 &#8594; *NNH).

         <title>One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8851-8858, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calbistrin biosynthesis involves an unusual dual&#8208;functional polyketide synthase CalA, which synthesizes both of the two structurally distinct moieties of calbistrins. The product divergence is intriguingly controlled by two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and a trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, to yield the decalin and polyene portions, respectively.







Abstract
Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin&#8197;A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin&#8197;A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and the trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD. Our study has uncovered a novel dual&#8208;functional PKS and thus broadened our understanding of how fungi synthesize diverse polyketide natural products.

         <title>Fe/Fe3C Boosts H2O2 Utilization for Methane Conversion Overwhelming O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8889-8895, April 12, 2021. </description>

In a heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type FeNx/C catalyst, Fe&#8208;Nx sites and graphene&#8208;encapsulated Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles promote the efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2 for the highly selective oxidation of methane to formic acid. The reaction mechanism at the active sites has been studied.







Abstract
H2O2 as a well&#8208;known efficient oxidant is widely used in the chemical industry mainly because of its homolytic cleavage into .OH (stronger oxidant), but this reaction always competes with O2 generation resulting in H2O2 waste. Here, we fabricate heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type Fe&#8208;based catalysts containing Fe&#8208;Nx sites and Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles as a model to study this competition. Fe&#8208;Nx in the low spin state provides the active site for .OH generation. Fe/Fe3C, in particular Fe3C, promotes Fe&#8208;Nx sites for the homolytic cleavages of H2O2 into .OH, but Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe0 as the main component) with more electrons are prone to the undesired O2 generation. With a catalyst benefiting from finely tuned active sites, 18&#8201;% conversion rate for the selective oxidation of methane was achieved with about 96&#8201;% selectivity for liquid oxygenates (formic acid selectivity over 90&#8201;%). Importantly, O2 generation was suppressed 68&#8201;%. This work provides guidance for the efficient utilization of H2O2 in the chemical industry.

&lt;/sub&gt; sites and Fe/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C nanoparticles as a model to study this competition. Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; in the low spin state provides the active site for &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH generation. Fe/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C, in particular Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C, promotes Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; sites for the homolytic cleavages of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH, but Fe/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C nanoparticles (Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as the main component) with more electrons are prone to the undesired O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation. With a catalyst benefiting from finely tuned active sites, 18&#8201;% conversion rate for the selective oxidation of methane was achieved with about 96&#8201;% selectivity for liquid oxygenates (formic acid selectivity over 90&#8201;%). Importantly, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation was suppressed 68&#8201;%. This work provides guidance for the efficient utilization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the chemical industry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unveiling the Photoinduced Electron&#8208;Donating Character of MoS2 in Covalently Linked Hybrids Featuring Perylenediimide</title>

The well&#8208;known electron acceptor perylenediimide (PDI) is covalently attached to semiconducting MoS2, thus exposing the MoS2 material's electron donating potential in the novel MoS2&#8211;PDI hybrid.







Abstract
The covalent functionalization of MoS2 with a perylenediimide (PDI) is reported and the study is accompanied by detailed characterization of the newly prepared MoS2&#8208;PDI hybrid material. Covalently functionalized MoS2 interfacing organic photoactive species has shown electron and/or energy accepting, energy reflecting or bi&#8208;directional electron accepting features. Herein, a rationally designed PDI, unsubstituted at the perylene core to act as electron acceptor, forces MoS2 to fully demonstrate for the first time its electron donor capabilities. The photophysical response of MoS2&#8208;PDI is visualized in an energy&#8208;level diagram, while femtosecond transient absorption studies disclose the formation of MoS2.+&#8208;PDI.&#8722; charge separated state. The tunable electronic properties of MoS2, as a result of covalently linking photoactive organic species with precise characteristics, unlock their potentiality and enable their application in light&#8208;harvesting and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Two Cryptic Self&#8208;Resistance Mechanisms in Streptomyces tenebrarius Reveal Insights into the Biosynthesis of Apramycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8990-8996, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cryptic self&#8208;resistance mechanisms involving C&#8208;5 phosphorylation and N&#8208;7&#8242; acetylation were discovered in Streptomyces tenebrarius to avoid auto&#8208;toxicity during apramycin biosynthesis. Characterization of the corresponding enzymes revealed the apramycin's assembly line at the pseudotrisaccharide stage.







Abstract
Apramycin is a clinically promising aminoglycoside antibiotic (AGA). To date, mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis and self&#8208;resistance of apramycin remain largely unknown. Here we report that apramycin biosynthesis proceeds through unexpected phosphorylation, deacetylation, and dephosphorylation steps, in which a novel aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (AprU), a putative creatinine amidohydrolase (AprP), and an alkaline phosphatase (AprZ) are involved. Biochemical characterization revealed that AprU specifically phosphorylates 5&#8208;OH of a pseudotrisaccharide intermediate, whose N&#8208;7&#8242; acetyl group is subsequently hydrolyzed by AprP. AprZ is located extracellularly where it removes the phosphate group from a pseudotetrasaccharide intermediate, leading to the maturation of apramycin. Intriguingly, 7&#8242;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylated and 5&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated apramycin that were accumulated in &#916;aprU and &#916;aprZ respectively exhibited significantly reduced antibacterial activities, implying Streptomyces tenebrarius employs C&#8208;5 phosphorylation and N&#8208;7&#8242; acetylation as two strategies to avoid auto&#8208;toxicity. Significantly, this study provides insight into the design of new generation AGAs to circumvent the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.

         <title>Unified Approach to Furan Natural Products via Phosphine&#8208;Palladium Catalysis</title>

Highly substituted polyalkyl furans can be synthesized using sequential Michael&#8211;Heck reactions between functionalized (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;halo allylic alcohols and activated alkynes. This method provides facile access to tetraalkyl furans containing a C2&#8208;carboxyalkyl chain, which is readily functionalized to enable the total syntheses of several classes of bioactive furans, including furanoterpenes, polyketides, and furan fatty acids.







Abstract
Polyalkyl furans are widespread in nature, often performing important biological roles. Despite a plethora of methods for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted furans, the construction of tetraalkyl furans remains non&#8208;trivial. The prevalence of alkyl groups in bioactive furan natural products, combined with the desirable bioactivities of tetraalkyl furans, calls for a general synthetic protocol for polyalkyl furans. This paper describes a Michael&#8211;Heck approach, using sequential phosphine&#8208;palladium catalysis, for the preparation of various polyalkyl furans from readily available precursors. The versatility of this method is illustrated by the total syntheses of nine distinct polyalkylated furan natural products belonging to different classes, namely the furanoterpenes rosefuran, sesquirosefuran, and mikanifuran; the marine natural products plakorsins&#8197;A, B, and D and plakorsin&#8197;D methyl ester; and the furan fatty acids 3D5 and hydromumiamicin.

Rapid RAFT 3D Printing: Photoinduced RAFT polymerization is applied to 3D printing, resulting in rapid prints with a broad window of operation. High resolution surface patterning from the 3D printed objects is readily achieved by reactivation of dormant RAFT functionalities in the polymeric material.







Abstract
RAFT facilitated digital light projection 3D printing of polymeric materials provides a convenient and facile route for inducing post&#8208;fabrication transformations via reactivation of dormant chain transfer agents. In this work, we report the use of a Norrish type I photoinitiator in conjunction with a RAFT agent to produce a variety of open&#8208;air 3D printable resins that rapidly cure under visible light irradiation. The photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT system polymerizes extremely quickly and provides high 3D printing build rates of up to 9.1&#8197;cm&#8201;h&#8722;1, representing a 7&#8208;fold increase compared to previous RAFT mediated 3D printing systems. 3D printed materials containing thiocarbonylthio groups can be also produced using low concentrations of divinyl comonomers in the initial resins, which has not been successfully achieved using other photocontrolled RAFT polymerization techniques. Interestingly, the inclusion of RAFT agents significantly improves 3D printing resolution compared to formulations without RAFT agent, allowing the fabrication of intricate and complex objects. Spatiotemporally controlled surface modifications of the 3D printed objects from the dormant RAFT agent groups on the material surfaces were also performed under one and two&#8208;pass configurations, inducing multiple successive post&#8208;printing transformations on the same object.

         <title>Stabilization of Polynitrogen Anions in Tantalum&#8211;Nitrogen Compounds at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9003-9008, April 12, 2021. </description>

Direct reaction between nitrogen and tantalum at approximately 100&#8197;GPa results in the energetic nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds TaN4 and TaN5, which feature N4 chains and unprecedented branched single&#8208;bonded polymeric nitrogen chains in the crystal structures, respectively. TaN5 possesses an extraordinary volumetric energy density of 18&#8197;kJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, exceeding well&#8208;known high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.







Abstract
The synthesis of polynitrogen compounds is of great importance due to their potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials (HEDM), but because of the intrinsic instability of these compounds, their synthesis and stabilization is a fundamental challenge. Polymeric nitrogen units which may be stabilized in compounds with metals at high pressure are now restricted to non&#8208;branched chains with an average N&#8722;N bond order of 1.25, limiting their HEDM performances. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a novel polynitrogen compound TaN5 via a direct reaction between tantalum and nitrogen in a diamond anvil cell at circa 100&#8197;GPa. TaN5 is the first example of a material containing branched all&#8208;single&#8208;bonded nitrogen chains [N55&#8722;]&#8734;. Apart from that we discover two novel Ta&#8211;N compounds: TaN4 with finite N44&#8722; chains and the incommensurately modulated compound TaN2&#8722;x, which is recoverable at ambient conditions.

         <title>Selectively Upgrading Lignin Derivatives to Carboxylates through Electrochemical Oxidative C(OH)&#8722;C Bond Cleavage by a Mn&#8208;Doped Cobalt Oxyhydroxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8976-8982, April 12, 2021. </description>

An electrochemical strategy has been developed for the oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C bonds using a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide catalyst under mild conditions. Preliminary studies demonstrate its application in upgrading lignin&#8208;derived products with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, electrorefining them into valuable oxygenates, such as benzoate and adipate.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C bonds to afford carboxylates is of significant importance for the petrochemical industry and biomass valorization. Here we report an efficient electrochemical strategy for the selective upgrading of lignin derivatives to carboxylates by a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide (MnCoOOH) catalyst. A wide range of lignin&#8208;derived substrates with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C units undergo efficient cleavage to corresponding carboxylates in excellent yields (80&#8211;99&#8201;%) and operational stability (200&#8197;h). Detailed investigations reveal a tandem oxidation mechanism that base from the electrolyte converts secondary alcohols and their derived ketones to reactive nucleophiles, which are oxidized by electrophilic oxygen species on MnCoOOH from water. As proof of concept, this approach was applied to upgrade lignin derivatives with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, achieving convergent transformation of lignin&#8208;derived mixtures to benzoate and KA oil to adipate with 91.5&#8201;% and 64.2&#8201;% yields, respectively.

         <title>Enhanced Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production by Self&#8208;Photosensitized Biohybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9055-9062, April 12, 2021. </description>

Novel biohybrid systems are created for light&#8208;driven H2 production by using non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms self&#8208;photosensitized with CdS nanoparticles. An outstanding biohybrid system using D. desulfuricans displays high H2 production activity, high stability and a remarkable solar efficiency.







Abstract
Storage of solar energy as hydrogen provides a platform towards decarbonizing our economy. One emerging strategy for the production of solar fuels is to use photocatalytic biohybrid systems that combine the high catalytic activity of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms with the high light&#8208;harvesting efficiency of metal semiconductor nanoparticles. However, few such systems have been tested for H2 production. We investigated light&#8208;driven H2 production by three novel organisms, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Citrobacter freundii, and Shewanella oneidensis, self&#8208;photosensitized with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, and compared their performance to Escherichia coli. All biohybrid systems produced H2 from light, with D. desulfuricans&#8208;CdS demonstrating the best activity overall and outperforming the other microbial systems even in the absence of a mediator. With this system, H2 was continuously produced for more than 10&#8197;days with a specific rate of 36&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gdcw&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. High apparent quantum yields of 23&#8201;% and 4&#8201;% were obtained, with and without methyl viologen, respectively, exceeding values previously reported.

         <title>Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity at Room Temperature in Cu4TiSe4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9106-9113, April 12, 2021. </description>

Cu4TiSe4 is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics.







Abstract
Ultralow thermal conductivity draws great attention in a variety of fields of applications such as thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Herein, the crystal structure and transport properties of Cu4TiSe4 are reported. Cu4TiSe4 is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics. This ultralow value of lattice thermal conductivity (kL) can be attributed to the presence of the localized modes of Cu, which partially hybridize with the Se atoms, which in turn leads to avoidance of crossing of acoustic phonon modes that reach the zone boundary with a reduced frequency. Like a phonon glass electron crystal, Cu4TiSe4 could also open a route to efficient thermoelectric materials, even, with chalcogenides of relatively high electrical resistivity and a large band gap, provided that their structures offer a sublattice with lightly bound cations.

         <title>Platinum Dissolution in Realistic Fuel Cell Catalyst Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8882-8888, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8197;situ technique is presented that closes the gap between catalyst degradation studies in real devices and fundamental electrochemical analyses. The method involves direct measurement of platinum dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and through Nafion membranes. The impact of catalyst loading and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface on platinum dissolution, as well as transport behavior of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes, are investigated.







Abstract
Pt dissolution has already been intensively studied in aqueous model systems and many mechanistic insights have been gained. Nevertheless, transfer of new knowledge to real&#8208;world fuel cell systems is still a significant challenge. To close this gap, we present a novel in&#8197;situ method combining a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) half&#8208;cell with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). With this setup, Pt dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and the transport of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes were evaluated directly. We observed that 1)&#8197;specific Pt dissolution increased significantly with decreasing Pt loading, 2)&#8197;in comparison to experiments on aqueous model systems with flow cells, the measured dissolution in GDE experiments was considerably lower, and 3)&#8197;by adding a membrane onto the catalyst layer, Pt dissolution was reduced even further. All these phenomena are attributed to the varying mass transport conditions of dissolved Pt species, influencing re&#8208;deposition and equilibrium potential.

     alt="Platinum Dissolution in Realistic Fuel Cell Catalyst Layers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An in&#8197;situ technique is presented that closes the gap between catalyst degradation studies in real devices and fundamental electrochemical analyses. The method involves direct measurement of platinum dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and through Nafion membranes. The impact of catalyst loading and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface on platinum dissolution, as well as transport behavior of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes, are investigated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pt dissolution has already been intensively studied in aqueous model systems and many mechanistic insights have been gained. Nevertheless, transfer of new knowledge to real&#8208;world fuel cell systems is still a significant challenge. To close this gap, we present a novel in&#8197;situ method combining a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) half&#8208;cell with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). With this setup, Pt dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and the transport of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes were evaluated directly. We observed that 1)&#8197;specific Pt dissolution increased significantly with decreasing Pt loading, 2)&#8197;in comparison to experiments on aqueous model systems with flow cells, the measured dissolution in GDE experiments was considerably lower, and 3)&#8197;by adding a membrane onto the catalyst layer, Pt dissolution was reduced even further. All these phenomena are attributed to the varying mass transport conditions of dissolved Pt species, influencing re&#8208;deposition and equilibrium potential.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cys&#8211;Cys and Cys&#8211;Lys Stapling of Unprotected Peptides Enabled by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9022-9031, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional hypervalent iodine reagents for two&#8208;component cysteine&#8208;cysteine and cysteine&#8208;lysine stapling are reported. Efficient and selective stapling on non&#8208;protected peptides was observed, and post&#8208;stapling modification could be easily achieved using reactive esters or cycloaddition on the thioalkynes formed on the cysteine residue. One stapled peptide displayed both enhanced helicity and binding to the MDM2 protein.







Abstract
Easy access to a wide range of structurally diverse stapled peptides is crucial for the development of inhibitors of protein&#8208;protein interactions. Herein, we report bis&#8208;functional hypervalent iodine reagents for two&#8208;component cysteine&#8208;cysteine and cysteine&#8208;lysine stapling yielding structurally diverse thioalkyne linkers. This stapling method works with unprotected natural amino acid residues and does not require pre&#8208;functionalization or metal catalysis. The products are stable to purification and isolation. Post&#8208;stapling modification can be accessed via amidation of an activated ester, or via cycloaddition onto the formed thioalkyne group. Increased helicity and binding affinity to MDM2 was obtained for a i,i+7 stapled peptide.

         <title>B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn Gas Diffusion Electrodes for CO2 Electroreduction to C2+&#8197;Products at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9135-9141, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B&#8208;Cu gas diffusion electrode (GDE) system was developed for highly selective CO2 conversion to C2+&#8197;products at high relevant current densities by mitigating the flooding problem and tuning the three&#8208;phase boundary. Anodic protection by sacrificial Zn&#8197;nanosheets remarkably improved the long&#8208;term stability for CO2 electroreduction at high current densities.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products has attracted considerable attention as it provides an avenue to high&#8208;density renewable energy storage. However, the selectivity and stability under high current densities are rarely reported. Herein, B&#8208;doped Cu (B&#8208;Cu) and B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) were developed for highly selective and stable CO2 conversion to C2+&#8197;products at industrially relevant current densities. The B&#8208;Cu GDE exhibited a high Faradaic efficiency of 79&#8201;% for C2+&#8197;products formation at a current density of &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a potential of &#8722;0.45&#8197;V vs. RHE. The long&#8208;term stability for C2+ formation was substantially improved by incorporating an optimal amount of Zn. Operando Raman spectra confirm the retained Cu+ species under CO2 reduction conditions and the lower overpotential for *OCO formation upon incorporation of Zn, which lead to the excellent conversion of CO2 to C2+ products on B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn GDEs.

         <title>Organelle&#8208;Specific Photoactivation of DNA Nanosensors for Precise Profiling of Subcellular Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8923-8931, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating organelle&#8208;specific targeting and NIR&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoactivation with DNA sensor technology, precise imaging of a specific enzyme in a chosen organelle (e.g., mitochondria or nucleus) was possible (see picture). The spatiotemporal control enabled imaging of enzyme translocation at subcellular resolution in response to oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Understanding of the functions of enzymes in diverse cellular processes is important, but the design of sensors with controllable localization for in situ imaging of subcellular levels of enzymatic activity is particularly challenging. We introduce herein a spatiotemporally controlled sensor technology that permits in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8197;1 (APE1) within an intracellular organelle of choice (e.g., mitochondria or nucleus). The hybrid sensor platform is constructed by photoactivatable engineering of a DNA&#8208;based fluorescent probe and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle and a specific organelle localization signal. Controlled localization and NIR&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoactivation of the sensor &#8220;on demand&#8221; effectively constrains the imaging signal to the organelle of interest, with improved subcellular resolution. We further demonstrate the application of the nanosensors for the imaging of subcellular APE1 translocation in response to oxidative stress in live cells.

         <title>(Aza)Acenes Share the C2 Bridge with (Anti)Aromatic Macrocycles: Local vs. Global Delocalization Paths</title>

Global switch for local effect: The linear fusion of (aza)acene and a redox switchable macrocycle (i.e. triphyrin(2.1.1)) gives a set of fused systems merging two &#960;&#8208;conjugated clouds. A competition between local and global effects can be distinguished as documented in spectroscopic properties with a domination of (aza)acene diatropic current obtained after a redox switching within the macrocyclic flank.







Abstract
A strong conjugation present in fused systems plays a crucial role in tuning of the properties that would be showing a dependence on the efficiency of &#960;&#8208;electrons coupling. The &#960;&#8208;cloud available in the final structure can be drastically influenced by a side&#8208; or a linear fusion of unsaturated and conjugated hydrocarbons. The linear welding of naphthalene/anthracene or quinoxaline/benzo[g]quinoxaline with triphyrin(2.1.1) gives structures where the competition between local and global delocalization is distinguished. The aromatic character observed in skeletons strongly depends on the oxidation state of the macrocyclic flanking and is either extended over the whole system or kept as a composition of local currents (diatropic and paratropic) of incorporated units. The hybrid systems show the properties derived from the &#960;&#8208;conjugations that interlace one another but also show a significant independence of (aza)acene subunits reflected in the observed spectroscopic properties.

         <title>Macrocyclic Arenes&#8208;Based Conjugated Macrocycle Polymers for Highly Selective CO2 Capture and Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8967-8975, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four catcher&#8208;type conjugated macrocycle polymers (CMP&#8208;n, n=1&#8211;4) have been designed and synthesized successfully, exhibiting interesting application in CO2 and I2 uptake. The CMP&#8208;2 is able to capture CO2 with excellent selectivity and the CMP&#8208;4 is capable of adsorbing iodine with outstanding capacity.







Abstract
Incorporating synthetic macrocycles with unique structures and distinct conformations into conjugated macrocycle polymers (CMPs) can endow the resulting materials with great potentials in gas uptake and pollutant adsorption. Here, four CMPs (CMP&#8208;n, n=1&#8211;4) capable of reversibly capturing iodine and efficiently separating carbon dioxide are constructed from per&#8208;triflate functionalized leaning tower[6]arene (LT6&#8208;OTf) and [2]biphenyl&#8208;extended pillar[6]arene (BpP6&#8208;OTf) via Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Intriguingly, owing to the appropriate cavity size of LT6&#8208;OTf and the numerous aromatic rings in the framework, the newly designed CMP&#8208;4 possesses an outstanding I2 affinity with a large uptake capacity of 208&#8197;wt&#8201;% in vapor and a great removal efficiency of 94&#8201;% in aqueous solutions. To our surprise, with no capacity to accommodate nitrogen, CMP&#8208;2 constructed from BpP6&#8208;OTf is able to specifically capture carbon dioxide at ambient conditions.

The first catalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing Fischer indolization of prochiral diketones, containing enantiotopic carbonyl groups, is developed and shown to proceed through dynamic kinetic resolution. Catalyzed by a combination of a spirocyclic chiral phosphoric acid and ZnCl2, this reaction delivers cyclopenta[b]indolones, containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, with up to 98.5:1.5 e.r.







Abstract
The first catalytic enantioselective Fischer indolization of prochiral diketones containing enantiotopic carbonyl groups is developed and shown to proceed through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). Catalyzed by the combination of a spirocyclic chiral phosphoric acid and ZnCl2 (Lewis acid assisted Br&#248;nsted acid), this direct approach combines 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones with N&#8208;protected phenylhydrazines to furnish cyclopenta[b]indole derivatives containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter with good to excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>An Unexpected Cubic Symmetry in Group&#8197;IV Alloys Prepared Using Pressure and Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9009-9014, April 12, 2021. </description>

New materials can be created without the need to follow conventional criteria and routes to synthesis. We demonstrate this for Ge&#8211;Sn, a system actively investigated for optoelectronic applications to overcome conventional cubic Si's deficiencies. Ge and Sn are however unreactive in the bulk, but we remove reactivity barriers and form a different structure, a simple new cubic solid solution.







Abstract
The cubic diamond (Fd
m) group IVA element Si has been the material driver of the electronics industry since its inception. We report synthesis of a new cubic (Im
m) group IVA material, a GeSn solid solution, upon heating Ge and Sn at pressures from 13 to 28&#8197;GPa using double&#8208;sided diamond anvil laser&#8208;heating and large volume press methods. Both methods were coupled with in situ angle dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction characterization. The new material substantially enriches the seminal group IVA alloy materials landscape by introducing an eightfold coordinated cubic symmetry, which markedly expands on the conventional tetrahedrally coordinated cubic one. This cubic solid solution is formed, despite Ge never adopting the Im
m symmetry, melting inhibiting subsequent Im
m formation and reactant Ge and Sn having unlike crystal structures and atomic radii at all these pressures. This is hence achieved without adherence to conventional formation criteria and routes to synthesis. This advance creates fertile avenues for new materials development.

         <title>Dynamic Stereoselection of Peptide Helicates and Their Selective Labeling of DNA Replication Foci in Cells**

Artificial bipyridine&#8208;containing peptide ligands encode in their sequence the stereoselective folding into chiral three&#8208;stranded FeII or CoII peptide helicates and as kinetically inert dinuclear CoIII complexes by in&#8208;situ oxidation. These peptide helicates selectively label DNA replication foci in functional cells.







Abstract
Although largely overlooked in peptide engineering, coordination chemistry offers a new set of interactions that opens unexplored design opportunities for developing complex molecular structures. In this context, we report new artificial peptide ligands that fold into chiral helicates in the presence of labile metal ions such as FeII and CoII. Heterochiral &#946;&#8208;turn&#8208;promoting sequences encode the stereoselective folding of the peptide ligands and define the physicochemical properties of their corresponding metal complexes. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy in combination with computational methods allowed us to identify and determine the structure of two isochiral &#923;&#923;&#8208;helicates, folded as topological isomers. Finally, in addition to the in&#8208;vitro characterization of their selective binding to DNA three&#8208;way junctions, cell&#8208;microscopy experiments demonstrated that a rhodamine&#8208;labeled FeII helicate was internalized and selectively stains DNA replication factories in functional cells.

         <title>Constructing Electron Levers in Perovskite Nanocrystals to Regulate the Local Electron Density for Intensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8905-8912, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intra&#8208;crystalline electron lever strategy is proposed by constructing Mn&#8208;doped BiFeO3 nanocrystals with a Mn4+&#8722;O&#8722;Fe3+ bond lever, which can specifically increase the local electron density of the Fe reaction centre to improve the kinetics of chemodynamic therapy. This method is promising in future research on the quantitative regulation of electron density and on&#8208;demand chemical reactivity adjustment.







Abstract
The local electron density of an atom is one key factor that determines its chemical properties. Regulating electron density can promote the atom's reactivity and so reduce the reaction activation energy, which is highly desired in many chemical applications. Herein, we report an intra&#8208;crystalline electron lever strategy, which can regulate the electron density of reaction centre atoms via manipulating ambient lattice states, for Fenton activity improvement. Typically, with the assistance of ultrasound, the Mn4+&#8722;O&#8722;Fe3+ bond in BiFe0.97Mn0.03O3 perovskite nanocrystals can drive valence electrons and free electrons to accumulate on Fe atoms by a polarization electric field originated from the designed lattice strain. The increase of electron density significantly improves the catalytic activity of Fe, decreasing the activation energy of BiFe0.97Mn0.03O3&#8208;mediated Fenton reaction by 52.55&#8201;%, and increasing the .OH yield by 9.21&#8208;fold. This study provides a new way to understand the sono&#8208;Fenton chemistry, and the increased .OH production enables a highly effective chemodynamic therapy.

The increase of electron density significantly improves the catalytic activity of Fe, decreasing the activation energy of BiFe&lt;sub&gt;0.97&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;mediated Fenton reaction by 52.55&#8201;%, and increasing the &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH yield by 9.21&#8208;fold. This study provides a new way to understand the sono&#8208;Fenton chemistry, and the increased &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH production enables a highly effective chemodynamic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Superstrong and Reversible Ionic Crystal&#8208;Based Adhesive Inspired by Ice Adhesion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8948-8959, April 12, 2021. </description>

Inspired by reversible ice adhesion, a reversible ionic crystal (IC) based gel adhesive was prepared, which showed superstrong and reversible adhesion due to the phase transition of ICs. In addition, the reversible adhesion can be adjusted by heating and light, and be effectively monitored by resistance and capacitance.







Abstract
In this study, we developed a superstrong and reversible adhesive, which can possess a high bonding strength in the &#8220;adhesive&#8221; state and detach with the application of heating. An ionic crystal (IC) gel, in which an IC was immobilized within a soft&#8208;polymer matrix, were synthesized via in situ photo&#8208;crosslinking of a precursor solution composed of N, N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide (DMAA) and a melted IC. The obtained IC gel is homogenous and transparent at melt point. When cooled to the phase transition temperature of the IC, the gel turns into the adhesive with the adhesion strength of 5.82&#8197;MPa (on glasses), due to the excellent wetting of melted gel and a thin layer of crystalline IC with high cohesive strength formed on the substrates. The synergistic effects between IC, polymer networks and substrates were investigated by solid state 1H&#8197;NMR and molecular dynamics simulation. Such an adhesive layer is reversable and can be detached by heating and subsequent re&#8208;adhesion via cooling. This study proposed the new design of removable adhesives, which can be used in dynamic and complex environments.

         <title>Quantifying the Likelihood of Structural Models through a Dynamically Enhanced Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Protocol</title>

Structurally characterizing new and poorly crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks is highly challenging. The dynamic protocol of this work overcomes this challenge through a systematic likelihood ordering based on intuitive heuristics and X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. It succeeds in unambiguously identifying a material's atomic&#8208;level structure, accounting for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experiments.







Abstract
Structurally characterizing new materials is tremendously challenging, especially when single crystal structures are hardly available which is often the case for covalent organic frameworks. Yet, knowledge of the atomic structure is key to establish structure&#8208;function relations and enable functional material design. Herein, a new protocol is proposed to unambiguously predict the structure of poorly crystalline materials through a likelihood ordering based on the X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. Key of the procedure is the broad set of structures generated from a limited number of building blocks and topologies, which is submitted to operando structural characterization. The dynamic averaging in the latter accounts for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experimental measurements, yielding unparalleled agreement with experimental powder XRD patterns. The proposed concept can hence unquestionably identify the structure of experimentally synthesized materials, a crucial step to design next generation functional materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Hydroacylation Involving Alkene Isomerization for the Construction of C3&#8208;Chirogenic Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8997-9002, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective intramolecular hydroacylation of 3&#8208;enals involving alkene isomerization was developed for the efficient construction of C3&#8208;chirogenic cyclopentanones with satisfactory yields, diastereoselectivities, and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A new transformation pattern for enantioselective intramolecular hydroacylation has been developed involving an alkene isomerization strategy. Proceeding through a five&#8208;membered rhodacycle intermediate, 3&#8208;enals were converted to C3&#8208; or C3,C5&#8208;chirogenic cyclopentanones with satisfactory yields, diastereoselectivities, and enantioselectivities. A catalytic cycle has been theoretically calculated and the origin of the stereoselection is rationally explained.

Simultaneous chemical analysis and spatial mapping of homopolymers used for energy storage and molecular feedstock in biological tissues are challenging using conventional MS imaging. Here, the spatial and size distributions for oligomers from polyhydroxybutyrate, polysaccharide, and polyglutamic acid are profiled in rhizobia&#8208;infected soybean root nodules by MS imaging using nanophotonic ionization from silicon nanopost arrays and MALDI.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables simultaneous spatial mapping for diverse molecules in biological tissues. Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) has been a mainstream MSI method for a wide range of biomolecules. However, MALDI&#8208;MSI of biological homopolymers used for energy storage and molecular feedstock is limited by, e.g., preferential ionization for certain molecular classes. Matrix&#8208;free nanophotonic ionization from silicon nanopost arrays (NAPAs) is an emerging laser desorption ionization (LDI) platform with ultra&#8208;trace sensitivity and molecular imaging capabilities. Here, we show complementary analysis and MSI of polyhydroxybutyric acid (PHB), polyglutamic acid (PGA), and polysaccharide oligomers in soybean root nodule sections by NAPA&#8208;LDI and MALDI. For PHB, number and weight average molar mass, polydispersity, and oligomer size distributions across the tissue section and in regions of interest were characterized by NAPA&#8208;LDI&#8208;MSI.

         <title>Bio&#8208;adhesive Nanoporous Module: Toward Autonomous Gating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8932-8937, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous covalent organic framework (GlueCOF) carrying guanidinium ion pendants has been developed that can accommodate guests and bind to biopolymers. The strong bio&#8208;adhesive nature of GlueCOF was used to noncovalently bind to calmodulin (CaM), which acted as a gating component for the guest&#8208;loaded 1D nanopores (CaMCOF&#8835;guest). The conformational change of the CaM gate upon selective binding with Ca2+ enabled the release of guest molecules.







Abstract
Here we report a bio&#8208;adhesive porous organic module (GlueCOF) composed of hexagonally packed 1D nanopores based on a covalent organic framework. The nanopores are densely decorated with guanidinium ion (Gu+) pendants capable of forming salt bridges with oxyanionic species. GlueCOF strongly adheres to biopolymers through multivalent salt&#8208;bridging interactions with their ubiquitous oxyanionic species. By taking advantage of its strong bio&#8208;adhesive nature, we succeeded in creating a gate that possibly opens the nanopores through a selective interaction with a reporter chemical and releases guest molecules. We chose calmodulin (CaM) as a gating component that can stably entrap a loaded guest, sulforhodamine&#8197;B (SRB), within the nanopores (CaMCOF&#8835;SRB). CaM is known to change its conformation on binding with Ca2+ ions. We confirmed that mixing CaMCOF&#8835;SRB with Ca2+ resulted in the release of SRB from the nanopores, whereas the use of weakly binding Mg2+ ions resulted in a much slower release of SRB.

The nanopores are densely decorated with guanidinium ion (Gu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) pendants capable of forming salt bridges with oxyanionic species. &lt;sup&gt;Glue&lt;/sup&gt;COF strongly adheres to biopolymers through multivalent salt&#8208;bridging interactions with their ubiquitous oxyanionic species. By taking advantage of its strong bio&#8208;adhesive nature, we succeeded in creating a gate that possibly opens the nanopores through a selective interaction with a reporter chemical and releases guest molecules. We chose calmodulin (CaM) as a gating component that can stably entrap a loaded guest, sulforhodamine&#8197;B (SRB), within the nanopores (&lt;sup&gt;CaM&lt;/sup&gt;COF&#8835;SRB). CaM is known to change its conformation on binding with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. We confirmed that mixing &lt;sup&gt;CaM&lt;/sup&gt;COF&#8835;SRB with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; resulted in the release of SRB from the nanopores, whereas the use of weakly binding Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions resulted in a much slower release of SRB.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cascaded Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Towards Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Lasers Beyond 850&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9114-9119, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six&#8208;level energy systems are constructed through the cascaded occurrence of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer consisting of a first ultrafast proton transfer of &lt;430&#8197;fs and a following dominant and irreversible proton transfer of ca. 1.6&#8197;ps, which support the NIR single&#8208;mode lasing at 854&#8197;nm for exploiting energy&#8208;level systems of OSSLs, especially at the NIR region from 780 to 2500&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic solid&#8208;state lasers play an essential role in applications ranging from laser communication to infrared night vision, but progress in this area is restricted by the lack of effective excited&#8208;state gain processes. Herein, we originally proposed and demonstrated the cascaded occurrence of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer for constructing the completely new energy&#8208;level systems. Cascading by the first ultrafast proton transfer of &lt;430&#8197;fs and the subsequent irreversible second proton transfer of ca. 1.6&#8197;ps, the stepwise proton transfer process favors the true six&#8208;level photophysical cycle, which supports efficient population inversion and thus NIR single&#8208;mode lasing at 854&#8197;nm. This work realizes longest wavelength beyond 850&#8197;nm of organic single&#8208;crystal lasing to date and originally exploits the cascaded excited&#8208;state molecular proton transfer energy&#8208;level systems for organic solid&#8208;state lasers.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Interplay Revealed: CO2 Reduction to CO over ZrO2 by Light with Further Reduction to Methane over Ni0 by Heat Converted from Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9045-9054, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 photoreduction with Ni&#8208;ZrO2 as a catalyst under UV/Vis light was monitored by 13C&#8208;labeled mass chromatography, FTIR spectroscopy, and EXAFS. The interplay of bicarbonate reduction to CO over ZrO2 owing to charge separation by light with subsequent hydrogenation of CO over Ni heated from light enabled CO2 reduction to methane.







Abstract
The reaction mechanism of CO2 photoreduction into methane was elucidated by time&#8208;course monitoring of the mass chromatogram, in situ FTIR spectroscopy, and in situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Under 13CO2, H2, and UV/Vis light, 13CH4 was formed at a rate of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 using Ni (10&#8197;wt&#8201;%)&#8208;ZrO2 that was effective at 96&#8197;kPa. Under UV/Vis light irradiation, the 13CO2 exchange reaction and FTIR identified physisorbed/chemisorbed bicarbonate and the reduction because of charge separation in/on ZrO2, followed by the transfer of formate and CO onto the Ni surface. EXAFS confirmed exclusive presence of Ni0 sites. Then, FTIR spectroscopy detected methyl species on Ni0, which was reversibly heated to 394&#8197;K owing to the heat converted from light. With D2O and H2, the H/D ratio in the formed methane agreed with reactant H/D ratio. This study paves the way for using first row transition metals for solar fuel generation using only UV/Vis light.

         <dc:description>
Calbistrin biosynthesis involves an unusual dual&#8208;functional polyketide synthase CalA, which synthesizes both of the two structurally distinct moieties of calbistrins. The product divergence is intriguingly controlled by two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and a trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferanse CalH, to yield the decalin and polyene portions, respectively. The esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD, as reported by Yudai Matsuda, Ikuro Abe, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;8851.

Circadian rhythms are present in most if not all animals, plants, and even photosynthetic cyanobacteria. These cyanobacterial clocks as well as plant clocks are very different from those of animals, with no credible homology between the different clock proteins. Therefore circadian rhythms probably emerged multiple times in evolution, which underscores their importance.

         <title>Multicolor Fluorescent Polymeric Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8608-8624, April 12, 2021. </description>

Multicolor fluorescent polymeric hydrogels (MFPHs), rising stars of luminescent materials, are the marriage of multicolor fluorescent materials and polymeric hydrogels. They have many extraordinary properties, such as a tissue&#8208;like modulus, an intrinsic soft and wet nature, and fluorescence color change. In this Review, recent progress in MFPHs is summarized, with a particular focus on the construction methods and important applications.







Abstract
Multicolor fluorescent polymeric hydrogels (MFPHs) are three&#8208;dimensionally crosslinked hydrophilic polymer networks with tunable emission color. Different from the classic fluorescent materials that are used primarily in dry solid states or solutions, MFPHs exist as highly water&#8208;swollen quasi&#8208;solids. They thus present many promising properties of both solids and solution, including tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, an intrinsic soft and wet nature, fabulous biocompatibility, along with a responsive volume, shape, and fluorescence color change. These advantageous properties hold great potential in many applications such as sensing, bioimaging, information encoding, encryption, biomimetic actuators, and soft robotics. This Review gives an in&#8208;depth overview of recent progress in the field of MFPHs, with a particular focus on the diverse construction methods and important demonstrated applications. Current challenges and future perspectives on MFPHs are also discussed.

         <title>Acid&#8211;Base Free Main Group Carbonyl Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8626-8648, April 12, 2021. </description>

Recently, hitherto elusive acid&#8208; and base&#8208;free main group carbonyl analogues (R2E=O) derived from group&#8197;13 to 15 elements have been isolated in crystalline form. Their unperturbed nature elicits exciting new chemistry, spanning the vista from classical organic carbonyl&#8208;type reactions to transition metal&#8208;like oxide ion transfer chemistry.







Abstract
Main group carbonyl analogues (R2E=O) derived from p&#8208;block elements (E=groups&#8197;13 to 15) have long been considered as elusive species. Previously, employment of chemical tricks such as acid&#8208; and base&#8208;stabilization protocols granted access to these transient species in their masked forms. However, electronic and steric effects inevitably perturb their chemical reactivity and distinguish them from classical carbonyl compounds.

     alt="Acid&#8211;Base Free Main Group Carbonyl Analogues"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, hitherto elusive acid&#8208; and base&#8208;free main group carbonyl analogues (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E=O) derived from group&#8197;13 to 15 elements have been isolated in crystalline form. Their unperturbed nature elicits exciting new chemistry, spanning the vista from classical organic carbonyl&#8208;type reactions to transition metal&#8208;like oxide ion transfer chemistry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main group carbonyl analogues (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E=O) derived from p&#8208;block elements (E=groups&#8197;13 to 15) have long been considered as elusive species. Previously, employment of chemical tricks such as acid&#8208; and base&#8208;stabilization protocols granted access to these transient species in their masked forms. However, electronic and steric effects inevitably perturb their chemical reactivity and distinguish them from classical carbonyl compounds. A new era was marked by the recent isolation of acid&#8211;base free main group carbonyl analogues, ranging from a lighter boracarbonyl to the heavier silacarbonyls, phosphacarbonyls and a germacarbonyl. Most importantly, their unperturbed nature elicits exciting new chemistry, spanning the vista from classical organic carbonyl&#8208;type reactions to transition metal&#8208;like oxide ion transfer chemistry. In this Review, we survey the strategies used for the isolation of such systems and document their emerging reactivity profiles, with a view to providing fundamental comparisons both with carbon and transition metal oxo species. This highlights the emerging opportunities for exciting &#8220;crossover&#8221; reactivity offered by these derivatives of the p&#8208;block elements.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8585-8595, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest developments in the large&#8208;scale production of carbon quantum dots by using microwave, ultrasonic, plasma, magnetic hyperthermia, and microfluidic techniques are outlined. The synthetic methods for generating carbon dot/polymer composites are summarized, whereby the carbon quantum dots can serve as fillers, monomers, or initiators. Promising applications, current challenges, and future perspectives are also highlighted and discussed.







Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CDs) have inspired vast interest because of their excellent photoluminescence (PL) performances and their promising applications in optoelectronic, biomedical, and sensing fields. The development of effective approaches for the large&#8208;scale production of CDs may greatly promote the further advancement of their practical applications. In this Minireview, the newly emerging methods for the large&#8208;scale production of CDs are summarized, such as microwave, ultrasonic, plasma, magnetic hyperthermia, and microfluidic techniques. The use of the available strategies for constructing CD/polymer composites with intriguing solid&#8208;state PL is then described. Particularly, the multiple roles of CDs are emphasized, including as fillers, monomers, and initiators. Moreover, typical applications of CD/polymer composites in light&#8208;emitting diodes, fluorescent printing, and biomedicine are outlined. Finally, we discuss current problems and speculate on their future development.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing Machinery Using Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Vehicles</title>

Spatiotemporal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing machinery is of great importance for developing chemical biology tools for manipulating cellular DNA sequences to treat genetic disorders. This Minireview provides an overview of synthetic approaches and specific chemistries that have been used to develop stimuli&#8208;responsive vehicles for CRISPR/Cas9 delivery and genome editing in a controlled manner.







Abstract
Recent innovations in genome editing have enabled the precise manipulation of the genetic information of mammalians, and benefitted the development of next&#8208;generation gene therapy. Despite these advances, several barriers to the clinical translation of genome editing remain, including the intracellular delivery of genome editing machinery, and the risk of off&#8208;target editing effect. Here, we review the recent advance of spatiotemporal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing machinery, which is composed of programmable Cas9 nuclease and a single&#8208;guide RNA (sgRNA) using stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. We discuss the specific chemistries that have been used for controlled Cas9/sgRNA delivery and intracellular release in the presence of endogenous or external signals. These methodologies can leverage biological signals found locally within disease cells, or exogenous signals administrated with spatiotemporal control, through which an improved genome editing could be achieved. We also discuss the future in exploiting these approaches for fundamental biomedical applications and therapeutic genome editing.

         <title>Tautomeric Molecule Acts as a &#8220;Sunscreen&#8221; for Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8673-8677, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harmful UV light and surface defects accelerate the degradation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A tautomeric &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecule can be used to protect the PSC from UV degradation and enable molecular defect passivation (defect formation energy: &#8722;1.35&#8197;eV) through interactions between functional groups and defects. This strategy provides high&#8208;efficiency PSCs with long&#8208;term UV stability.







Abstract
UV light always does great harm to perovskite solar cells, relentlessly degrading perovskites and shortening the lifetime of perovskite devices. Meanwhile, surface defects in perovskite films further accelerate the degradation process and serve as nonradiative charge recombination centers to deteriorate device efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecule, 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone, not only protects the perovskite solar cell from UV degradation but also enables molecular defect passivation through interaction between functional groups and defects by molecular tautomerism under UV light illumination. Therefore, the sunscreen strategy efficiently enhances the UV endurance of PSCs and improves defect formation energy to &#8722;1.35&#8197;eV. The perovskite solar cell with sunscreen (sunscreen PSC) exhibits outstanding efficiencies of up to 23.09&#8201;% (0.04&#8197;cm2) and 19.73&#8201;% (1.00&#8197;cm2) as well as long&#8208;term UV (UVa: 365&#8197;nm and UVb: 285&#8197;nm) stability.

         <title>Ambient&#8208;Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Titanium Carbide (MXene) Enabled by Iodine Etching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8689-8693, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;assisted method has been developed for etching bulk Ti3AlC2 in anhydrous acetonitrile (CH3CN), resulting in 2D MXene sheets (Ti3C2Tx, T=O, OH) with intact lattice, high yield (71&#8201;%), large size (1.8&#8197;&#956;m) and ultimate thickness (&lt;5&#8197;nm). 2D MXene sheets present great ambient stability in water for at least 2&#8197;weeks and high gravimetric capacitances of 293&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1 when serving as electrode materials for supercapacitors.







Abstract
MXene (e.g., Ti3C2) represents an important class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials owing to its unique metallic conductivity and tunable surface chemistry. However, the mainstream synthetic methods rely on the chemical etching of MAX powders (e.g., Ti3AlC2) using hazardous HF or alike, leading to MXene sheets with fluorine termination and poor ambient stability in colloidal dispersions. Here, we demonstrate a fluoride&#8208;free, iodine (I2) assisted etching route for preparing 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tx, T=O, OH) with oxygen&#8208;rich terminal groups and intact lattice structure. More than 71&#8201;% of sheets are thinner than 5&#8197;nm with an average size of 1.8&#8197;&#956;m. They present excellent thin&#8208;film conductivity of 1250&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and great ambient stability in water for at least 2 weeks. 2D MXene sheets with abundant oxygen surface groups are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, delivering a high gravimetric capacitance of 293&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a scan rate of 1&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1, superior to those made from fluoride&#8208;based etchants (&lt;290&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1). Our strategy provides a promising pathway for the facile and sustainable production of highly stable MXene materials.

         <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction Over Ultrathin Metallic Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 Nanosheets</title>

It is a tough task to achieve IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Herein, an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst is designed to achieve IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Among the reported single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is realized by Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 nanosheets.







Abstract
Converting CO2 and H2O into carbon&#8208;based fuel by IR light is a tough task. Herein, compared with other single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is achieved by an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst&#8208;Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 nanosheets (Ni&#8208;CoS2). The evolution rate of CH4 over Ni&#8208;CoS2 is up to 101.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The metallic and ultrathin nature endow Ni&#8208;CoS2 with excellent IR light absorption ability. The PL spectra and Arrhenius plots indicate that Ni atoms could facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers and the decrease of the activation energy. Moreover, in situ FTIR, DFT calculations, and CH4&#8208;TPD reveal that the doped Ni atoms in CoS2 could effectively depress the formation energy of the *COOH, *CHO and desorption energy of CH4. This work manifests that element doping in atomic level is a powerful way to control the reaction intermediates, providing possibilities to realize high&#8208;efficiency IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Discovery of a Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;Active Inhibitor of SETDB1 Tudor Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8760-8765, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first potent and selective small&#8208;molecule SETDB1 tandem tudor domain (TTD) inhibitor, (R,R)&#8208;59, is reported. (R,R)&#8208;59 is an endogenous binder&#8208;competitive inhibitor and also showed activities in intact cells. The enantiomer (S,S)&#8208;59 did not show any activity.







Abstract
SET domain bifurcated protein 1 (SETDB1) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that promotes the silencing of some tumour suppressor genes and is overexpressed in many cancers. SETDB1 contains a unique tandem tudor domain (TTD) that recognizes histone H3 sequences containing both methylated and acetylated lysines. Beginning with the identification of a hit compound (Cpd1), we discovered the first potent and selective small molecule SETDB1&#8208;TTD inhibitor (R,R)&#8208;59 through stepwise structure&#8208;guided optimization. (R,R)&#8208;59 showed a KD value of 0.088&#177;0.045&#8197;&#956;M in the ITC assay. The high potency of (R,R)&#8208;59 was well explained by the cocrystal structure of the (R,R)&#8208;59&#8208;TTD complex. (R,R)&#8208;59 is an endogenous binder competitive inhibitor. Evidence has also demonstrated its cellular target engagement. Interestingly, the enantiomer (S,S)&#8208;59 did not show activity in all the assays, highlighting the potential of (R,R)&#8208;59 as a tool compound in exploring the biological functions of SETDB1&#8208;TTD.

         <title>Formation of Nanoscale [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ from Condensation of &#1013;&#8208;GeAl128+ Keggin Polycations**

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;condensation of &#1013;&#8208;GeAl128+ upon thermal aging is proposed as the mechanism for the formation of tetrameric [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ (Ge4Al4820+).







Abstract
Keggin&#8208;type polyaluminum cations belong to a unique class of compounds with their large positive charge, hydroxo bridges, and divergent isomerization/oligomerization. Previous reports indicated that oligomerization of this species can only occur through one isomer (&#948;), but herein we report the isolation of largest Keggin&#8208;type cluster that occurs through self&#8208;condensation of four &#1013;&#8208;isomers &#1013;&#8208;GeAl128+ to form [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ cluster (Ge4Al48). The cluster was crystallized and structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and the elemental composition was confirmed by ICP&#8208;MS and SEM&#8208;EDS. Additional dynamic light scattering experiments confirms the presence of the Ge4Al48 in thermally aged solutions. DFT calculations reveal that a single atom Ge substitution in tetrahedral site of &#1013;&#8208;isomer is the key for the formation of Ge4Al48 because it activates deprotonation at key surface sites that control the self&#8208;condensation process.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8818-8822, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by a Pd/Cu cooperative catalyst system, the first example of defluorinative carbonylative coupling has been established. With gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aryl iodides as the substrates, this methodology offers flexible and facile access to privileged &#945;&#8208;fluorochalcones under mild reaction conditions in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields.







Abstract

         <title>Boosting Production of HCOOH from CO2 Electroreduction via Bi/CeOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8798-8802, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited current density, production rate as well as selectivity hinder the improvement of HCOOH production from CO2 electroreduction. Here, bismuth/cerium oxide (Bi/CeOx) displays outstanding performances for CO2 electroreduction to HCOOH, which not only shows excellent selectivity, but also achieves a high current density (149&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and especially the maximum HCOOH production rate (2600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) ever reported.







Abstract
Formic acid (HCOOH) is one of the most promising chemical fuels that can be produced through CO2 electroreduction. However, most of the catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to HCOOH in aqueous solution often suffer from low current density and limited production rate. Herein, we provide a bismuth/cerium oxide (Bi/CeOx) catalyst, which exhibits not only high current density (149&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), but also unprecedented production rate (2600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with high Faradaic efficiency (FE, 92&#8201;%) for HCOOH generation in aqueous media. Furthermore, Bi/CeOx also shows favorable stability over 34&#8197;h. We hope this work could offer an attractive and promising strategy to develop efficient catalysts for CO2 electroreduction with superior activity and desirable stability.

         <title>Synthesis of Ketones by C&#8722;H Functionalization of Aldehydes with Boronic Acids under Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8728-8732, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrosobenzene can simultaneously activate the C&#8722;H bonds of aldehydes and the C&#8722;B bonds of boronic acids triggering a C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming process that leads to the synthesis of ketones via an intramolecular migration from boron to carbon. These findings constitute a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free practical, scalable, and operationally easy method for the synthesis of ketones.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of ketones from aldehydes and boronic acids via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization reaction is reported. The method employs nitrosobenzene as a reagent to drive the simultaneous activation of the boronic acid as a boronate and the activation of the C&#8722;H bond of the aldehyde as an iminium species that triggers the key C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming step via an intramolecular migration from boron to carbon. These findings constitute a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of ketones.

         <title>Structural Revision of Natural Cyclic Depsipeptide MA026 Established by Total Synthesis and Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8792-8797, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A revised structure of natural cyclic depsipeptide MA026 with tight junction opening activity was established by physicochemical analysis and confirmed by its total solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster demonstrated that the stereochemistry of amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained.







Abstract
A revised structure of natural 14&#8208;mer cyclic depsipeptide MA026, isolated from Pseudomonas sp. RtlB026 in 2002 was established by physicochemical analysis with HPLC, MS/MS, and NMR and confirmed by total solid&#8208;phase synthesis. The revised structure differs from that previously reported in that two amino acid residues, assigned in error, have been replaced. Synthesized MA026 with the revised structure showed a tight junction (TJ) opening activity like that of the natural one in a cell&#8208;based TJ opening assay. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of RtIB026 demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained. Phylogenetic analysis with xantholysin BGC indicates an exceptionally high homology (ca. 90&#8201;%) between xantholysin and MA026. The TJ opening activity of MA026 when binding to claudin&#8208;1 is a key to new avenues for transdermal administration of large hydrophilic biologics.

         <title>The Atypical Hysteresis of [Fe(C6F5Tp)2]: Overlay of Spin&#8208;Crossovers and Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8803-8807, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [FeII(C6F5Tp)2] complex is converted through melting from a crystal phase showing a very gradual spin&#8208;crossover to another one showing a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition. The uncommon &#8220;rounded&#8221; hysteresis occurs in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system. It is due to a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that is triggered when roughly ca. 50&#8201;% of the SCO complexes are switched.







Abstract
The [FeII(C6F5Tp)2] spin&#8208;crossover complex is an atypical molecular switch, which can be converted upon annealing between two archetypal spin&#8208;crossover behaviours: from an extremely gradual spin&#8208;crossover to a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition (of ca. 65&#8197;K). The hysteresis shows an uncommon &#8220;rounded shape&#8221; that is reproducible upon cycling temperature. In depth structural studies reveal a first crystal phase transition, which occurs upon melting and recrystallizing at high temperature. This first irreversible transition is associated with a radical change in the crystal packing. More importantly, the &#8220;rounded and broad&#8221; hysteretic transition is shown to occur in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system and is associated with the occurrence of a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that appears when roughly ca. 50&#8201;% of the SCO complexes are switched.

         <title>GlycoBODIPYs: Sugars Serving as a Natural Stock for Water&#8208;soluble Fluorescent Probes of Complex Chiral Morphology</title>

Twelve sugars, differing in size and stereochemistry, were used as building blocks in a modular, efficient four&#8208;step synthetic route to multifunctional BODIPY glycoconjugates with high fluorescence and hydrophilicity. The chiral information was transferred unchanged, thereby providing complex and distinct probes for target&#8208;oriented binding studies and specific in&#8197;vivo imaging.







Abstract
A range of unprocessed, reducing sugar substrates (mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trisaccharides) is shown to take part in a straightforward four&#8208;step synthetic route to water&#8208;soluble, uncharged BODIPY derivatives with unimpaired chiral integrity and high fluorescence efficiency. A wide compatibility with several postfunctionalizations is demonstrated, thus suggesting a universal utility of the multifunctional glycoconjugates, which we call GlycoBODIPYs. Knoevenagel condensations are able to promote a red&#8208;shift in the spectra, thereby furnishing strongly fluorescent red and far&#8208;red glycoconjugates of high hydrophilicity. The synthetic outcome was studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and by comprehensive photophysical investigations in several solvent systems. Furthermore, cell experiments illustrate efficient cell uptake and demonstrate differential cell targeting as a function of the integrated chiral information.

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Jamming Using an Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Molecular Reporter</title>

With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs), a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting a liquid&#8208;like assembly into a solid&#8208;like assembly. Real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging has been used to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of nanoparticle surfactants at the water/oil interface by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state (see graph).







Abstract
With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs), a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting the assembly from a liquid&#8208;like into a solid&#8208;like assembly. Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network is denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid&#8208;like state. It is a challenge to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, since both jamming and vitrification lead to a solid&#8208;like behavior of the assemblies. Herein, we show a real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging method to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of NP surfactants at the water/oil interface using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. The AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior at densities at which they can move and rotate. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the smaller intermolecular separation distance arrests rotation, and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs.

A direct catalytic asymmetric addition of acetonitrile to aldehydes with high enantioselectivity is achieved by the strategic use of a sterically demanding NiII pincer carbene complex. This afforded highly enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles.







Abstract
A direct catalytic asymmetric addition of acetonitrile to aldehydes that realizes over 90&#8201;% ee is the ultimate challenge in alkylnitrile addition chemistry. Herein, we report achieving high enantioselectivity by the strategic use of a sterically demanding NiII pincer carbene complex, which afforded highly enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles. This highly atom&#8208;economical process paves the way for exploiting inexpensive acetonitrile as a promising C2 building block in a practical synthetic toolbox for asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Traceless Removal of Two Kernel Atoms in a Gold Nanocluster and Its Impact on Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8668-8672, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel nanoclusters Au48(m&#8208;MB)26 and Au46(m&#8208;MBT)26 have been synthesized and fully characterized, and the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in metal nanoclusters has been achieved for the first time. The two kernel atoms reduction leads to the photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) increase by almost four times. In addition, kernel bond length dependent photoluminescence and kernel charge state were first revealed.







Abstract
Removing or adding kernel atoms of metal nanoclusters (NCs) without leaving a trace is a substantial challenge because the kernel atoms are inside and covered by the outer staples. However, such kernel tuning is very important for improving the properties and acquiring an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kernel&#8208;property correlation. Photoluminescence (PL) is one of the most intriguing characteristics of metal NCs but has not been well understood until now. Inspired by these challenges/questions, we conducted this study and, for the first time, achieved the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in a gold nanocluster by applying a simple thermal treatment and revealed its impact on PL. Further, we demonstrated that the kernel Au&#8208;Au bond length can be an indicator for a comparison of the PL or kernel charge state between nanoclusters with similar kernel structures and sizes.

         <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Enhanced Nuclear Spin Optical Rotation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8823-8826, April 12, 2021. </description>

Nuclear spin optical rotation (NSOR) signals are enhanced by hyperpolarization of nuclear spins using dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization. The signal enhancement leads to the measurement of the NSOR constant of dimethyl sulfoxide. A spectroscopy based on hyperpolarized NSOR offers the possibility to provide information on ground and excited electronic states in molecules, localized to an NMR&#8208;addressable site.







Abstract
Nuclear spin optical rotation (NSOR) has been investigated as a magneto&#8208;optical effect, which holds the potential for applications, including hybrid optical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gradientless imaging. The intrinsic nature of NSOR renders its detection relatively insensitive, which has prevented it moving from a proof of concept to a method supporting chemical characterizations. In this work, the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization technique is introduced to provide nuclear spin polarization, increasing the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by several thousand times. NSOR signals of 1H and 19F nuclei are observed in a single scan for diluted compounds, which has made this effect suitable for the determination of electronic transitions from a specific nucleus in a large molecule.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assisted Catalytic Kinetic Resolution of Acyclic &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8786-8791, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for catalytic kinetic resolution (KR) of acyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides was developed via enantioselective acylation of primary alcohol with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Enhanced selectivity was realized for the catalytic KR process using cyclic tertiary amine as a base additive. Diastereomeric transition state models are proposed to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched acyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides are valuable compounds in chemical, material and medicinal sciences, but their enantioselective synthesis remains challenging. A catalytic kinetic resolution (KR) of such amides with selectivity factor(s) up to &gt;200 is developed via enantioselective acylation of primary alcohol with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. An enhanced selectivity for the catalytic KR process is realized using cyclic tertiary amine as base additive. Diastereomeric transition state models for the process are proposed to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Unprecedented Reactivity of &#947;&#8208;Amino Cyclopentenone Enables Diversity&#8208;Oriented Access to Functionalized Indoles and Indole&#8208;Annulated Ring Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8808-8812, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights diversity&#8208;oriented access to cyclopentenoid indoles and indole&#8208;alkaloid like structures which is pillared on an unprecedented latent reactivity of &#947;&#8208;aminoenones. The transformation highlights &#947;&#8208; or &#946;,&#947;&#8208;functionalization of enones to generate new structural space. A reverse&#8208;aza&#8208;Piancatelli rearrangement seemed to be operating, which should invoke new attributes to its mechanism.







Abstract
Observation of an unexpected, Lewis acid promoted displacement of latent reactive &#947;&#8208;amino group on cyclopentenone presented unparalleled opportunity for enone functionalization and annulations with indole derivatives, which is developed in the current study. Herein, a vast range of C3/N&#8208;indolyl enones and indole alkaloid&#8208;like compound were accessed in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and selectivity through a one&#8208;pot operation. The mechanism most likely involves an unprecedented trait of Piancatelli&#8208;type rearrangement where influence of the gem&#8208;diaryl group appeared crucial.

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive Cyanation and Phosphonylation of Secondary Amides by Iridium and Chiral Thiourea Sequential Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8827-8831, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been achieved by the combination of iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route for the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates from bench&#8208;stable feedstocks.







Abstract
The combination of transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis increasingly offers chemists opportunities to realize diverse unprecedented chemical transformations. By combining iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis, direct enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been accomplished for the first time for the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route to the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines from the simple, readily available feedstocks. In addition, the reactions are scalable and the thiourea catalyst can be recycled and reused.

         <title>A Long and Reversibly Self&#8208;Assembling 1D DNA Nanostructure Built from Triplex and Quadruplex Hybrid Tiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8722-8727, April 12, 2021. </description>

A new and reversible 1&#8208;dimensional DNA nanostructure, assembled from DNA triplexes and G&#8208;quadruplexes, is reported. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; nanostructures require potassium ions and acidic pH to form and are easily disassembled by removal of either requirement. We anticipate that they will find unique and varied application as communication modules, sensors, logic gates, and in diverse other uses of DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
We report a new DNA nanostructure, an extended 1&#8208;dimensional composite built for the first time out of structurally robust yet conveniently disassembled DNA triple helices, interspersed with short stretches of G&#8208;quadruplexes. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructures require potassium ions and modestly acidic pH for their formation and are easily disassembled by changes to either of these requirements. We initially prepared and characterized a &#8220;monomeric&#8221; TQ Hybrid tile; followed by &#8220;sticky&#8221; TQs tiles, incorporating unique guanine&#8208;only sticky ends, that enable efficient self&#8208;assembly via G&#8208;quartet formation of nanostructures &gt;150&#8197;nm in length, as seen with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We anticipate that such DNA TQ Hybrid structures will find unique and varied application as communication modules within larger nanostructures, and as sensors, logic gates, as well as in other aspects of DNA nanotechnology.

Fifteen global minima of the CE3M3+ (E=S&#8211;Te and M=Li&#8211;Cs) series contain a true planar hexacoordinate carbon. The chemical bonding analyses indicate that the carbon atom is covalently bonded to three chalcogens and ionically connected to the three alkali metals.







Abstract
Herein, the first global minima containing a planar hexacoordinate carbon (phC) atom are reported. The fifteen structures belong to the CE3M3+ (E=S&#8211;Te and M=Li&#8211;Cs) series and satisfy both geometric and electronic criteria to be considered as a true phC. The design strategy consisted of replacing oxygen in the D3h&#8197;CO3Li3+ structure with heavy and less electronegative chalcogens, inducing a negative charge on the C&#8197;atom and an attractive electrostatic interaction between C and the alkali&#8208;metal cations. The chemical bonding analyses indicate that carbon is covalently bonded to three chalcogens and ionically connected to the three alkali metals.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;EM Resolves Molecular Recognition Of An Optojasp Photoswitch Bound To Actin Filaments In Both Switch States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8678-8682, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting actin requires spatiotemporal control of drug activity. Optojasps are photo&#8208;switchable small molecules, providing direct optical spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton. We present high&#8208;resolution cryo&#8208;EM structures of both isomeric states of an optojasp bound to F&#8208;actin and describe in detail the binding pocket and conformational changes associated with switching of the azobenzene.







Abstract
Actin is essential for key processes in all eukaryotic cells. Cellpermeable optojasps provide spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton, confining toxicity and potentially rendering F&#8208;actin druggable by photopharmacology. Here, we report cryo electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) structures of both isomeric states of one optojasp bound to actin filaments. The high&#8208;resolution structures reveal for the first time the pronounced effects of photoswitching a functionalized azobenzene. By characterizing the optojasp binding site and identifying conformational changes within F&#8208;actin that depend on the optojasp isomeric state, we refine determinants for the design of functional F&#8208;actin photoswitches.

         <title>Bubble&#8208;Propelled Janus Gallium/Zinc Micromotors for the Active Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8750-8754, April 12, 2021. </description>

Janus Ga/Zn micromotors powered by bubbles are presented as an integrated platform with autonomous movement, self&#8208;degradability, and bacteriostatic capacity. The micromotors are applied to the active target treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.







Abstract
We report a bubble&#8208;propelled Janus gallium/zinc (Ga/Zn) micromotor with good biocompatibility and biodegradability for active target treatment of bacteria. The Janus Ga/Zn micromotors are fabricated by asymmetrically coating liquid metal Ga on Zn microparticles and display self&#8208;propulsion in simulated gastroenteric acid (pH&#8197;0.5) at a speed of up to 383&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, propelled by hydrogen bubbles generated by the zinc&#8211;acid reaction. This motion of Ga/Zn micromotors is enhanced by the Ga&#8211;Zn galvanic effect. The GaIII cations produced from the degradation of Ga/Zn micromotors serve as a built&#8208;in antibiotic agent. The movement improves the diffusion of GaIII and results in a significant increase of the antibacterial efficiency against H.&#8197;pylori, compared with passive Ga microparticles. Such Ga/Zn micromotors combine the self&#8208;propulsion, good biocompatibility and biodegradability, and Ga&#8208;based antibacterial properties, providing a proof of concept for the active treatment of bacterial infections.

         <title>A Facile Synthesized Polymer Featuring B&#8208;N Covalent Bond and Small Singlet&#8208;Triplet Gap for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>

An easily synthesized building block BNT and a relevant polymer PBNT&#8208;BDD featuring B&#8208;N covalent bond were synthesized for application in solar cells. The polymer offered a power conversion efficiency of 16.1&#8201;%, a nonradiative recombination energy loss of 0.19&#8197;eV, and a singlet&#8208;triplet gap as low as 0.15&#8197;eV, demonstrating the promising prospect of B&#8208;N&#8208;containing materials in organic photovoltaics.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) largely rely on polymer donors. Herein, we report a new building block BNT and a relevant polymer PBNT&#8208;BDD featuring B&#8208;N covalent bond for application in OSCs. The BNT unit is synthesized in only 3 steps, leading to the facile synthesis of PBNT&#8208;BDD. When blended with a nonfullerene acceptor Y6&#8208;BO, PBNT&#8208;BDD afforded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.1&#8201;% in an OSC, comparable to the benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (BDT)&#8208;based counterpart. The nonradiative recombination energy loss of 0.19&#8197;eV was afforded by PBNT&#8208;BDD. PBNT&#8208;BDD also exhibited weak crystallinity and appropriate miscibility with Y6&#8208;BO, benefitting of morphological stability. The singlet&#8211;triplet gap (&#916;EST) of PBNT&#8208;BDD is as low as 0.15&#8197;eV, which is much lower than those of common organic semiconductors (&#8805;0.6&#8197;eV). As a result, the triplet state of PBNT&#8208;BDD is higher than the charge transfer (CT) state, which would suppress the recombination via triplet state effectively.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Electric Coupling in a Cobalt(II)&#8208;Based Spin Triangle Revealed by Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Modulated Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8832-8838, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution describes the observation of spin&#8211;electric coupling utilizing electric&#8208;field&#8208;modulated ESR (EFM&#8208;ESR) spectroscopy for single&#8208;crystals of a spin triangle which is characterized by the strong magnetic anisotropy of the individual cobalt(II) centers and a pronounced sensitivity of the molecular energy levels on the relative orientation of their magnetic axes as well as the exchange coupling between them.







Abstract
A cobalt(II)&#8208;based spin triangle shows a significant spin&#8211;electric coupling. [Co3(pytag)(py)6Cl3]ClO4&#8901;3&#8201;py crystallizes in the acentric monoclinic space group P21. The intra&#8208;triangle antiferromagnetic interaction, of the order of ca. &#8722;15&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (H=&#8722;JSaSb), leads to spin frustration. The two expected energy&#8208;degenerate ground doublets are, however, separated by a few wavenumbers, as a consequence of magnetic anisotropy and deviations from threefold symmetry. The Co3&#8197;planes of symmetry&#8208;related molecules are almost parallel, allowing for the determination of the spin&#8211;electric properties of single crystals by EFM&#8208;ESR spectroscopy. The spin&#8211;electric effect detected when the electric field is applied in the Co3&#8197;plane was revealed by a shift in the resonance field. It was quantified as &#916;gE/E=0.11&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;m&#8201;V&#8722;1, which in terms of frequency corresponds to approximately 0.3&#8197;Hz&#8201;m&#8201;V&#8722;1. This value is comparable to what was determined for a Cu3&#8197;triangle despite the antiferromagnetic interaction being 20&#8197;times larger for the latter.

It was quantified as &#916;g&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;/E=0.11&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;m&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which in terms of frequency corresponds to approximately 0.3&#8197;Hz&#8201;m&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This value is comparable to what was determined for a Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;triangle despite the antiferromagnetic interaction being 20&#8197;times larger for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stable Thermotropic 3D and 2D Double Gyroid Nanostructures with Sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm Feature Size from Scalable Sugar&#8211;Polyolefin Conjugates</title>

Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight disaccharide&#8211;polyolefin conjugates with cellobiose, lactose and maltose head groups and atactic polypropene tails, such as 1, provide highly ordered and exceptionally stable thermotropic hexagonal perforated lamellar (HPL) and double gyroid (DG) nanostructured phases. The unique stability of this DG phase extends further down to the two&#8208;dimensional limit of 15 nm in which film thickness, l, is now less than the surface&#8208;oriented unit cell height, hDG.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight disaccharide&#8211;polyolefin conjugates with cellobiose, lactose and maltose head groups and atactic polypropene tails, such as 1, undergo a series of irreversible thermotropic order&#8211;order transitions with increasing temperature to provide nanostructured phases in the sequence: lamellar (L), hexagonal perforated lamellar (HPL), double gyroid (DG) and hexagonal cylindrical (C). The DG phase displays exceptional stability at ambient temperature and features two interpenetrating sugar domain networks having a sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm strut width and a lattice parameter, aDG, of 13.1&#8197;nm. The unique stability of this DG phase extends further within ultrathin films all the way down to the two&#8208;dimensional limit of 15&#8197;nm in which film thickness, l, is now less than the surface&#8208;oriented unit cell height, hDG. In addition to raising the fundamental question of what minimally constitutes a Schoen triply periodic minimal surface and DG lattice, these results serve to establish the class of sugar&#8211;polyolefin conjugates as a new material platform for nanoscience and nanotechnology.

The asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters has been achieved, in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities, employing sequence diverse metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs).







Abstract
N&#8208;Substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters are widely used as chiral intermediates in a range of pharmaceuticals. Here we report the enantioselective biocatalyic synthesis of N&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters through the direct reductive coupling of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters and amines employing sequence diverse metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs). Both enantiomers of N&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters were obtained with high conversion and excellent enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. In addition &gt;20 different preparative scale transformations were performed highlighting the scalability of this system.

         <title>Blatter&#8208;Radical&#8208;Grafted Mesoporous Silica as Prospective Nanoplatform for Spin Manipulation at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8683-8688, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely stable Blatter's type organic radicals grafted into the mesoporous silica show advanced relaxation properties at room temperature. Electron spin decoherence time exceeds that in many other qubit candidates, allowing efficient spin manipulation at ambient conditions. The tuneable multifunctional nature of such composite materials promotes them as promising nanoplatforms for developing new spin&#8208;based quantum bits.







Abstract
Quantum computing and quantum information processing (QC/QIP) crucially depend on the availability of suitable quantum bits (qubits) and methods of their manipulation. Most qubit candidates known to date are not applicable at ambient conditions. Herein, we propose radical&#8208;grafted mesoporous silica as a versatile and prospective nanoplatform for spin&#8208;based QC/QIP. Extremely stable Blatter&#8208;type organic radicals are used, whose electron spin decoherence time is profoundly long even at room temperature (up to Tm&#8776;2.3&#8197;&#956;s), thus allowing efficient spin manipulation by microwave pulses. The mesoporous structure of such composites is nuclear&#8208;spin free and provides additional opportunities of embedding guest molecules into the channels. Robustness and tunability of these materials promotes them as highly promising nanoplatforms for future QC/QIP developments.

         <title>A Desaturase&#8208;Like Enzyme Catalyzes Oxazole Formation in Pseudomonas Indolyloxazole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8781-8785, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolyloxazole alkaloids are widespread natural products with diverse bioactivities but previously unknown biosynthesis. Transposon mutagenesis, heterologous pathway expression, and labeling experiments provide evidence for a Pseudomonas pathway involving oxazole formation by cyclization as a new reaction type catalyzed by a desaturase&#8208;like enzyme.







Abstract
Indolyloxazole alkaloids occur in diverse micro&#8208; and macroorganisms and exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. Despite their ubiquitous occurrence and simple structures, the biosynthetic pathway remained unknown. Here, we used transposon mutagenesis in the labradorin producer Pseudomonas entomophila to identify a cryptic biosynthetic locus encoding an N&#8208;acyltransferase and a non&#8208;heme diiron desaturase&#8208;like enzyme. Heterologous expression in E. coli demonstrates that both enzymes are sufficient to produce indolyloxazoles. Probing their function in stable&#8208;isotope feeding experiments, we provide evidence for an unusual desaturase mechanism that generates the oxazole by decarboxylative cyclization.

&lt;p&gt;Indolyloxazole alkaloids are widespread natural products with diverse bioactivities but previously unknown biosynthesis. Transposon mutagenesis, heterologous pathway expression, and labeling experiments provide evidence for a &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; pathway involving oxazole formation by cyclization as a new reaction type catalyzed by a desaturase&#8208;like enzyme.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indolyloxazole alkaloids occur in diverse micro&#8208; and macroorganisms and exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. Despite their ubiquitous occurrence and simple structures, the biosynthetic pathway remained unknown. Here, we used transposon mutagenesis in the labradorin producer Pseudomonas entomophila to identify a cryptic biosynthetic locus encoding an N&#8208;acyltransferase and a non&#8208;heme diiron desaturase&#8208;like enzyme. Heterologous expression in E. coli demonstrates that both enzymes are sufficient to produce indolyloxazoles. Probing their function in stable&#8208;isotope feeding experiments, we provide evidence for an unusual desaturase mechanism that generates the oxazole by decarboxylative cyclization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chiral Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores by Self&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Coupling of Cationic Helicenes with Amines/Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8733-8738, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic dioxa[6]helicene oxidizes alkyl amines to enamines and further reacts in situ as an electrophile to form, in one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step cascades, fully delocalized mono or bis donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor coupling products. This original approach provides chiral cyanine&#8208;like chromophores that absorb up to the NIR and fluoresce alike, with intense NIR ECD (&#916;&#1013; up to 60&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1). DFT showcases the importance of conformers in the strong chiroptical response.







Abstract
In one pot, tertiary alkyl amines are oxidized to enamines by cationic dioxa[6]helicene, which further reacts as electrophile and oxidant to form mono or bis donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor coupling products. This original and convergent synthetic approach provides a strong extension of conjugation yielding chromophores that absorb intensively in far&#8208;red or NIR domains (&#955;max up to 791&#8197;nm) and fluoresce in the NIR as well (&#955;max up to 887&#8197;nm). Intense ECD properties around 790&#8197;nm with a |&#916;&#1013;| value up to 60&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 are observed.

         <title>Implications of Quenching&#8208;to&#8208;Dequenching Switch in Quantitative Cell Uptake and Biodistribution of Dye&#8208;Labeled Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general strategy to carry out cell uptake and biodistribution studies is to label nanoparticles (NPs) with a fluorescent dye. However, the comparative study of different dye&#8208;loaded NPs remains difficult due to uncontrolled dye quenching and de&#8208;quenching. Here we compared two types of dye&#8208;labeled NPs and demonstrated their distinct properties. NPs with dye molecules at a solid state suffer from dye quenching, so the dye release and/or NP degradation in biological environments leads to a several&#8208;fold increase of fluorescence intensity despite the same amount of NPs, due to the state switch from quenching to de&#8208;quenching. In contrast, NPs with dye molecules at a soluble state exhibit no quenching effect. To standardize the comparative study, we propose two possible solutions: using lower dye loading, or using medium analysis for quantifying cell uptake of NPs. This work provides valuable insights into selecting valid quantification methods for bio&#8208;nano studies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A couple of enantiomers of 2, 6&#8208;diaminotriptycene (  R, R  &#8208;  1  and  S, S  &#8208;  1  ) are split by chiral HPLC and their absolute configurations are identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technology. Using the enantiomers as monomers, a couple of chiral porous polyimides (  R  &#8208;  FTPI  and  S  &#8208;  FTPI  ) are prepared by polycondensation reactions and display good heat stability, high BET surface area and good solubility in organic solvents. Moreover, both of  R  &#8208;  FTPI  and  S  &#8208;  FTPI  can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with symmetrical chiral selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Ketones from Methyl Esters by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct conversion of alkyl esters to ketones has been hindered by the sluggish reactivity of the starting materials and the susceptibility of the product towards subsequent nucleophilic attack. We have now achieved a cross&#8208;coupling approach to this transformation using nickel, a bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, and alkyl organoboron coupling partners. 65 alkyl ketones bearing diverse functional groups and heterocyclic scaffolds have been synthesized with this method. Catalyst&#8208;controlled chemoselectivity is observed for C(acyl)&#8211;O bond activation of multi&#8208;functional substrates bearing other bonds prone to cleavage by Ni, including aryl ether, aryl fluoride, and N&#8208;Ph amide functional groups. Density functional theory calculations provide mechanistic support for a Ni(0)/Ni(II) catalytic cycle and demonstrate how stabilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions between the bulky catalyst and substrate are critical for the reaction&#8217;s success.</dc:description>

         <title>Light Emitting Metal&#8208;Organic Halide 1D and 2D Structures: Near&#8208;unity Quantum Efficiency, Low&#8208;loss Optical Waveguide and Highly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8722;inorganic metal&#8208;halide materials (OIMMs) with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structure have recently attracted increasing attention owing to their excellent optical properties and widely photo&#8208;functional applications. However, successful examples of 0D structural OIMMs with well&#8208;defined optical&#160; performance at micro&#8208;/nanometer size are still quite limited. Here, we design and synthesise&#160; a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) (DTA)  2  SbCl  5  &#183;DTAC (DTAC=Dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) single crystal micro&#8208;rod and 2D micro&#8208;plates with 0D structure, in which individual (SbCl  5  )  2&#8208;  quadrangular units are completely isolated and surrounded by the organic cation DTA  +  . Experimental results indicate that the organic molecular unit with a long alkyl chain (C  12  ) and three methyl groups enables the formation of micro&#8208;rods and micro&#8208;plates. The single crystal micro&#8208; rods/plates exhibit a broadband orange emission peak at 610 nm with a photoluminescence&#160; quantum yield (PLQY) of around 90% and a large Stokes shift of 260 nm under photoexcitation. The broad emission originates from self&#8208;trapping excitons as determined by the joint experiment&#8208;theory studies. Spatially resolved PL spectra confirm that the micro&#8208;rods exhibit an optical waveguide effect with low waveguide loss coefficient (0.0019 dB &#956;m  &#8208;1  ) during propagation, and linear polarized photoemission with polarization contrast (0.57). These features present a new direction towards the design of 0D OIMMs with various morphologies, which also further extend the applications of 0D OIMMs to potential optical communication micro&#8208;devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient (&gt;20%) and Stable All&#8208;inorganic Cesium Lead Triiodide Solar Cell Enabled by Thiocyanate Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Besides widely&#8208;used surface passivation, engineering the film crystallization is an important and more fundamental route to improve the performance of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells. Herein, we have developed a urea&#8208;ammonium thiocyanate (UAT) molten salt modification strategy to fully release and exploit coordination activities of SCN&#8208; to deposit high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 film for efficient and stable all&#8208;inorganic solar cells. The UAT is derived by the hydrogen bond interactions between urea and NH4+ from NH4SCN. With the UAT, the crystal quality of the CsPbI3 film has been significantly improved and a long single&#8208;exponential charge recombination lifetime of over 30 ns has been achieved. With these benefits, the cell efficiency has been promoted to over 20% (steady&#8208;state efficiency of 19.2%) with excellent operational stability over 1000 h. These results demonstrate a promising development route of the CsPbI3 related photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Freezing&#8208;assisted Conjugation of Unmodified Diblock DNA to Hydrogel Nanoparticles and Monoliths for DNA and Hg2+ Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acrydite&#8208;modified DNA is the most frequently used reagent to prepare DNA&#8208;functionalized hydrogels. Herein, we show that unmodified penta&#8208;adenine (A5) can reach up to 75% conjugation efficiency in 8 h under a freezing polymerization condition in polyacrylamide hydrogels. DNA incorporation efficiency was reduced by forming duplex or other folded structures and by removing the freezing condition. By designing diblock DNA containing an A5 block, various functional DNA sequences were attached. Such hydrogels were designed for ultrasensitive DNA hybridization and Hg2+ detection, with detection limits of 50 pM and 10 nM, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of using unmodified DNA to replace acrydite&#8208;DNA. The same method worked for both gel nanoparticles and monoliths. This work revealed interesting reaction products by exploiting freezing and has provided a cost&#8208;effective way to attach DNA to hydrogels.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin has dramatic consequences on the solution behaviour of molybdates. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis (SAXS) reveals the formation of large nanoscopic Mo&#8208;based oligomers that give rise to the fast formation of supramolecular core&#8211;shell type systems. This behaviour has been attributed to the chaotropic effect able to amplify very weak supramolecular interaction and then generates sophisticated non&#8208;covalent hierarchical assemblies.







Abstract
Herein, we show how the chaotropic effect arising from reduced molybdate ions in acidified aqueous solution is able to amplify drastically weak supramolecular interactions. Time&#8208;resolved Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) analysis suggests that molybdenum&#8208;blue oligomeric species form huge aggregates in the presence of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) which results in the fast formation of nanoscopic {Mo154}&#8208;based host&#8208;guest species, while X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the ending&#8208;point of the scenario results in an unprecedented three&#8208;component well&#8208;ordered core&#8211;shell&#8208;like motif. A similar arrangement was found by using preformed hexarhenium chalcogenide&#8208;type cluster [Re6Te8(CN)6]4&#8722; as exogenous guest. This seminal work brings better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly processes in general and gives new opportunities for practical applications in the design of complex multicomponent materials via the simplicity of the non&#8208;covalent chemistry.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Catabolic Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanosponge for Programmable Drug Delivery and Efficient Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exquisite cascade DNAzyme&#8208;sustained gene silencing platform was assembled to program the &#8220;mask&#8208;cleave&#8208;release&#8221; of therapeutic DNAzyme from the intelligent DNAzyme nanosponge, where the upstream self&#8208;catabolic DNAzyme mediated the specific and accurate activation of downstream therapeutic DNAzyme for guaranteeing the efficient gene silencing with improved bioavailability.







Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy holds immense prospects for effectively treating severe diseases, yet is constrained with inefficient delivery and unconditional activation. Herein, we designed a bioinspired self&#8208;catabolic DNA nanocapsule for sustaining tumor&#8208;specific cascade activation of therapeutic DNAzyme. The exquisite DNAzyme was temporarily masked by the self&#8208;excising DNAzyme in the hierarchical rolling circle replication (RCR) nanostructures, thus stayed in an inactive state in physiological fluids. Through the multivalent tumor&#8208;anchoring aptamer strands, the RCR nanocapsule was specifically accumulated in cancer cells and was sequentially activated for motivating the ultimate DNAzyme&#8208;mediated gene silencing via the intelligent stimuli&#8208;responsive cascade DNAzyme activation. By virtue of the programmable RCR assembly strategy, our compact DNAzyme nanoplatform shows great promise for developing versatile smart gene therapeutics and personalized nanomedicines.

         <title>Effective Encapsulation of C60 by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Polyamide Macrocyclic Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ditopic flexible benzylic amide macrocycle was employed as an organic ligand for the assembly of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These reticular materials form non&#8208;interpenetrated channels with a remarkable solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46&#8201;%. The incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pockets of these materials was studied, and C60 was able to occupy an impressive 98&#8201;% of them. These materials were selective for the recognition of C60 in the presence of the larger C70.







Abstract
A flexible benzylic amide macrocycle, functionalized with two carboxylic acid groups, was employed as the organic ligand for the preparation of robust copper(II)&#8208; and zinc(II)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These polymers crystallized in the C2/m space group of the monoclinic crystal system, creating non&#8208;interpenetrated channels in one direction with an extraordinary solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46&#8201;%. Unlike metal&#8211;organic rotaxane frameworks having benzylic amide macrocycles as linkers, the absence of the thread in these novel reticular materials causes a decrease of dimensionality and an improvement of pore size and dynamic guest adaptability. We studied the incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pocket generated between two macrocycles connected to the same dinuclear clusters, occupying a remarkable 98&#8201;% of the cavities inside the network. The use of these materials as hosts for the selective recognition of different fullerenes was evaluated, mainly encapsulating the smaller size fullerene derivative in several mixtures of C60 and C70.

         <title>Solar and Visible Light Assisted Peptide Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide coupling reaction is described that relies mechanistically on sunlight activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent in situ. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
Amino acid and peptide couplings are widely used in fields related to pharma and materials. Still, current peptide synthesis continues to rely on the use of expensive, water sensitive, and waste&#8208;generating coupling reagents, which are often prepared in multi&#8208;step sequences and used in excess. Herein is described a peptide coupling reaction design that relies mechanistically on sun&#8208;light activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent in situ. The resulting coupling method is rapid, does not require dry solvents or inert atmosphere, and is compatible with all the most common amino acids and protecting groups. Peptide couplings can be run on gram&#8208;scale, without the use of special equipment. This method has a significantly reduced environmental and financial footprint compared to standard peptide coupling reactions. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.

The resulting coupling method is rapid, does not require dry solvents or inert atmosphere, and is compatible with all the most common amino acids and protecting groups. Peptide couplings can be run on gram&#8208;scale, without the use of special equipment. This method has a significantly reduced environmental and financial footprint compared to standard peptide coupling reactions. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The hydrotropic effect of ionic liquids in water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have successfully expanded the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes beyond 2&#160;V. Further improvements in stability can be achieved by partially substituting water with either classical organic solvents or ionic liquids. Here, we study ternary electrolytes composed of LiTFSI, water, and imidazolium ionic liquids. We find that the LiTFSI solubility strongly increases from 21&#160;mol/kg in water to up to 60 mol/kg in the presence of ionic liquid. The solution structure is investigated with Raman and NMR spectroscopy and the enhanced LiTFSI solubility is found to originate from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. The increased reductive stability of the ternary electrolytes enables stable cycling of an aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery with an energy density of 150&#160;Wh/kg on the active material level based on commercially relevant Li4Ti5O12 and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Cooperated Catalytic Mechanism of Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8208;N4 and Zn&#8208;N4 for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual metal single atom catalysts exhibit superior performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, the synergistic catalytic mechanism is not deeply understood. Herein, we report a dual metal single atom catalyst consisted of Cu&#8208;N4  and Zn&#8208;N4  on the N&#8208;doped carbon support (Cu/Zn&#8208;NC). It exhibits high&#8208;efficiency ORR activity with an  E  onset  of 0.98 V and an  E  1/2  of 0.83 V, excellent stability (no degradation after 10000 cycles), surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and great mass of Pt&#8208;free single atom catalysts. Operando XANES demonstrates that the Cu&#8208;N4  as active center experiences the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8208;N4  during ORR process, and then turns to single atom state again after reaction. DFT calculation further indicates that the adjustment effect of Zn on the d&#8208;orbital electron distribution of Cu could benefit to the stretch and cleavage of O&#8208;O on Cu active center, speeding up the process of rate determining step of OOH*.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Metal Substitution in Tuning Anion Redox in Sodium Metal Layered Oxides Revealed by X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy and Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The link between the high&#8208;valent structure of P2&#8208;type sodium layered transition metal oxides and the redox properties involving oxygen redox is demonstrated. By substituting Fe with Cu and Ni from P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2, the antisite&#8208;vacancy defect formation is controlled during desodiation of the positive electrodes. Ligand to metal charge transfer and the O 2p state near the Fermi level evoke and stabilize oxygen redox from the electrodes.







Abstract
We investigate high&#8208;valent oxygen redox in the positive Na&#8208;ion electrode P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 (NMF) where Fe is partially substituted with Cu (P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Mn0.66Fe0.20Cu0.14]O2, NMFC) or Ni (P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Mn0.65Fe0.20Ni0.15]O2, NMFN). From combined analysis of resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering and X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge structure with electrochemical voltage hysteresis and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function profiles, we correlate structural disorder with high&#8208;valent oxygen redox and its improvement by Ni or Cu substitution. Density of states calculations elaborate considerable anionic redox in NMF and NMFC without the widely accepted requirement of an A&#8208;O&#8208;A&#8242; local configuration in the pristine materials (where A=Na and A&#8242;=Li, Mg, vacancy, etc.). We also show that the Jahn&#8211;Teller nature of Fe4+ and the stabilization mechanism of anionic redox could determine the extent of structural disorder in the materials. These findings shed light on the design principles in TM and anion redox for positive electrodes to improve the performance of Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Decarboxylative Polyfluoroarylation of Alkylcarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed decarboxylative polyfluoroarylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids is reported. The defluorinative C&#8722;C bond formation through a radical process enables expedient access to polyfluoroaromatics from abundant carboxylic acids.







Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are useful building blocks in several areas such as drug discovery, materials, and crop protection. Herein, we report the first polyfluoroarylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids via photoredox decarboxylation. The method proceeds with broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Moreover, small complex molecules such as natural products and drugs can be modified by late&#8208;stage modification.

         <title>Impact of In&#8208;Cell and In&#8208;Vitro Crowding on the Conformations and Dynamics of an Intrinsically Disordered Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy reveals the effects of intracellular crowding on the dimensions and dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins.







Abstract
The conformations and dynamics of proteins can be influenced by crowding from the large concentrations of macromolecules within cells. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exhibit chain compaction in crowded solutions in vitro, but no such effects were observed in cultured mammalian cells. Here, to increase intracellular crowding, we reduced the cell volume by hyperosmotic stress and used an IDP as a crowding sensor for in&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy. In these more crowded cells, the IDP exhibits compaction, slower chain dynamics, and much slower translational diffusion, indicating a pronounced concentration and length&#8208;scale dependence of crowding. In vitro, these effects cannot be reproduced with small but only with large polymeric crowders. The observations can be explained with polymer theory and depletion interactions and indicate that IDPs can diffuse much more efficiently through a crowded cytosol than a globular protein of similar dimensions.

         <title>Enhanced Catalysis under 2D Silica: A CO Oxidation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO oxidation taking place under a 2D microporous silicon dioxide film demonstrates a &#8764;12&#8201;% enhancement in CO2 production by creating an interfacial microenvironment that fosters a higher coverage of reactive Pd surface oxide sites that are integral to CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Interfacially confined microenvironments have recently gained attention in catalysis, as they can be used to modulate reaction chemistry. The emergence of a 2D nanospace at the interface between a 2D material and its support can promote varying kinetic and energetic schemes based on molecular level confinement effects imposed in this reduced volume. We report on the use of a 2D oxide cover, bilayer silica, on catalytically active Pd(111) undergoing the CO oxidation reaction. We &#8220;uncover&#8221; mechanistic insights about the structure&#8211;activity relationship with and without a 2D silica overlayer using in situ IR and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. We find that the CO oxidation reaction on Pd(111) benefits from confinement effects imposed on surface adsorbates under 2D silica. This interaction results in a lower and more dispersed coverage of CO adsorbates with restricted CO adsorption geometries, which promote oxygen adsorption and lay the foundation for the formation of a reactive surface oxide that produces higher CO2 formation rates than Pd alone.

     alt="Enhanced Catalysis under 2D Silica: A CO Oxidation Study"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO oxidation taking place under a 2D microporous silicon dioxide film demonstrates a &#8764;12&#8201;% enhancement in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production by creating an interfacial microenvironment that fosters a higher coverage of reactive Pd surface oxide sites that are integral to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfacially confined microenvironments have recently gained attention in catalysis, as they can be used to modulate reaction chemistry. The emergence of a 2D nanospace at the interface between a 2D material and its support can promote varying kinetic and energetic schemes based on molecular level confinement effects imposed in this reduced volume. We report on the use of a 2D oxide cover, bilayer silica, on catalytically active Pd(111) undergoing the CO oxidation reaction. We &#8220;uncover&#8221; mechanistic insights about the structure&#8211;activity relationship with and without a 2D silica overlayer using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; IR and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. We find that the CO oxidation reaction on Pd(111) benefits from confinement effects imposed on surface adsorbates under 2D silica. This interaction results in a lower and more dispersed coverage of CO adsorbates with restricted CO adsorption geometries, which promote oxygen adsorption and lay the foundation for the formation of a reactive surface oxide that produces higher CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation rates than Pd alone.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Effect of Zinc&#8208;Doping on the Reduction of the Hot&#8208;Carrier Cooling Rate in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper Zn&#8208;doping (0.34&#8201;%) in perovskites is found to be able to significantly slowdown the hot&#8208;carrier cooling, the cooling rate of the 500&#8197;K hot&#8208;carriers can be reduced down to one third of the un&#8208;doped sample. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations uncover the mechanisms of such efficient retardation of the hot&#8208;carrier cooling via Zn&#8208;doping.







Abstract
The fast hot&#8208;carrier cooling process in the solar&#8208;absorbers fundamentally limits their photon&#8208;conversion efficiencies. It is highly desirable to develop a solar absorber with long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carriers at sun&#8208;illumination intensity, which can be used to develop the hot&#8208;carrier solar cells with enhanced efficiency. Herein, we reveal that zinc&#8208;doped (0.34&#8201;%) halide perovskites have the slower hot&#8208;carrier cooling compared with the pristine sample through the transient absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. The hot&#8208;carrier energy loss rate at the low photoexcitation level of 1017&#8197;cm&#8722;3 is found to be &#8776;3 times smaller than that of un&#8208;doped perovskites for T=500&#8197;K hot carriers, and up to ten times when the hot&#8208;carrier temperature approaches the lattice temperature. The incorporation of zinc&#8208;dopant into perovskites can reduce the nonadiabatic couplings between conduction bands, which retards the photogenerated hot&#8208;carriers relaxation processes. Our findings present a practical strategy to slow down the hot&#8208;carrier cooling in perovskites at low carrier densities, which would be invaluable for the further development of practical hot&#8208;carrier photovoltaics based on perovskites.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Toward a Photoinduced Single&#8208;Chain Magnet Showing High Coercivity Values</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced spin&#8208;crossover switchable single&#8208;chain magnet was discovered in an asymmetric ditopic ligand&#8208;containing cyanide&#8208;bridged compound. A photoinduced opening hysteresis with the highest coercive field of 1.3&#8197;T was realized in pure 3d metal&#8208;based molecular magnets.







Abstract
The production of photo&#8208;switchable molecular nanomagnets with substantial coercivity, which is indispensable for information storage and process applications, is challenging. Introducing photo&#8208;responsive spin&#8208;crossover units provides a feasible means of controlling the magnetic anisotropy, interactions, and overall nanomagnet properties. Herein, we report a cyanide&#8208;bridged chain 1&#8901;12H2O ({[(PzTp)FeIII(CN)3]2FeII(Pmat)2}n&#8901;12&#8201;H2O) generated by linking the FeII&#8208;based spin&#8208;crossover unit with the [(PzTp)Fe(CN)3]&#8722; (PzTp: tetrakis(pyrazolyl)borate) building block in the presence of asymmetric ditopic ligand Pmat ((4&#8208;pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyleneamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole). Structural characterization revealed that the introduction of this asymmetric ligand led to a distorted coordination environment of FeII ions, which were equatorially coordinated by four cyanide N atoms, and apically coordinated by one pyridine N atom and one triazole N atom. Upon 808&#8208;nm light irradiation, 1&#8901;12H2O underwent photoinduced spin&#8208;crossover and exhibited single&#8208;chain magnet behavior with a coercive field of up to 1.3&#8197;T. This represents a 3d&#8208;based photoinduced single&#8208;chain magnet exhibiting pronounced hysteresis.

         <title>Prebiotic Phosphorylation and Concomitant Oligomerization of Deoxynucleosides to form DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides under plausible prebiotic conditions with diamidophosphate gives rise to 5&#8242;&#8208;amidophosphorylated nucleotides and concomitantly to the 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;linked DNA oligomers. This direct conversion of deoxynucleosides to DNA oligonucleotides in a single pot scenario&#8212;under conditions compatible with ribonucleosides&#8212;sets the stage for the potential emergence of RNA and DNA from mixtures of nucleosides.







Abstract
Recent demonstrations of RNA&#8211;DNA chimeras (RDNA) enabling RNA and DNA replication, coupled with prebiotic co&#8208;synthesis of deoxyribo&#8208; and ribo&#8208;nucleotides, have resurrected the hypothesis of co&#8208;emergence of RNA and DNA. As further support, we show that diamidophosphate (DAP) with 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (amido)phosphorylates and oligomerizes deoxynucleosides to form DNA&#8212;under conditions similar to those of ribonucleosides. The pyrimidine deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;amidophosphates are formed in good (&#8776;60&#8201;%) yields. Intriguingly, the presence of pyrimidine deoxynucleos(t)ides increased the yields of purine deoxynucleotides (&#8776;20&#8201;%). Concomitantly, oligomerization (&#8776;18&#8211;31&#8201;%) is observed with predominantly 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;phosphodiester DNA linkages, and some (&lt;5&#8201;%) pyrophosphates. Combined with previous observations of DAP&#8208;mediated chemistries and the constructive role of RDNA chimeras, the results reported here help set the stage for systematic investigation of a systems chemistry approach of RNA&#8211;DNA coevolution.

         <title>Ultrastable and Efficient Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 Reduction Triggered by Regenerative Oxygen&#8208;vacancies in Bi2O2CO3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface vacancies can exert positive impact on CO2 photoreduction activity, yet difficultly maintaining long&#8208;term stability. Herein, we first design a fast low&#8208;pressure ultraviolet light irradiation strategy for easily regenerating the nearly equivalent surface vacancies, thus concurrently optimizing CO2 photoreduction activity and stability. Taking the defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets as an example, nearly equal amount of oxygen vacancies can be regenerated under UV light irradiation. Synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8211;ray photoelectron spectra disclose the Bi sites in the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets can act as the highly active sites, which not only help to activate CO2 molecules, but also contribute to stabilizing the rate&#8208;limiting COOH* intermediate. Also, in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ mass spectrometry unravel the UV light irradiation contributes to accelerating CO desorption process. As a result, the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets achieve a stability up to 2640 h over 110 cycling tests and a high evolution rate of 275 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO. This study offers a new way for developing sustainable CO2 reduction photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrocarbons Separation and Purification with Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrocarbons, including methane, ethene, propene, para&#8208;xylene and ortho&#8208;xylene, are of great significance in current and future chemical industry. Separation and purification of hydrocarbons, such as methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, propene/propane and separation of C8 aromatics, are important processes. Nevertheless, traditional distillation&#8208;based separation accounts for a large portion of the world&#8217;s energy consumption. Porous materials&#8208;based separation is believed to be a promising alternative technology with lower energy consumption and operational cost. This review focuses on the developments of the adsorptive separation of methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, propene/propane mixtures as well as on the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e., xylene isomers) with a wide variety of materials, including carbonaceous materials, zeolites, metal&#8208;organic frameworks and porous&#8208;organic frameworks. Some recent important developments for these adsorptive separations are also highlighted. The advantages and disadvantages of each material category are discussed and guidelines for the design of improved materials are proposed. Furthermore, challenges and future developments of each material type and separation processes are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Reorganization of self&#8208;assembled DNA&#8208;based polymers using orthogonally addressable building blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature uses the breaking and making of non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve the reversible formation and structural reconfiguration of biopolymers, a strategy that permits dynamic adaptation in response to external cues and to changes in the environment. Inspired by this observation and taking advantage of the addressability and programmability of DNA/DNA non&#8208;covalent interactions we report here the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that self&#8208;assemble into polymer&#8208;like structures that can be reconfigured and reorganized by external inputs. The different tiles share the same 5&#8208;nucleotide sticky ends responsible for self&#8208;assembly but are rationally designed to contain a specific regulator&#8208;binding domain that can be orthogonally targeted by different DNA regulator strands (activators and inhibitors). We show that by sequentially adding specific activators and inhibitors it is possible to re&#8208;organize in a dynamic and reversible way the formed polymer&#8208;like structures to display well&#8208;defined distributions: homopolymers made of a single tile, random polymers in which different tiles are distributed randomly and block structures in which the tiles are organized in segments. The versatility of the systems presented in this study shows the ease with which DNA&#8208;based addressable monomers can be designed to create reconfigurable synthetic micron&#8208;scale DNA structures offering a new approach to the growing field of supramolecular polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Triplet Blinking Using Cyclooctatetraene to Access the Dynamics of Biomolecules at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore the dynamics of biomolecules, tracing the kinetics of photo&#8208;induced chemical reactions via the triplet excited state (T1) of probe molecules offers a timescale that is ~10^6  &#160;  times wider than via the singlet excited state (S1). Here, using cyclooctatetraene (COT) as a triplet energy acceptor and at the same time as a photostabilizer, the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTET) kinetics governed by oligonucleotide (oligo) dynamics were studied at the single&#8208;molecule level by measuring fluorescence blinking. TTET kinetics measurement allowed us to access the length&#8208; and sequence&#8208;dependent dynamics of oligos, and realize the single&#8208;molecule detection of a model microRNA biomarker. In sharp contrast to the singlet&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that occurs in the 1&#8211;10 nm range, TTET requires a Van der Waals contact. Thus, the present method serves as a complementary method to FRET and provides direct information on biomolecular dynamics on the &#956;s to ms timescale.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Assemblies of Thiophosphopeptides Instantly Target Golgi Apparatus and Selectively Kill Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Golgi apparatus is emerging as a key signaling hub of cells and an important target for cancer therapy, but there are few approaches for targeting Golgi and selectively killing cancer cells. Here we show an unexpected result that changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phosphopeptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S&#8208;phosphate to the C&#8208;terminal of a self&#8208;assembling peptide generates a thiophosphopeptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP&#8208;catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self&#8208;assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi by themselves and with Golgi proteins. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (e.g., HeLa) with the IC  50  (about 3 &#956;M), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide. This work, as the first report of thiophosphopeptide for targeting Golgi, illustrates a new molecular platform for designing enzyme and redox responsive molecules that target subcellular compartment for functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Selective Protection of Peptides from Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic nanoparticles act as protecting agents for peptides from enzymatic action, enabling selective proteolysis of peptides in a mixture and selective hydrolysis at degenerate cleavage sites.







Abstract
Proteolysis of proteins and peptides is involved in the infection of cells by enveloped viruses and also in the invasion and spread of cancer cells. Shutting down broad&#8208;specificity proteases, however, is problematic because normal functions by these proteases will be affected. Herein, nanoparticle receptors were prepared from molecular imprinting for complex biological peptides. Their strong and selective binding enabled them to protect their targeted sequences from proteolysis in aqueous solution at stoichiometric amounts. Generality of the method was demonstrated by the protection of hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides from different proteases, selective protection of a segment of a long peptide, and selective protection of a targeted peptide in a mixture. Most interestingly, two receptors targeting different parts of a long peptide could work in cooperation to protect the overall sequence, highlighting the versatility of the method.

         <title>One&#8208;step Ethylene Purification from an Acetylene/Ethylene/Ethane Ternary Mixture by Cyclopentadiene Cobalt&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new modification method for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can realize one&#8208;step purification of ethylene in ternary gas mixture with a single adsorbent. 







Abstract
The separation of ethylene (C2H4) from a mixture of ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), and acetylene (C2H2) at normal temperature and pressure is a significant challenge. The sieving effect of pores is powerless due to the similar molecular size and kinetic diameter of these molecules. We report a new modification method based on a stable ftw topological Zr&#8208;MOF platform (MOF&#8208;525). Introduction of a cyclopentadiene cobalt functional group led to new ftw&#8208;type MOFs materials (UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613), which increase the host&#8208;guest interaction and achieve efficient ethylene purification from the mixture of hydrocarbon gases. The high performance of UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613 for C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 separation has been verified by gas sorption isotherms, density functional theory (DFT), and experimentally determined breakthrough curves. This work provides a one&#8208;step separation of the ternary gas mixture and can further serve as a blueprint for the design and construction of function&#8208;oriented porous structures for such applications.

         <title>A Balance Between Capture and Release: How Nanochaperones Regulate Refolding of Thermally Denatured Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two working mechanisms of nanochaperones in regulating the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme were fully deciphered. The balance between the capture and release of client proteins that are controlled by nanochaperones plays a key role in regulating the refolding of denatured proteins, regardless of the ATP&#8208;independent or ATP&#8208;dependent chaperones.







Abstract
Nanochaperones have been designed and used for regulating the (re)folding of proteins, treating protein misfolding&#8208;related diseases, and, more recently, in drug delivery. Despite various successes, a complete understanding of the working mechanisms remains elusive, which represents a challenge for the realization of their full potential. Here, we thoroughly investigated the functioning of differently charged nanochaperones that regulate the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme. We found that the balance between the capture and release of lysozyme clients that are controlled by nanochaperones plays a key role in regulating refolding. More importantly, the findings could be applied to other enzymes with various physicochemical properties. On the basis of these results, we could recover the activity of enzymes with high efficiency either after 20&#8197;days of storage at 40&#8201;&#176;C or heating at high temperatures for 30&#8211;60&#8197;min. Our results provide important new design strategies for nanochaperone systems to improve their properties and expand their applications.

         <title>Unprecedented 2D Homochiral Hybrid Lead&#8208;Iodide Perovskite Thermochromic Ferroelectrics with Ferroelastic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D homochiral lead&#8208;iodide perovskites were constructed by the introduction of a chiral center. The perovskites exhibit coexisting ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and reversible thermochromism, offering great application prospects for next&#8208;generation smart devices.







Abstract
Chiral perovskites have emerged as a significant class of materials showing promising optoelectronic and spintronic applications. Reports of chiral perovskite ferroelectrics, however, have been scarce. In this work, we have successfully synthesized homochiral lead&#8211;iodide perovskite ferroelectrics [(R)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 and [(S)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 by introducing a methyl group into the organic cation of the parent (N&#8208;benzylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium)PbI4. Vibrational circular dichroism spectra identify the chiral mirroring relationship. They both undergo 222F2&#8208;type paraelectric&#8211;ferroelectric behavior at around 378&#8197;K coupled with clear ferroelastic domain &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switching. Besides, they exhibit an evident thermochromism with color change from orange&#8211;yellow to orange&#8211;red. To our knowledge, the discovery of integrated ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and reversible thermochromism in chiral perovskites is unprecedented.

         <title>Implantable Biosupercapacitor Inspired by the Cellular Redox System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study describes an implantable supercapacitor using NAD+, which is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction.







Abstract
The carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn supercapacitor has high potential for in vivo energy storage because it can be used in aqueous environments and stitched to inner parts of the body, such as blood vessels. The biocompatibility issue for frequently used pseudocapacitive materials, such as metal oxides, is controversial in the human body. Here, we report an implantable CNT yarn supercapacitor inspired by the cellular redox system. In all living cells, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Based on this redox system, CNT yarn electrodes were fabricated by inserting a twist in CNT sheets with electrochemically deposited NAD and benzoquinone for redox shuttling. Consequently, the NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes exhibited the maximum area capacitance (55.73&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under physiological conditions, such as phosphate&#8208;buffered saline and serum. In addition, the yarn electrodes showed a negligible loss of capacitance after 10&#8201;000 repeated charge/discharge cycles and deformation tests (bending/knotting). More importantly, NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes implanted into the abdominal cavity of a rat's skin exhibited the stable in vivo electrical performance of a supercapacitor. Therefore, these findings demonstrate a redox biomolecule&#8208;applied platform for implantable energy storage devices.

         <title>Rotaxanes as Cages to Control DNA Binding, Cytotoxicity, and Cellular Uptake of a Small Molecule**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties including low bioavailability and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. Herein we demonstrate the potential for using mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane, leading to enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity in cancer cells compared to the &#8220;uncaged&#8221; metallodrug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity and translocation to the cell nucleus.







Abstract
The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties, such as poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. To combat this, various drug carriers have been investigated to enhance the pharmacological profile of therapeutic agents. In this work, we demonstrate the use of mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane. More specifically, we report the synthesis of rotaxanes incorporating as a stoppering unit a known G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binder, namely a PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This compound cannot interact with DNA when it is part of the mechanically interlocked assembly. The second rotaxane stopper can be cleaved by either light or an esterase, releasing the PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This system shows enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity within osteosarcoma cells compared to the free drug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity, arising from the translocation of PtII&#8208;salphen to the nucleus and its binding to DNA.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of 3d&#8208;Block Metal (Hydro)oxides by Ligand&#8208;Induced Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general ligand&#8208;induced conversion strategy was proposed to boost the electrocatalytic activities of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides. After the introduction of an organic ligand, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) increased by &#8776;5.7 times.







Abstract
The 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal (hydro)oxides belong to a group of highly efficient, scalable and inexpensive electrocatalysts for widespread energy&#8208;related applications that feature easily tailorable crystal and electronic structures. We propose a general strategy to further boost their electrocatalytic activities by introducing organic ligands into the framework, considering that most 3d&#8208;metal (hydro)oxides usually exhibit quite strong binding with reaction intermediates and thus compromised activity due to the scaling relations. Involving weakly bonded ligands downshifts the d&#8208;band center, which narrows the band gap, and optimizes the adsorption of these intermediates. For example, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be greatly promoted by &#8776;5.7 times over a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) after a terephthalic acid (TPA)&#8208;induced conversion process, arising from the reduced energy barrier of the deprotonation of OH* to O*. Impressively, the proposed ligand&#8208;induced conversion strategy is applicable to a series of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides, including NiFe2O4, NiCo2O4, and NiZn LDH, providing a general structural upgrading scheme for existing high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Rhodium Catalyzed Regioselective C&#8722;H Allylation of Simple Arenes via C&#8722;C Bond Activation of Gem&#8208;difluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium catalyzed C(aryl)&#8722;C(allyl) bond&#8208;forming reaction is achieved via a combination of C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C activation. Gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates, enabling C&#8722;H allylation of a variety of simple arenes under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a rhodium catalyzed directing&#8208;group free regioselective C&#8722;H allylation of simple arenes. Readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates via a sequence of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F bond activation, providing allyl arene derivatives in good yields with high regioselectivity under mild conditions. The robust methodology enables facile late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules. The high efficiency of this reaction is also demonstrated by the high turnover number (TON, up to 1700) of the rhodium catalyst on gram&#8208;scale experiments. Preliminary success on kinetic resolution of this transformation is achieved, providing a promising access to enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.

         <title>(&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A, a Naturally Occurring Immunosuppressive Meroditerpenoid: Structure Elucidation and Scalable Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the isolation, structure determination of (&#8722;)&#8208;isoscopariusin&#8197;A by spectroscopic analysis and concise chemical synthesis. The unprecedented meroditerpenoid bears a 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters, and exhibits selective inhibition of T&#8208;cell proliferation. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from (+)&#8208;sclareolide.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A was isolated from the aerial parts of Isodon scoparius. Chemical synthesis and spectroscopic analysis established its structure as an unsymmetrical meroditerpenoid bearing a sterically congested 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from commercially available (+)&#8208;sclareolide. A cobalt catalyzed, hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;based olefin isomerization was used to prepare a trisubstituted alkene, which underwent stereoselective [2+2] cycloaddition with a substituted keteniminium ion generated in situ from the corresponding amide. The cyclobutanone product was further elaborated into the fully substituted cyclobutane core through face&#8208;selective homologation, and the two side chains were installed by using nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and carbodiimide&#8208;mediated esterification, respectively. (&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A displayed selective inhibition of T&#8208;cell proliferation.

         <title>Strong Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acidic Sites in the Borosulfate Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ever&#8208;expanding chemistry of borosulfates is enriched by the novel borosulfate Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 featuring an unprecedented Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct of water to the anion [B(SO4)3]3&#8722;. Isodesmic exchange calculations revealed high Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acidity, opening new insights and perspectives for this fascinating silicate&#8208;analogous material class.







Abstract
Borosulfates provide fascinating structures and properties that go beyond a pure analogy to silicates. Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 is the first borosulfate featuring a boron atom solely coordinated by three tetrahedra. Thus, the free Lewis acidic site forms a Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct with a water molecule. This is unprecedented for borosulfate chemistry and even for borates. Quantum chemical calculations on water exchange reactions with BF3 and B(C6F5)3 revealed a higher Lewis acidity for the borosulfate anion. Moreover, proton exchange reactions showed a higher Br&#248;nsted acidity than comparable silicates or phosphates. Additionally, Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 was characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Binding Molecular Photothermal Agent for Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal therapy usually requires a high power density to activate photothermal agent for effective treatment, which inevitably leads to damage to normal tissues and inflammation in tumor tissues. Herein, we rationally design a protein&#8208;binding strategy to build a molecular photothermal agent for photothermal ablation of tumor. The synthesized photothermal agent can covalently bind to the thiol groups on the intracellular proteins. The heat generated by the photothermal agent directly destroyed the bioactive proteins in the cells, effectively reducing the heat loss and the molecular leakage. Under a low power density of 0.2 W/cm2, the temperature produced by the photothermal agent was sufficient to induce apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the therapeutic effect of photothermal therapy can be efficiently improved with the protein&#8208;binding strategy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The novel concept of  NORD  (  NO R  elaxation  D  elay) NMR spectroscopy is introduced. The idea is to design concatenated experiments in a way that the magnetization used in the first relaxes toward equilibrium during the second and vice versa, thus saving instrument time. Applications include complete well&#8208;resolved  1  H&#8208;  1  H and  1  H&#8208;  13  C one&#8208;bond and long&#8208;range correlation maps of an 80 mM solution of a trisaccharide recorded in less than two minutes and hydrocortisone with extensive spectral overlap.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Rotor&#8208;Driven Advanced Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;driven advanced porous materials (MR&#8208;APMs) can expand the chemical and physical properties of conventional rigid porous solids and drive the development of sophisticated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. This Minireview emphasizes the strategies for the localization and characterization of molecular rotors in porous materials as well as the exploration of their rotor&#8208;induced specific functionalities.







Abstract
Advanced porous materials (APMs)&#8212;such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs)&#8212;have emerged as an exciting research frontier of chemistry and materials science. Given their tunable pore size and extensive diversity, APMs have found widespread applications. In addition, adding dynamic functional groups to porous solids furthers the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. By incorporating moving elements&#8212;molecular rotors&#8212;into the porous frameworks, molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;driven advanced porous materials (MR&#8208;APMs) can respond reversibly to chemical and physical stimuli, thus imparting dynamic functionalities that have not been found in conventional porous materials. This Minireview discusses exemplary MR&#8208;APMs in terms of their design, synthesis, rotor dynamics, and potential applications.

This Minireview emphasizes the strategies for the localization and characterization of molecular rotors in porous materials as well as the exploration of their rotor&#8208;induced specific functionalities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced porous materials (APMs)&#8212;such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs)&#8212;have emerged as an exciting research frontier of chemistry and materials science. Given their tunable pore size and extensive diversity, APMs have found widespread applications. In addition, adding dynamic functional groups to porous solids furthers the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. By incorporating moving elements&#8212;molecular rotors&#8212;into the porous frameworks, molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;driven advanced porous materials (MR&#8208;APMs) can respond reversibly to chemical and physical stimuli, thus imparting dynamic functionalities that have not been found in conventional porous materials. This Minireview discusses exemplary MR&#8208;APMs in terms of their design, synthesis, rotor dynamics, and potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Aptamer Blocking Strategy Inhibits SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Virus Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer blocking strategy is demonstrated by Honglin Chen, Yanling Song, Chaoyong Yang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100225) to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. An aptamer probe was engineered to bind to the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, which inhibits infection of the virus by blocking the interaction of the virus with ACE2 receptors on human cell membrane.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive phenomena are widely observed in nature. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202017089), Chongli Zhong, Dan Zhao, and co&#8208;workers report pressure&#8208;responsive MOF composite membranes based on the gate&#8208;opening effect of CO2 molecules which function as a &#8220;key&#8221; to open the MOF gates. Large jumps of the CO2 permeance and the CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities occur above the gate&#8208;opening pressure of the flexible MOF, demonstrating a smart gas separation behavior.

         <dc:description>
Maize to medicine! With annual production at &gt;85&#8197;million tons/year, ethanol is the world's largest&#8208;volume renewable small molecule carbon source, yet its use as a C2&#8208;feedstock in enantioselective C&#8722;C coupling is unknown. The first catalytic enantioselective C&#8722;C couplings of ethanol are demonstrated in reactions with structurally complex, nitrogen&#8208;rich allylic acetates incorporating the top&#8197;10 N&#8208;heterocycles found in FDA&#8208;approved drugs.

         <title>Regulative Electronic States around Ruthenium/Ruthenium Disulphide Heterointerfaces for Efficient Water Splitting in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting from the rearranged charge density around the abundant interface and the enhanced electronic states, in acidic media, the Ru/RuS2 heterostructure exhibits prominent catalytic activity toward oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, and consequent remarkably high overall water splitting performance, demonstrating promising application prospect for industrial proton exchange membrane&#8208;water electrolysis.







Abstract
Theoretical calculations unveil the charge redistribution over abundant interfaces and the enhanced electronic states of Ru/RuS2 heterostructure. The resulting surface electron&#8208;deficient Ru sites display optimized adsorption behavior toward diverse reaction intermediates, thereby reducing the thermodynamic energy barriers. Experimentally, for the first time the laminar Ru/RuS2 heterostructure is rationally engineered by virtue of the synchronous reduction and sulfurization under eutectic salt system. Impressively, it exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for both OER (201&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and HER (45&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in acidic media due to favorable kinetics and excellent specific activity, consequently leading to a terrific performance in acidic overall water splitting devices (1.501&#8197;V @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The in&#8208;depth insight into the internal activity origin of interfacial effect could offer precise guidance for the rational establishment of hybrid interfaces.

         <title>Cage&#8208;Like Porous Materials with Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Excellent C2H2/CO2 Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cage&#8208;like FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;R (R=Me, Et, nPr and iPr) series all exhibit excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance, which may overcome the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation performance.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based separation is an important technology for C2H2 purification due to the environmentally friendly and energy&#8208;efficient advantage. In addition to the high selectivity of C2H2/CO2, the high uptake of C2H2 also plays an important role in the separation progress. However, the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation performance is still in a dilemma. Herein, we report a series of cage&#8208;like porous materials named FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;R (R=Me, Et, nPr and iPr) which all have high C2H2 uptakes at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K. Dynamic breakthrough studies show that they all exhibit excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance. Particularly, FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;Me possesses a long breakthrough time up to 90&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation reveals that the suitable pore space and geometry contribute much to the excellent separation performance.

         <title>Au&#8211;Ag Bimetallic Catalysis: 3&#8208;Alkynyl Benzofurans from Phenols via Tandem C&#8722;H Alkynylation/Oxy&#8208;Alkynylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and general synthesis of 3&#8208;alkynylbenzofurans from readily available phenols by Au&#8211;Ag bimetallic catalysis has been developed. Importantly, this also advances our mechanistic understanding of the &#8220;silver effect&#8221; in gold redox chemistry.







Abstract
The development of new methodologies enabling a facile access to valuable heterocyclic frameworks still is an important subject of research. In this context, we describe a dual catalytic cycle merging C&#8722;H alkynylation of phenols and oxy&#8208;alkynylation of the newly introduced triple bond by using a unique redox property and the carbophilic &#960;&#8197;acidity of gold. Mechanistic studies support the participation of a bimetallic gold&#8211;silver species. The one&#8208;pot protocol offers a direct, simple, and regio&#8208;specific approach to 3&#8208;alkynyl benzofurans from readily available phenols. A broad range of substrates, including heterocycles, is transferred with excellent functional group tolerance. Thus, this methodology can be used for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of benzofurans.

         <title>Conversion of Dinitrogen into Nitrile: Cross&#8208;Metathesis of N2&#8208;Derived Molybdenum Nitride with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of N2 splitting on a Mo complex followed by nitrile&#8211;alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis results in the direct synthesis of nitrile from dinitrogen under mild conditions. This provides a new strategy for functionalizing N2&#8208;derived metal nitrido complexes.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of nitrile from N2 under mild conditions is of great importance and has attracted much interest. Herein, we report a direct conversion of N2 into nitrile via a nitrile&#8211;alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis (NACM) process involving a N2&#8208;derived Mo nitride. Treatment of the Mo nitride with alkyne in the presence of KOTf afforded an alkyne&#8208;coordinated nitride, which was then transformed into MoV carbyne and the corresponding nitrile upon 1&#8201;e&#8722; oxidation. Both aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes underwent this process smoothly. Experiments and DFT calculations have proved that the oxidation state of the Mo center plays a crucial role. This method does not rely on the nucleophilicity of the N2&#8208;derived metal nitride, offering a novel strategy for N2 fixation chemistry.

         <title>Regulating the Local Charge Distribution of Ni Active Sites for the Urea Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient W&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;WOx UOR catalyst for the urea oxidation reaction has been devised which could be used in CO2 electroreduction devices. A low cell voltage of 2.16&#8197;V was achieved in a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolyzer, saving 15&#8201;% energy compared to standard devices based on the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) accounts for a large proportion of the energy consumption. The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising alternatives to OER, owing to its low thermodynamic potential. However, owing to the sluggish UOR kinetics, its potential in practical use has not been unlocked. Herein, we developed a tungsten&#8208;doped nickel catalyst (Ni&#8208;WOx) with superior activity towards UOR. The Ni&#8208;WOx catalyst exhibited record fast reaction kinetics (440&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and a high turnover frequency of 0.11&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is 4.8 times higher than that without W dopants. In further experiments, we found that the W dopant regulated the local charge distribution of Ni atoms, leading to the formation of Ni3+ sites with superior activity and thus accelerating the interfacial catalytic reaction. Moreover, when we integrated Ni&#8208;WOx into a CO2 flow electrolyzer, the cell voltage is reduced to 2.16&#8197;V accompanying with &#8776;98&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards carbon monoxide.

         <title>Making Waxy Salts in Water: Synthetic Control of Hydrophobicity for Anion&#8208;Induced and Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition in water is an unperfected art in synthetic supramolecular chemistry. We demonstrate that the inherent hydrophobicity of tripodal fluorogenic cations can be synthetically modulated to control the sensitivity toward large, non&#8208;spherical, and charge&#8208;diffuse anions in water.







Abstract
We show that multipodal polycationic receptors function as anion&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitters in water. Prevailing paradigms utilize rigid holes and cavities for ion recognition. We instead built open amphiphilic scaffolds that trigger polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar environment transitions around cationic fluorophores upon anion complexation. This ion&#8208;pairing and aggregation event produces a dramatic enhancement in the emission intensity, as demonstrated by perchlorate as a non&#8208;spherical hydrophobic anion model. A synergetic interplay of C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion hydrogen bonding and tight anion&#8211;&#960;+ contacts underpins this supramolecular phenomenon. By changing the aliphatic chain length, we demonstrate that the response profile and threshold of this signaling event can be controlled at the molecular level. With appropriate molecular design, inherently weak, ill&#8208;defined, and non&#8208;directional van der Waals interaction enables selective, sensitive, and tunable recognition in water.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Pyroglutamic Acid Esters from Glycinate via Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of chiral pyridoxal 5&#8201;d as a carbonyl catalyst, asymmetric 1,4&#8208;conjugated addition at the &#945;&#8208;position of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and subsequent in situ lactamization formed chiral pyroglutamic acid esters 4 in 43&#8211;96&#8201;% yields with 81&#8211;97&#8201;% enantioselectivities, providing an interesting and straightforward way to make chemically and biologically significant pyroglutamic acid derivatives.







Abstract
Direct &#945;&#8208;functionalization of NH2&#8208;free glycinates with relatively weak electrophiles such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters still remains a big challenge in organic synthesis. With chiral pyridoxal 5&#8201;d as a carbonyl catalyst, direct asymmetric conjugated addition at the &#945;&#8208;C of glycinate 1&#8201;a with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters 2 has been successfully realized, to produce various chiral pyroglutamic acid esters 4 in 14&#8211;96&#8201;% yields with 81&#8211;97&#8201;% ee's after in situ lactamization. The trans and cis diastereomers can be obtained at the same time by chromatography and both of them can be easily converted into chiral 4&#8208;substituted pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones such as Alzheimer's drug Rolipram (11) with the same absolute configuration via tert&#8208;butyl group removal and subsequent Barton decarboxylation.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Separation of n&#8208;Hexane by a Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Reduced Energy Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic metal&#8208;organic framework with breathing effect shows unique separation properties toward hexane isomers. A reversed relationship between uptake capacity and diffusion rate as a function of temperature caused by the structure dynamic provides a new perspective for optimized separation performance at lower temperatures and with less energy consumption.







Abstract
The separation of n&#8208;alkanes from their branched isomers is vitally important to improve octane rating of gasoline. To facilitate mass transfer, adsorptive separation is usually operated under high temperatures in industry, which require considerable energy. Herein, we present a kind of dynamic pillar&#8208;layered MOF that exhibits self&#8208;adjustable structure and pore space, a behavior induced by guest molecules. A combination of the flexibility of the framework with the commensurate adsorption for n&#8208;hexane results in exceptional performance in separating hexane isomers. More significantly, lower temperature prompts the guest molecules to open the dynamic pores, which may provide a new perspective for optimized separation performance at lower temperatures with less energy consumption.

         <title>Ultrafast Excimer Formation and Solvent Controlled Symmetry Breaking Charge Separation in the Excitonically Coupled Subphthalocyanine Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent polarity tunes the interplay of excimer formation and symmetry breaking charge separation (SB&#8211;CS) in the photoexcited subphthalocyanine dimer.







Abstract
Knowledge of the factors controlling excited state dynamics in excitonically coupled dimers and higher aggregates is critical for understanding natural and artificial solar energy conversion. In this work, we report ultrafast solvent polarity dependent excited state dynamics of the structurally well&#8208;defined subphthalocyanine dimer, &#956;&#8208;OSubPc2. Stationary electronic spectra demonstrate strong exciton coupling in &#956;&#8208;OSubPc2. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements reveal ultrafast excimer formation from the initially excited exciton, mediated by intramolecular structural evolution. In polar solvents the excimer state decays directly through symmetry breaking charge transfer to form a charge separated state. Charge separation occurs under control of solvent orientational relaxation.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Benzyl Alcohols via Palladium/Chiral Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a highly enantioselective kinetic resolution of tertiary benzyl alcohols via palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis. With simple aryl iodides as the resolution reagent, a wide range of readily available racemic tertiary benzyl alcohols are applicable to this method. Both chiral tertiary benzyl alcohols and benzo[c]chromene products are obtained in good to excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity factor up to 544). The appealing synthetic utility of the obtained enantioenriched tertiary alcohols is demonstrated by the facile preparation of several valuable chiral heterocycles. Preliminary mechanism studies include DFT calculations to explain the origin of enantiodiscrimination and control experiments to uncover the formation of a transient axial chirality during the kinetic resolution step.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry uncovers guest&#8208;induced distortions in a supramolecular organometallic metallosquare</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The encapsulation of the tetracationic palladium metallosquare with four pyrene&#8208;bis&#8208;imidazolylidene ligands [  1  ]  4+  with a series of organic molecules was studied by Electrospray ionization Travelling Wave Ion&#8208;Mobility Mass Spectrometry (ESI TWIM&#8208;MS). The method allowed to determine the Collision Cross Sections (SCCs), which were used to assess the size changes experienced by the host upon encapsulation of the guest molecules. When fullerenes were used as guests, the host is expanded &#916;CCS 13 &#197;  2  and 23 &#197;  2  , for C  60  or C  70  , respectively. The metallorectangle [  1  ]  4+  was also used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and naphtalenetetracarboxylic diimide (NTCDI), to form complexes of formula [(NTCDI)  2  (PAH)@  1  ]  4+  , in which the PAH molecule is sandwiched between the two NTCDI guests. For these host:guest adducts, the ESI IM&#8208;MS studies revealed that [  1  ]  4+  is expanded by 47&#8208;49 &#197;  2  , regardless the nature of the PAH molecule used. The energy&#8208;minimized structures of [  1  ]  4+  , [C  60  @  1  ]  4+  , [C  70  @  1  ]  4+  , [(NTCDI)  2  (corannulene)@  1  ]  4+  in the gas phase were obtained by DFT calculations. The CCS values of the DFT structures were calculated using Trajectory Methods (TM). These calculated CCS data were in great agreement with the experimental ones, thus demonstrating that ESI IM&#8208;MS is a reliable tool for measuring structural distortions of supramolecular structures in the gas phase, and highlight the extraordinary size&#8208;adaptability of the metallocage [  1  ]  4+  .</dc:description>

         <title>Multicolor Mechanofluorophores for the Quantitative Detection of Covalent Bond Scission in Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fracture of polymer materials is a multiscale process starting with the scission of a single molecular bond advancing to a site of failure within the bulk. Quantifying the bonds broken during this process remains a big challenge yet would help to understand the distribution and dissipation of macroscopic mechanical energy. We here show the design and synthesis of fluorogenic molecular optical force probes (mechanofluorophores) covering the entire visible spectrum in both absorption and emission. Their dual fluorescent character allows to track non&#8208;broken and broken bonds in dissolved and bulk polymers by fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. Importantly, we develop an approach to determine the absolute number and relative fraction of intact and cleaved bonds with high local resolution. We anticipate that our mechanofluorophores in combination with our quantification methodology will allow to quantitatively describe fracture processes in materials ranging from soft hydrogels to high&#8208;performance polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated glycan assembly of 19F labelled glycan probes enables high&#8208;throughput NMR studies of protein&#8208;glycan interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;glycan interactions mediate important biological processes, including pathogen host invasion and cellular communication. Major challenges to monitoring these low affinity interactions are the required high sensitivity of a biophysical assay and to cover a breath of synthetic well&#8208;defined structures. Here, we showcase an expedite approach that integrates automated glycan assembly (AGA) of  19  F labelled probes and high&#8208;throughput NMR methods, enabling the study of protein&#8208;glycan interactions. Synthetic Lewis type 2 antigens were screened against seven glycan binding proteins (GBPs), including DC&#8208;SIGN and BambL, respectively involved in HIV&#8208;1 and lung infections in immunocompromised patients, confirming the preference for fucosylated glycans (Le  x  , H type 2, Le  y  ). Previously unknown glycan&#8208;lectin weak interactions were detected, and thermodynamic data were obtained. Enzymatic reactions were monitored in real&#8208;time, delivering kinetic parameters. These results demonstrate the utility of AGA combined with  19  F NMR for the discovery and characterization of glycan&#8208;protein interactions, opening up new perspectives for  19  F labelled complex glycans.</dc:description>

In this context, we developed a new experimental setup allowing controlled preparation of catalytic intermediates for characterization by various spectroscopic techniques. The  in situ  monitoring of redox transitions by infrared spectroscopy in enzyme lyophilizate, crystals and solution during gas exchange in a wide temperature range can be accomplished as well. As a proof of concept, two O  2  &#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenases were investigated as model systems. First, we utilized our platform to prepare highly concentrated hydrogenase lyophilizate in a paramagnetic state harboring a bridging hydride. This procedure proved beneficial for  57  Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy and revealed, in combination with density functional theory calculations, the vibrational fingerprint of this catalytic intermediate. Furthermore, in combination with resonance Raman spectroscopy, the same  in situ  IR setup provided detailed insights into the redox chemistry of enzyme crystals, underlining the general necessity to complement X&#8208;ray crystallographic data with spectroscopic analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Sarpagine and Koumine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a concise, collective, and asymmetric total synthesis of sarpagine alkaloids and biogenetically related koumine alkaloids, which structurally feature a rigid cage scaffold, with L&#8208;tryptophan as the starting material. Two key bridged skeleton&#8208;forming reactions, namely tandem sequential oxidative cyclopropanol ring&#8208;opening cyclization and ketone &#945;&#8208;allenylation, ensure concurrent assembly of the caged sarpagine scaffold and installation of requisite derivative handles. With a common caged intermediate as the branch point, by taking advantage of ketone and allene groups therein, total synthesis of five sarpagine alkaloids (affinisine, normacusine B, trinervine, Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine, and vellosimine) with various substituents and three koumine alkaloids (koumine, koumimine, and N&#8208;demethylkoumine) with more complex cage scaffolds has been accomplished.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a gold and palladium sequential catalysis system to access furan&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered heterocycles in high efficiency and enantioselectivity. In this one&#8208;pot procedure, easily accessible enynamides undergo cyclization to generate azadienes  in situ  that participate in enantioselective formal [5 + 4] cycloaddition with vinyl ethylene carbonates. Conformation&#8208;controlled highly diastereoselective derivatizations of these medium&#8208;sized rings, coupled with oxidative furan cleavage, have enabled the access to diverse densely&#8208;functionalized nine&#8208;membered lactams.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards the Highly Efficient Synthesis and Selective Methylation of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged [6]Cycloparaphenylenes from Fluoren[3]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach to the highly efficient synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylenes (C[6]CPPs) from fluoren[3]arenes (F[3]As) was developed. Consequently, F[3]As as a new kind of macrocyclic arenes were synthesized. Followed by the demethylation, triflation and intramolecular aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, C[6]CPPs were then conveniently obtained. Interestingly, C[6]CPPs could be selectively methylated to produce their fully outer&#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted derivatives. The crystal structures showed the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted F[3]As had bowl&#8208;shaped conformations, and the C[6]CPPs exhibited rigid belt&#8208;shaped structures with deep cavities. Moreover, C[6]CPPs exhibited high HOMO energies and narrow energy gaps. An unclosed belt was further obtained, and it not only showed a similar narrow energy gap to those of the aromatic belts, but also displayed strong fluorescence property, which can play a vital role in the design and synthesis of new aromatic belts.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and functional analyses of the tridomain&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase FmoA3 for 4&#8208;methyloxazoline ring formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are attractive targets for bioengineering to generate useful peptides . F moA3 is a single modular NRPS composed of heterocyclization (Cy), adenylation (A), and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains. It use s &#945; &#8208; methyl&#8208; l &#8208;serine to synthesize a 4&#8208;methyloxazoline ring, probably with another Cy domain in the preceding module FmoA2. Here, we determined the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail homodimeric structures of FmoA3 by X&#8208;ray crystallography (  apo  &#8208;form, with adenylyl&#8208;imidodiphosphate and &#945; &#8208;methyl&#8208; l &#8208;seryl&#8208;AMP) and cryogenic electron microscopy single particle analysis, and performed site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments. The data revealed that &#945; &#8208;methyl&#8208; l &#8208;serine can be accommodated in the active site because of the extra space around Ala688. The Cy domains of FmoA2 and FmoA3 catalyze peptide bond formation and heterocyclization, respectively. FmoA3&#8217;s Cy domain seems to lose its donor PCP binding activit y. The collective data support a proposed catalytic cycle of FmoA3.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced low&#8208;flammable electrolytes for stable operation of high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite being an effective flame retardant, trimethyl phosphate (TMP  a  ) is generally considered as an unqualified solvent for fabricating electrolytes used in graphite (Gr) based lithium&#8208;ion batteries as it readily leads to Gr exfoliation and cell failure. In this work, by adopting the unique solvation structure of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to TMP  a  and tuning the composition of the solvation sheathes  via  electrolyte additives, excellent electrochemical performance can be achieved with TMP  a  based electrolytes in Gr||LiNi  0.8  Mn  0.1  Co  0.1  O  2  cells. After 500 charge/discharge cycles within the voltage range of 2.5&#8208;4.4 V, the batteries containing TMP  a  based LHCEs with proper additive can achieve a capacity retention of 85.4%, being significantly higher than cells using a LiPF  6  &#8208;organocarbonates baseline electrolyte (75.2%). Meanwhile, due to the flame retarding effect of TMP  a  , TMP  a  based LHCEs exhibit significantly reduced flammability compared with the conventional LiPF  6  &#8208;organocarbonates electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Halide Replacement with Complete Preservation of Crystal Lattice in Mixed&#8208;Anion Lanthanide Oxyhalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed anion compounds afford considerable compositional diversity and tunability of function. A challenging aspect of anion control of properties of periodic solids is to preserve the crystal lattice while substituting for different anions of widely varying size and hardness. Post&#8208;synthetic modification routes that place cations or anions in non&#8208;equilibrium configurations represent a promising means of decoupling composition and crystal structure and for accessing metastable solids; however, such methods remain relatively unexplored for anion placement. Here, we report the synthesis of LaOI nanocrystals by a non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel condensation reaction and their transformation into LaOBr, LaOCl, and LaOF nanocrystals along hard&#8212;soft&#8212;acid&#8212;base principles using post&#8208;synthetic metathesis reactions with ammonium halides. Anion displacement proceeds along halide planes preserving the tetragonal matlockite structure. Energy&#8208;variant X&#8208;ray excited optical luminesce signatures of alloyed Tb3+&#8208;ions serves as a sensitive quantum reporter of the preservation of the cation sublattice and hardening of the crystal structure upon anion replacement.</dc:description>

         <title>25 years of Reticular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At its core, reticular chemistry has translated the precision and expertise of organic and inorganic synthesis to the solid state. While initial excitement over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) was undoubtedly fueled by their unprecedented porosity and surface areas, the most profound scientific innovation of the field has been the elaboration of design strategies for the synthesis of extended crystalline solids through strong directional bonds. In this contribution we highlight the different classes of reticular materials that have been developed, how these frameworks can be functionalized and how complexity can be introduced into their backbones. Finally, we show how the structural control over these materials is being extended from the molecular scale to their crystal morphology and shape on the nanoscale, all the way to their shaping on the bulk scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirogenesis and Amplification of Molecular Chirality Using Optical Vortices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of chirogenesis of organic molecules is important to elucidate the origin of the homochirality of biomolecules on Earth. Here, we have accomplished chiral symmetry breaking from a racemate using optical vortices with orbital angular momentum and a helical wavefront. We propose a new methodology of asymmetric transformation by the combination of (1) enantioselective crystal nucleation by irradiation with optical vortices and (2) crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic optical resolution of conglomerate crystals. Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532 nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization. This transfer of the physical chirality of light quanta to molecular chirality was performed for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Photocatalyzed Hydroboration of Alkynes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes is reported. The use of newly&#8208;designed copper photocatalysts with B  2  Pin  2  &#160;permits the formation a boryl radical, which is used for hydroboration of a large panel of alkenes and alkynes. The hydroborated products were isolated in high yields, with excellent diastereoselectivities and a high functional group tolerance under mild conditions. The hydroboration reactions were developed under continuous flow conditions to demonstrate their synthetic utility. The reaction mechanism was studied and suggested an oxidation reaction between an in situ formed borate and the Cu&#8208;photocatalyst in its excited state for the boryl radical formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and biosynthesis of a structurally dynamic antibacterial diterpenoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new bicyclic diterpenoid, benditerpenoic acid, was isolated from soil&#8208;dwelling&#160;Streptomyces&#160;sp. (CL12&#8208;4). We sequenced the bacterial genome, identified the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster, verified the function of the terpene synthase, and heterologously produced the core diterpene. Comparative bioinformatics indicated this&#160;Streptomyces&#160;strain is phylogenetically unique and possesses nine terpene synthases. The absolute configurations of the new&#160;trans&#8208;fused bicyclo[8.4.0]tetradecanes were achieved by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including Mosher&#8217;s analysis,&#160;J&#8208;based coupling analysis, and computations based on sparse NMR&#8208;derived experimental restraints. Interestingly, benditerpenoic acid exists in two distinct ring&#8208;flipped bicyclic conformations with a rotational barrier of ~16 kcal mol&#8208;1&#160;in solution. The diterpenes exhibit moderate antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including methicillin and multi&#8208;drug resistant&#160;Staphylococcus aureus. This is the first isolation of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Potassium&#8208;Rich Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode for High Power Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most of the cathode materials for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) suffer from poor structural stability due to the large ionic radius of K +  , resulting in poor cycling stability. Here we report a low&#8208;strain potassium&#8208;rich K 1.84  Ni[Fe(CN) 6  ] 0.88  &#8729;0.49H 2  O (KNiHCF) as a cathode material for PIBs. The as&#8208;prepared KNiHCF cathode can deliver reversible discharge capacity of 62.8 mAh g &#8722;1  at 100 mA&#183;g &#8722;1  , with a high discharge voltage of 3.82 V. It can also achieve a superior rate performance of 45.8 mAh g &#8722;1  at 5000 mA g &#8722;1  , with a capacity retention of 88.6% after 100 cycles. The combination of in situ  characterizations and theoretical calculations unveils that the superior performance of KNiHCF cathode results from low&#8208;strain de&#8208;/intercalation mechanism, intrinsic semiconductor property and low potassium diffusion energy barrier. In addition, the high power density and long term stability of KNiHCF//graphite full cell have further proved the feasibility of K&#8208;rich KNiHCF cathode in PIBs. This work is expected to provide meaningful guidance to develop Prussian blue analogues as cathode materials for high&#8208;performance PIBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

The electronic structure, bonding, and aromaticity of the boracyclic anions were comprehensively investigated via computational studies. Compounds&#160;  5  &#160;and&#160;  8  &#160;react with metal halides via salt elimination to give new B&#8722;E (E = Au, Se, Ge)&#8208;containing materials (  9  &#8208;  12  ). Upon reaction with diketones, the carbene ligand cleanly dissociates from&#160;  5  &#160;or&#160;  8  &#160;to yield new B&#8722;O containing spirocycles (  13  &#8208;  14  ) that cannot be easily obtained using "normal" valent borafluorene compounds.

         <title>High Pressure In Situ Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Reveals Turnstile Linker Rotation Upon Room&#8208;Temperature Stepped Uptake Of Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rare availability of suitable single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) structural data allows for the direct interpretation of the response of a framework to gas sorption and may lead to the development of improved functional porous materials. We report an  in situ  SCXRD structural investigation of a flexible MOF subjected to methane, ethane, propane and butane gas pressures. Supporting theoretical investigations indicate weak host&#8208;guest interactions for the crystallographically modeled gaseous guests and, in addition, reveal that a turnstile mechanism facilitates the transport of alkanes through the seemingly nonporous system.

We report an  in situ  SCXRD structural investigation of a flexible MOF subjected to methane, ethane, propane and butane gas pressures. Supporting theoretical investigations indicate weak host&#8208;guest interactions for the crystallographically modeled gaseous guests and, in addition, reveal that a turnstile mechanism facilitates the transport of alkanes through the seemingly nonporous system. Inflections present in the adsorption isotherms are furthermore rationalized as due to gate&#8208;opening, but without the expected creation of new accessible space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An electrically conducting three&#8208;dimensional iron&#8208;catecholate porous framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the synthesis of a unique cubic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), the Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF, comprising hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) supertetrahedral units and FeIII ions, arranged in a diamond topology. The MOF is synthesized under solvothermal conditions, yielding a highly crystalline, deep black powder, with crystallites of 300&#8208;500&#160;nm size and tetrahedral morphology. Nitrogen sorption analysis indicates a highly porous material with a surface area exceeding 1400&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF shows broadband absorption from 475 nm up to 1900 nm with excellent absorption capability of 98.5% of the incoming light over the visible spectral region. Electrical conductivity measurements of pressed pellets reveal a high intrinsic electrical conductivity of up to 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. Quantum mechanical calculations predict Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF to be an efficient electron conductor, exhibiting continuous charge&#8208;carrier pathways throughout the structure. This report expands the paradigm of intrinsically electroactive MOFs, serving as a solid basis for the development of highly porous, ordered frameworks with enhanced electrical conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics that target the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8209;catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein complexes are defined by the three&#8208;dimensional structure of participating binding partners. Knowledge about these structures can facilitate the design of peptidomimetics which have been applied e.g. as inhibitors of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Even though &#946;&#8208;sheets participate widely in PPIs, they have only rarely served as the basis for peptidomimetic PPI inhibitors, in particular when addressing intracellular targets. Here, we present the structure&#8208;based design of &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics targeting the intracellular protein &#946;&#8208;catenin, a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on a protein binding partner of &#946;&#8208;catenin, a macrocyclic peptide was designed and its crystal structure in complex with &#946;&#8208;catenin obtained. Using this structure, we designed a library of bicyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics employing a late&#8208;stage diversification strategy. Several mimetics were identified that compete with transcription factor binding to &#946;&#8208;catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling in cells. The presented design strategy can support the development of inhibitors for other &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;mediated PPIs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclotetrabenzoin Acetate: A Macrocyclic Porous Molecular Crystal for CO2 Separations by Pressure Swing Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A porous molecular crystal (PMC) assembled by macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is an efficient adsorbent for CO2 separations. The 7.1&#215;7.1 &#197; square pore of PMC and its ester C=O groups play important roles in improving its affinity for CO2 molecules. The benzene walls of macrocycle engage in an apparent [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interaction with the molecule of CO2 at low pressure. In addition, the polar carbonyl groups pointing inward the square channels reduce the size of aperture to a 5.0&#215;5.0 &#197; square, which offers kinetic selectivity for CO2 capture. The PMC features water tolerance and high structural stability under vacuum and various gas adsorption conditions, which are rare among intrinsically porous organic molecules. Most importantly, the moderate adsorbate&#8211;adsorbent interaction allows the PMC to be readily regenerated, and therefore applied to pressure swing adsorption processes. The eluted N2 and CH4 are obtained with over 99.9% and 99.8% purity, respectively, and the separation performance is stable for 30 cycles. Coupled with its easy synthesis, cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is a promising adsorbent for CO2 separations from flue and natural gases.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Higher cocrystal synthesis depends acutely on a knowledge of supramolecular synthons. We report three synthetic approaches towards ternary halogen bonded cocrystals that illustrate specificity and generality. Electrophilicity/nucleophilicity differences are needed among alternative sites of halogen bond formation. The two halogen bonds A&#8230;B and B&#8230;C in a halogen bonded ternary cocrystal ABC need to of different strength. Interaction mimicry of hydrogen bonds by halogen bonds is a viable approach towards ternaries as illustrated with the pyrene structure. Finally, the crystal engineer should well be able to anticipate halogen bonds that are stronger than hydrogen bonds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of the first terminal imido complex of an Fe&#8211;S cluster, (IMes)3Fe4S4=NDipp (2; IMes = 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphen&#173;yl), which is generated by oxidative group transfer from DippN3&#160;to the all&#8208;ferrous cluster (IMes)3Fe4S4(PPh3). This two&#8208;electron process is achieved by formal one&#8208;electron oxidation of the imido&#8208;bound Fe site and one&#8208;electron oxidation of two IMes&#8208;bound Fe sites. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies establish that the Fe&#8211;imido site is best described as a high&#8208;spin Fe3+&#160;center, which is reflected in its long Fe&#8211;N(imido) distance of 1.763(2)&#160;&#197;.

         <title>Single Atom Pd Nanozyme for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal therapy (PTT) is extremely promising tumor therapeutic modality. However, excessive heat inevitably injures normal tissues nearby tumors, and the cancer cells damage caused by mild hyperthermia is easily repaired by stress&#8208;induced heat shock proteins (HSPs). Thus, maximizing the PTT efficiency and minimizing healthy tissues damage simultaneously by adopting appropriate therapeutic temperature is imperative. Herein, an innovative strategy is firstly reported of ferroptosis&#8208;boosted mild PTT based on single atom nanozyme (SAzyme). The Pd SAzyme with atom&#8208;economic utilization of the catalytic centers exhibits peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimic enzyme activities, and photothermal conversion performance, which can result in ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving HSPs, which enables Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aromatic Oligomer Micelle: Large Enthalpic Stabilization and Selective&#160;Oligothiophene Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An aromatic oligomer micelle, featuring both&#160;  high stability  and&#160;  high uptake ability  , was quantitatively formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers,&#160;composed of three bent polyaromatic amphiphiles connected alternately by two hydrophilic chains. The well&#8208;defined micelle, with a diameter of ~2 nm,&#160;remains intact even under highly diluted conditions (~3 &#956;M) and at elevated temperature (&gt;130 &#186;C), due to the polyaromatic chelate effect. The&#160;thermodynamic studies reveal that large enthalpic gain (  &#916; H&#160;  =&#160;&#8211;110 kJ mol  &#8211;1  ) is the key for the micelle formation. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes (&#8805;4&#8208;mer) to a high degree and the resultant, aqueous host&#8208;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers. Furthermore, facile uptake and release of unsubstituted polythiophenes can be achieved using the oligomer micelle.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid Electrolyte Interphase Design for Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn batteries are challenged by water decomposition and dendrite growth due to the absence of a dense Zn&#8208;ion conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we design a low&#8208;concentration aqueous Zn(OTF)2&#8208;Zn(NO3)2  electrolyte to in situ form a robust inorganic ZnF2&#8208;Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6&#8208;organic bi&#8208;layer SEI where the inorganic inner layer promotes Zn&#8208;ion diffusion while the organic outer layer suppresses water penetration. Comprehensive characterization reveals that insulating Zn5(OH)8(NO3)2&#183;2H2O layer is first formed on Zn anode surface by self&#8208;terminated chemical reaction of NO3&#8208;  with Zn2+  and OH&#8208;  generated via HER, and then it transforms into Zn&#8208;ion conducting Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6  which in&#8208;turn promots ZnF2  formation as the inner layer. The organic dominated outer layer is formed by the reduction of OTF&#8208;  . The in situ formed SEI enables a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.8% for 200 h in Ti||Zn cells, and a high energy density (168&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8211;1  ) with 96.5% retention for 700 cycles in Zn||MnO2  cells with a low Zn/MnO2  capacity ratio of 2:1.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Prebiotic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Threofuranosyl Cytidine by Photochemical Anomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TNA cytidine, a candidate precursor to RNA cytidine at the origin of life, is synthesized from prebiotic precursors via a high&#8208;yielding, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective, protecting&#8208;group free synthesis utilizing an efficient photochemical anomerization. Phosphorylation also enables selective photodestruction of the contaminating erythro&#8208;diastereomer enriching any potential pool of TNA monomers.







Abstract
The structure of life's first genetic polymer is a question of intense ongoing debate. The &#8220;RNA world theory&#8221; suggests RNA was life's first nucleic acid. However, ribonucleotides are complex chemical structures, and simpler nucleic acids, such as threose nucleic acid (TNA), can carry genetic information. In principle, nucleic acids like TNA could have played a vital role in the origins of life. The advent of any genetic polymer in life requires synthesis of its monomers. Here we demonstrate a high&#8208;yielding, stereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and furanosyl&#8208;selective prebiotic synthesis of threo&#8208;cytidine 3, an essential component of TNA. Our synthesis uses key intermediates and reactions previously exploited in the prebiotic synthesis of the canonical pyrimidine ribonucleoside cytidine 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that erythro&#8208;specific 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic phosphate synthesis provides a mechanism to photochemically select TNA cytidine. These results suggest that TNA may have coexisted with RNA during the emergence of life.

         <title>A Rod&#8208;Packing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Suitable Pore Confinement for Benchmark Ethane/Ethylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rod&#8208;packing microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonding framework with functional surfaces and suitable cavity spaces for C2H6 uptake exhibited simultaneously high capacity and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (see picture). The excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation occurred with record&#8208;high C2H4 productivity of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 under high humidity and ambient conditions.







Abstract
For the separation of ethane from ethylene, it remains challenging to target both high C2H6 adsorption and selectivity in a C2H6&#8208;selective material. Herein, we report a reversible solid&#8208;state transformation in a labile hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework to generate a new rod&#8208;packing desolvated framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;1) with suitable cavity spaces and functional surfaces to optimally interact with C2H6. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;1 thus exhibits simultaneously high C2H6 uptake (88&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K) and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (2.25), which are significantly higher than those of most top&#8208;performing materials. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cage&#8208;like cavities and functional sites synergistically &#8220;match&#8221; better with C2H6 to provide stronger multipoint interactions with C2H6 than C2H4. In combination with its high stability and ultralow water uptake, this material can efficiently capture C2H6 from 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures in ambient conditions under 60&#8201;% RH, providing a record polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 productivity of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Selective Implantation of Diamines for Cooperative Catalysis in Isoreticular Heterometallic Titanium&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different affinity of Ti(IV) and Ca(II) sites to direct selective coordination of amines was used. This enables the combination of Lewis acid and available &#8208;NH2 sites in sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides. MUV&#8208;12 displays full conversion of propylene oxide at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in absence of additional co&#8208;catalysts and with excellent cyclability.







Abstract
We introduce the first example of isoreticular titanium&#8211;organic frameworks, MUV&#8208;10 and MUV&#8208;12, to show how the different affinity of hard Ti(IV) and soft Ca(II) metal sites can be used to direct selective grafting of amines. This enables the combination of Lewis acid titanium centers and available &#8208;NH2 sites in two sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The selective grafting of molecules to heterometallic clusters adds up to the pool of methodologies available for controlling the positioning and distribution of chemical functions in precise positions of the framework required for definitive control of pore chemistry.

         <title>Opening up the Single&#8208;Cell Toolbox for Microbial Natural Products Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New chemistry from single cells: The challenge of studying uncultivated microbes is a significant impediment to efforts to mine the natural world for useful molecules. Single&#8208;cell analysis techniques have achieved significant success in the study of microbial ecology but are only beginning to gain traction in the search for microbial natural products. This review highlights successful implementations and promising techniques for future studies.







Abstract
The diverse microbes that produce natural products represent an important source of novel therapeutics, drug leads, and scientific tools. However, the vast majority have not been grown in axenic culture and are members of complex communities. While meta&#8208;&#8217;omic methods such as metagenomics, &#8208;transcriptomics, and &#8208;proteomics reveal collective molecular features of this &#8220;microbial dark matter&#8221;, the study of individual microbiome members can be challenging. To address these limits, a number of techniques with single&#8208;bacterial resolution have been developed in the last decade and a half. While several of these are embraced by microbial ecologists, there has been less use by researchers interested in mining microbes for natural products. In this review, we discuss the available and emerging techniques for targeted single&#8208;cell analysis with a particular focus on applications to the discovery and study of natural products.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Primed Native Chemical Ligation Produces Autoinducing Cyclopeptides in Clostridia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The genome&#8208;guided discovery of an autoinducing peptide (AIP) that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum is reported. A combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain reveals that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP).







Abstract
Clostridia coordinate many important processes such as toxin production, infection, and survival by density&#8208;dependent communication (quorum sensing) using autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Although clostridial AIPs have been proposed to be (thio)lactone&#8208;containing peptides, their true structures remain elusive. Here, we report the genome&#8208;guided discovery of an AIP that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Through a combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain, we reveal that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP). Kinetic analyses indicate that the mature cAIP is produced via a cryptic thiolactone intermediate that undergoes a rapid S&#8594;N acyl shift, in a manner similar to intramolecular native chemical ligation (NCL). Finally, by implementing a chemical probe in a targeted screen, we show that this novel enzyme&#8208;primed, intramolecular NCL is a widespread feature of clostridial AIP biosynthesis.

         <title>ReI Tricarbonyl Complexes as Coordinate Covalent Inhibitors for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Cysteine Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;coronavirus 2 has impacted the life quality and cost hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;thousands of lives worldwide. Herein, a novel approach using ReI tricarbonyl complexes as coordinate covalent inhibitors for the main protease is presented. These complexes target the active site cysteine residue and show selective inhibition of the main protease over several human proteases.







Abstract
Since its outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has impacted the quality of life and cost hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;thousands of lives worldwide. Based on its global spread and mortality, there is an urgent need for novel treatments which can combat this disease. To date, the 3&#8208;chymotrypsin&#8208;like protease (3CLpro), which is also known as the main protease, is considered among the most important pharmacological targets. The vast majority of investigated 3CLpro inhibitors are organic, non&#8208;covalent binders. Herein, the use of inorganic, coordinate covalent binders is proposed that can attenuate the activity of the protease. ReI tricarbonyl complexes were identified that demonstrate coordinate covalent enzymatic inhibition of 3CLpro. Preliminary studies indicate the selective inhibition of 3CLpro over several human proteases. This study presents the first example of metal complexes as inhibitors for the 3CLpro cysteine protease.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Photopolymerization of Hybrid Acrylate&#8208;Oxetane Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization process of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture was developed. Control over the sequence and rate of both polymerizations allows for control over phase separation within the interpenetrating network structure. The structurally colored cholesteric coatings could be used to monitor the phase separation.







Abstract
We report on the wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture. By controlling the sequence and rate of the orthogonal free&#8208;radical and cationic photopolymerization reactions, it is possible to control the degree of phase separation in the resulting liquid crystal interpenetrating networks. We show that this can be used to tune the reflective color of the structurally colored coatings produced. Conversely, the structural color can be used to monitor the degree of phase separation. Our new photopolymerization procedure allows for structuring liquid crystal networks in three dimensions, which has great potential for fabricating liquid crystal polymer materials with programmable functional properties.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Silver Active Sites in Gold Nanoclusters for Chemical Fixation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made catalytic sites for the chemical fixation of CO2 were achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different levels of liberation in atomically precise Au clusters. Au19Ag4(S&#8208;Adm)15 with a completely open surface Ag site has the best catalytic activity, Au20Ag1(S&#8208;Adm)15 with a partially open Ag site is least efficient, and Au21(S&#8208;Adm)15 without a Ag site exhibits decent catalytic performance.







Abstract
Precise control of the composition and structure of active sites in an atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fashion remains insuperable for heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we introduce tailor&#8208;made catalytic sites for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different levels of liberation in atomically precise Au nanoclusters. Our results reveal that a single open Ag site on the Au19Ag4 cluster improves the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides and sequent CO2 insertion, while the partially exposed Ag site on the Au20Ag1 cluster exhibits a weak affinity for epoxides and poor efficiency for CO2 capture. Structural tunability imparted by the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring and unusual atomic charges distributed on Au and Ag atoms of the three clusters seem to be crucial for promoting challenging bond cleavages and formations in the chemical utilization of CO2.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Design Strategy to Construct Smart Fluorescent Probes for the Precise Tracking of Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;dimensional design strategy to construct smart fluorescent probes for the precise tracking of senescence. Our approach relies on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity in combination with the monitoring of lysosomal microenvironmental pH since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells.







Abstract
The tracking of cellular senescence usually depends on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal). Previous probes for SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal with this purpose only cover a single dimension: the accumulation of this enzyme in lysosomes. However, this is insufficient to determine the destiny of senescence because endogenous &#946;&#8208;gal enriched in lysosomes is not only related to senescence, but also to some other physiological processes. To address this issue, we introduce our fluorescent probes including a second dimension: lysosomal pH, since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells. With this novel design, our probes achieved excellent discrimination of SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal from cancer&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal, which enables them to track cellular senescence as well as tissue aging more precisely. Our crystal structures of a model enzyme E. coli &#946;&#8208;gal mutant (E537Q) complexed with each probe further revealed the structural basis for probe recognition.

         <title>Honeycomb Carbon Nanofibers: A Superhydrophilic O2&#8208;Entrapping Electrocatalyst Enables Ultrahigh Mass Activity for the Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Honeycomb carbon nanofibers behave as a superb electrocatalyst for selective H2O2 production (97.3&#8201;%) via 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction, capable of attaining an ultrahigh mass activity of 220&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a H2O2 yield rate of 6.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The catalytic mechanism is revealed by in situ Raman analysis and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction has emerged as a promising alternative to the energy&#8208; and waste&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process for distributed H2O2 production. This process, however, suffers from strong competition from the four&#8208;electron pathway leading to low H2O2 selectivity. Herein, we report using a superhydrophilic O2&#8208;entrapping electrocatalyst to enable superb two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction electrocatalysis. The honeycomb carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) are robust and capable of achieving a high H2O2 selectivity of 97.3&#8201;%, much higher than that of its solid carbon nanofiber counterpart. Impressively, this catalyst achieves an ultrahigh mass activity of up to 220&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, surpassing all other catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The superhydrophilic porous carbon skeleton with rich oxygenated functional groups facilitates efficient electron transfer and better wetting of the catalyst by the electrolyte, and the interconnected cavities allow for more effective entrapping of the gas bubbles. The catalytic mechanism is further revealed by in situ Raman analysis and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Doubling the Stakes: The Promise of Halide Double Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two B sites in combination dictate the properties of halide double perovskites (A2BB&#8242;X6; A=monocation, X=halide). This Minireview gives a brief overview of the rich history of halide double perovskites, highlights key structural and electronic aspects, and describes the current understanding on how to correctly select the B&#8208;site pairs that afford the desired properties.







Abstract
When the stakes are doubled in a wager, a player must correctly place two consecutive bets to win, but the payout is larger. Similarly, two B sites in combination dictate the properties of A2BB&#8242;X6 (A=monocation, X=halide) double perovskites. Correctly picking two B sites is more challenging than picking just one, as in the AIBIIX3 single perovskites, but the options are greater and, we believe, the rewards are higher when the stakes are doubled. In this Minireview, we emphasize fundamental aspects of halide double perovskites to provide a foundation for interested readers to explore this extraordinary class of materials. In particular, we highlight the differences and similarities between double and single perovskites and describe how the double perovskite structure potentially offers greater control over photophysical properties.

         <title>Controlled Ligand Exchange Between Ruthenium Organometallic Cofactor Precursors and a Na&#239;ve Protein Scaffold Generates Artificial Metalloenzymes Catalysing Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium organometallic complex is transformed into an effective transfer hydrogenation catalyst upon exchanging ligands with a na&#239;ve protein. The direct coordination of protein sidechains to the metal is an underutilised feature in artificial metalloenzymes.







Abstract
Many natural metalloenzymes assemble from proteins and biosynthesised complexes, generating potent catalysts by changing metal coordination. Here we adopt the same strategy to generate artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) using ligand exchange to unmask catalytic activity. By systematically testing RuII(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(bipyridine) complexes designed to facilitate the displacement of functionalised bipyridines, we develop a fast and robust procedure for generating new enzymes via ligand exchange in a protein that has not evolved to bind such a complex. The resulting metal cofactors form peptidic coordination bonds but also retain a non&#8208;biological ligand. Tandem mass spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy were used to characterise the organometallic cofactors and identify the protein&#8208;derived ligands. By introduction of ruthenium cofactors into a 4&#8208;helical bundle, transfer hydrogenation catalysts were generated that displayed a 35&#8208;fold rate increase when compared to the respective small molecule reaction in solution.

         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;phase non&#8208;dissociative electron transfer is used for charge reduction of a donor&#8208;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamer (green). The consecutive co&#8208;conformational transition is monitored using ion mobility spectrometry and infrared ion spectroscopy. Comparing the collision cross section distributions (blue) and infrared spectra (red) recorded for analogous closed&#8208;shell and radical systems highlights differences that can be attributed to radical&#8208;pairing interactions.







Abstract
The digital revolution sets a milestone in the progressive miniaturization of working devices and in the underlying advent of molecular machines. Foldamers involving mechanically entangled components with modular secondary structures are among the most promising designs for molecular switch&#8208;based applications. Characterizing the nature and dynamics of their intramolecular network following the application of a stimulus is the key to their performance. Here, we use non&#8208;dissociative electron transfer as a reductive stimulus in the gas phase and probe the consecutive co&#8208;conformational transitions of a donor&#8208;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamer using electrospray mass spectrometry interfaced with ion mobility and infrared ion spectroscopy. A comparison of collision cross section distributions for analogous closed&#8208;shell and radical molecular ions sheds light on their respective formation energetics, while variations in their respective infrared absorption bands evidence changes in intramolecular organization as the foldamer becomes more compact. These differences are compatible with the advent of radical&#8208;pairing interactions.

         <title>Selective Inhibition of the Hsp90&#945; Isoform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. A structure&#8208;based approach was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.







Abstract
The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. Many of these proteins contribute to the progression of cancer, and consequently, inhibition of the Hsp90 protein folding machinery represents an innovative approach toward cancer chemotherapy. However, clinical trials with Hsp90 N&#8208;terminal inhibitors have encountered deleterious side effects and toxicities, which appear to result from the pan&#8208;inhibition of all four Hsp90 isoforms. Therefore, the development of isoform&#8208;selective Hsp90 inhibitors is sought to delineate the pathological role played by each isoform. Herein, we describe a structure&#8208;based approach that was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.

         <title>Construction of Highly Ordered Glyco&#8208;Inside Nano&#8208;Assemblies through RAFT Dispersion Polymerization of Galactose&#8208;Decorated Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing numerous intermediate morphologies are fabricated by leveraging RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated monomer for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. This method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to expand the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.







Abstract
Glyco&#8208;assemblies derived from amphiphilic sugar&#8208;decorated block copolymers (ASBCs) have emerged prominently due to their wide application, for example, in biomedicine and as drug carriers. However, to efficiently construct these glyco&#8208;assemblies is still a challenge. Herein, we report an efficient technology for the synthesis of glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies by utilizing RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated methacrylate for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Using this approach, a series of highly ordered glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing intermediate morphologies were fabricated by adjusting the length of the hydrophobic glycoblock and the polymerization solids content. A specific morphology of complex vesicles was captured during the PISA process and the formation mechanism is explained by the morphology of its precursor and intermediate. Thus, this method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to enable the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.

         <dc:description>
(NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx decorated GO is used as a hole booster in all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC. A champion efficiency of 10.95&#8201;% is achieved arising from the charge transfer doping effect between (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx and GO.







Abstract
The precise regulation of interfacial charge distribution highly determines the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inorganic (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide (GO) is successfully demonstrated as a hole booster for all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC free of precious metal electrode. Arising from the spontaneous electron transfer induced p&#8208;type doping of GO from edged oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups to (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx, the best all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC achieves an efficiency of 10.95&#8201;% under one standard sun owing to the eliminated paradox between charge extraction and charge localization in GO surface. Furthermore, the champion device exhibits an excellent long&#8208;term stability at 10&#8201;% relative humidity without encapsulation over 70&#8197;days because of the suppressed ions migration.
