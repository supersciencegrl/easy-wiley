         <dc:description>
In their Research Article (e202515805), Ye Wang et&#160;al. reporte the controllable synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (PdxPy, &lt; 2 nm) via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO2&#8208;supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy enhances the atom utilization of Pd and modulates its geometric structure. The sub&#8208;2 nm PdxPy exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&#8722;1 for selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.

         <title>C&#9472;H Amination of Polypropylene with Sodium N&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy to introduce diverse N&#8208;containing groups onto polypropylene materials under mild conditions via C&#9472;H functionalization has been developed. A series of aminated polypropylenes retaining crystallinity and molecular weight could be obtained while exhibiting new properties not present in virgin PP, such as improved compatibility in mixed plastic blends, enhanced adhesion to metals, and fluorescence properties.








Abstract
Polypropylene (PP) is one of the most produced polymers. To meet the requirements of many modern technologies, it is very urgent to introduce diverse functional groups onto PP. Selective C&#9472;N bonds forming via C&#9472;H functionalization have been considered as a universal platform; however, it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a mild, catalyst&#8208;free, and light&#8208;free C&#9472;H amination of both commodity and postconsumer PP using sodium N&#8208;chloro&#8208;amides as nitrogen sources. This method allows the efficient preparation of a variety of aminated PP materials (up to 2.4 mol% LOF) via direct functionalizations and subsequent functional group transformations. These aminated materials retain crystallinity and molecular weight while exhibiting new properties not present in virgin PP, such as improved compatibility in mixed plastic blends, enhanced adhesion to metals, and fluorescence properties. This work also provides a sustainable strategy to expand the use of PP waste.

         <title>Engineering Autonomous Micro&#8208;/Nanorobots for Neurological Diseases: From Barrier Crossing to Neuroenergetic Restoration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview explores the potential of micro&#8208;/nanorobots in treating neurological diseases, focusing on blood&#8208;brain barrier penetration, stem cell regulation, and energy metabolism modulation. These advancements shift treatment toward more precise, targeted therapies, with intelligent technologies offering promising prospects for revolutionizing care.








Abstract
Neurological diseases (NDs) are associated with barrier transport dysfunction, abnormal protein aggregation, and impaired cellular energy metabolism, with bioenergetic deficits increasingly recognized as a central factor in disease progression. Micro&#8208;/nanorobots offer a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling active and targeted regulation of neuronal metabolism. Unlike passive nanocarriers, micro&#8208;/nanorobots can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) under external guidance and deliver therapeutic agents with subcellular precision. By integrating mitochondrial&#8208;targeting components, ATP&#8208;generating modules, and redox&#8208; or ion&#8208;responsive release systems, they can restore cellular energy supply and attenuate oxidative stress, thereby improving metabolic function, synaptic activity, and neural repair. This minireview summarizes recent advances in micro&#8208;/nanorobot applications for drug delivery, barrier penetration, stem&#8208;cell differentiation, and metabolic regulation. It explores their potential roles in improving neuronal function, limiting pathological protein aggregation, and facilitating neural network reconstruction. Also, clinical translation faces significant challenges, including safety evaluation, large&#8208;scale manufacturing, and regulatory compliance. A therapeutic framework centered on micro&#8208;/nanorobot&#8208;mediated metabolic regulation may provide a novel and effective approach for treating NDs.

         <title>Breaking of the Up&#8208;Down Symmetry of DNA Origami on a Solid Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the surface orientation of chiral double&#8208;L (CDL) DNA origami on mica was controlled by tuning magnesium ion (Mg2&#8314;) concentration. This simple yet powerful method, exploiting global shape distortions, achieved 100% S orientation enabling precise nanostructure deposition.








Abstract
Controlling the surface orientation of DNA origami nanostructures (DON) is crucial for applications in nanotechnology and materials science. While previous work utilized various DON modifications, simple methods for controlling their landing orientation remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward approach to control the adsorption orientation of chiral double&#8208;L (CDL) DON on mica by tuning magnesium ion (Mg2&#8314;) concentration and exploiting global shape distortions. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we analyzed the resulting distribution of the mirror&#8208;image orientations, referred to as S and Z orientations, at both buffer/mica and air/mica interfaces and identified conditions resulting in homogenous CDL orientation of 100% S. These results demonstrate how DON conformation and ionic environments influence DON orientation, offering insights for precise nanostructure deposition.

         <title>High&#8208;Selectivity Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to C3&#8208;Glyceraldehyde Coupled to H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a PtSb single&#8208;atom alloy loaded on oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 catalyst, which achieved 87% selectivity for C3&#8208;glyceraldehyde, offering a novel strategy for the glycerol oxidation to produce a single high&#8208;value chemical product.








Abstract
Achieving high selectivity of glyceraldehyde (GLD) products remained challenging due to competing C&#9472;C bond cleavage and multiple reaction pathways during glycerol electrooxidation. Herein, we designed a PtSb single&#8208;atom alloy supported on non&#8208;stoichiometric TiO2 (PtSb1/TiOx), which enabled highly efficient and stable GLD production under neutral conditions. The catalyst achieved 87% GLD selectivity with exceptional stability exceeding 120&#160;h. TiOx support suppressed C&#9472;C bond cleavage, preserving C3 intermediates, while atomic Sb dispersed in the Pt matrix enhanced GLD selectivity. This further stabilized active sites through Pt&#9472;Sb bond formation, which mitigated oxidative deactivation. We integrated PtSb1/TiOx with a Pt&#8208;loaded ZnFeWMn medium&#8208;entropy oxide for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction, enabling simultaneous production of C3 and H2O2 products. In a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly system under neutral conditions, this achieved yields of 0.332&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 for GLD and 0.50&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 for H2O2. In alkaline media, by controlling H2O2 transport, the system attained 72.9% glycerate selectivity without external bias, representing one of the most efficient bias&#8208;free glycerol valorization systems reported. This work pioneered a dual&#8208;strategy approach for catalyst engineering to control reaction pathways and system integration for simultaneous high&#8208;value chemical production.

         <title>Hypercrosslinked Polymers for Volatile and Very Volatile Organic Compound Capture Beyond Commercial Benchmarks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption of volatile and very volatile organic compounds ((V)VOCs) is investigated using hypercrosslinked polymers with varied chemical functionalities. Mixed&#8208;analyte breakthrough experiments reveal how polymer chemistry governs sorption under dry and humid conditions. Amine&#8208;functionalised networks outperform commercial benchmarks, offering broad analyte retention, regenerability, and lower cost, establishing hypercrosslinked polymers as tuneable sorbents for (V)VOC capture.








Abstract
The effective capture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and very volatile organic compounds (VVOCs) is crucial for controlling indoor air quality, environmental monitoring, and emission regulation. However, effective VVOC adsorption remains challenging due to their low boiling points, high vapour pressures, and the susceptibility of many adsorbents to competitive water sorption. Here, we report a systematic study on the role of chemical functionality in hypercrosslinked polymers for (V)VOC capture under realistic operational conditions. A series of fluorene&#8208;based hypercrosslinked polymers bearing heteroatom substituents (C, N, O, S, and SO2) was synthesised and characterised, exhibiting high thermal stability, surface areas up to 1600&#160;m2&#183;g&#8722;1, and micro&#8208;/mesoporous architectures. The adsorption performance of these networks is evaluated using thermodesorption&#8208; and headspace&#8208;gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry. Under both dry and humid atmospheres, the hypercrosslinked polymers outperform a commercial benchmark sorbent in the uptake of a ten&#8208;component (V)VOC mixture, with the amine&#8208;functionalised network achieving the broadest analyte retention range even in the presence of water vapour. Our findings elucidate how polymer chemistry governs sorption behaviour and establish hypercrosslinked polymers as high&#8208;performance, tuneable alternatives to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial sorbents for capturing volatile analytes.

         <title>Rhodopsin&#8208;Mimicking Reversible Photo&#8208;Switchable Chloride Channels Based on Azobenzene&#8208;Appended Semiaza&#8208;Bambusurils for Light&#8208;Controlled Ion Transport and Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>

         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;appended semiaza&#8208;bambusuril macrocycles act as light&#8208;gated anion channels. UVA and visible light toggle E/Z isomers, enabling reversible ON/OFF chloride transport in liposomes and cells. This photo&#8208;switchable system offers a new design strategy for stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular therapeutics.








Abstract
The ability to control ion transport across membranes in living systems by stimulus&#8208;responsive natural channels, such as channelrhodopsins and their mimics, is a revolutionary tool for understanding biological processes. Herein, we demonstrate a new class of azo&#8208;functionalized bambusurils (azo&#8208;BUs) that act as efficient, photo&#8208;switchable anion channels capable of modulating chloride flux across lipid membranes and within cellular environments. The (E)&#8208;isomer exhibits pronounced chloride transport activity, which can be reversibly toggled via light&#8208;induced isomerization, enabling precise spatiotemporal control. Mechanistic studies reveal that the (E)&#8208;form induces apoptosis through mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen spieces (ROS) generation, and cytochrome c release, while also disrupting lysosomal acidification via H&#8314;/Cl&#8722; cotransport. This dual perturbation of cytosolic and lysosomal ion homeostasis underscores the compound's multifaceted cytotoxic mechanism. In contrast, the (Z)&#8208;isomer displayed minimal transport activity and negligible cytotoxicity, reinforcing its role as the inactive, photo&#8208;switchable OFF state in this system. The ability to control transport activity with light positions azo&#8208;BUs as promising candidates for the development of next&#8208;generation, stimuli&#8208;responsive anticancer agents. This work introduces a reversible photo&#8208;gated anion channel with therapeutic potential, offering a powerful platform for studying membrane transport and designing light&#8208;responsive biomedical tools.

         <title>The Effect of Cap Structure and Poly(A) Positioning on mRNA Translation Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We examined how protein synthesis is affected when the positions of two major structural elements of eukaryotic mRNA&#8212;the 5&#8242; cap and the 3&#8242; poly(A) tail&#8212;are reversed. Reversing their orientation resulted in a marked reduction in protein production. This decrease is likely due to the essential role of cap positioning at the 5&#8242; end for efficient translation initiation, coupled with an inhibitory influence of the poly(A) positioned at the 5&#8242; end.








Abstract
We investigated the relationship between mRNA structure and translation activity using our recently developed chemical method to add a cap structure to an oligonucleotide and a technique for purifying capped mRNAs via reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) employing a photoreactive tag. Specifically, we designed and synthesized mRNA constructs in which the typical eukaryotic elements&#8212;the 5&#8242; cap and the 3&#8242; poly(A) tail&#8212;were interchanged in position. We examined how this inversion affected translation efficiency. The results revealed that this reversed configuration abolished the synergistic enhancement of translation typically observed with correctly positioned cap and poly(A) tail, resulting in a substantial decrease in activity compared to the native orientation. Interestingly, focusing solely on the cap structure, capping at the 3&#8242; end&#8212;though less effective than at the 5&#8242; end&#8212;still promoted a measurable increase in translation. Moreover, the poly(A) sequence placed at the 5&#8242; end was found to suppress translation. We also prepared mRNAs containing a poly(A) tail with reversed 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; orientation and demonstrated that this inverted poly(A) could still enhance protein synthesis.

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Heteroleptic Metallacages for Enhanced Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design of porphyrin&#8208;based heteroleptic metallacages that mediate directional photoinduced electron transfer for efficient confined photocatalysis. One of the metallacages, constructed via multicomponent self&#8208;assembly, incorporate electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine ligands that enhance charge separation and superoxide generation, leading to improved photocatalytic activity in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative coupling of tetraorganoborates.








Abstract
The rational design of supramolecular architectures capable of mediating directional photoinduced electron transfer (PET) remains a central challenge in confined photocatalysis. Herein, we report two porphyrin&#8208;based heteroleptic metallacages, constructed via multicomponent coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, for the visible light&#8208;driven oxidative coupling of tetraorganoborates. Both metallacages feature well&#8208;defined, positively charged cavities that enable selective substrate encapsulation and efficient catalytic turnover. In particular, one metallacage incorporates electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine units that engage in directional interligand PET with the porphyrin moieties, as supported by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This intramolecular PET promotes long&#8208;lived charge separation and enhances superoxide anion generation, resulting in markedly improved photocatalytic activity compared to control systems lacking donor&#8211;acceptor motifs. This study demonstrates a modular strategy for integrating electron donor and acceptor functionalities within a single supramolecular scaffold and highlights the potential of PET&#8208;enhanced cage&#8208;based photocatalysis, providing a versatile platform for sustainable light&#8208;driven chemical transformations.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Twisted Intramolecular Charge Transfer (TICT) Dyes into Bright Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile supramolecular strategy to transform environment&#8208;sensitive twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) dyes into bright fluorophores with retained large Stokes shifts in aqueous media is reported. By embedding TICT dyes within a rigid microdomain provided by a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, nonradiative decay pathways, particularly the TICT process, are effectively suppressed, leading to enhanced radiative emission.








Abstract
Twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) dyes are promising candidates for bioimaging and sensing due to their environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescence and large Stokes shifts. However, their inherently low fluorescence quantum yields in aqueous media have limited their practical applications. Here, we present a general supramolecular strategy to transform a broad range of TICT dyes into bright fluorophores with large Stokes shifts. By noncovalently dispersing the dyes into the rigid microdomain of a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold in water, the formation of the non&#8208;radiative TICT state is effectively suppressed. The resulting supramolecular TICT dyes exhibit dramatically enhanced fluorescence quantum yields (up to 42.3%), while preserving large Stokes shifts of up to 107&#160;nm. Particularly, supramolecular TICT dyes emitting in the NIR region display excellent photostability, enabling applications in long&#8208;term bioimaging and single&#8208;excitation multi&#8208;color imaging in live cells. This work offers a versatile and modular supramolecular approach to generate high&#8208;performance fluorophores from otherwise low&#8208; or non&#8208;emissive TICT dyes, greatly broadening their potential in biological and optical applications.

     alt="Supramolecular Engineering of Twisted Intramolecular Charge Transfer (TICT) Dyes into Bright Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shifts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A versatile supramolecular strategy to transform environment-sensitive twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) dyes into bright fluorophores with retained large Stokes shifts in aqueous media is reported. By embedding TICT dyes within a rigid microdomain provided by a cyclic peptide-based supramolecular scaffold, nonradiative decay pathways, particularly the TICT process, are effectively suppressed, leading to enhanced radiative emission.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) dyes are promising candidates for bioimaging and sensing due to their environment-sensitive fluorescence and large Stokes shifts. However, their inherently low fluorescence quantum yields in aqueous media have limited their practical applications. Here, we present a general supramolecular strategy to transform a broad range of TICT dyes into bright fluorophores with large Stokes shifts. By noncovalently dispersing the dyes into the rigid microdomain of a cyclic peptide-based supramolecular scaffold in water, the formation of the non-radiative TICT state is effectively suppressed. The resulting supramolecular TICT dyes exhibit dramatically enhanced fluorescence quantum yields (up to 42.3%), while preserving large Stokes shifts of up to 107&#160;nm. Particularly, supramolecular TICT dyes emitting in the NIR region display excellent photostability, enabling applications in long-term bioimaging and single-excitation multi-color imaging in live cells. This work offers a versatile and modular supramolecular approach to generate high-performance fluorophores from otherwise low- or non-emissive TICT dyes, greatly broadening their potential in biological and optical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Crystalline Bismuth(II) Radical Anion: Synthesis, Characterization, and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;shaped Bi(III) trisamide featuring a sterically demanding NNN pincer ligand was prepared. The planarization of the Bi center furnishes a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital with distinct Bi(6p) orbital character which unlocks clean one&#8208;electron reduction to afford a crystalline Bi(II) radical anion. Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis reveals the localization of the unpaired electron at the bismuth center further confirmed by reactivity studies.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of a planarized tris&#8208;amidobismuthane supported by a rigid, bulky NNN pincer ligand, which enforces a T&#8208;shaped geometry at the bismuth center. The Bi(NNN) complex features a low&#8208;lying LUMO with distinct Bi(6p) orbital character as shown by DFT calculations. Cyclic voltammetry reveals a fully reversible one&#8208;electron reduction at E1/2&#160;=&#160;&#8211;1.85&#160;V versus Fc0/+ in THF. Chemical reduction with KC8 in the presence of 4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane (222&#8208;crypt) enables the isolation of an unprecedented Bi(II) radical anion in high isolated yields. Multi&#8208;frequency EPR, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry complemented by theoretical calculations confirm localization of the unpaired electron on the bismuth center. Preliminary reactivity studies display radical reactivity as shown by single&#8208;electron transfer chemistry and radical coupling reactions.

         <title>Rational Crystal Contact Engineering for Programmable Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Winning by losing: With rational elimination of crystal lattice contacts, the remaining interaction sites drive the formation of predetermined assemblies. Thus, rational lattice redesign can produce multiple structured frameworks from essentially the same building blocks, without resource&#8208;costly calculations required for new designs.








Abstract
Ordered protein&#8208;based assemblies are increasingly desirable for materials science, but the design of new materials remains challenging and requires considerable effort. Crystal lattice contact modulation enables rapid rational design of an assortment of structurally diverse constructs with crystalline order. Targeted disruption of crystal contacts and directional growth pre&#8208;biasing allows for restricting crystal lattice growth in selected directions, resulting in lower&#8208;dimension assemblies with parent crystal structural features. Two&#8208;dimensional crystals, one&#8208;dimensional fibres, flexible ribbons, and single&#8208;walled nanotubes based on tetratricopeptide repeat proteins were constructed from reengineered 3D crystal lattices. The large library of available crystal structures provides an abundance of engineering targets, promising to make crystal contact engineering a rapid and attractive approach for the design of ordered supramolecular protein assemblies.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component Dearomative Coupling of Bromoarenes: Modular Construction of Terpenoid Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed, enantioselective three&#8208;component dearomative coupling of bromoarenes, silyldiazomethane, and malonates has been developed. This method employs a newly designed chiral ligand to efficiently construct 1,4&#8208;disubstituted hydrogenated naphthalenes, providing a concise and versatile strategy for the synthesis of terpenoid natural products. 








Abstract
We report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric three&#8208;component coupling of bromoarenes, diazoalkanes, and malonates. It represents a significant advancement in catalytic enantioselective dearomative 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated arenes. A palladium catalyst of a novel phosphoramidite enables a domino reaction consisting of enantiofacial aryl insertion of a bound diazoalkane and regioselective and stereospecific allylic substitution. The new reaction was readily applied in short total syntheses of three terpenoids, including (+)&#8208;erogorgiaene, (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydrocadalin, and (&#8722;)&#8208;odongrossin C. Mechanistic studies establish that stereocontrol arises from a concerted aryl migration/N2 extrusion, which forms the key cyclic &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate. The C4&#8208;regioselectivity of the malonate attack is governed by a combination of ligand effects, silyl group sterics, and stabilizing noncovalent interactions between the naphthyl ring and sodium malonate.

         <title>Valence&#8208;Modulated Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) Cathode Tuned by Orbital&#8208;Delocalization for Extreme&#8208;Temperature Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional NFPP cathodes suffer from slow Na&#8314; diffusion, low capacity, and structural degradation. We propose an orbital&#8208;delocalization assisted valence modulation strategy, optimizing Na&#8314; pathways for ultralow&#8208;temperature (&#8722;40&#8239;&#176;C) operation and creating multiple redox centers to boost capacity and conductivity. NFPP&#8208;2Mo exhibits enhanced structural stability, resisting electrolyte attack even at 60&#8239;&#176;C, ensuring long&#8208;term integrity. This approach enables wide&#8208;temperature (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8239;&#176;C) functionality, fast charging/discharging, and extended lifespan, addressing key Na&#8208;ion cathode challenges.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based polyanionic Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with its cost&#8208;effectiveness and stable framework. However, its commercialization is seriously hindered by sluggish Na+ kinetics, and insufficient capacity utilization. Herein, an orbital&#8208;delocalization assisted valence modulated strategy is proposed to address these challenges. The lattice is stabilized by high&#8208;valence Mo6+ through robust Mo&#9472;O bonds, simultaneously reducing Na+ diffusion barriers and activating the inert Na2 sites, while electron delocalization is effectively promoted by its partially filled 3d orbitals to enhance electronic conductivity. Concurrently, additional charge compensation is also provided by Mo4+ via a reversible Mo4+/Mo6+ redox couple, enabling complete Na+ extraction/insertion and suppression of structure distortion. A record&#8208;high discharge capacity of 130.74&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C is delivered by the optimized Na4Fe2.91Mo0.09(PO4)2(P2O7) cathode, with 87.23% capacity retained after 10&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;C, along with stable operation from&#160;&#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. A universal paradigm for high&#8208;performance polyanionic cathodes is established by this synergistic reinforcement approach, advancing durable and high&#8208;power SIBs.

A record-high discharge capacity of 130.74&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;C is delivered by the optimized Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2.91&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.09&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) cathode, with 87.23% capacity retained after 10&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;C, along with stable operation from&#160;&#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. A universal paradigm for high-performance polyanionic cathodes is established by this synergistic reinforcement approach, advancing durable and high-power SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Reversible Chemoenzymatic Labeling Strategy for Profiling of Protein O&#8208;Glucosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible chemoenzymatic labeling strategy for the efficient analysis of protein O&#8208;Glc was developed, and numerous canonical and noncanonical O&#8208;Glc modifications were identified across human cell lines with mass spectrometry (MS) technology, suggesting protein O&#8208;Glc is a widespread post&#8208;translational protein modification.








Abstract
O&#8208;linked glucose (O&#8208;Glc), the &#946;&#8208;linked modification of serine residues, is a rare form of protein glycosylation first identified on proteins containing epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#8208;like domains (canonical O&#8208;Glc). Several recent studies revealed that proteins lacking EGF&#8208;like domains could also undergo O&#8208;Glc modification (noncanonical O&#8208;Glc). However, the biosynthetic origin and biological function of protein O&#8208;glucosylation remain poorly understood and debated, owing to the lack of effective analytical tools. Here, a reversible chemoenzymatic labeling strategy for O&#8208;Glc analysis is described. By the strategy described, a large number of canonical and noncanonical O&#8208;Glc sites were identified in human cell lines, indicating that protein O&#8208;Glc is a widespread post&#8208;translational protein modification.

         <title>Spatial Decoupling of Adsorption and Transformation Sites on Ag&#8208;Cu Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically paired neighboring Ag and Cu sites on g&#8208;C3N4 with their synergistic functions enable photocatalytic tandem nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion under visible light irradiation via the creation of an unique microenvironment: Cu sites adsorb and activate NO3&#8211;, whereas adjacent Ag sites stabilize *NO intermediates and modulate the proton supply suppressing the hydrogen reaction evolution for achieving fast spatially decoupling adsorption&#8208;transformation pathways with 98% NH3 selectivity.








Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8211;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) presents a sustainable solution for simultaneous NH3 synthesis and wastewater remediation. However, achieving high selectivity is challenging, plagued by sluggish kinetics and parasitic side reactions. In this study, we rationally design a synergistic Ag&#8208;Cu dual&#8208;atom catalyst on g&#8208;C3N4 (AgCu&#8208;CN) that embodies a spatially decoupled tandem scheme. We demonstrate that the oxophilic Cu1 site serve as Lewis acid centers to efficiently capture and activate NO3&#8211;, before the crucial *NO intermediate is shuttled to adjacent Ag1 site, which is intrinsically inert toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, act as dedicated hydrogenation center for rapid and deep *NO reduction. This atomic&#8208;level synergy manifests in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, with AgCu&#8208;CN delivering an impressive 98% NH3 selectivity and a production rate of 630.5&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under visible light. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations corroborate the tandem mechanism and the critical role of the Ag&#8208;Cu dual sites in steering reaction selectivity. This study establishes a powerful tandem catalytic design principle to manage the selectivity challenges in complex multi&#8208;proton/electron reactions.

         <title>Photocatalytic Partial Water Dissociation by Protonated Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated graphitic carbon nitride photocatalyst reduces the bond dissociation energy of water to 1.48&#160;eV, enabling partial water dissociation for efficient hydrogenation reactions under visible light irradiation at a practical scale in a flow system.








Abstract
Catalytic hydrogenation using pressurized hydrogen at elevated temperature is of utmost importance in refinery and fine chemical industries, but heavily relies on the hydrocarbon reforming industry. Photocatalytic water dissociation provides a sustainable solution for hydrogenation; however, the strong O&#9472;H bond and instant recombination of generated hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals need to be solved. Here, we demonstrate efficient hydrogenation of unsaturated aromatics using water by a protonated graphitic carbon nitride photocatalyst with dioxane as a hydroxyl radical trap under mild conditions. The dissociation energy of the H&#9472;O bond is reduced from 5.15 to only 1.48&#160;eV, enabling the formation of H atoms and surface adsorbed hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OHads) under visible light. The &#8226;OHads reacts with dioxane, yielding value&#8208;added dioxane&#8208;2&#8208;ol and prolonging the lifetime of hydrogen atoms for hydrogenation. A high quantum efficiency of &#8764;6% can be realized under visible light irradiation for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic bromides and aldehydes with high conversion. This approach is scalable in a flow system, revealing financial and environmental potential for hydrogenation and deuteration at a practical level.

         <title>Difluorinative Cyclopropene Rearrangement by I(I)/I(III) Catalysis: Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Allyl Difluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A difluorinative rearrangement of substituted cyclopropenes is disclosed using I(I)/I(III) catalysis. This platform enables di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl difluorides to be generated with high levels of stereoselectivity, with the I(III) center serving as a traceless directing group. X&#8208;ray crystal structural analysis is described together with facile post&#8208;reaction modifications that include expedient access to fluorinated indenes.








Abstract
Allyl difluorides are pervasive in the pharmaceutical arena, but synthetic challenges in the construction of highly substituted derivatives impede chemical space exploration. Consequently, efforts to develop general approaches that display high levels of regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity continue to be intensively pursued. To contribute to this vibrant area of contemporary organofluorine chemistry, a highly efficient difluorinative rearrangement of densely substituted cyclopropenes is disclosed under the auspices of I(I)/I(III) catalysis. This platform leverages a highly intuitive ring opening model that enables di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl difluorides to be generated with high levels of stereoselectivity where the transient I(III) center serves as a traceless directing group. X&#8208;ray crystal structural analysis is described together with facile post&#8208;reaction modifications that include expedient access to fluorinated indenes. Given the ubiquity of the allyl difluoride chemotype in drug discovery, it is envisaged that this operationally simple, organocatalytic platform will expedite bioisostere design.

         <title>Synergistic Mechanism of Nanochannels and Chain Migration in Bioinspired Solid&#8208;State Gel Electrolytes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate, Long&#8208;Life Flexible Tin&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from neurons, we show a calcium&#8208;coordinated multidimensional nanochannel gel polymer electrolyte, incorporating one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional of polyacrylamide, cellulose nanofibers&#8208;graphene oxide, and calcium ion&#8208;adsorbed single&#8208;layer montmorillonite. It displays remarkable tensile property and ionic conductivity. The tin&#8208;air battery exhibits an ultralong cycle life (195&#160;h) and an exceptional rate capability (50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
Flexible high&#8208;performance tin&#8208;air batteries (FTABs) exhibit transformative potential for wearable electronics. Nonetheless, the rate performance and cycle life are still limited by the sluggish hydroxide ion transport in gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), along with the inactive tin and dendrites. Herein, drawing inspiration from the structure of neurons, we show a calcium&#8208;coordinated multidimensional nanochannel GPE, incorporating one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional of polyacrylamide, cellulose nanofibers&#8208;graphene oxide, and calcium ion&#8208;adsorbed single&#8208;layer montmorillonite (PAM/CNF&#8208;GO/CaSMMT). The bionic GPEs demonstrate remarkable tensile property (1350%), and ultra&#8208;high ionic conductivity (294 mS&#183;cm&#8722;1). The integration of kinetic isotope effect (KIE) technology and molecular dynamics simulations has, for the first time, elucidated the continuous multidimensional nanochannels and chain migration mechanism. The FTABs exhibit an ultralong cycle life up to 195 h, outperforming the previous tin&#8208;air batteries. In addition, the device achieves an exceptional rate capability of 50 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, while almost maintaining structural integrity under various deformations. This work has driven the development of flexible tin&#8208;air batteries and set a new benchmark for the next generation of wearable energy storage.

         <title>Layered Double Hydroxides as Building Blocks for Precise Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines recent advances in using layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and their topotactic derivatives as platforms for precise catalysis. By enabling atomic&#8208;level control over active site composition, structure, and interfaces, LDH&#8208;derived catalysts achieve enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in key reactions, including electrocatalysis, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and syngas conversion. 








Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are structurally tunable, 2D materials that serve as versatile precursors for the design of heterogeneous catalysts. Their unique lamellar architecture, topotactic transformation ability, and compositional flexibility enable the fabrication of monometallic, bimetallic, and intermetallic catalysts with atomically controlled active sites. These LDH&#8208;derived catalysts feature high metal dispersion, strong metal&#8211;support interactions, and defect&#8208;rich interfaces, which are key attributes for precise catalysis. Recent advances have demonstrated their broad applicability in electrocatalysis (e.g., oxygen evolution and CO2 reduction), selective hydrogenation, direct and oxidative dehydrogenation, and syngas conversion. Across these reactions, LDH&#8208;derived systems offer enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability by tailoring active site geometry, electronic structure, and interfacial properties. This review summarizes the advances in synthesis, structure&#8211;function relationships, and catalytic applications of LDH&#8208;based catalysts. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in understanding transformation mechanisms, capturing dynamic active sites under working conditions, and establishing predictive design rules. Future efforts combining operando spectroscopy, theory, and data&#8208;driven approaches are expected to unlock the full potential of LDH&#8208;derived materials for precise catalysis in sustainable energy and chemical transformations.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Engineering and Modification of Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases Based on Golden Gate Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Golden Gate Assembly (GGA)&#8208;based method was developed for the efficient assembly of natural and engineered non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). This method has enabled the creation of NRPS libraries to generate novel peptides in high&#8208;throughput as well as the targeted derivatisation of natural products (NPs).








Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are multimodular enzymes that produce complex peptides with diverse biological activities, potentially being used as clinical drugs. However, the pharmaceutical applications of such natural peptides often require further derivatisation and modification of the peptide backbone, mainly performed by chemical synthesis. A sustainable alternative resembles the in vivo engineering of NRPS to change and modify the enzyme properties rationally and, thus, the produced products. The novel NRPS engineering approach, the eXchange Unit Thiolation domain (XUT) concept, allows the efficient modular assembly of different natural NRPS fragments to form hybrid NRPS that produce defined peptides. In this study, we describe a Golden Gate Assembly (GGA)&#8208;based method for efficient high&#8208;throughput generation of novel and engineered NRPS libraries utilising the XUT concept. This method was applied to generate over 100 novel NRPS with the possibility of changing starter, elongation, and termination modules, respectively. Additionally, we applied this method for targeted modification of the xenoamicin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) xabABCD from Xenorhabdus doucetiae, resulting in the generation of 25 novel xenoamicin derivatives.

         <title>Engineered Thermostable Chemically Responsive GlowCas9 System for Real&#8208;Time Therapeutic Monitoring Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CRISPR&#8208;associated protein SpCas9 was rationally engineered by fusing a split nanoluciferase to form a thermostable and reporter enzyme, GlowCas9. The GlowCas9 is chemically responsive and detectable in vitro and in vivo with high sensitivity without the need for expensive antibodies. The dual&#8208;function GlowCas9 is superior in gene editing and homology&#8208;based DNA repair applications than the wild&#8208;type Cas9. The protein engineering strategy is generalizable to other CRISPR enzyme orthologs, like in SaCas9.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR&#8208;associated protein (Cas) has revolutionized gene therapy applications due to its ease of design and efficiency, albeit accompanied by off&#8208;target effects. Spatiotemporally regulated Cas9 offers safer gene editing methods due to its lower off&#8208;target mediated genotoxicities; however, probing the Cas9 in real time for assessing the delivery efficiency, gene editing timeframe, and spatial target information remains elusive. Here, we report an engineered Cas9 system, GlowCas9, that can be probed chemically in real&#8208;time across all assay systems, including cell lysate, native gel, ex vivo, and in vivo. Importantly, we rationally engineered the Cas9 system to attain remarkable thermostability with enhanced gene editing activities. Besides its sensitive reporter and enhanced gene editing activity, the GlowCas9 system exhibits precision HDR&#8208;based gene knock&#8208;in ability in cells and significantly outperformed the WTCas9. Overall, we report a new thermostable engineered SpCas9 system for real&#8208;time theratracking applications compatible with diverse assay formats, including live ex vivo and in vivo. This GlowCas9 system will add a new dimension of non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time tracking in gene therapy development, both ex vivo and in vivo.

         <title>Mapping Boryl Radical Properties and Reactivity Using Machine Learning: The B&#8208;Rad and React&#8208;B&#8208;Rad Maps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boryl radicals are central to synthesis, yet their steric and electronic complexity makes systematic mapping challenging. The B&#8208;rad map organizes 141 in silico&#8208;parametrized 7e&#8208;4c radicals into five meaningful clusters via unsupervised learning. React&#8208;B&#8208;rad maps enriched with computed barriers reveal reactivity trends, while supervised classification confirms predictive power, establishing a platform for virtual design and screening.








Abstract
Boryl radicals have become indispensable in organic synthesis, yet, translating their complex steric and electronic properties into actionable reactivity insights remains challenging. Herein, we present a comprehensive classification of boryl radicals, including a publicly accessible database of 141 neutral 7e&#8208;4c boryl radicals, each parametrized by a set of electronic and steric features derived from DFT calculations. Unsupervised machine learning (k&#8208;means clustering) and dimensionality reduction (PCA/UMAP) condense this high dimensional descriptor space into the &#8220;B&#8208;rad map&#8221;, capturing trends in sterics and electronics among the resulting five clusters. Global electrophilicity (&#969;) and nucleophilicity (N) indices are overlaid to create a polarity&#8209;annotated guide, while DFT&#8209;computed activation free energies for six benchmark reactions (HAT, radical addition, and XAT for two different substrates) yield the React&#8209;B&#8209;rad maps that directly link intrinsic properties to specific reaction performance. To demonstrate predictive power, supervised machine learning models (random forest) are trained on the descriptors and successfully predict radical reactivity regimes across all reaction types. Overall, this integrated, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven platform can serve as both a practical guide for experimental decision&#8208;making and a foundation for data&#8208;driven discovery, paving the way towards rational design and virtual screening of boryl&#8208;radical reagents for diverse synthetic applications.

         <title>Tough Supramolecular Glasses Enabled by Frustrated Non&#8208;Covalent Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated noncovalent complexation has been developed as an effective route to tough supramolecular glasses, by installing steric isopropyl groups adjacent to directional squaramide hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs. Compared with a nonfrustrated control, the frustrated design increases mechanical toughness by 4.3&#8208;fold and enhances interfacial adhesion, enabling the resulting supramolecular glasses to function as impact&#8208;resistant coatings. 








Abstract
Supramolecular glasses, as noncovalently cross&#8208;linked amorphous materials, are hampered by a fundamental trade&#8208;off between vitrification and mechanical performance. Here we propose a strategy&#8212;&#8220;frustrated non&#8208;covalent complexation&#8221;&#8212;inspired by frustrated Lewis pairs to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by installing sterically hindering isopropyl groups adjacent to directional squaramide hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs. Relative to a nonfrustrated control, this design not only generates more loosely packed hydrogen&#8208;bonded domains but also shifts the dominant interactions from squaramide&#8211;squaramide to squaramide&#8211;ester hydrogen bonding. The frustrated system yields a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in mechanical toughness in the resulting supramolecular glass, facilitated by efficient energy dissipation through reversible hydrogen&#8208;bond rupture. It also enhances interfacial adhesion, functioning as an effective impact&#8208;resistant coating that mitigates substrate fracture. Overall, this work establishes frustrated noncovalent complexation as a powerful paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance supramolecular glass materials.

         <title>Carbonothioate&#8208;Triggered Cascade Cyclization Enables High&#8208;Specificity Fluorescence Imaging of Hydrogen Polysulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonothioate&#8208;triggered cascade cyclization strategy enabled near&#8208;infrared probe CTP&#8208;8 for highly selective hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn) sensing. It achieves first&#8208;ever imaging of H2Sn dynamics in insulin&#8208;resistant live cells and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. The trigger is adaptable to diverse phenolic hydroxyl&#8208;containing fluorophores, providing a modular platform for future probes.








Abstract
Hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn; n&#160;&gt;&#160;1) are critical redox signaling molecules. While the biological functions of H2Sn have received much attention, their exact action mechanisms are still poorly understood due to the lack of reliable detection methods. In this context, fluorescent probes for H2Sn are emerging as powerful chemical tools to aid in unraveling its contributions to biology. Currently, most available H2Sn probes are prone to interference from biothiols or hydrogen sulfide (H2S). To address this challenge, herein, we report a unique carbonothioate&#8208;based trigger utilizing a cascade cyclization reaction for specific detection of H2Sn. Using this strategy, eight new fluorescent probes (CTP 1&#8211;8) were prepared and evaluated. Among them, CTP&#8208;8 not only enables highly sensitive and selective detection of H2Sn but also allows visualization of H2Sn fluctuations in living cells and mice. Significantly, we demonstrate for the first time the fluorescence imaging of endogenous H2Sn dynamics in insulin&#8208;resistant cells and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. Besides, this carbonothioate&#8208;based trigger could also be potentially utilized in other fluorescent dye scaffolds that possess an optically tunable phenolic hydroxyl group. This work provides a useful approach for further investigations of H2Sn biology as well as future probe development.

         <title>Cu&#8211;Ce Dual&#8211;Atom Sites Embedded in Zeolites Boost Resistance to Impurity Interference for Environmental Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedding Cu&#8208;Ce dual&#8208;atom sites in zeolites enhances catalyst resistance to impurity poisoning for environmental applications. By implanting Ce into Cu&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13, we increase the relative proportion of P&#8208;insensitive Z2Cu2&#8314; sites by forming [ZCe3+(OH)2]+ sites in the 8MRs, while Ce sites preferentially bind phosphorus. This dual function boosts phosphorus tolerance even after hydrothermal aging, offering a general strategy for robust emission control catalysts in challenging conditions.








Abstract
Biodiesel, a carbon&#8208;neutral alternative to fossil fuels, plays a vital role in decarbonizing transportation, with global production exceeding 40 million tons annually. However, its widespread use introduces elevated phosphorus and metal cations into vehicle exhaust, severely deactivating Cu&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13 catalysts for NOX reduction through pore blockage, framework degradation, and Cu sites loss. We present a Cu&#8211;Ce dual&#8208;atom catalyst embedded in SSZ&#8208;13 that maintains high performance in ammonia&#8208;selective catalytic reduction under phosphorus&#8208;rich conditions. Ce species, precisely positioned in eight&#8208;membered rings, displace P&#8208;sensitive [ZCu2+OH]+ sites, enriching the catalyst with P&#8208;tolerant Z2Cu2&#8314; species in six&#8208;membered rings. Concurrent Ce&#9472;P interactions restore the electronic environment of Cu sites, enhancing NH3/NO adsorption and redox cycling. This design sustains 90% NOX conversion and 100% N2 selectivity at 210&#160;&#176;C, even after phosphorus exposure. The strategy is broadly applicable to impurity&#8208;sensitive environmental reactions, including NH3 oxidation and the coupled removal of NOX with VOCs, offering a practical pathway to durable, poison&#8208;resistant catalysts for clean and sustainable mobility.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Centered Organic Salts Enabling Na&#8208;Ion Supply and Interfacial Protection for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CH3B(ONa)2 can be coated on the cathode surface and complete decompose to release Na&#8208;ion below 4.1&#160;V, and in situ generating NaBO2, which protects the cathode interface and inhibits the dissolution of transition metals. The additional CH3&#183; produced can capture active hydrogen in the battery, reducing the occurrence of battery side reactions.








Abstract
Sodium (Na)&#8208;ion batteries employing hard carbon anodes suffer from a significant irreversible loss of active Na ions (up to 20%) during the initial formation cycle. Conventional Na&#8208;ion compensation methods are hindered by issues such as incomplete decomposition of Na&#8208;ion supply agents, the generation of harmful byproducts, and electrode degradation. To address these challenges, we utilized unsupervised machine learning to develop an organic Na salt, methylboronic acid sodium salt (CH3B(ONa)2), which is coated on cathode particles and effectively delivers over 15% Na&#8208;ion compensation. Meanwhile, its decomposition product, sodium metaborate (NaBO2), in situ formed a protective cathode coating that mitigates transition metal dissolution. Spectroscopic and microscopic studies identified a free radical mechanism of CH3B(ONa)2 decomposition reaction and effective inhibition of nickel metal dissolution in cathode due to the presence of NaBO2. In addition, no side effects were found in the process of Na&#8208;ion supply. The initial coulombic efficiency of a hard carbon|P2&#8208;Na0.75Ni0.25Fe0.25Mn0.5O2 pouch cell increased from 81% to 97%, with a capacity retention of 81.5% over 700 cycles. This dual&#8208;function approach significantly enhances cycling stability and capacity retention in Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Chemical Fuel&#8208;Driven Stiffening of Transient Hydrogels via Vitrifiable Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a chemically fueled transient hydrogel that can reversibly and temporarily switch between soft rubbery and stiff glassy states. Mechanistically, a carbodiimide fuel triggers the transient conversion of carboxylic acids to hydrophobic anhydrides, substantially lowering the stiffening temperature of poly(zinc acrylate)&#8208;based copolymer hydrogels. An unprecedented stiffened modulus and modulus increase are achieved with tunable lifetimes.








Abstract
Fuel&#8208;driven transient materials that can temporally adjust their mechanical properties are ubiquitous in living systems, enabling biological functions to be maintained far from equilibrium. While numerous biomimetic transiently stiffened materials have been developed, their low stiffened moduli (typically in the kPa range) severely restrict their practical use in load&#8208;bearing applications. Here we report a chemically fueled transient hydrogel that can stiffen into a highly rigid glassy state via vitrifiable bicontinuous phase separation. The hydrogel is made from thermal&#8208;stiffening poly(zinc acrylate)&#8208;based copolymers, with the stiffening temperature being precisely regulated by the acrylic acid content. Carbodiimide triggers the temporary conversion of carboxylic acids to hydrophobic anhydrides, drastically lowering stiffening temperature and vitrifying polymer&#8208;rich phase under ambient conditions. Consequently, the initial soft hydrogel transforms into a transient glassy state, achieving an ultrahigh modulus of 115&#160;MPa and 920&#8208;fold modulus increase. This phase separation&#8208;mediated dissipative approach significantly enhances the mechanical properties of transient materials with tunable lifetimes.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen Activation Through Redox&#8208;Induced &#948;&#8208;MnO2/Co3&#8208;xMnxO4 Interfaces for Enhanced N2O Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#8211;O covalency in spinel oxide is modulated through redox&#8208;induced &#948;&#8208;MnO2/Co3&#8208;xMnxO4 interfaces, activating lattice oxygen to favor a lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated Mars&#8211;van Krevelen mechanism for N2O decomposition, whereas pristine Co3O4 primarily follows the Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood mechanism.








Abstract
N2O decomposition over spinel catalysts suffers from a spin&#8208;forbidden oxygen recombination step, resulting in substantial kinetic barriers of O2 formation. Herein, we present a redox&#8208;induced interfacial engineering strategy to activate lattice oxygen in spinel oxides, thereby effectively overcoming the kinetic constraints associated with oxygen recombination. In a Co3O4&#8208;based model system, controlled permanganate etching partially substitutes Mn into octahedral Co3+ sites, while simultaneously generating heterointerfaces. The enhanced hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p orbitals and high Co&#8211;O&#8211;Mn covalency induced by the interface between &#948;&#8208;MnO2 and Co3&#8208;xMnxO4, lead to the formation of highly active lattice oxygen species adjacent to the interface. 18O isotope labeling experiment further confirms a dominant lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated Mars&#8211;van Krevelen mechanism for N2O decomposition, whereas pristine Co3O4 predominantly follows the Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood mechanism. Therefore, the optimized catalyst exhibits enhanced N2O decomposition activities, maintaining stability under impurity&#8208;rich conditions. This work offers a promising approach for the rational design of efficient catalysts for N2O abatement and provides mechanistic insights into redox&#8208;induced lattice oxygen activation.

         <title>The Role of Intimate Dipole Carbonyl&#8211;Carbonyl and Hydrogen&#8211;Carbonyl Interactions in the Stereocomplexation and Crystallization: The Case of Poly(Cyclohexene Carbonate)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isotactic poly(cyclohexene carbonate) crystalizes both as enantiopure polymer and upon stereocomplexation of the two opposite enantiomers. Both structures are characterized by multiple H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O&#9552;C tight attractive interactions, whereas in the stereocomplex a tight interdigitation of the two enantiomeric chains occurs due to additional intimate dipole interactions between carbonyl groups of the opposite enantiomers.








Abstract
Enantiopure isotactic poly(cyclohexene carbonate) (PCHC) has been synthesized with chiral Zn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diiminate catalyst. PCHC crystallizes both as enantiopure polymer (R)&#8208;PCHC and (S)&#8208;PCHC and upon stereocomplexation of the two enantiomers. We report the crystal structures of the enantiopure polymer and of the stereocomplex (R/S)&#8208;PCHC and explain their crystallization based on the establishment of multiple attractive H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O&#9552;C interactions between oxygen atoms of carbonyl groups and the hydrogen atoms of the cyclohexyl rings and C&#9552;O&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;C&#9552;O intimate dipole interactions between carbonyl groups of chains of opposite chirality in the stereocomplex. The crystal structure of the enantiopure polymer is characterized by chains in 2/1 helical conformation packed in the orthorhombic unit cell with axes a&#160;=&#160;11.55&#160;&#197;, b&#160;=&#160;9.42&#160;&#197;, and c&#160;=&#160;7.36&#160;&#197;, according to the space group P212121, with steric interdigitation between chains of similar chirality favored by multiple attractive H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O&#9552;C interactions. The stereocomplex crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell with axes a&#160;=&#160;10.40&#160;&#197;, b&#160;=&#160;8.41&#160;&#197;, and c&#160;=&#160;7.36&#160;&#197;, according to the space group Pbc21, driven by establishment of additional C&#9552;O&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;C&#9552;O dipole interactions between carbonyl groups of chains of opposite chirality, besides of the multiple attractive H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O&#9552;C interactions.

         <title>Photooxidation&#8208;Induced Ultrabright and Ultraphotostable NIR&#8208;II Emissive Water&#8208;Soluble Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an illumination method to generate water&#8208;soluble gold nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;high NIR&#8208;II QY (&#8764;14% in H2O, &#8764;60% in D2O) and photostability (unchanged emission for hours). Photooxidation converts Au38(pMBA)24 to Au76(pMBA)44, enhancing emission via accelerated inter&#8208;system crossing, prolonged triplet lifetime, and suppressed nonradiative decay. This strategy provides a robust pathway to develop highly emissive photostable luminophores.








Abstract
The long&#8208;standing issues of photobleaching and low photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region greatly hinder the luminophore's downstream applications. Herein we developed an ingenious method of continuous light illumination to achieve water&#8208;soluble gold nanoclusters with both ultra&#8208;high QY in NIR&#8208;II region (&#8764;14% in H2O, &#8764;60% in D2O, the highest QY among NIR&#8208;II emitting water&#8208;soluble nanoclusters with typical QY&lt;1%) and ultra&#8208;high photostability where emission remained completely unchanged under several hours&#8217; illumination. Photooxidation&#8208;induced transformation of Au38(pMBA)24 to Au76(pMBA)44 (pMBA&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid) has been demonstrated to be the mechanism of the emission enhancement. The accelerated inter&#8208;system crossing rate, extended lowest triplet lifetime, and suppressed nonradiative decay collectively contribute to the higher QY of Au76(pMBA)44. This photooxidation strategy opens a new pathway to the development of more highly emissive and photostable luminophores.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Compatible Polarity&#8208;switched Small Molecules Enable Auxiliary Charge Generation and Transport Pathways in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two small molecules, L8&#8208;CT and L8&#8208;2CT, were designed by gradually replacing the end group of L8&#8208;BO from an electron acceptor to electron donor. The introduction of L8&#8208;2CT significantly enhances the donor&#8211;acceptor molecular percolation at the interface, so that enabling auxiliary charge generation and transport pathways. The PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;2CT ternary device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 20.33%, with simultaneously enhanced photostability.








Abstract
The commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs) is limited by bottlenecks including relatively high voltage loss, insufficient donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial charge generation, and morphological instability.

&lt;p&gt;Two small molecules, L8-CT and L8-2CT, were designed by gradually replacing the end group of L8-BO from an electron acceptor to electron donor. The introduction of L8-2CT significantly enhances the donor&#8211;acceptor molecular percolation at the interface, so that enabling auxiliary charge generation and transport pathways. The PM6:L8-BO:L8-2CT ternary device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 20.33%, with simultaneously enhanced photostability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs) is limited by bottlenecks including relatively high voltage loss, insufficient donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial charge generation, and morphological instability. Traditional approaches of interfacial regulation usually struggle with unmatching energetic landscape and/or molecular compatibility. In this study, two small molecules, L8-CT and L8-2CT are designed and synthesized by end-group substitution of the star nonfullerene acceptor L8-BO, gradually switching it from electron acceptor to electron donor. Moreover, L8-2CT with full end-group substitution exhibits exceptional compatibility/miscibility with both donor (PM6) and acceptor (L8-BO) in the ternary blend. The tight molecular packing between L8-2CT and L8-BO also reduces exciton diffusion time by an order of magnitude compared to PM6:L8-BO. The introduction of L8-2CT significantly enhances the donor&#8211;acceptor molecular percolation at the interface so that enabling auxiliary charge generation and transport pathways, thereby boosting the interfacial charge generation efficiency and morphology stability. Therefore, the PM6:L8-BO:L8-2CT ternary device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 20.33%, with simultaneously enhanced photostability.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich MOF&#8208;Material&#8208;Derived Metal Dual&#8208;Atom Platforms for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a general strategy to construct asymmetric dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) using energetic MOFs as precursors. The explosive decomposition of Zn&#8208;based EMOFs yields porous N&#8208;doped carbon frameworks embedding atomically dispersed Zn&#9472;M (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Fe, Mn, etc.) dual sites. The Zn&#9472;Co DACs achieves 98.95% Faradaic efficiency for nitrate reduction, with in situ XAS/DFT revealing the key N3Zn&#9472;CoN2 configuration. 








Abstract
The rational design of asymmetrically coordinated dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) offers new opportunities to overcome intrinsic limitations in selective multi&#8208;electron electrochemical reactions. Here, we present a general synthetic strategy that exploits high&#8208;energy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (EMOFs, such as nitrogen&#8208;rich MOFs) as versatile precursors to construct a diverse library of atomically dispersed and structurally asymmetric DACs. By leveraging the exothermic decomposition and gas&#8208;releasing nature of Zn&#8208;based EMOFs such as Zn(C2H2N3)2 (1,2,3&#8208;triazolate, MET&#8208;6), we achieve the in situ formation of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks embedding various Zn&#9472;M (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Fe, Mn, Pd, Pt, Ni, Ru) dual&#8208;atom sites with tailored asymmetric coordination environments. This far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium route enables atomic dispersion while steering the formation of non&#8208;centrosymmetric metal sites that are otherwise challenging to access via conventional thermal treatments. Across the DACs library, the Zn&#9472;Co/NC member stands out for electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR), delivering a Faradaic efficiency of 98.95% toward NH3 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory calculations reveal that the asymmetric N3Zn&#9472;CoN2 configuration enhances electronic coupling between the two metal centers, optimizes *NOH adsorption, and lowers the activation barrier for key intermediates. This work establishes a broadly applicable route to asymmetric DACs and provides a platform for tailoring active&#8208;site configurations to diverse electrochemical transformations.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Near&#8208;Infrared Chiral TeSe Nanodrug Against Orthotopic Drug&#8208;Resistant Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This first brain&#8208;targeted near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chiral TeSe nanodrug was fabricated via self&#8208;assembly and apolipoprotein E&#8208;modification. D&#8208;TeSe showed enhanced cellular uptake, blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration, and tumor specificity compared to L&#8208;TeSe, benefiting from chirality recognition. 808&#160;nm irradiation elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of D&#8208;TeSe, selectively inducing apoptosis and oxidative death in orthotopic drug&#8208;resistant glioma, significantly improving survival. 








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains a formidable therapeutic challenge due to its high invasiveness, the highly restrictive blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), and frequent drug resistance, necessitating new therapeutic strategies. Here, we developed tellurium&#8208;selenium nanoparticles (TeSe NPs) with exceptional near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chiroptical properties and potent antitumor activity against drug&#8208;resistant glioma for the first time. Notably, the right&#8208;handed nanoparticles (D&#8208;TeSe NPs) exhibited higher cellular uptake than left&#8208;handed L&#8208;TeSe NPs through chirality&#8208;selective recognition by drug&#8208;resistant glioma cells. The Te and Se active centers in D&#8208;TeSe NPs selectively triggered severe oxidative stress in glioma cells, leading to redox imbalance, reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately causing 44.2% glioma cell death (versus 37.1% for L&#8208;TeSe NPs). When combined with 808&#160;nm right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light, D&#8208;TeSe NPs showed enhanced ROS generation, elevating therapeutic efficacy to 62.5% while maintaining negligible toxicity to normal cells. Furthermore, apolipoprotein E&#8208;functionalized D&#8208;TeSe NPs demonstrated improved BBB penetration and tumor&#8208;targeting capability, significantly extending the survival of mice with orthotopic drug&#8208;resistant glioma to 52 days (versus 21 days for PBS control). This study pioneers a NIR and brain&#8208;targeted chiral nanoplatform for precision therapy of orthotopic glioma, offering a chirality&#8208;driven paradigm against drug&#8208;resistant malignancies and other brain diseases.

The diversified kinetic resolutions of diaryl&#8208;substituted cyclobutenones through Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation has been achieved for the first time, affording a range of diaryl&#8208;substituted four&#8208;membered ring products, which facilitates the total synthesis of six representative natural products in a stereodivergent fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the catalysts play vital roles in determining the resolution modes.








Abstract
1,2&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dialkyl cyclobutanes (DA2CBs) are important scaffolds in numerous bioactive substances. However, the concise asymmetric synthesis of this type of compound remains a formidable challenge, especially in a stereodivergent manner. In this work, we report for the first time the diversified kinetic resolutions of diaryl&#8208;substituted cyclobutenones through Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH). The protocol affords a range of diaryl&#8208;substituted four&#8208;membered rings with structural and stereochemical diversity, which facilitates the total synthesis of six representative natural products in a stereodivergent fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies have been conducted to reveal the origin of the three kinetic resolution modes, and the catalysts are found to play vital roles in determining the reaction pathways, a phenomenon that has been scarcely observed in the field of ATH.

         <title>Choline Iodide&#8208;Mediated Sulfur Conversion and Zinc Plating/Stripping Chemistry in Aqueous Zn&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choline iodide (ChI), as an electrolyte additive, enables aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries to achieve low polarization and prolonged cycle life. Coupled with the catalytic effect of I&#8722; during charging, Ch+ not only accelerates the reaction kinetics of the discharge process by generating highly active intermediates, but also inhibits polyiodide shuttling through its adsorption on the zinc anode surface. 








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries are promising candidates for future energy storage due to their intrinsic safety, environmental friendliness, and low cost. However, their practical application is hindered by sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and rapid zinc anode degradation. Here, we introduce choline iodide (ChI) as a multifunctional electrolyte additive that enables bidirectional catalysis of sulfur conversion and simultaneous protection of the zinc anode. During discharge, Ch+ promotes the formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates, which rapidly combine with Zn2+ to form ZnS via a solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid pathway, accelerating reaction kinetics. During charge, iodine species catalyze the conversion of ZnS back to sulfur. Moreover, Ch+ adsorbs on the zinc anode, suppressing dendrite growth and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Importantly, Ch+ also inhibits polyiodide shuttling at high iodine concentrations, maximizing catalytic efficiency. Coupled with a CoNC solid&#8208;phase catalyst, the Zn&#8211;S cell achieves a record&#8208;low polarization of 0.26&#160;V at 0.1&#160;C, delivers 780&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C, and maintains 380&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 5500 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries are promising candidates for future energy storage due to their intrinsic safety, environmental friendliness, and low cost. However, their practical application is hindered by sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and rapid zinc anode degradation. Here, we introduce choline iodide (ChI) as a multifunctional electrolyte additive that enables bidirectional catalysis of sulfur conversion and simultaneous protection of the zinc anode. During discharge, Ch&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; promotes the formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates, which rapidly combine with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to form ZnS via a solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid pathway, accelerating reaction kinetics. During charge, iodine species catalyze the conversion of ZnS back to sulfur. Moreover, Ch&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; adsorbs on the zinc anode, suppressing dendrite growth and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Importantly, Ch&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; also inhibits polyiodide shuttling at high iodine concentrations, maximizing catalytic efficiency. Coupled with a CoNC solid-phase catalyst, the Zn&#8211;S cell achieves a record-low polarization of 0.26&#160;V at 0.1&#160;C, delivers 780&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#160;C, and maintains 380&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 5500 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Wastewater Nickel into Single&#8208;Site Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Peroxide Production with Industrial Level Current</title>

This study introduces a &#8220;waste&#8208;to&#8208;wealth&#8221; approach by converting hazardous nickel&#8208;laden waste into atomically precise single&#8208;site Ni&#8211;S4 catalysts via molecular engineering. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional industrial capacity, achieving &gt;95% Faradaic efficiency and high H2O2 yield rates (&gt;70&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), enabling sustainable applications in textile bleaching and wastewater remediation.








Abstract
The persistent environmental threat posed by nickel&#8208;laden industrial wastewater demands advanced strategies beyond conventional treatment&#8208;and&#8208;dispose methods. Here, we propose a coordination chemistry&#8208;guided approach to molecularly engineer nickel complexes from wastewater into single&#8208;site electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR). By precisely tailoring the ligand fields using sodium dimethyl dithiocarbamate (SDD), the derived SDD&#8208;Ni catalyst exhibits&#160;&gt;95% Faradaic efficiency for H2O2 synthesis across industrial&#8208;level current densities (200&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in flow&#8208;cell. Notably, at 781&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the catalyst delivers a record H2O2 productivity of 70.75&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Real&#8208;wastewater&#8208;derived SDD&#8208;Ni catalysts showed similar performance and sustained &gt;450&#160;h stability in continuous flow&#8208;cell operation, underscoring their practical feasibility. Mechanistic studies reveal that the square&#8208;planar Ni&#8211;S4 coordination structure enables end&#8208;on O2 adsorption and optimal *OOH intermediates binding, ensuring exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity. This work provides a molecular&#8208;level solution for decentralized H2O2 production by repurposing hazardous Ni wastes into high&#8208;value electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Directed Assembly of Robust Coordination Cages: Overcoming Kinetic Inertness and Conformational Mismatch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate (POM) templates unlock the selective self&#8208;assembly of robust coordination cages from inert metal centers and conformationally mismatched ligands. This strategy modulates both thermodynamic and kinetic pathways, affording stable hosts capable of guest binding under acidic and basic aqueous conditions.








Abstract
The selective construction of kinetically robust coordination cages by self&#8208;assembly remains a significant challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly strategy enabling the selective assembly of robust Pt6L4 cages under thermodynamic or kinetic control, which is inaccessible via untemplated methods. For a planar ligand (L1) with a dihedral angle (&#952; = 0&#176;), the POM template promotes the formation of a thermodynamically favored Pt6(L1)4 analog. Remarkably, for a twisted and flexible ligand (L2) with a nonideal dihedral angle (&#952; &#8776; 36&#176;), which typically favors the thermodynamically preferred M12L8 cages, the POM template induces the formation of the kinetically trapped M6L4 cages even when using inert Pt(II) precursors. In the absence of POMs, such structures cannot form due to conformational mismatch and the kinetic inertness of metal&#8208;ligand coordination. The resulting Pt(II)&#8208;based cages are highly stable and remain intact as discrete, template&#8208;free hosts after POM removal, capable of encapsulating diverse guests in both acidic and basic aqueous media. This work highlights the unique templating role of POMs in accessing both thermodynamic and kinetic architectures, offering new opportunities for designing robust cages for drug delivery, sensing, and catalysis under harsh conditions.

         <title>Ph2SCCO: A New Versatile CCO&#8208;Fragment Transfer Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, isolation, and full characterization of the unprecedented heterocumulene Ph2SCCO is presented. Starting from simple precursors, Ph2SCCO provides direct access to the valuable class of (bicyclic) &#945;&#8208;cyclopropylcarbonyl compounds. It has emerged from our reactivity studies as an excellent reagent for the CCO fragment transfer in organic synthesis.








Abstract
ketenylidene (C2O) is an electronically intriguing small molecule with significant potential as a C2 synthon in organic synthesis. However, its high reactivity has thus far precluded practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new reagent, the heterocumulene Ph2S&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;O (1), a well&#8208;defined C2O equivalent that accurately replicates the chemical reactivity profile of C2O in a controlled manner. 1 uniquely integrates ketene&#8208;like and classical carbene reactivity. In the presence of Br&#248;nsted acids, 1 undergoes initial 1,2&#8208;addition to form a sulfur ylide intermediate, which can be exploited for subsequent reactions including cyclopropanation, epoxidation, or X&#8211;H addition. The CCO fragment transfer strategy, starting from simple precursors, enables efficient access to &#945;&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208; as well as &#945;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;carbonyl derivatives and structurally complex bicyclic cyclopropanes.

         <title>Binding Modes Tuning Nitrite Reduction Reactivity at Iron(III) Centers Triggered by Hydrogen Atom, Hydride, and Proton Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary&#8208;sphere effects control the nitrite binding mode (&#954;1&#8211;O or &#954;1&#8211;N) in an Fe(III) center, leading to strikingly different reduction pathways. The &#954;1&#8211;O isomer undergoes unprecedented Fe(III)&#8208;mediated hydrogen&#8208;atom and hydride transfer in addition to protonation, whereas the &#954;1&#8211;N isomer reacts exclusively via protonation. These results uncover new mechanistic possibilities for Fe&#8208;mediated nitrite reduction.








Abstract
To elucidate the mechanisms of iron&#8208;mediated nitrite reduction, we synthesized and fully characterized Fe(III)&#8208;NO2&#8722; complexes featuring distinct &#954;1&#8211;O (nitrito) and &#954;1&#8211;N (nitro) binding modes, supported by a tris(benzenethiolato)phosphine ligand derivative. Interconversion between these two linkage isomers is modulated by a Na+ cation in the secondary coordination sphere. These binding motifs direct divergent nitrite reduction pathways. For the &#954;1&#8211;O isomer, reduction is initiated by hydrogen atom or hydride transfer to yield an {FeNO}7 species, whereas protonation results in formation of an {FeNO}6 complex. Hydrogen atom transfer and protonation are accompanied by hydroxyl radical generation, while hydride transfer produces hydroxide. In contrast, the &#954;1&#8211;N isomer undergoes nitrite reduction exclusively via protonation. Detailed computational studies afford a mechanistic rationale for how nitrite binding modes govern distinct nitrite reduction trajectories.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atomic Ni&#8208;N4 Biofuel Cell for Mimicking Intramolecular Electron&#8208;Harnessing of Laccase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;C atomic unit installed in PAN&#8208;derived N&#8208;carbon electrode accelerates anodic oxidation of BPA in a BFC with an increased power density with increasing BPA concentration. A comparison of electrooxidation of BPA by LAC@ZIF&#8208;8 and Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC in BFCs suggests how a Ni&#8211;N4 atomic sites exhibit intramolecular electron harnessing like laccase enzyme, even without an external mediator such as ABTS and offers a concentration&#8208;dependent enhanced power density.








Abstract
Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC, consisting of an atomic Ni&#8211;N4&#160;site, mimics the intramolecular electron&#8208;harnessing of natural laccase (LAC) confined in a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (LAC@ZIF&#8208;8) for anodic electrooxidation of bisphenol&#8208;A (BPA). We have introduced a facile &#960;&#8208;conjugated unit of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;resorcinol&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped conjugated &#8208;C&#8801;N. The atomically dispersed Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom in Ni&#8211;N4&#8208; PAN&#8211;NC exhibits high activity for the paired electrolysis of ORR and the electrooxidation of BPA with an enhanced current density. The single Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC electrode effectively withdraws the electrons from electrooxidizing BPA due to a built&#8208;in electric field via incorporation of Ni&#8211;N4. The paired electrolysis of Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC biofuel cells is determined by LSV, EIS, and power&#8208;polarization curve&#160;for anodic electrooxidation of BPA. Machine learning molecular dynamics (ML&#8208;MD) simulation depicts non&#8208;covalent interaction (hydrogen bonding) between the O&#8208;hydroxyl of BPA and the N of the Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC, suggesting&#160;preferential adsorption&#160;on&#160;the Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC surface via weak van der Waals interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between the aromatic rings of BPA and the conjugated PAN&#8208;NC. An increased power density with increased concentration of BPA in the absence of ABTS suggests a DET mechanism of BPA electrooxidation on Ni&#8211;N4, unlike a MET in the presence of ABTS when using LAC@ZIF&#8208;8. Thus, single atomic&#160;Ni&#160;&#8722;&#160;N4&#160;opens avenues with&#160;a DET mechanism.

         <title>Interfacially Mineralized Magnetic Colloidal Gel with Microenvironment&#8208;Triggered Disassembly for Interventional Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable, acid&#8208;responsive mineralized magnetic colloidal gel is developed via interfacial mineralization, enabling intelligent gel&#8208;network disassembly in acidic tumor microenvironments. This design significantly improves controlled drug release and magnetothermal&#8208;assisted interventional therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential for minimally invasive precision medicine.








Abstract
Colloidal gels (CGs) are attractive carriers for functional nanoparticles (NPs) in biomedical applications. However, the current interfacial design of CG networks often lacks efficient disassembly mechanisms, resulting in limited intelligent responsiveness, constraining their advancements in precision medicine. Herein, we developed an interfacial mineralization strategy to fabricate a mineralized magnetic colloidal gel (MMG) tailored for disassembling in the acidic tumor microenvironment. MMG comprises electrostatically attracted mineralized magnetic core&#8208;shell Fe3O4@calcium phosphate (CaP) NPs and gelatin NPs, exhibiting outstanding injectability and magnetic&#8208;heating effect, and presenting potential for minimally invasive interventional therapy of tumors. Benefiting from the dissolution of the interfacial CaP layer in an acidic microenvironment, the storage modulus of MMG decreased from 1400 to 400&#160;Pa after 48&#160;h, while the drug&#8208;release efficiency increased from &#8764;35% to &#8764;70%. In comparison, the unmineralized magnetic CG showed few changes in mechanical properties and exhibited a low drug&#8208;release efficiency of &#8764;20%. The acid&#8208;triggered disassembly of MMG's network confirmed the feasibility of precision chemotherapy. Additionally, MMG&#8208;mediated magnetic hyperthermia and chemotherapy significantly improved a synergistic therapeutic effect in tumor&#8208;bearing mice and ultrasound&#8208;guided interventional hepatic tumor rabbits. These findings demonstrate that the interfacial mineralization strategy provides an innovative approach to imparting CG's network with microenvironment&#8208;responsive controllable disassembly behavior.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controlled Protein Corona&#8208;Armored DNA Nanomachine for Multitype Biomarker Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV&#8208;responsive protein corona (PC)&#8208;armored DNA nanomachine was developed for multitype biomarker imaging in living cells. The PC shell offers nuclease resistance, avoids undesirable PC formation during delivery, enhances tumor cell targeting, and promotes lysosomal escape. Subsequent light activation ensures controlled cytoplasmic operation, while RNase H&#8208;driven walking, which is free from sequence limitations, establishes a versatile platform for intracellular multitype biomarker detection. 








Abstract
DNA nanomachines have significant potential for biosensing because of their high programmability, signal amplification ability, and excellent biocompatibility. However, under physiological conditions, their performance is often hindered by insufficient endogenous driving forces, nuclease degradation, and lysosomal entrapment. In this study, we develop a protein corona (PC)&#8208;armored DNA nanomachine with spatiotemporal control for multiple intracellular biomarker imaging. By pre&#8208;assembling a UV&#8208;responsive PC shell, the DNA nanomachine forms a physical barrier that protects nucleic acids from nucleases, reduces uncontrollable PC formation during unimpaired operation, and enhances cellular uptake via PC&#8208;mediated targeting. After internalization, the retained PC promotes lysosomal escape, followed by light&#8208;triggered disassembly for precise cytoplasmic operation of the nanomachine. Notably, our nanomachine employs RNA as a track and the widely expressed intracellular RNase H enzyme as the driving force, circumventing sequence limitations and establishing a general operational platform. Through this modulation, we achieve in situ imaging of microRNA in U87 human glioblastoma cells and ATP in A549 lung carcinoma cells, pioneering a PC&#8208;enabled paradigm for DNA nanomachines and building a versatile intracellular diagnostic platform for precision medicine.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Birth&#8208;Acceptor: Easily&#8208;Synthesized Mixture for Easily&#8208;Fabricated Quaternary Organic Solar Cells with Beyond 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a simple method to fabricate high&#8208;performance quaternary organic solar cells (QOSCs) by using &#8220;multiple&#8208;birth&#8208;acceptor&#8221; (MBA) mixtures synthesized by reacting one D middle segment with two A terminal units. Without separation, these MBAs could be used directly as electron acceptors, and the performance of PM6: MBA&#8208;based QOSCs are significantly superior to that of binary/ternary devices. The PM6:MBA13 quaternary device achieves a record PCE of 20.10%.








Abstract
Ternary strategy has been proved very effective to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, quaternary OSCs (QOSCs), containing four components in the active layer, have been rarely reported due to the complexity of material synthesis and optimization of active layer composition. Here, we developed a simple method to fabricate high&#8208;performance QOSCs by using &#8220;multiple&#8208;birth&#8208;acceptor&#8221; (MBA), a mixture of three molecules synthesized simultaneously. These A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type MBAs (MBA31, MBA11, MBA13, and MBA19) were synthesized by reacting one DA'D&#8208;type central segment (BTP&#8208;2CHO) with two A terminal units (&#947;&#8208;IC&#8208;Cl and IC&#8208;2Cl) with different feed ratios (&#947;&#8208;IC&#8208;Cl: IC&#8208;2Cl&#160;=&#160;3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 1:9). Without the need to isolate individual components, these MBAs can be utilized directly as electron acceptor to fabricate QOSCs. Compared with binary and ternary devices, QOSCs based on PM6: MBAs exhibit dramatically improved PCEs. Further device optimization, by using 2PACz as hole transport layer and DIB as an additive, PM6:MBA13&#8208;based device achieves a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCE of 20.10%, among the highest values reported for QOSCs to date. Obviously, this method simplifies the material synthesis and device fabrication process for QOSCs. This study provides a feasible method to synthesize MBAs and subsequently fabricate high&#8208;performance QOSCs, and thereby opens up a new venue for the further optimization of OSCs.

         <title>Simultaneous Degradation&#8208;Depolymerization of Bioderived Comb Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable comb copolymer, P(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;PhthMA&#8208;co&#8208;HEMA)&#8208;graft&#8208;PLA, is synthesized by combining reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) and ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP). Thermally triggered backbone depolymerization and PLA side chain degradation enable simultaneous deconstruction into methyl methacrylate and poly(lactic acid) byproducts. 








Abstract
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is the most widely explored biodegradable alternative for polystyrene; however, its low toughness and glass transition temperature may limit its wider adoption as a sustainable replacement. To improve its material and thermal properties, PLA can be chemically or physically combined with other polymers, like poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), though the incorporation of vinyl&#8208;based polymer components complicates chemical recycling and reduces the sustainability of the material. In this study, we synthesized polymethacrylate&#8208;PLA comb copolymers designed to be thermally deconstructed. Our design strategically extends current polymer deconstruction methodologies to more complex macromolecular systems. Thermally labile units within the polymethacrylate backbone permitted depolymerization that was concurrent with PLA side chain degradation during heating. This dual degradation&#8208;depolymerization process enhances the overall sustainability of lactide/vinyl&#8208;based copolymers and demonstrates the synergistic potential of integrating multiple deconstruction pathways into a single system. This report elaborates on the design of advanced, degradable copolymers, contributing to the further development of sustainable polymer materials.

         <title>Methanol Upcycling Toward Glycolaldehyde Synthesis Enabled by New High&#8208;Performance Photoredox Route</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time identify a new high&#8208;performance selective photoredox route to glycolaldehyde (GA) synthesis via dehydrogenation C&#9472;C coupling of methanol paired with H2 production over the Ni&#8208;decorated ZnIn2S4 (Ni/ZIS) catalyst. The optimal apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 22% for GA production is achieved at &#955; = 360&#160;nm, reaching the highest literature value in the field of photocatalytic methanol conversion. 








Abstract
Glycolaldehyde (GA) possesses great potential to serve as the feedstock for the C2&#8208;based chemical industry and plays a vital role in the fabrication of pharmaceuticals and various chemicals. However, conventional GA synthesis methods suffer from harsh reaction conditions, low selectivity, and high purification costs. Herein, we for the first time demonstrate a new photoredox&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;performance route toward dehydrogenative C&#9472;C coupling of methanol into GA paired with H2 generation over Ni&#8208;decorated ZnIn2S4, presenting an essentially untapped photocatalytic tactic for selective GA synthesis. Specifically, GA is formed with the production rate of 30.0 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and the selectivity of 94% and the optimal apparent quantum yield at &#955; = 360&#160;nm reaches 22%, the highest value reported to date for selective photocatalytic methanol conversion to GA. Mechanistic studies reveal that the decoration of Ni facilitates interfacial charge separation and transfer and promotes the formation of key radical intermediates of &#8226;CH2OH and &#8226;OCH3 for GA production. This work offers a conceptually new photocatalytic approach for the efficient and sustainable production of GA and enriches the content of methanol upcycling chemistry.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Regulated Bond Polarizability in Layered Cuprates for Promoted Surface Reconstruction Toward C2+ Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare&#8208;earth modulation strategy was reported to regulate the bond polarizability in layered cuprates to promote surface reconstruction toward high&#8208;efficiency C2+ electrosynthesis. The optimized Pr2CuO4 achieves &#8764;80% C2+ Faradaic efficiency and 376.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 partial current density, which could be attributed to the reconstruction&#8208;redirected dual active sites of strained Cu nanoparticles and Cu/Pr2CuO4 interface due to largest bond polarizability. 








Abstract
Copper (Cu) oxides hold great potential for electrochemical synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products from CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but a clear picture correlating chemical bond characteristics in pristine Cu oxides with inevitable reconstruction during CO2RR remains underexplored. Herein, we report our findings in the regulation of Cu&#9472;O bond polarizability in layered cuprates (Ln2CuO4, Ln&#160;=&#160;La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) by an A&#8208;site rare&#8208;earth modulation strategy, to promote surface reconstruction toward high&#8208;efficiency C2+ electrosynthesis. In particular, the optimized Pr2CuO4 bulk material with largest bond polarizability exhibits the best performance, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;80% for C2+ products and a C2+ partial current density of 376.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.7&#160;V versus RHE as well as maintaining robust durability at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a membrane electrode assembly. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that larger Cu&#9472;O bond polarizability, characterized as increased bond length and decreased valence state, accelerates the Cu&#8208;O bond breaking that can lead to the formation of ultrasmall, highly dispersed, and strained Cu nanoparticles. These reconstructed metallic Cu particles, together with Cu/Pr2CuO4 interface, function as dual active sites to improve *CO coverage and lower the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling, resulting in the enhanced C2+ selectivity.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Phosphorus Anodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries via Tailored Reversible Na/Polyphosphide Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored and reversible Na2P16&#8596; Na3P reaction pathway is enabled by anchoring Na2P16 onto carbon cloth (CC) via P&#9472;O&#9472;C bonds and optmizing the electrolyte. These strategies overcome the kinetic and structural limitations of red phosphorus, yielding a composite anode with high areal capacity and long cycling stability, advancing the design of high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
To surmount the inherent limitations and fully harness the remarkable ultra&#8208;high specific capacity (2,596&#160;mAh g&#8722;1) of phosphorus (P) anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), we unveil an alternative fast and reversible electrochemical pathway based on Na2P16&#8596;Na3P, which transcends the barriers posed by sluggish reaction kinetics in solid&#8208;state red P. It entails the immobilization of dissolved sodium polyphosphide (Na2P16) onto carbon cloth (CC) matrices via robust C&#9472;O&#9472;P bonding (Na2P16@CC), and the intrinsic superior malleability of Na2P16 effectively mitigates the issue of electrode pulverization caused by volumetric changes of red P during (de)sodiation. Additionally, the profound chemical adsorption of surface oxygen&#8208;doped CC toward phosphorus species and the utilization of weakly solvating cyclic carbonate solvents synergistically inhibit the vexing dissolution of high&#8208;order polyphosphides in the electrolyte. By capitalizing on the advances of the novel reaction mechanism, the Na2P16@CC composite anode material achieves improved sodium storage performance with a high initial reversible capacity of 1.75&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a capacity retention of 81% over 600 cycles. This work opens an avenue toward the rational design of P&#8208;based anodes for high&#8208;energy SIBs.

         <title>Fluorinated Lead&#8208;Chelating Molecules Boost Performance, Stability, and Safety of Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Carbon&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional fluorinated lead&#8208;chelating molecule&#8208;based interfacial modifier enables simultaneous surface defect passivation, interfacial band alignment, and Pb2+ sequestration in hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based planar&#8208;structured perovskite solar cells, leading to enhanced efficiency (20.78%), long&#8208;term stability (&gt;2000&#160;h), and improved environmental safety.








Abstract
Hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (HTL&#8208;free C&#8208;PSCs) hold promise for low&#8208;cost, stable photovoltaics but suffer from poor interfacial charge extraction, inferior defect passivation, and unresolved environmental risk. Here, we reported a multifunctional interfacial engineering strategy using fluorinated lead&#8208;chelating (FLC) molecules containing sulfonate groups, fluoride atoms, and metal ions. Sulfonate groups coordinated with undercoordinated Pb2+ ions, fluoride atoms formed hydrogen bonds with organic cations, and K+ ions stabilized halide anions, synergistically passivating deep&#8208;level defects and enhancing thermal stability. FLC modification also reduced the perovskite work function (from &#8722;4.14 to &#8722;4.39 eV), improving energy level alignment and facilitating hole extraction at the perovskite/carbon interface. As a result, the optimized devices achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.7%, among the highest for fully solution&#8208;processed planar HTL&#8208;free C&#8208;PSCs. Unencapsulated devices retained over 93% of initial efficiency after 2000 h in ambient air or after 500 h at 60&#160;&#176;C. Importantly, strong FLC&#8208;Pb2+ chelation significantly reduced lead leakage from severely damaged devices under acidic aqueous environment (334.7 to 53.7&#160;mg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1), achieving &#8764;84% sequestration efficiency. This work presents a unified strategy to enhance efficiency, stability, and environmental safety of simplified perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Low&#8208;Spin WIII&#8208;Triggered Triplet Spin&#8208;Polarized Electron Delocalization of Tungsten Oxide for Photocatalytic Reduction of Uranium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
WO3 with confined oxygen vacancies to (110) facets is synthesized, switching WIII to low&#8208;spin state and boosting spin polarization through triplet&#8208;state generation, which exhibits exceptional U(VI) photoreduction under solar light. 








Abstract
Solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis is a green and efficient technology to immobilize high&#8208;toxic and radioactive uranium (U). However, a great challenge is to develop photocatalysts with simultaneous elevated conduction band (CB) potential and rapid charge carrier separation rate. Herein, spin&#8208;state engineering in d0 WO3 through (110) facet&#8208;confined oxygen vacancies (OVs) is proposed. Anchoring OVs at the symmetry&#8208;broken (110) facets induces low&#8208;spin WIII (d3) generation, delocalizing CB electrons and elevating CB by &#8722;0.86&#160;V versus NHE due to higher electron occupancy in &#960; antibonding orbitals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveal that triplet (T)&#8208;dominated spin&#8208;polarized electron delocalization significantly disrupts the charge carrier recombination pathway. Experiments and theoretical calculations confirm the enhanced interfacial charge transfer via O bridging between W 5d and U 5f provides a W 5d &#8594; U 5f directional electron transfer channel. Thus, the developed (110)&#8208;WO2.35 achieves high photocatalytic activity for U(VI) removal from water under simulated solar light, with a reduction efficiency of 98.0% (C0 = 10&#160;mg L&#8722;1) and a reaction rate constant (k1) of 0.022 min&#8722;1, which is 4.1 times higher than the conventional WO3. This work pioneers atomic&#8208;scale spin&#8208;orbital synergy in d0 photocatalysis, offering a novel strategy for radionuclide remediation.

         <title>In Situ Tandem Synthesis of Charged Boron&#8208;Oxo Clusters into Highly Ordered Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision in tandem: In situ synthesis&#8208;guided assembly of charged boron&#8208;oxo clusters into exceptionally highly&#8208;ordered architectures enables the accommodation of diverse incoming ligands and encapsulation of various guest anions, thereby facilitating precise modulation of third&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties.








Abstract
The controlled assembly of multiple cationic and anionic clusters into well&#8208;defined architectures remains one of the major challenges in chemistry. In this work, a series of charged boron&#8208;oxo cluster&#8208;based structures, named BOC&#8208;n (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;8) have been successfully synthesized using an in situ tandem strategy. Through the comprehensive combination of the dynamic covalent chemistry and coordination interactions, porphyrin&#8208;like cationic metal boron&#8208;oxo clusters ([Cu(II)B8O8Qi8]2+ in BOC&#8208;1 and [Cu(II)2B10O12(Qi)8]2+ in BOC&#8208;2 to 8; Qi&#160;=&#160;quinoline) have been developed. These cationic clusters further exhibit versatile dynamic properties and maintain directional control through metrically matched &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions during assembly, enabling the formation of highly ordered architectures with diverse incoming ligands and various guest anions. Notably, BOC&#8208;2 can reversibly respond to guest molecules through electrostatic interaction to facilitate anion exchange. Furthermore, the modulation of axial ligands and guest anions influence their optical third&#8208;order nonlinear properties.

         <title>Asymmetric Electrosorption in a Bio&#8208;Inspired Reactor Enables Energy Efficient Ocean Carbon Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coral&#8208;inspired capacitive decarbonization (CDC) reactor enables direct ocean carbon removal by coupling selective electrodes with an asymmetric electrosorption strategy. Dissolved inorganic carbon is mineralized into stable CaCO3 with an ultralow intrinsic energy input (2.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 CO2) and demonstrated continuous operation over 100&#160;h without electrode fouling.








Abstract
Ocean carbon removal represents a promising pathway for mitigating residual anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), yet existing methods are constrained by high energy demands and potential ecological risks. Here, inspired by the natural calcification process of corals, we present a bio&#8208;inspired capacitive decarbonization (CDC) reactor that sequesters dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from seawater as CaCO3 using only seawater&#8208;derived Ca2+ and renewable electricity. The CDC system integrates a Ca2+&#8208;selective electrode with a weak electric field to regulate ion transport and disrupt the hydration shell of Ca2+, enhancing its reaction with CO32&#8722;. To address the limited concentration of CO32&#8722; relative to Ca2+ in seawater, we introduce an asymmetric electrosorption strategy to preferentially enrich CO32&#8722; at the electrode interface, achieving a DIC conversion rate of up to 34% with an ultralow intrinsic electrochemical energy input of 2.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 CO2 for the CDC reactor. The reactor exhibits stable continuous operation for over 100&#160;h without fouling, enabled by spatially decoupled CaCO3 precipitation. To mitigate the reduction in seawater alkalinity, we introduce a mineral&#8208;assisted re&#8208;alkalinization step that effectively restores pH and supports continued CO2 absorption. A global integrated analysis model shows the CDC technology could remove up to 11&#8211;438 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050&#8211;2100. This work demonstrates a scalable and low&#8208;energy solution for durable ocean carbon removal.

         <title>A Synergistic Cu/Ca Dual&#8208;Doping Strategy for High&#8208;Stability and Fast&#8208;Charging O3&#8208;Type Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu2+/Ca2+ doped&#160;O3&#8208;type oxide Na0.98Ca0.01Ni0.35Cu0.05Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 (CuCa&#8211;NFM) was designed as a cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Cu2+ facilitates Na+ diffusion and suppresses Na+/vacancy ordering, whereas Ca2+ pillars restrain phase transition. The CuCa&#8208;NFM cathode displays a high&#8208;rate capacity of 86.02 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C with 80.64% retention after 300 cycles.








Abstract
The O3&#8208;type layered oxide cathodes are highly promising for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high specific capacity. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor interlayer stability caused by narrow layer spacing and volumetric stress accumulation limit their fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;cycle performance. Herein, targeted interlayer regulation is conducted on O3&#8208;type layered oxide by introducing Cu2+ and Ca2+ into the transition metal (TM) and alkali metal (AM) layers, respectively. The introduction of Cu2+ effectively enlarges sodium&#8208;ion transport channels, mitigates oxygen arrangement around TM octahedra, and suppresses Na+/vacancy ordering, which is evidenced by scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Additionally, Ca2+ in the AM layer effectively mitigates volume variation during electrochemical reactions and preserves structural integrity, as confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, resulting in lower lattice stress and mitigated phase evolution. The result is an exceptionally high&#8208;rate capability of 86.02&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C (2.4&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), accompanied by a prolonged lifetime with 80.64% retention after 300 cycles. This work demonstrates synergistic regulation of ion transport and lattice stability, providing new insights for cathode design.

         <dc:description>

Abstract
A chiral sulfide&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H sulfenylation reaction for the efficient synthesis of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing aza&#8208;[5]helicenes has been developed for the first time. The chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diamine (BINAM)&#8208;derived sulfide, bearing a tert&#8208;butyl group, was identified as the optimal catalyst. The transformation proceeds via a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process, attributed to the low rotational energy barrier of the indole substrates. This approach features simple and mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and broad substrate scope (41 examples). A diverse range of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing aza&#8208;[5]helicenes were obtained in high to excellent yields with high to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield and 97% ee). Furthermore, this catalytic system demonstrates applicability for the modification of drug molecules and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that &#960;&#8943;&#960; and C&#9472;H&#8943;&#960; interactions play a critical role in determining the observed enantioselectivity.

         <title>Discriminative Peroxymonosulfate Activation on Iron Carbides for Redox&#8208;Neutral Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the covalent Fe&#9472;C bonds featured with moderate electron delocalization regulates peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation pathway and preserves the Fe valence state, affecting the contribution of radical pathway and electron&#8208;connection between PMS and phenol, thereby achieving high catalytic activity with exceptional stability. This study introduces a new paradigm for Fenton&#8208;like processes in wastewater treatment.








Abstract
In conventional redox cycle&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like processes, the imbalanced rates between the reductive activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and the subsequent catalyst recovery by PMS oxidation often leads to the catalyst deactivation, posing a major challenge to achieving long&#8208;term stability. Herein, we report a discriminative, redox&#8208;neutral PMS activation pathway enabled by a core&#8211;shell Fe3C@C catalyst, which eliminates performance loss caused by such redox imbalance. Covalent Fe&#9472;C bonds within Fe3C@C suppress complete electron transfer for PMS oxidation or reduction, preventing the radical&#8208;forming pathways. Instead, PMS is activated through electronic induction, discriminatively cleaving the peroxyl O&#9472;O bond to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) as the sole reactive oxygen species (ROS) without significant changes in the Fe valence state, thereby greatly enhancing catalyst durability. Beyond PMS activation, the highly conductive Fe3C@C network serves as an efficient electron relay, promoting pollutant degradation with 1O2 by facilitating electron&#8208;exchange between PMS and pollutant. By integrating redox&#8208;neutral PMS activation with electron&#8208;connection driven pollutant oxidation, Fe3C@C achieves both high reactivity and exceptional long&#8208;term stability, overcoming the traditional trade&#8208;off between activity and durability. This work introduces a new paradigm in Fenton&#8208;like catalysis, demonstrating how covalent coordination engineering can unlock selective, nonradical pathways for sustainable and robust water treatment.

         <title>Development and Application of Radical&#8208;Mediated Stereochemical Epimerization in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;mediated stereochemical epimerization enables direct stereochemical editing at inert C&#9472;H sites and late&#8208;stage modifications of complex molecules. By controlling hydrogen atom transfer through abstraction and donation, and bond cleavage and reformation, researchers have achieved site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective isomerization at challenging positions, including unactivated tertiary carbons and sterically hindered quaternary carbon stereocenters. This strategy facilitates the total synthesis of natural products.









Abstract
Precise control over stereochemistry (enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity) is essential in the long&#8208;step synthetic protocol of complex molecules bearing multiple stereocenters, such as natural products and pharmaceuticals. Stereospecificity is the ideal goal for the formation of the first and subsequent chiral centers in the specific chemical environment through either an exo&#8208; or endo&#8208;genous molecule&#8211;molecule interaction. In this context, epimerization and isomerization offer valuable supplemental strategies for modifying preexisting stereocenters, thereby enhancing synthetic efficiency, enabling molecular diversification, and facilitating late&#8208;stage modification. Recent advances in radical&#8208;mediated epimerization have further enabled site&#8208;specific inversion of stereocenters, allowing late&#8208;stage access to diverse stereoisomers from a common intermediate. This minireview highlights emerging approaches in radical&#8208;based stereochemical epimerization and discusses their potential applications in the synthesis of complex molecules, emphasizing their role as a complementary strategy to previously established epimerization tactics. Also covered are recent developments in the epimerization of quaternary carbon stereocenters, an underexplored yet promising area that offers new opportunities for innovation in synthetic design.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Prediction of Ground&#8208; and Excited&#8208;State Redox Potentials in Iridium(III) Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven framework integrating density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) predicts ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state redox potentials of Ir(III) photocatalysts. Unified models enable interpretable structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) analysis and efficient virtual screening, supporting rational molecular design for advanced photoredox catalysis.

This study introduces a data&#8208;driven framework that combines DFT calculations with machine learning to facilitate accurate and scalable predictions of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state redox potentials for iridium(III) photocatalysts. We first constructed independent models to identify key geometric and electronic descriptors governing redox behavior. Shapley additive explanations&#8208;based analyses revealed clear structure&#8211;activity relationships, offering mechanistic insights and rational guidance for tuning redox potentials. Based on these insights, we developed unified multi&#8208;output models&#8212;Model G for ground&#8208;state and Model E for excited&#8208;state redox potentials&#8212;to enable rapid, cost&#8208;effective, and high&#8208;throughput predictions. By modeling oxidation and reduction processes within a shared descriptor space, we can reduce computational overhead while maintaining high predictive accuracy. To assess cross&#8208;metal generalizability, residual transfer learning was applied to osmium (Os) photocatalysts. Using feature&#8208;similar complexes, the resulting transfer models (G&#8208;T, E&#8208;T) achieved performance comparable to Os&#8208;only baselines, demonstrating efficient few&#8208;shot cross&#8208;metal transfer. Collectively, this study establishes an interpretable and transferable machine&#8208;learning framework for photocatalyst discovery. This framework provides a foundation for large&#8208;scale screening and rational design across diverse transition&#8208;metal platforms, accelerating advancements in photoredox catalysis, solar fuel production, and broader sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis on a Diiron Platform of Stable Ferrabenzenes with Promising Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot reaction on a diiron platform yields the first isolable series of ferrabenzene compounds. X&#8208;ray, NMR, and DFT studies confirm their aromatic character. Selected derivatives display favorable physicochemical prerequisites for biological applications and exhibit a promising in vitro cytotoxicity profile, linked to disruption of mitochondrial activity.








Abstract
Despite extensive research on metallabenzenes, ferrabenzenes have remained elusive, with only a single example reported to date, discovered accidentally. In this work, we present a reproducible, room&#8208;temperature reaction on a diiron bis&#8208;cyclopentadienyl platform, providing access to a class of four substituted ferrabenzenes (5a&#8208;c), stabilized by &#951;6&#8208;coordination to a second iron fragment. This synthesis involves a one&#8208;pot double C&#9472;C coupling of iminium, carbene (from a diazo compound), and carbon monoxide moieties, yielding ferra&#8208;cyclohexadienone derivatives (4a&#8208;c), followed by O&#8208;alkylation with alkyl triflates. Experimental and computational studies enabled the proposal of a plausible reaction mechanism. Combined X&#8208;ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and computational data support the aromatic character of the ferrabenzene ring in compounds 5a&#8208;c and, to a lesser extent, in their precursors 4a&#8208;c. Complexes 4a&#8208;c and 5a&#8208;c were further characterized by IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and IR spectroelectrochemistry. A selection of ferrabenzenes (5a, 5b, 5aEt) revealed physicochemical properties suitable for biological applications, including permanent air stability, adequate aqueous solubility and stability, and balanced hydrophilic/lipophilic profile. These compounds exhibited potent cytotoxicity in vitro against three cancer cell lines, with 5aEt standing out for its pronounced activity, attributed to disruption of cell redox homeostasis, and marked selectivity compared to two noncancerous cell lines.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Dual Synergistic Interfacial Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual synergistic interfacial passivation strategy using a tetrathiol&#8208;based molecule, pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) to enhance the ZnO/perovskite interface for application in inverted perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;QLEDs). By incorporating PETMP, Pe&#8208;QLEDs achieved a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.35%, accompanied by significantly enhanced device stability.








Abstract
Inverted perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;QLEDs) hold significant promise for next&#8208;generation displays due to their compatibility with n&#8208;type thin&#8208;film transistor&#8208;driven active&#8208;matrix panels, a critical advantage for industrial integration. However, interfacial reactions between the ZnO electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite quantum dots (Pe&#8208;QDs) induce severe degradation and fluorescence quenching, undermining device efficiency and operational stability. To resolve this, we introduce a dual synergistic interfacial passivation strategy employing pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) as a multifunctional buffer layer. The PETMP layer addresses interfacial incompatibility through two synergistic mechanisms: (I) Thiol groups in PETMP form robust S&#9472;Zn bonds with the ZnO ETL, passivating surface oxygen vacancies, improving film morphology, and reducing the electron injection barrier. (II) Concurrently, these thiols coordinate with undercoordinated Pb ions on the Pe&#8208;QD surface, enhancing luminescence efficiency and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. This dual synergistic passivation strategy yields inverted green Pe&#8208;QLEDs with a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.35%, doubling the performance of conventional devices using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) buffers (EQE&#160;=&#160;12.61%). Additionally, the optimized interface resulting from this strategy significantly enhances the operational stability of the devices. This work establishes PETMP&#8208;based passivation as a transformative approach for high&#8208;performance inverted Pe&#8208;QLEDs and other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Modeling Midbrain and Brainstem Neuromelanins to Characterize Metal Binding and Associated MRI Contrast in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41/2025)</title>

Neuromelanin is a pigment in the brain and an effective metal chelator. It is likely a crucial factor in the viability of neurons, which has sparked interest in MRI biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. In their Research Article (e202509102), Harald E. M&#246;ller and co&#8208;workers demonstrate remarkable complexity of the binding of Fe and Cu to synthetic neuromelanin analogues, with different binding sites, competition, and intricate magnetic properties, all of which affect the proton relaxation of surrounding water, the main contrast mechanism in MRI.

The image illustrates frustrated spins in the triangular Fe3(&#956;3&#8208;O) nodes of the MIL&#8208;101(Fe). In their Research Article (e202514014), Leticia Gonz&#225;lez, Georg Kresse and co&#8208;workers reveal the true antiferromagnetic ground state of such metal&#8208;organic frameworks by using spin&#8208;flip, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT. This intrinsic spin frustration determines structure stability and controls the temperature&#8208;dependent switch between N2 fixation and CO adsorption. The &#8220;spin&#8208;city&#8221; illustration is designed by Caroline Lechner.

The cover image depicts a [6]catenane topology woven from six interlocked rings with 18 crossings, formed via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands yields exclusively topological enantiomers. The mirrored, semi&#8208;transparent structure below represents the opposite&#8208;handed topology against a celestial backdrop, highlighting the elegance and grandeur of the assembly. Details are reported by Guo&#8208;Xin Jin, Zheng Cui, et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202515400).

Incorporation of non&#8208;benzenoid rings into cycloarylenes profoundly affects their molecular geometry and photophysics. In their Research Article (e202512344), Zheng Zhou and co&#8208;workers report a reductive cleavage strategy that dissociates {FeCp} moieties to yield two anionic cycloarylenes, which exhibit abnormal anti&#8208;Kasha emission and ultra&#8208;long thermally activated delayed fluorescence.

         <dc:description>
A method to extend lanthanide emission lifetimes by utilizing dynamic molecular triplet excitons in lanthanide complex aggregates is presented by Yuichi Kitagawa, Takuma Nakai, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202513236). The image illustrates that the triplet exciton migration among phenanthrene ligands extends Eu3+ emission lifetime. This emission lifetime tuning method enhances the encoding capacity of luminescent lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Considerations in Pursuing Reaction Scope Generality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods that are applicable to a broad range of substrates are sought after, owing to their utility in industrial settings. This minireview describes considerations associated with how chemists define and identify general methods, especially with the emergence of modern analytical, high&#8208;throughput, and data science tools in chemistry, and gives the reader an overview of workflows that have been used to expedite this pursuit.








Abstract
The term &#8220;generality&#8221; has recently been popularized in synthetic chemistry, owing largely to the increasing use of high&#8208;throughput technology for producing vast quantities of data and the emergence of data science tools to plan and interpret these experiments. Despite this, the term has not been clearly defined, and there is no standardized approach toward developing a method with a diverse (general) scope. This minireview will examine different emerging strategies toward achieving generality using selected examples and aims to give the reader an overview of modern workflows that have been used to expedite this pursuit.

         <title>Topology&#8208;Engineered Guide RNAs for Programmable Control of CRISPR/Cas Activity</title>

Topology&#8208;engineered guide RNAs (TE&#8208;gRNAs) provide precise spatiotemporal control over CRISPR/Cas9, Cas12a, and Cas13 systems. By introducing photolabile and chemical&#8208;responsive modifications into RNA topology, such as polymeric, cyclic or star&#8208;shaped architectures, this Minireview presents strategies to reversibly modulate gene editing activities, enabling programmable and conditional genome engineering.








Abstract
CRISPR/Cas systems have transformed genome editing, yet achieving precise temporal and conditional control remains challenging. Traditional strategies involving linear guide RNAs (gRNAs) modified with multiple chemical groups throughout their strands often face limitations such as heterogeneous reaction outcomes, irreversibility, and variable editing efficiencies. To overcome these issues, topology&#8208;engineered guide RNAs (TE&#8208;gRNAs) have emerged, featuring defined structural architectures including polymeric, circular, and dendrimer&#8208;like topologies that enable precise spatial control, reversibility, and programmable activation of CRISPR activity. By selectively incorporating physical or chemically responsive linkers and stimuli&#8208;sensitive groups at specific sites, TE&#8208;gRNAs facilitate dynamic and conditional genome editing that can be activated or deactivated with external triggers such as light or chemical signals. These engineered RNA structures significantly improve synthesis feasibility, stability, reduce off&#8208;target effects, and provide unprecedented control over gene editing processes. Recent advancements in TE&#8208;gRNAs demonstrate their broad applicability in synthetic biology, functional genomics, and therapeutic interventions, highlighting their potential to achieve precise spatiotemporal modulation of CRISPR systems. This review summarizes the current strategies, benefits, and challenges associated with TE&#8208;gRNAs, and discusses future directions for enhancing their performance and utility in complex genome editing applications.

         <title>Modeling Midbrain and Brainstem Neuromelanins to Characterize Metal Binding and Associated MRI Contrast in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic neuromelanin analogs are used to characterize iron and copper binding to the melanin moiety or to conjugated protein (&#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin). The models confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear&#8208;binding sites and iron or mixed&#8208;metal clusters that enhance water proton relaxation to varying degrees. The results help to better understand MRI contrast changes related to altered neuromelanin content in the brain due to neurodegeneration.








Abstract
Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark pigment that binds potentially toxic metal ions and is crucial for neuronal vulnerability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was proposed to measure neuromelanin in the substantia nigra or locus coeruleus, potentially providing a marker of Parkinson's disease. Here, synthetic neuromelanin analogues were prepared with iron and copper and used for characterization of metal binding and impact on proton relaxation, a prerequisite for optimizing neuromelanin&#8208;sensitive MRI. The results confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear Fe(III) and antiferromagnetically coupled clusters, which enhance relaxation to variable degrees. Further complexity arises from Cu(II), which can compete for binding to mononuclear sites, aggregate in mixed&#8208;metal clusters, or bind to proteins associated with the melanin moiety. Unlike the strong relaxant Fe(III), Cu(II) only indirectly impacts relaxation by replacing iron. Overall, MRI primarily provides measures of average neuromelanin concentrations. Information on the distribution of neuromelanins with different metal compositions might be obtained with multiparametric MRI.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroelectrochemical Observation of Overlayer&#8208;Induced Charge Carrier Dynamics in Water Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

TiO2 overlayers on WO3 photoanode enhance photoelectrochemical water oxidation by surface and interfacial engineering. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy reveals photogenerated electron trapping pathway in ionized states driven by band bending. These findings demonstrate how surface properties, PEC performance, and charge carrier kinetics interrelate, highlighting the significance of band bending modifications.








Abstract
Surface and interface engineering is essential for constructing efficient and stable photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar fuel production. Despite the recent advances in photoelectrode optimization for the practical application, the corresponding interfacial reaction mechanism has not been elucidated owing to a lack of suitable measurements at the semiconductor&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the key factor for an interfacial reaction in a model system (WO3 photoanode coated with amorphous TiO2 overlayers) is elucidated using operando spectroelectrochemistry. The thin TiO2 overlayers are shown to enhance n&#8208;type semiconductor characteristics and heal the excessive oxygen vacancies on the WO3 photoanode surface, which suggests reduced bulk and surface charge carrier recombination and 1.5&#8208;fold increase in Faradaic efficiency. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the overlayers accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the electrode to the external circuit and increase the population of trapped holes by promoting band bending, which reveals that the kinetic connection between ultrafast phenomena and real water oxidation reaction. Thus, our work elucidates band bending in the space&#8208;charge region as a key factor and provides a major strategy for designing surface&#8208;modified PEC devices.

&lt;p&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers on WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode enhance photoelectrochemical water oxidation by surface and interfacial engineering. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy reveals photogenerated electron trapping pathway in ionized states driven by band bending. These findings demonstrate how surface properties, PEC performance, and charge carrier kinetics interrelate, highlighting the significance of band bending modifications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface and interface engineering is essential for constructing efficient and stable photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar fuel production. Despite the recent advances in photoelectrode optimization for the practical application, the corresponding interfacial reaction mechanism has not been elucidated owing to a lack of suitable measurements at the semiconductor&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the key factor for an interfacial reaction in a model system (WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode coated with amorphous TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers) is elucidated using operando spectroelectrochemistry. The thin TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers are shown to enhance n-type semiconductor characteristics and heal the excessive oxygen vacancies on the WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode surface, which suggests reduced bulk and surface charge carrier recombination and 1.5-fold increase in Faradaic efficiency. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the overlayers accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the electrode to the external circuit and increase the population of trapped holes by promoting band bending, which reveals that the kinetic connection between ultrafast phenomena and real water oxidation reaction. Thus, our work elucidates band bending in the space-charge region as a key factor and provides a major strategy for designing surface-modified PEC devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) moiety can be installed on amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides so that SuFEx click chemistry can be enabled on the corresponding polypeptides. By allowing the use of simple hydroxyl and amino groups on functional moieties of interest with minimal preset conditions, and utilizing the functionalities of SuFEx linkages, high throughput preparation of diverse functional polypeptides can be made possible.








Abstract
Facile but effective synthesis and functionalization of polypeptides has long been a challenge, blocking the way to further explorations of their properties and potential applications. Here, we report the incorporation of sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) moiety in amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides, which grant the resulting polypeptides from ring&#8208;opening polymerization the ability to utilize simple hydroxyl and amino groups on functional moieties of interest without the requirement for the introduction of preset conditions, such as reactive molecular anchors. We prepared series of polypeptides modified with sulfates or amidosulfonates (sulfamates), and importantly, we demonstrate that such linkages derived from SuFEx exhibit unique nature, which possibly benefits future biomaterial designs. In addition, the linkages can synergize with incorporated functionalizing moieties, demonstrated in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example in which the sulfate&#8208;linked, saccharide&#8208;modified polypeptides showed outstanding antiviral activity and biocompatibility.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Axial Imaging for Quantifying Piconewton Traction Forces in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce metal&#8208;induced energy transfer&#8208;based tension probe microscopy (MIET&#8208;TPM), a hybrid imaging approach that combines MIET with DNA&#8208;based molecular tension probes to map piconewton cellular traction forces with nanometer axial resolution. This method enables simultaneous visualization of integrin forces and membrane topography in live cells.








Abstract
Cell mechanics play a pivotal role in regulating numerous biological processes. Although super&#8208;resolution microscopy enables the imaging of cellular forces in the lateral dimension with sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm resolution, achieving comparable resolution along the axial dimension remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce metal&#8208;induced energy transfer (MIET)&#8208;based tension probe microscopy (MIET&#8208;TPM), a technique for mapping cellular mechanical forces with nanometer precision in the axial direction. This approach combines the nanometer spatial resolution of MIET imaging with the piconewton sensitivity of DNA&#8208;hairpin&#8208;based molecular tension probes (MTPs), enabling the simultaneous observation of both the plasma membrane and force&#8208;exerting molecules in the axial dimension. Using MIET&#8208;TPM, we mapped axial integrin tension within focal adhesions and podosomes, alongside their corresponding plasma membrane height profiles, offering detailed insights into the nanoscale structures and mechanisms involved in force transmission. Notably, MIET&#8208;TPM can be implemented on any fluorescence microscopy setup without hardware modifications, making it a versatile and accessible tool that promises to become an integral part of future cellular mechanobiology&#160;analysis.

         <title>Molecular Afterglow of Lophine&#8208;Based Luminophore and Its Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered that lophine&#8212;the first historically documented chemiluminescent compound&#8212;can be converted from weak chemiluminescence to bright molecular afterglow by caging its imidazole moiety. This switch greatly enhances its emission intensity, enabling, for the first time, the use of lophine derivatives for in vivo imaging applications, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection and monitoring adipose tissue changes induced by the GLP&#8208;1 agonist Semaglutide






.

Abstract
Lophine, the first chemiluminescent compound discovered in history, has rarely been applied for in vivo imaging since its discovery in 1877. In this report, we demonstrate that lophine's chemiluminescence emission could be significantly enhanced by caging the imidazole moiety via molecular afterglow mechanism. Notably, our study revealed a rare superoxide anion&#8208;mediated luminescence. Our novel probes JIMI&#8208;11 and JIMI&#8208;12 could be used for in vivo mouse imaging. Compared to its uncaged form JIMI&#8208;6, JIMI&#8208;11 exhibited a significant enhancement (126&#8208;fold) in vitro and a 190&#8208;fold higher emission signal in vivo. JIMI&#8208;11 selectively accumulates in white adipose tissues (WAT) and can be used to monitor changes in WAT mass in a mouse model of type&#8208;1 diabetes. Additionally, it can assess the therapeutic effects of Semaglutide in a mouse model of diet&#8208;induced obesity. Lastly, we designed JIMI&#8208;12 with a reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) responsive moiety as the caging group and demonstrated its utility for in vivo imaging of ROS in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced inflammatory mouse model. Our studies suggest that re&#8208;designing lophine&#8208;based probes could unlock their potential for both in vitro and in vivo applications. The ability to switch from chemiluminescence to molecular afterglow introduces a novel approach to designing imaging probes.

This work presents a tert&#8208;butyl functionalized ultra&#8208;microporous three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) with high crystallinity and a large surface area.

Abstract
Efficient capture and recovery of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from SF6/N2 mixtures is critical for mitigating greenhouse effects and promoting gas recycling in the electronics industry. Herein, we report a novel ultra&#8208;microporous three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF), termed CPOF&#8208;12, enriched with tert&#8208;butyl groups. CPOF&#8208;12 exhibits a Brunauer&#8722;Emmett&#8722;Teller (BET) surface area of 1,140&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, a pore volume of 0.66&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, and a uniform pore size of 0.59&#160;nm, which closely matches the kinetic diameter of SF6 (0.52&#160;nm). Gas adsorption measurements reveal a high SF6 uptake of 2.20&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, along with an exceptional SF6/N2 selectivity of 149.4, calculated using ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). This study highlights the effectiveness of pore surface engineering in COFs for high&#8208;performance separation of greenhouse gases.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Hybrid of Viruses and Supramolecular Peptide Fibers for Multidimensional Control of Patterning and Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid of a bacteriophage virus and a helical supramolecular fiber, composed of an amphiphilic peptide containing an azobenzene group (A2Az), as a virus hybridizable self&#8208;assembling peptide is reported. The hybrid undergoes disassembly by photo&#8208;induced depolymerization of the A2Az fiber, which enables site&#8208;selective control of the adhesion and infection behaviors of the bacteriophage not only on 2D substrates but also in 3D hydrogel environments.








Abstract
Viruses are versatile colloidal materials in their biofunctions, monodispersed and periodic structures, and high surface designability. For expanding the applicability of virus&#8208;based materials, spatiotemporally controlled immobilization and dispersion of viruses with retained activity should be useful, though control of the dynamic nature of viruses hybridized with commonly used polymers has been difficult due to their strong interactions. Here, we report a self&#8208;assembling peptide (A2Az) enabling photo control of adhesion and dispersion of M13 bacteriophage virus (M13 phage) and successfully demonstrate patterning of localization and infection of the virus. A2Az is a cationic peptide with amphiphilicity that consists of eight amino acid residues containing a photo&#8208;responsive azobenzene group at the second position and self&#8208;assembles into a helical supramolecular fiber to form a hydrogel. The helical fibrillar morphology of A2Az exhibits strong interaction with M13 phage, allowing for immobilization not only on a two&#8208;dimensional surface but also in a three&#8208;dimensional hydrogel with suppression of infectivity. The A2Az fiber undergoes a light&#8208;triggered fiber&#8208;to&#8208;particle transition and releases the immobilized M13 phage with retained infectivity for the photo&#8208;controlled patterning of localization and infection. This approach has potential applicability to various virus&#8208;based biomaterials, such as structural materials and materials for photo&#8208;selective gene transfection to cells.

         <title>Hydrophilic Iridium Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes Catalyze Linear&#8208;Selective, Additive&#8208;Free Hydroaminomethylation of Long&#8208;Chain Olefins in Water</title>

         <dc:description>
An additive&#8208;free hydroaminomethylation of long&#8208;chain olefins in water is achieved by using a hydrophilic bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;iridium catalyst without high&#8208;pressure H2 and organic solvent, affording linear amines with good yields and high linear/branch selectivities. This approach provides a simple, straightforward, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective method for the synthesis of higher (deuterium) amines and derivatives.








Abstract
Aqueous hydroaminomethylation (HAM) of olefins generally requires the use of organic solvents, additives, and high&#8208;pressure hydrogen to synthesize amines in satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we accomplish the HAM reactions of long&#8208;chain olefins in water without organic solvent or additives by using a hydrophilic bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;Ir complex as the catalyst. A broad scope of long&#8208;chain olefins and amines is well compatible, affording corresponding higher amines in up to 99% yields with excellent linear/branched (l/b) selectivity (up to 94/6). Mechanistic investigations reveal that water acts as both solvent and hydrogen source. The protocol can be readily extended to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and deuterated analogues with excellent yields and deuterium rates. Moreover, the amine products are easily separated by extraction, and the recovered aqueous phase could be directly used and recycled. This protocol offers a sustainable, safe, and cost&#8208;effective approach for synthesizing higher amines.

         <title>Boosting Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion over Copper&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts by Facilitating Hydrogenation and Product Desorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ca&#8208;doped Cu2O with oxalate modification is synthesized as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction reaction. By integrating the facilitated NO3&#8722; adsorption and hydrogenation, promoted NH3 desorption and impeded side reactions, an excellent performance is achieved with an NH3 yield of 15.02&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and Faraday efficiency of 97.49% in neutral condition.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) in neutral condition offers a sustainable route for ammonia (NH3) production and water purification. For the most extensively investigated Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts that favor NO3&#8722; adsorption, insufficient hydrogenation capability and sluggish NH3 desorption hinder the ultimate performance. Herein, we report Ca&#8208;doped Cu2O co&#8208;modified by oxalate (Ca&#9472;Cu2O&#9472;OA) as a novel and high&#8208;performance NitRR electrocatalyst. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the Ca dopant with strong hydration effect facilitates the hydrogenation steps of adsorbed NO3&#8722; on the adjacent Cu active sites. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between OA and adsorbed NH3 promotes the product desorption. Together with the strong NO3&#8722; adsorption capability and inhibited hydrogen evolution as a side reaction, excellent NitRR performance with a high Faraday efficiency (FE) of 97.49% and a high NH3 yield of 15.02&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 is achieved in neutral condition, outperforming most reported electrocatalysts. This work has provided new insights into the rational design of advanced NitRR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Fluorination in Dual&#8208;Halogen Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: A Case Study of New Li2HfCl6&#8722;xFx Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of dual&#8208;halogen solid electrolytes (SEs), based on a new Pnma phase of Li2HfCl6. By systematically fluorinating it to various degrees, Li2HfCl5.5F0.5 was identified as the optimal formulation. ASSBs assembled using it as the catholyte exhibited greatly enhanced electrochemical stability compared to those employing Li2HfCl6. We explicitly demonstrate that this is due to the formation of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated, LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, not enhanced anodic stability of the catholyte.








Abstract
Lithium metal chlorides are promising superionic conductors for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) due to their favorable mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, and good oxidative stability (up to &gt;4.2&#160;V versus Li/Li+). Nonetheless, chloride solid electrolytes (SEs) still undergo electrochemical degradation when paired with high&#8208;voltage cathodes such as LiNi0.85Co0.1Mn0.05O2. A viable strategy to enhance the intrinsic electrochemical stability of chloride electrolytes is to partially substitute Cl with F. By leveraging complementary insights from neutron and X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS), and electrochemical studies, we investigate the interplay between ionic and electronic conductivity, voltage stability, and overall battery performance of a family of new dual&#8208;halogen SEs&#8212;Li2HfCl6&#8722;xFx. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells utilizing Li2HfCl5.5F0.5 as the electrolyte demonstrate much&#8208;enhanced battery performance compared to Li2HfCl6. This improvement is mainly attributed to the formation of a kinetically stable LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), which inhibits detrimental reactions between the cathode and the SE, as revealed by ToF&#8208;SIMS studies. The findings from this study are applicable to other dual&#8208;halogen solid ionic conductors, offering valuable insights into the relationship between intrinsic electrochemical window (IEW), electronic and ionic conductivity, and battery performance in dual&#8208;halogen solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Identification of a Selective YTHDF1 Inhibitor Targeting the m6A Recognition Domain for Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered SKLB&#8208;Y13, a selective YTHDF1 inhibitor that binds to the m6A recognition pocket and disrupts m6A&#8208;dependent YTHDF1&#8211;mRNA interactions. SKLB&#8208;Y13 shows potent cellular activity and selectivity in breast cancer models, with chemoproteomic profiling confirming its high target specificity.








Abstract
As a key N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) reader, YTH domain&#8208;containing family protein 1 (YTHDF1) promotes protein synthesis by recognizing m6A&#8208;modified mRNA, and its abnormal expression is closely related to breast cancer (BC) progression. To date, the scarce reported YTHDF1 inhibitors suffer from poor selectivity and limited potency, primarily due to the high homology of the YTH domain within the YTHDF family, which poses significant challenges for the discovery of subtype&#8208;selective inhibitors. Here, we report SKLB&#8208;Y13, the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitor achieving exclusive targeting of the YTHDF1 m6A&#8208;binding pocket&#160;(IC50&#160;=&#160;0.76 &#181;M), via structural optimization of a novel 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrothieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridine scaffold.&#160;Uniquely, SKLB&#8208;Y13 interacts with YTHDF1&#8208;specific residues Tyr397 and Trp470, as confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and demonstrates improved selectivity for YTHDF1 over YTH family proteins. Cellular and in vivo studies reveal that&#160;SKLB&#8208;Y13 disrupts YTHDF1&#8208;PRPF6 mRNA interaction in an m6A&#8208;dependent manner, thereby impairing the translation of PRPF6 and inhibiting BC proliferation while promoting apoptosis. Chemical proteomics profiling confirms its good target specificity, while pharmacokinetic analysis shows favorable in vivo properties.&#160;This study introduces the first selective YTHDF1 inhibitor, serving as a&#160;novel chemical probe&#160;to elucidate m6A&#8208;dependent oncogenesis and a promising starting point for developing precision therapies against YTHDF1&#8208;overexpressing BC.

         <title>Quest for Luminescent Low&#8208;Spin Chromium(I) Complexes with Doublet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States</title>

Paramagnetic low&#8208;spin d5 Cr(I) complexes prepared by chemical oxidation from their Cr(0) precursors were found luminescent in solutions and the emissions were tentatively assigned to be doublet MLCT in nature.








Abstract
Two paramagnetic Cr(I) complexes with homoleptic fac&#8208;bis(triarylisocyanide) ligands were prepared by chemical oxidation of the Cr(0) precursors and emission spectra with peak maximum at respective 568 and 525&#160;nm have been recorded with THF solutions of these two low&#8208;spin d5 metal complexes at 298&#160;K. Structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies revealed that the emission of the Cr(I) complexes could be tentatively assigned to be spin&#8208;allowed 2MLCT excited states. Femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra confirmed that the lifetimes of the excited states were in the tens of picoseconds, which could be explained by the fast nonradiative decay of 2MLCT state through low&#8208;lying quartet metal&#8208;centered (4MC) states. The Cr(I) complexes with luminescent 2MLCT excited states were distinct from the previously reported d5 Fe(III) complexes with luminescent 2LMCT excited states, enriching the diversity of emissive excited states of earth&#8208;abundant 3d transition metal complexes.

         <title>Phospholipid&#8208;Drug Conjugates Self&#8208;Organized into Well&#8208;Defined Supramolecular Nanotubes for Efficient Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful installation of planar camptothecin (CPT) into PC&#8208;type phospholipids enables the controlled self&#8208;assembly of these molecules into well&#8208;defined supramolecular nanotubes with varying lengths. We highlight the potential of phospholipid nanotubes as a versatile platform for targeted chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical applications.








Abstract
Controlled self&#8208;organization of amphiphilic phospholipid camptothecin (CPT) conjugates (named PCCs) selectively forms supramolecular nanotubes with varying lengths and polydispersity. Our study elucidates the underlying mechanisms governing PCC assembly, demonstrating that &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions derived from the planar, conjugated structure of CPT play a pivotal role in nanotube formation. Precise modulation of the hydrophobic characteristics of PCC linkers enables fine&#8208;tuning of &#960;&#8208;stacking strength, thereby controlling the length of the nanotubes, ranging from the nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale. With exceptionally high drug&#8208;loading efficiencies (43.9% to 52.3%) and stimulus&#8208;responsive release properties, the optimized PCC nanotubes exhibit tumor&#8208;selective cytotoxicity of 20&#8208; to 50&#8208;fold greater potency against tumor cells compared to normal cells. Furthermore, PCC nanotubes of intermediate length (0.3&#8211;0.5&#160;&#181;m) display prolonged circulation times than conventional liposomes, resulting in enhanced tumor&#8208;targeting and therapeutic efficacy.

The antioxidant strategy is employed to achieve the all&#8208;air preparation of organic solar cells (OSCs) by doping the antioxidant C60&#8208;OH into PDINN. C60&#8208;OH significantly affects the film&#8208;forming process of PDINN and the resulting morphological characteristics. Due to the stability of PDINN:C60&#8208;OH, an impressive efficiency of 20.22% is attained, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in air&#8208;processed (o&#8208;xylene) OSCs.








Abstract
The pronounced efficiency disparity between ambient&#8208;air&#8208;fabricated organic solar cells (OSCs) and nitrogen&#8208;glovebox&#8208;processed devices poses a major obstacle to industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. The instability of the organic electron transport layer (ETL) materials in air undoubtedly affects the carrier transport properties, which significantly reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. Here, based on the antioxidant strategy, the stability of PDINN in air is enhanced by doping PDINN with the antioxidant C60&#8208;OH, thereby successfully achieving the all&#8208;air preparation of OSCs. Eventually, the PCE of the air&#8208;prepared green OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and PM6:PTQ10:BTP&#8208;eC9 (o&#8208;xylene) achieves 19.35% and 20.22%, respectively, after being optimized by the antioxidant strategy. Moreover, C60&#8208;OH remarkably improves the operational stability of the device in air with a T80 lifetime of over 1060&#160;h, which is higher than that of undoped device (416&#160;h). Furthermore, the PCE of large&#8208;area (25&#160;cm2) modules based on PDINN:C60&#8208;OH attains 16.47%. This study highlights the potential of the antioxidant strategy to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency and stable organic photovoltaics in air, significantly promoting the development of OSCs.

         <title>General Synthesis of 2D Mesoporous Multimetal Spinel Supracrystals for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general and modular strategy for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with well&#8208;defined mesoporous surfaces and compositions that range from unary to multinary oxides. Leveraging multimetal electronic modulation, facet&#8208;specific catalytic activity, and 2D geometry, mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are demonstrated as interlayers in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, which deliver exceptional electrochemical performance under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous metal oxide crystals that integrate atomic&#8208;level single crystallinity with ordered mesoporosity represent a promising but rarely realized class of materials, particularly in multicomponent systems. Here, we report a universal strategy for synthesizing freestanding 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with tunable compositions, spanning from unary to multinary spinel oxide systems. This approach decouples crystalline framework formation from mesopore generation, combining emulsion&#8208;mediated, on&#8208;surface crystallization of 2D nanocrystal superlattices with thermally&#8208;induced collective nanocrystal reorientation and facet&#8208;selective epitaxial fusion. Concurrent surface reconstruction exposes {110} facets along nanocrystal edges, which define the internal surfaces of vertically aligned mesopores. As a proof of concept, 2D mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are employed as functional interlayers in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. These interlayers demonstrate strong polysulfide adsorption, accelerated redox kinetics, and enhanced Li+ ion transport, enabled by their multimetal&#8208;induced electronic modulation, facet&#8208;specific catalytic activity, and 2D mesoporous architecture. As a result, Li&#8211;S cells equipped with FeMnCoO&#8208;modified separators deliver exceptional electrochemical performance, even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This work addresses a longstanding challenge in reconciling ordered mesoporosity with crystallographic coherence in mesoporous materials, establishing a molecularly modular approach for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel crystals with programmable compositions and facet&#8208;engineered functionality.

         <title>Tailoring Low&#8208;Miller&#8208;Index Crystal Facets Realizes Perovskite Solar Cells with Flat Grain&#8208;boundary Grooves</title>

Diphosphate Lewis&#8208;base molecules tailored low&#8208;Miller&#8208;index crystal facets, flattened grain&#8208;boundary grooves and reduced nanoscale physical voids, thus enabling 26.80% efficiency perovskite solar cells with excellent operational stability.








Abstract
Charge transport and nonradiative recombination loss at the buried interface are important factors, which limit the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we screen a series of diphosphate Lewis&#8208;base molecules, where N,N&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (N&#8208;DPPM) with appropriate alkyl chains and multiple active sites not only can efficiently facilitate carrier transport but also coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ and interact with FA+ through N&#8943;H bond. These features prompt the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films along (100)/(200) crystal facets. Interestingly, these oriented low&#8208;Miller&#8208;index crystal facets have approximately a twice&#8208;increase in heterointerface energy and twice&#8208;decrease in grain&#8208;boundary energy, flattening grain&#8208;boundary grooves, thereby reducing nanoscale physical voids and releasing residual stress. Consequently, the champion inverted PSCs exhibit impressive power conversion efficiencies of 26.80%, 26.18%, and 20.59% for narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.55&#160;eV), large&#8208;area (0.5&#160;cm2), and wide&#8208;bandgap (1.73&#160;eV) devices, respectively. Meanwhile, the unencapsulated devices exhibit excellent stability after long&#8208;term storage, thermal&#8208;aging, or light&#8208;soaking.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed, stereospecific, and ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of nucleophilic 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals has been developed, enabling the divergent synthesis of 3&#8208;C&#8208;glycals and 2,3&#8208;unsaturated C&#8208;glycosides in good yields with excellent selectivity. A DFT&#8208;assisted, data&#8208;driven predictive model was established to guide rational ligand design, laying a solid foundation for future advances in regiodivergent glycosylation.








Abstract
The selective modification of carbohydrates to achieve structural complexity has emerged as a crucial strategy in carbohydrate&#8208;based drug development. However, the intricate stereochemistry and densely packed functional groups of carbohydrates pose significant challenges for precise stereoselectivity and regioselectivity control. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, stereospecific, and ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals, establishing a robust platform for glycoside diversification with versatile C1 and C3 modification. Notably, stable 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals with 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraethylethylene glycol protection were first synthesized and fully characterized. Operating under mild conditions, this reaction enables the efficient synthesis of diverse 2,3&#8208;unsaturated aryl/alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with exceptional regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Importantly, this ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent C&#8208;glycosylation offers a concise and efficient strategy for accessing 3&#8208;C&#8208;glycals (C3&#8208;arylated/alkenylated glycals), circumventing time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive multi&#8208;step sequences. To elucidate the origins of regioselectivity control, we employ a data&#8208;driven approach integrating DFT&#8208;assisted multivariate regression analysis, identifying key ligand parameters that govern regioselectivity. Leveraging this predictive model, we pursued rational ligand design to enhance C3&#8208;glycosylation selectivity and yield. Additionally, density functional theory calculations (DFT) provide critical insights into the fundamental principles dictating regioselectivity and tunability. These findings establish a solid foundation for advancing ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosylation reactions and significantly expand the synthetic toolkit for glycochemical synthesis.

         <title>Corral[n]Bicarbazoles: Redox&#8208;Active Chiral Macrocycles for Air&#8208;Stable Radical Cations Formation and Guest Capture/Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active macrocycles were synthesized employing axially chiral 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole units, showing excellent chiropotical propreties and hosting ability. These macrocycles generate stable radical cations upon oxidation and enable redox&#8208;responsive guest capture/release via their electron&#8208;rich, deep cavity.








Abstract
Macrocyclic compounds are pivotal in both supramolecular chemistry and materials science, as their preorganized cavities enable selective molecular recognition, while their cyclic frameworks facilitate electronic and spatial coupling of monomeric units to yield advanced optoelectronic and magnetic properties. However, macrocycles that combine exceptional host&#8211;guest recognition with these properties remain rare and challenging to design. Herein, we report the synthesis of three pairs of enantiopure, redox&#8208;active, conjugated macrocycles, termed corral[n]bicarbazole, employing axially chiral 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole units. These macrocycles display strong blue emission (quantum yields up to 78% in THF) and pronounced circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| up to 10&#8722;3). Notably, controlled oxidation of corral[n]bicarbazoles generates their mono&#8208; and polyradical cations with exceptional air stability (half&#8208;lives up to five days) and intriguing magnetic properties. The electron&#8208;rich deep&#8208;cavity of corral[4]bicarbazole confers strong hosting ability (Ka = 104&#8211;105 M&#8722;1) toward cationic guests, facilitating redox&#8208;responsive guest capture/release. By integrating a chiroptical, redox&#8208;active backbone with a switchable recognition cavity, corral[n]bicarbazoles offer a versatile platform for advancing interdisciplinary innovation, with potential applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and smart supramolecular materials.

         <title>HerTACs Enable Tumor&#8208;Selective Lysosomal Degradation of Membrane and Extracellular Proteins via HER2 Trafficking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
AI&#8208;guided design of HER2&#8208;targeted lysosome&#8208;tethering chimeras (HerTACs) enables selective degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins in HER2+ tumors. These stapled peptide&#8208;based degraders harness HER2&#8208;mediated trafficking to deliver programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), V&#8208;domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) into lysosomes, offering a broadly applicable and clinically promising strategy for targeted protein degradation (TPD). 








Abstract
Targeting extracellular and membrane proteins for degradation remains a frontier challenge in the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD), largely due to the intracellular confinement of existing proteolysis systems and reliance on bulky biologics. Here, we develop a novel TPD platform, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeted lysosome&#8208;tethering chimeras (HerTACs), which co&#8208;opts the tumor overexpressed, endocytic, and lysosomal trafficking capability of HER2. Starting from the HER2&#8208;binding peptide LTVSPWY, we engineered the first&#8208;generation HerTAC (LP), a conjugate of the HER2&#8208;binding peptide and a PD&#8208;L1 ligand, to degrade programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) in HER2&#8208;positive cells. Guided by AlphaFold modeling and alanine scanning, we developed a stapled peptide&#8208;based HerTAC (L2,5P) with enhanced degradative&#160;efficacy (DC50&#160;=&#160;156&#160;nM), stability, and pharmacokinetics. HerTAC L2,5P showed potent antitumor activity and low systemic toxicity in HER2+ breast cancer animal models. The HerTAC strategy was further extended to other clinically relevant inaccessible membrane and extracellular targets (i.e., V&#8208;domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation [VISTA] and macrophage migration inhibitory factor [MIF]), highlighting its generality and broad applicability. This work establishes a tumor&#8208;selective, lysosome&#8208;directed TPD strategy that expands the druggable proteome and offers a clinically transformable approach for precision oncology.

         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron catalytic system for efficient atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of CH2Br2 to alkenes has been developed. This photochemical approach enables facile synthesis of valuable 1,3&#8208;dibromo compounds that serve as versatile intermediates for streamlined preparation of oxetanes, allyl bromides, and cyclopropane derivatives through one&#8208;pot or sequential transformations. This breakthrough in CH2Br2 activation under mild conditions advances sustainable halogenation methodologies.








Abstract
An efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated iron&#8208;catalyzed atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction between CH2Br2 and various alkenes has been developed. This transformation provides direct access to synthetically valuable 1,3&#8208;dibromo compounds with excellent atom economy under mild reaction conditions. The protocol demonstrates remarkable versatility, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility. Notably, the obtained 1,3&#8208;dibromo products function as highly versatile synthetic building blocks. Through rationally designed one&#8208;pot multistep transformations, these intermediates can be conveniently converted into structurally diverse derivatives, including oxetanes and allyl bromides, directly from terminal alkenes.

         <title>In Situ Click Chemistry Screen Facilitated by an On&#8208;Nanoparticle DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Identifies Highly Selective and Potent Peptoid Ligands for a Phosphatase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

The discovery of ligands that selectively target closely related protein families or isoforms remains a critical challenge. A protein&#8208;templated in situ click strategy, enabled by a nanoparticle&#8208;based DNA&#8208;encoded library (nanoDEL), yielded nanomolar, highly selective inhibitors of PTP1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site.








Abstract
Capture agents that selectively bind to biological targets are indispensable tools in diagnostics, therapeutics, and biomedical research. However, discovering such capture agents, particularly for structurally conserved or challenging targets, remains a challenge. Here, we describe a protein&#8208;templated in situ click strategy enabled by a nanoparticle&#8208;based DNA&#8208;encoded library (nanoDEL) platform. The nanoDEL enables the construction and screening of vastly large, chemically diverse combinatorial libraries with high redundancy, far exceeding the scale and throughput of conventional approaches, such as one&#8208;bead&#8208;one&#8208;compound and solution&#8208;phase in situ click methods. Thus, this enables the rapid and efficient identification of high&#8208;affinity, high&#8208;selectivity ligands in a single selection round, eliminating the need for iterative screening. To demonstrate the utility of this strategy, we performed an in situ click screening of a 27&#8208;million&#8208;member nanoDEL of azido&#8208;functionalized peptoids, in the presence of a weak and promiscuous alkyne&#8208;bearing anchor ligand. This yielded bidentate inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site. These inhibitors exhibited nanomolar potency and exceptional selectivity over closely related phosphatases. This work represents a broadly applicable strategy for discovering high&#8208;performance capture agents, particularly for selectively targeting closely related protein families or isoforms where achieving selectivity remains a critical challenge.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Step Screening&#8208;Guided Core&#8208;Shell RuO2@TaOx Nanorods Electrocatalyst for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the limitations of conventional experimental method, which are often time&#8208; and resource&#8208;intensive, a multi&#8208;step systematic screening strategy guides the selection of high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides as protective layers for RuO2 in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The relevant core&#8208;shell structures are subsequently designed, where interfacial synergy promotes both catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
In the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the exploration of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts is essential for the environmentally friendly production of hydrogen. Although RuO2 exhibits high catalytic activity, its solubility and corrosion in acidic environments are of concern. In this study, high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides were multi&#8208;step rationally screened as protective layers for RuO2 to identify their roles in the acidic OER process. Among them, Ta&#8208;related oxide was selected as the best candidate. To demonstrate the theoretical predictions, RuO2@TaOx with a core&#8208;shell structure was deployed, which exhibited low overpotentials of 163 and 232&#160;mV at 10&#160; and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In fact, the dense amorphous TaOx layer effectively prevented the dissolution of RuO2 and optimized the charge transfer through interfacial synergy, significantly improving both the activity and durability of OER. Meanwhile, the operando quick X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (Quick&#8208;XAS) confirmed that Ru served as the active site during OER, while Ta inhibited the over&#8208;oxidation of Ru, correlating with theoretical considerations. This study provides a new paradigm using targeted computational screening to guide the design of advanced catalysts, and serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the deployment of high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides as a protective layer for RuO2 in the acidic OER.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Insensitive Solvation Chemistry Stabilizes High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

This work proposes a solvophilic diluent&#8208;modulated electrolyte model for electric field&#8208;insensitive electrolyte chemistry. The electrolyte decouples solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields and maintains Li+&#8208;solvent coordination integrity via mutual hydrogen bonding, enabling remarkable success in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Ether based electrolytes are promising for the realization of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs). However, the oxidation chemistry of these electrolytes stemming from the disruption to solvent coordination by interfacial electric&#8208;field remains unresolved and challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that reinforcing the interactions between solvent and diluent to decouple solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields could maintain Li&#8314;&#8208;solvent coordination integrity and drastically diminish uncoordinated solvents, thereby increasing electrolyte anodic stability. To realize this concept, we identify a class of solvophilic diluents (SPDs, whose interaction energies with solvent&gt;3.3&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) to strongly anchor diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) solvent at electrified interfaces via mutually reinforcing H(DEGDME)&#183;&#183;&#183;F/O(SPD) and H(SPD)&#183;&#183;&#183;O(DEGDME) interactions and effectively decrease dipole moment of DEGDME (&lt;&#160;2.47&#160;D), creating an electric field&#8208;insensitive solvation environment wherein the O&#9472;H/C&#9472;H bond polarization of DEGDME is dramatically impeded. Remarkably, our designed SPD&#8208;assisted electrolyte mediated by electric field&#8208;insensitive methyl nonafluorobutyl ether exhibits outstanding anodic stability, endowing 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 30&#160;&#181;m Li||2.1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell with 80% capacity retention after 168 cycles&#8208;an improvement over the 90 cycles achieved with a Li friendly electrolyte. This work establishes a mechanistic framework for manipulating interfacial solvation dynamics to unlock high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Bionic Design of Ni4+ Lewis Acid Site Based on Selective Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the early flowering of damaged plants for survival, we have designed an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich catalyst that can &#8220;ripen&#8221; to a highly active state (Ni4+). This state selectively attracts hydroxide ions and repels chloride ions, thereby achieving efficient and stable seawater electrolysis and avoiding corrosion.








Abstract
The side reaction caused by chloride ions and the toxicity to the active site have always been the hindrance to the electrocatalyst of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for seawater splitting. Herein, inspired by the early flowering of damaged plants, we designed a catalyst rich in oxygen vacancies (Ovac) and proved that Ovac can accelerate the formation of Ni3+ and further oxidize it to Ni4+, which we named as the &#8220;ripening&#8221; mechanism of Ovac. Ovac reduces the hydrogen proton desorption energy by regulating local charge redistribution, thus realizing the rapid transformation of Ni2+&#8594;Ni3+&#8594;Ni4+. Meanwhile, the hard Lewis acid Ni4+ has strong selectivity to OH&#8722;, avoiding the competitiveness and corrosiveness of chloride ions in seawater. This work provides an effective strategy for the simple and rapid construction of self&#8208;rebuilding high&#8208;valence Ni4+ electrocatalysts, and is expected to provide guidance for the development of seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Kirkendall Effect&#8208;Driven Interface Engineering Facilitates Water Dissociation for Dual&#8208;Site H2O2 Electrosynthesis Simultaneously at the Anode and Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Kirkendall effect&#8208;driven interfacial engineering strategy was developed to construct NiZnOx&#9472;C catalysts with exposed (100) facets. The incorporation of hetero&#8208;nanocluster NiOx induced built&#8208;in electric fields and enriched oxygen vacancies, which synergistically promoted the spontaneous dissociation of water and subsequent formation of *H and *OH radicals. These interfacial features collectively optimized the thermodynamics and kinetics of both the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) pathways for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The direct integration of renewable energy into H2O2 electrosynthesis systems offers a promising strategy to minimize energy losses and costs. Due to the intermittency of renewable energy, the dual&#8208;site catalysts must efficiently enable both the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR). The Kirkendall effect was employed to engineer interfaces and construct a NiZnOx&#9472;C catalyst with exposed (100) facets. The hetero&#8208;cluster NiOx induces oxygen vacancies and built&#8208;in electric fields, which facilitate water activation and subsequent formation of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals, thereby enabling a single catalyst to rapidly electrosynthesize H2O2 at both the anode and cathode. Notably, 2e&#8722; ORR on the cathode enabled rapid synthesis of high&#8208;concentration H2O2 (33987&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1, 33.18&#160;mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). NiZnOx&#9472;C achieves stable 2e&#8722; ORR/WOR coupling in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor, operating reliably for 4 h under simulated alternating current (AC) and peaking at a total Faradaic efficiency of 150.9% under amperage&#8208;level direct currents. This work provides insights into interface engineering based on the Kirkendall effect, demonstrating the feasibility of directly integrating intermittent renewable energy into H2O2 electrosynthesis systems.

         <title>Bioinspired Anti&#8208;Freezing Hydrogel With Localized Ice Regulation for Subzero Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by freeze&#8208;tolerant organisms, we develop a bioinspired anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel by embedding bacterial membrane&#8208;anchored ice nucleating protein (BMIP)&#8208;loaded microgels (BGEL) into an ice binding protein (IBP)&#8208;containing PAMAC matrix. BMIP triggers localized ice nucleation in BGEL, while IBP suppresses further growth, spatially confining ice within BGEL. This ensures BGEL freezes at subzero temperatures but the surrounding PAMAC matrix remains unfrozen.








Abstract
Freezing hydrogels at subzero temperatures severely compromises mechanical flexibility, ionic conductivity, and structural integrity, thereby limiting their application in low&#8208;temperature environments. Hydrogel freezing involves both ice nucleation and ice growth; however, simultaneously inhibiting these two processes remains a significant challenge. In nature, freeze&#8208;tolerant organisms do not rely on completely preventing ice formation to survive freezing conditions. Instead, they utilize bacterial membrane&#8208;anchored ice nucleating protein (BMIP) to promote ice nucleation and ice binding protein (IBP) to regulate ice growth, thereby achieving freeze protection through precise ice management. Inspired by this biological strategy of &#8220;selective nucleation of small ice crystals with restricted growth,&#8221; we developed anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels by incorporating both BMIP and IBP. The anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels exhibit enhanced mechanical and electrical performance at low temperatures, with a non&#8208;freezing matrix stable down to &#8722;30&#176;C and excellent structural integrity over multiple freeze&#8208;thaw cycles. When employed as a functional component of a robotic hand designed for low&#8208;temperature operation and integrated with machine learning algorithms, the anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels enable precise recognition of object stiffness and size under ultra&#8208;low temperature conditions. This bioinspired approach provides a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels capable of supporting stable human&#8208;robot&#8208;environment interactions in harsh, low&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Accessing Strain Engineered V&#8208;Fe(O)OH from Prussian Blue Analogue Precatalyst for Efficient Anodic Oxidation Reactions</title>

We present a d&#8208;d electron complementation strategy to precisely modulate the electronic structure of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst to access a strain&#8208;engineered V&#8208;Fe(O)OH active catalyst for anodic oxidation reactions. 








Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising precatalysts to access active metal oxyhydroxide [M(O)OH] phases for anodic oxidation reactions (AORs). In this study, we have introduced a d&#8208;d electron complementation strategy to fine&#8208;tune the electronic features of a VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst. Spectroscopic studies revealed the altered coordination and electronic features of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst compared to the FeFe&#8208;PBA counterpart. The electrochemical activation of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst led to the formation of a strained V&#8208;Fe(O)OH active catalyst. Notably, V&#8208;Fe(O)OH demonstrated exceptional performance, requiring a potential of only 1.56&#160;V versus RHE for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 1.42&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) at a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, significantly outperforming the Fe(O)OH. When employed in IOR&#8208;assisted water splitting, V&#8208;Fe(O)OH achieved an energy efficiency of 60% compared to overall water splitting. In&#8208;situ Raman studies reflected the potential dependent generation of active reaction intermediates, which participated in IOR to produce iodate. Mechanistic investigations suggested the involvement of a lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) facilitated by a proton&#8208;decoupled electron transfer (PDET) pathway.

         <title>Bidirectional Electron Relay at TiN&#8208;TiO2 Interfaces Enables Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Ru for High&#8208;Potential Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;based catalysts face catastrophic activity loss above 0.2&#160;V vs. RHE due to oxidation and OH over&#8208;adsorption. A TiN&#8208;TiO2 heterophase&#8208;derived charge&#8208;relay is proposed to realize potential&#8208;adaptive electronic regulation of Ru sites, spatially isolating Had/OHad and enabling metallic Ru0 preservation above 1.0&#160;V. This dual&#8208;phase design achieves unprecedented 100% activity retention at 1.1&#160;V and resolves the fundamental oxidation&#8208;driven deactivation.








Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;based catalysts are pivotal as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to Pt for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, they typically face irreversible deactivation above 0.2&#160;V vs. RHE due to synergistic Ru oxidation/OHad over&#8208;adsorption. We propose a Taichi&#8208;inspired TiN&#8208;TiO2 heterophase&#8208;segregated electron&#8208;relay mechanism that dynamically balances bidirectional electron flow (Ru&#8594;TiN electron donation and TiO2&#8594;Ru electron replenishment), achieving complete activity retention (100%) even under 1.1&#160;V operation. This potential&#8208;adaptive regulation can significantly inhibit electron redistribution and band compression under the high potential induced electric field, and effectively alleviate the d&#8208;band upshift and OH adsorption energy surge. Spatially decoupled Ti(TiN)&#8208;Ru bridge sites simultaneously adsorb OHad (Eads = &#8208;1.40&#160;eV) and decouple Had/OHad adsorption domains, eliminating competitive binding. This configuration delivers triple synergies: 1) geometric isolation of reactive intermediates adsorption, 2) potential&#8208;responsive Ru0 stabilization, and 3) accelerated Volmer kinetics via interfacial hydroxyl migration. The Ru/TiN&#8208;TiO2 catalyst achieves 100% activity retention at 1.1&#160;V vs. RHE (vs. &gt;60% loss for Ru/TiN) with 73.23% metallic Ru0 preserved after 10&#160;h operation. This work resolves the intrinsic activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in Ru HOR catalysts and establishes dynamic charge&#8208;relay interfaces as a universal design paradigm for oxidation&#8208;prone electrocatalysts.

         <title>Perfluoroalkyl Hybrid Ethylene Glycol Side Chains: A Solution to Water Related Challenges in n&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address water related challenges in n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs), we proposed an innovative strategy by incorporating perfluoroalkyl hybridized ethylene glycol (fag) side chains into the polymer. As a result, fag&#8208;modified OMIECs achieve a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#181;C* value of 189.78&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and maintain 68% performance after 50&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a novel pathway for developing high&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type OMIECs.








Abstract
The water molecule is regarded as a double&#8208;edged sword in organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs), particularly for n&#8208;type semiconductors. On the one hand, hydration facilitates ion transport within OMIECs; on the other hand, water acts as an electron trap, capturing electrons in n&#8208;type materials. Excessive hydration may disrupt the continuity of OMIECs crystalline domains, leading to device degradation. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative strategy by incorporating perfluoroalkyl hybridized ethylene glycol (fag) side chains into the polymer. The strong hydrophobicity of fluoroalkyl segments effectively repels water from polymer backbone, thereby reducing electron trapping. Meanwhile, the ethylene glycol components facilitate efficient ion transport. These findings are confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8208;D). Additionally, the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of fluorine lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, which in turn enhances stability in aqueous environments. We also discovered that the incorporation of fag side chains also promotes polymer self&#8208;assembly and improves crystallinity. Grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) reveals a face&#8208;on/edge&#8208;on mixed orientation in fag&#8208;based polymers, facilitating efficient ion&#8208;electron transport. Consequently, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) fabricated from fag&#8208;based OMIECs demonstrate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type performance, achieving a &#181;C* figure of merit of 189.78&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, they exhibit excellent stability, retaining 68% of their initial performance after 50&#160;000 switching cycles in aqueous electrolyte. This study demonstrates that a rational approach to molecular design can effectively alleviate the detrimental effects of water, providing a novel strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type OMIECs.

         <title>Bidirectional Hydrogen Spillover Enables High Activity Catalysts for Rechargeable Hydrogen Batteries</title>

The Ru&#8211;WO3 catalyst with low ruthenium loading accelerates the reaction kinetics of HER/HOR in acidic environments via the bidirectional hydrogen spillover mechanism, thereby enabling hydrogen batteries to exhibit excellent activity and stability across a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Rechargeable hydrogen batteries exhibit superior electrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in acidic media compared to alkaline counterparts, making them promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the development of efficient electrocatalysts for both HER and HOR in acidic media remains challenging, as conventional platinum&#8208;based catalysts face intrinsic limitations in simultaneously achieving high activity and long&#8208;term stability under harsh operating conditions. Herein, we introduce a bidirectional hydrogen spillover strategy to enable synergistic bifunctional HER/HOR catalysts for hydrogen batteries. We demonstrate a Ru&#8211;WO3 catalyst grown on Cu foam (Ru&#8211;WO3@CF), where the interaction between Ru and WO3 enables dynamic shuttling of adsorbed hydrogen species under alternating potentials. The Ru&#8211;WO3@CF electrode demonstrates exceptional HER/HOR bifunctionality in acidic media (0.5 M H2SO4), achieving an ultralow HER overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and an HOR current density of 21.5 mA cm&#8722;2 at 50 mV &#8212; both significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The hydrogen battery fabricated with Ru&#8211;WO3@CF demonstrates exceptional performance across a wide range of temperatures. This work aims to explore the feasibility of bidirectional hydrogen spillover in enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activities toward HER/HOR, providing new insights for high&#8208;performance hydrogen batteries.

We demonstrate a Ru&#8211;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst grown on Cu foam (Ru&#8211;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@CF), where the interaction between Ru and WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; enables dynamic shuttling of adsorbed hydrogen species under alternating potentials. The Ru&#8211;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@CF electrode demonstrates exceptional HER/HOR bifunctionality in acidic media (0.5 M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), achieving an ultralow HER overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an HOR current density of 21.5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 50 mV &#8212; both significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The hydrogen battery fabricated with Ru&#8211;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@CF demonstrates exceptional performance across a wide range of temperatures. This work aims to explore the feasibility of bidirectional hydrogen spillover in enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activities toward HER/HOR, providing new insights for high-performance hydrogen batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Strategy to Develop Highly Sensitive FAP&#945; Fluorescent Probes for Invasive Cancer Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the construction of fluorescent probe library and the deep analysis of FAP&#945;&#8217;s structure, we proposed and confirmed that introducing a positive charge onto the fluorophore skeleton could markedly improve the response efficiency of FAP&#945; fluorescent probe. By virtue of the high sensitivity of FQCy7 toward FAP&#945;, we achieved significant differentiation between invasive tumors and benign lesions, as well as minimally invasive foci in paracancerous tissues.








Abstract
Fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;) has been reported to be expressed in many carcinoma cells and associated with tumor growth, invasive, and metastasis. However, due to the lack of appropriate fluorescent probes, detecting FAP&#945; with high sensitivity in tumor and clearly delineating tumor margins remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a general design strategy&#8212;introducing a positive charge into the fluorophore skeleton&#8212;for the construction of FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probe with enhanced sensitivity. Molecular docking simulations and fluorescence spectra revealed that the FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probe with positive charges displayed an improved affinity and sensitivity toward FAP&#945;. As demonstration, FQCy7, featuring two positive charges, NIR fluorescence emission, and large Stokes shift, exhibited a satisfactory sensitivity toward FAP&#945; and was used for the relationship study between FAP&#945; and carcinoma cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that FQCy7 is highly useful in distinguishing invasive tumor from benign lesions and evaluating the precise resection of tumor tissues. This work not only reports an original strategy to design FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probes with high sensitivity but also provides a powerful tool for precise tumor detection.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Precise Control of Stacking Configurations in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

A solvent&#8208;assisted precise modulation Zn&#9472;N coordination can control AA and ABC stacking in 2D COFs, enabling enhanced light absorption, charge transport, and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which reveals critical metal&#8208;solvent&#8208;framework interactions and stacking&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property relationships for advanced photocatalysts design.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts due to their high surface areas and precisely tunable physicochemical properties. However, it remains a significant challenge to precisely control over interlayer stacking configurations in 2D COFs, which critically influence charge carrier transport and consequently determine catalytic efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate a solvent&#8208;driven strategy to precisely regulate the interlayer stacking configurations of metal&#8208;incorporated 2D COFs, successfully achieving both AA eclipsed (COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA) and ABC staggered (COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC) configurations. Notably, by modulating the coordination interactions between solvent 1&#8208;butanol and Zn2+ (within the COFs), the interactions between the Zn2+ and nitrogen atoms (from imine bonds, pyridine, and triazine units) can be precisely tuned, which leads to the formation of AA or ABC stacked 2D COFs. Interestingly, the ABC&#8208;stacked COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC exhibited an extended light absorption and superior charge migration/separation efficiency than those of COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA. As a result, when coupled with Pt co&#8208;catalysts, COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC achieved a high hydrogen evolution rate up to 10.92&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, representing a &#8764;3.5&#8208;fold enhancement over COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA (3.12&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work provides a fundamental insight into the stacking&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property relationships in COFs, paving the way for the rational design of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Photocatalytic Co&#8208;Reduction of CO2 and Nitrate over Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Dual Atomic Active Site and Nanostructure Synergy Enhances C&#8211;N Coupling for Urea Production</title>

A bimetallic porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework with nanoflower&#8208;like architecture is synthesized as a high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for urea synthesis. The synergy between dual atomic active sites and nanostructure engineering enables an excellent performance with a urea yield of 2459.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 via photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and nitrate.








Abstract
The photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 (NitRR&amp;CRR) offers a sustainable approach for urea synthesis and environment remediation. However, there is a lack of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Herein, we report a nanoflower&#8208;like bimetallic porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework superstructure (Cu&#8208;TCPP(Co)&#8208;NF, TCPP&#160;=&#160;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) as an efficient NitRR&amp;CRR photocatalyst for urea production. Systematical investigations have revealed that the Cu and Co centers serve as the active sites for driving NitRR and CRR, respectively. The high pore volumes of nanoflower architecture can improve the light adsorption, promote the reactant enrichment, and intermediate generation. Consequently, the C&#8211;N coupling process over Cu&#8208;TCPP(Co)&#8208;NF is facilitated with reduced energy barriers and inhibited side reactions, resulting in an unprecedent urea yield of 2459.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 in the absence of sacrificial agents. This study provides new insights into the design of advanced photocatalysts for urea synthesis.

         <title>Confining the Node Accessibility of Zr&#8208;MOFs Along One&#8208;Dimensional Channels Toward High Water&#8208;Vapor Cycle&#8208;Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A principle for building Zr&#8208;MOFs with high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability by deliberately constructing one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels with limited accessibility of Zr6 nodes to water along channel direction was illustrated. Through either shortening or elongating the core of organic linker horizontally, MOFs with high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability were synthesized. The new resultant Zr&#8208;MOF NJTech&#8208;5 shows one of the highest water uptake amount and working capacity.








Abstract
Zirconium&#8208;based MOFs (Zr&#8208;MOFs) with high hydrolytic stability are promising materials for water&#8208;adsorption&#8208;related applications. However, besides hydrolytic stability, cycling stability is also a crucial feature that renders a MOF a good candidate for water adsorption. Through a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels showing high water cycling stability, a principle of confining the accessibility of Zr6 nodes aligning along channel direction in Zr&#8208;MOFs was unveiled. According to this principle, several topologies that regulates Zr6 nodes with chelating formate aligning in a same plane with a distance less than 5.4&#160;&#197; can successfully hinder the introduction of in&#8208;plane water molecules, thus significantly improve the cycling stability of Zr&#8208;MOFs for water adsorption. Along with this principle, we illustrated a linker designing strategy by horizontal extending the core of organic linkers toward the synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs with similar node alignment. By either intentionally shortening or elongating the core horizontally, both MOFs shows high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability. Among them, NJTech&#8208;5 (NJTech for Nanjing Tech University) with scu&#8208;topology, presents a water uptake capacity of 0.93&#160;g g&#8722;1 and working capacity of 0.82&#160;g g&#8722;1, making it among the top stable MOFs with high water uptake capacity and a promising candidate for indoor humidity control.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zirconium-based MOFs (Zr-MOFs) with high hydrolytic stability are promising materials for water-adsorption-related applications. However, besides hydrolytic stability, cycling stability is also a crucial feature that renders a MOF a good candidate for water adsorption. Through a series of Zr-MOFs with one-dimensional (1D) channels showing high water cycling stability, a principle of confining the accessibility of Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; nodes aligning along channel direction in Zr-MOFs was unveiled. According to this principle, several topologies that regulates Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; nodes with chelating formate aligning in a same plane with a distance less than 5.4&#160;&#197; can successfully hinder the introduction of in-plane water molecules, thus significantly improve the cycling stability of Zr-MOFs for water adsorption. Along with this principle, we illustrated a linker designing strategy by horizontal extending the core of organic linkers toward the synthesis of Zr-MOFs with similar node alignment. By either intentionally shortening or elongating the core horizontally, both MOFs shows high water-vapor cycling stability. Among them, &lt;b&gt;NJTech-5&lt;/b&gt; (NJTech for Nanjing Tech University) with &lt;i&gt;scu&lt;/i&gt;-topology, presents a water uptake capacity of 0.93&#160;g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and working capacity of 0.82&#160;g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, making it among the top stable MOFs with high water uptake capacity and a promising candidate for indoor humidity control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Facile and Scalable &#945;&#8208;Diimine Platform for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Polymerization</title>

         <dc:description>
A versatile post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is employed in the facile, rapid, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of benchmark &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts (20 catalysts). These catalysts show boosted activity (4.4&#160;&#215;&#160;108&#160;g mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), enhanced thermostability (up to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weight, enabling scalable polyethylene production from plastic to elastomer and wax and oil.








Abstract
The structural design and facile synthesis of ligands are crucial for the development of innovative catalysts. Advances have enabled the iterative design of benchmark &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts for the synthesis of polyolefins, which represent the largest class of polymers. In this work, a versatile post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is introduced for the synthesis of a new family of &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts, deviating from the conventional methods. Based on the commercial butanedione ligand backbone that is found in &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts, target groups were introduced into the backbone via a one&#8208;pot substitution reaction. This simple and efficient approach enabled the large&#8208;scale production of the target systems without purification. Using this protocol, 20 new ligands (50&#160;g&#8208;level) and 20 new nickel catalysts were easily and rapidly synthesized. The catalysts demonstrated significant enhancements in their catalytic activities (4.4 &#215; 108&#160;g mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), thermostabilities (from 90 to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weights (8.3&#8208;fold those of polyethylenes produced by the unmodified catalyst) during ethylene polymerization. These improvements are comparable to those achieved through complicated and tedious aniline modifications in pioneering reports, thereby facilitating the kg&#8208;scale synthesis of polyethylenes, varying from semi&#8208;crystalline plastics to thermoplastic elastomers and ultimately to wax&#8208;like and oil&#8208;like products.

         <title>Dienoic&#8208;Acid Coupling Effect Induced Hierarchical Interface for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dienoic acid coupling effect is innovatively proposed to in situ construct HSL on Zn anode by the structural screening of a series of organic&#8208;acid additives. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of dual carboxyl and metastable double bond facilitates the self&#8208;decomposition reaction to form the organic&#8208;rich outer layer and the inorganic&#8208;rich inner layer.








Abstract
Rational pre&#8208;design of self&#8208;decomposed electrolyte additives to construct solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth of zinc (Zn) anode confronts enormous challenges, especially for the in&#8208;depth understanding of structure&#8211;function relationship and the lack of reasonable design criteria. In this work, the dienoic&#8208;acid coupling effect is innovatively proposed to in&#8208;situ construct a hierarchical SEI layer (HSL) through the structural screening of a series of organic&#8208;acid molecules. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of dual carboxyl and metastable double bond can strengthen the self&#8208;decomposition tendency of trace electrolyte additive to form HSL via chemical and electrochemical reaction. HSL can effectively regulate interfacial H2O environment via hydrogen&#8208;bond anchoring to reduce thermodynamically active H2O, facilitate desolvation kinetics, and uniform Zn2+ diffusion, thus significantly suppressing HER and dendrite growth. As a result, Zn anode with HSL can achieve high average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% over 2400 cycles, long&#8208;term cycling stability of 3800&#160;h, and good reversibility under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8211;I2 full battery with HSL displays a long cycling life of 15&#160;000 cycles and successfully powers the portable and wearable instruments. This work opens a novel route to design an advanced interface with fast kinetics by trace electrolyte additive for high&#8208;performance Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Tailoring the Oxygen Vacancy Distribution in Se&#8208;Doped RuOx to Enhance Its Stability in Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of oxygen vacancy (VO) distribution on Ru oxide stability is unclear. We propose a strategy to tailor the distribution of VOs (VOs located away from Se dopants) via urea&#8208;assisted synthesis of Se&#8208;doped RuOx (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx), which optimizes the oxygen evolution mechanism pathway and inhibits Ru dissolution. Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx shows enhanced acidic water oxidation activity and stability (&gt;1000&#160;h@200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), surpassing the Se&#8208;RuOx with VO adjacent to Se.








Abstract
Developing durable ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) remains challenging due to irreversible Ru dissolution and lattice oxygen instability. Although elemental doping is a general method to improve stability, it inadvertently induces oxygen vacancies (VOs), which are randomly distributed in the nanocatalyst. Notably, the impact of VO distribution on the stability of Ru&#8208;based catalysts remains unresolved. Herein, we synthesized the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide via annealing the mixture of ruthenium (III) chloride and selenium (Se) in the air (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx) with the presence of urea, showing the VOs distributed away from Se dopants, which is significantly different from the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide synthesized without urea (Se&#8208;RuOx), showing VOs distributed relatively close to the Se dopants. The Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction performance over Se&#8208;RuOx. Particularly, Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx delivers a low working voltage (1.62&#160;V@1&#160;A cm&#8722;2) and excellent durability (&gt;1000&#160;h@200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in PEMWE tests. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that VOs engage in long&#8208;range cooperation with spatially decoupled Se dopants in Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx, synergistically enhancing reaction kinetics via an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism, while inhibiting the lattice oxygen mechanism and suppressing Ru dissolution, which demonstrates a new strategy to break the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in promising Ru&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Fe Atom to Boost Surface Reaction Kinetics Toward Robust Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomineralization strategy was developed to regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low&#8208;spin configuration to a medium&#8208;spin state, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe&#8208;N4 to Fe&#8208;N3S. This spin state transition of Fe SAs influences its orbital orientation and modulates electronic coupling with adsorbates, directly contributing to the superior activity of Fer&#8208;N&#8208;C@ZIS in PHE.








Abstract
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance over transition metal catalysts is limited by the unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics, which involves the transformation of electronic spin states. In this work, we successfully regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low&#8208;spin configuration (LS) to a medium&#8208;spin state (MS) via a biomineralization strategy, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe&#8208;N4 to Fe&#8208;N3S. This spin state transition of Fe center is able to not only influence the orbital orientation but also modulate the electronic coupling between active sites and the adsorbates, thereby enhancing the kinetic process of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, the spin polarization induced by this unique structure could also improve the utilization efficiency of the carriers by facilitating the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and prolonging their lifetime. All these factors directly contribute to the superior activity of Fer&#8208;N&#8208;C@ZIS (Fer, ferritin; ZIS, ZnIn2S4), which delivers an impressive H2 evolution rate of approximately 31&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a high stability over 25 h of continuous operation.

     alt="Manipulating the Spin State of Fe Atom to Boost Surface Reaction Kinetics Toward Robust Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A biomineralization strategy was developed to regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low-spin configuration to a medium-spin state, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S. This spin state transition of Fe SAs influences its orbital orientation and modulates electronic coupling with adsorbates, directly contributing to the superior activity of Fer-N-C@ZIS in PHE.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance over transition metal catalysts is limited by the unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics, which involves the transformation of electronic spin states. In this work, we successfully regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low-spin configuration (LS) to a medium-spin state (MS) via a biomineralization strategy, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S. This spin state transition of Fe center is able to not only influence the orbital orientation but also modulate the electronic coupling between active sites and the adsorbates, thereby enhancing the kinetic process of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, the spin polarization induced by this unique structure could also improve the utilization efficiency of the carriers by facilitating the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and prolonging their lifetime. All these factors directly contribute to the superior activity of Fer-N-C@ZIS (Fer, ferritin; ZIS, ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which delivers an impressive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of approximately 31&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high stability over 25 h of continuous operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Modular Three&#8208;Component Asymmetric Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reaction Enabled by Cooperative Palladium/Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel three&#8208;component asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) reaction was realized by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid catalysis for the straightforward construction of enantioenriched diversely functionalized allylic compounds from organic feedstocks of aldehydes, allylboronates, and nucleophiles. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three&#8208;component reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. Finally, the protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids.








Abstract
Asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) reactions, named as the Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction, stand as a landmark in modern organic synthesis. The merge of AAS reactions with the concept of multicomponent modular synthesis could allow flexible customization of molecular architectures from fundamental feedstocks, which remains underdeveloped. Herein, we disclose our recent observations on a novel three&#8208;component asymmetric Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction enabled by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid (LA) catalysis. This &#8216;1C&#160;+&#160;2C&#160;+&#160;NuH&#8217; approach starts from fundamental organic feedstocks, i.e., aldehyde, allylboronate, and a nucleophile with the in situ formation of a C&#9552;C double bond. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three&#8208;component AAS reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. The protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids. Mechanistic studies suggest that the three&#8208;component AAS approach proceeds via a reaction sequence of LA&#8208;catalyzed allylation of aldehyde, olefin shift under palladium catalysis, and Pd/LA&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Irradiated Polarized Emission in Mn(II) Bromide Hybrids with Chain&#8208;Like Alignment of Halopyridine and Polar MnBr42&#8722; Units</title>

[3&#8208;IPy]3[MnBr3][MnBr4] exhibits quasi&#8208;1D chain structure with antiparallel electric dipole alignment, and the corresponding X&#8208;ray&#8208;irradiated polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Mn(II) halide hybrid crystals possess exceptional emission properties and pronounced anisotropic optoelectronic characteristics, making them highly promising for diverse applications. In this study, we present five structurally distinct Mn(II) hybrids, which either form the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains or a hybrid structure combining both 1D [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains and a quasi&#8208;1D chains. These quasi&#8208;1D chains are composed of polar MnBr42&#8722; tetrahedra and halogen&#8208;substituted pyridine ligands. Of particular interest is the mixed&#8208;polyhedral compound [3&#8208;IPy]3[MnBr3][MnBr4]. It exhibits dominant antiparallel alignment of dipole moment between quasi&#8208;1D chains, while 1D [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains display zero dipole moment. The highly&#8208;distorted MnBr42&#8722; tetrahedra owing to strong hydrogen bonding with halopyridine introduces large inherent structural anisotropy. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, it gives rise to a pronounced and fascinating polarization&#8208;sensitive emission. These findings underscore the promising potential of mixed&#8208;polyhedral Mn(II) halide hybrids in polarized photonic applications and provide valuable insights for the rational design of polarization&#8208;sensitive functional materials.

&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral macrocycles with reversible photoregulatable chiroptics (|gabs|: 0.023&#8596;0.014; CPL ON/OFF) and cave sizes (e.g., 25.8&#160;&#215;&#160;19.8&#160;&#197; &#8596; 22.6&#160;&#215;&#160;18.3&#160;&#197;) were firstly synthesized, which do not exist in previously documented &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles. Continuous chirality amplification was realized, giving high dissymmetry factors (|gabs| = 0.023, |glum| = 0.013). A size&#8208;photoswitching correlation was revealed innovatively.








Abstract
Chiral macrocycles have attracted considerable attention because of their fascinating circular chiral topologies, circularly distributed electronic structures, and excellent chiroptical features. However, the challenging synthesis and limited cases hinder the understanding, improvement, and regulation of their optoelectronic properties. To avoid this dilemma, we employed cyclic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between dithienylethene (DTE) and [6]helicene to firstly synthesize donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles, including m&#8208;[1&#160;+&#160;1], m&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2], and m&#8208;[3&#160;+&#160;3], where these compounds displayed photocontrollable ring sizes and chiroptical properties. More importantly, continuous amplification in chirality can be achieved via distinctive multiple chiral&#8208;centers&#8208;bonding in series within helical rings, giving high |gabs| and |glum| of up to 0.023 and 0.013, respectively. The macrocycles were endowed with a photoswitchable function that is absent in previously documented &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles. Both the cavity sizes and chiroptical properties could be photoregulated. As typical examples, the cavity dimension of m&#8208;[3&#160;+&#160;3]&#8208;PPP was photoadjusted from 25.8&#160;&#215;&#160;19.8 to 22.6&#160;&#215;&#160;18.3&#160;&#197;, accompanied by reversible photoswitched |gabs| between 0.023 and 0.014 and remarkable CPL ON/OFF behavior. Moreover, a size&#8208;photoswitching correlation was revealed innovatively, i.e., the photoswitching ability increased with increasing ring size. Our study provides a new guidance for developing high&#8208;performance chiral systems and novel stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral macrocycles and provides ideal platforms for understanding chiral structure&#8211;functionality relationships.

         <title>Convenient Production of Photothermal Recycling Phosphorescent Materials from Cellulose and Lignin</title>

         <dc:description>
The formation of RTP films (Cell&#8208;Lig) from ionic liquid (1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, [Bmim]Cl) solutions of cellulose and lignin was achieved within 1 s through ethanol&#8208;induced phase transition. Specifically, Cell&#8208;Lig can be readily recycled through light&#8208;controlled phase transitions, and the initial RTP performance was maintained over six cycles of recycling.








Abstract
Developing recyclable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) films using ultrafast fabrication techniques remains a critical yet challenging objective. With this research, we developed an RTP film (Cell&#8208;Lig) through ethanol&#8208;induced phase transition, achieving solid film formation within 1 s from ionic liquid (1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, [Bmim]Cl) solutions of cellulose and lignin. The phase transition also generated a confined rigid environment for Cell&#8208;Lig, activating thickness&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent green RTP emission from the incorporated lignin. Furthermore, red afterglow emission using an energy transfer mechanism was realized by incorporating rhodamine B (RhB). The inherent photothermal activity of lignin endowed Cell&#8208;Lig with easy recyclability using light&#8208;controlled phase transitions. Under irradiation, photothermal evaporation of residual ethanol triggered liquefaction (solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition), while ethanol reintroduction facilitated instantaneous hardening. Remarkably, the initial RTP performance was maintained over six recycling cycles. Capitalizing on these attributes, Cell&#8208;Lig was successfully used for advanced coating and security applications.

         <title>Low Symmetry Cage Complexes Formed by Metalation of Symmetric Hexa&#8208;Cationic Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threefold symmetric hexa&#8208;cationic hydrazone cages coordinate a range of transition metal ions upon deprotonation. When the cage contains ethyl solubilising groups the expected threefold symmetric cage complexes are observed, however when the cage contains alkoxy solubilising groups persistent low symmetry cage complexes form.








Abstract
Most metal organic cages are assembled through metal&#8211;ligand coordination, resulting in cages where the metal ions are part of the cage architecture, and thus have limited reactivity. There are only a handful of metal organic cages produced by metalation of a pre&#8208;synthesised organic cage. In this work, we show that hexa&#8208;cationic hydrazone cages coordinate a range of transition metal ions upon deprotonation to give cage complexes with metal ions oriented towards the cage cavity. Remarkably, a cage with ethyl solubilising groups gives the expected three&#8208;fold symmetric metallocage, cages with alkoxy solubilising groups give low&#8208;symmetry zinc metallocages, and a cage without a solubilising group switches between high and low symmetry conformations depending on solvent. These low symmetry arrangements persist on the NMR timescale at temperatures as high as 360&#160;K and in the presence of a wide range of anions.

         <title>Dynamic Molecular Triplet Excitons Tune Lanthanide Emission Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Eu3+&#8208;(or Tb3+&#8208;)&#8208;incorporated Lu3+ molecular crystals were prepared for the demonstration of the emission lifetime tuning method using slow triplet exciton migration. The lanthanide emission lifetimes were drastically extended (&#964;max = 152&#160;ms) by controlling the molar ratios of Eu3+ (or Tb3+) and modifying the ligand structures.








Abstract
Optical codes generated from the emission lifetimes of lanthanide complexes have received considerable attention for their potential application in multiplexed bioimaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, such tunable lifetimes are limited to short ranges (0.01&#8722;1&#160;ms). Herein, we describe a method that extends the emission lifetime using dynamic molecular triplet excitons in aggregation systems composed of lanthanide complexes. To demonstrate the conceptual method, molecular crystals comprising lutetium (Lu3+) and luminescent lanthanide (europium: Eu3+ or terbium: Tb3+) complexes with two organic ligands (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;heptanedionate and 2,7&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)phenanthrene) were prepared. These molecular crystals exhibited persistent emission via slow triplet exciton migration between the phenanthrene units. The extended degree of the lifetime could be controlled between 1 and 152&#160;ms by ligand modifications. This proposed lifetime&#8208;tuning method should significantly expand the encoding capacity of lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Optical Force Monitoring in Polymeric Materials with a Coumarin&#8208;Based Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin dyes are reacted with acrylates to form a mechanophore via an accessible two&#8208;step synthesis that exhibits exclusive responsivity to force. Mechanical deformation of polymeric materials functionalized with the mechanophore activates blue fluorescence visible to the naked eye, enabling the optical detection of force&#8208;induced molecular damage in the material.








Abstract
Optical mechanophores offer a powerful platform for the real&#8208;time, nondestructive detection of mechanically induced damage in polymers. However, the exploitation of mechanophores for fundamental investigations of deformation processes and the prediction of failure in technologically critical applications has been constrained by their responsivity to other stimuli, laborious synthesis, and limited control of their photophysical and mechanical properties. Here, we report a cyclobutane&#8208;based mechanophore that activates a fluorescent coumarin dye through the application of mechanical stress in solution and in the solid state. We demonstrate the preparation of the mechanophore in two synthetic steps, its incorporation into linear and crosslinked polymers, and its thermal and photochemical stability, establishing the basis for a new class of mechanophores with tunable spectral and mechanical characteristics.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Box[6]arenes for 3D Charge&#8208;Transfer Co&#8208;Crystal Engineering via Macrocyclic Self&#8208;Complementary and Exo&#8208;Wall Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Box[6]arene (B[6]A), a new kind of macrocyclic arene with flexible skeleton and bright fluorescence, has been designed and synthesized. Through the macrocyclic self&#8208;complementarity and &#8220;exo&#8208;wall&#8221; CT interactions, three 3D supramolecular assemblies are formed with the electron&#8208;deficient planar molecules TCNB, TFTN, and TClTN, showing tunable fluorescence and selective vapochromic behaviors toward picoline isomers.








Abstract
The construction of well&#8208;defined 3D charge&#8208;transfer (CT) co&#8208;crystals using new macrocyclic hosts to enable programmable functionality remains challenging due to the dimensional constraints imposed by conventional assembly strategies. Herein, we address this limitation using a new synthetic macrocycle named box[6]arene (B[6]A) with a flexible skeleton, which adopts two distinct conformations (B[6]A&#945; and B[6]A&#946;). Crucially, the self&#8208;complementary and exo&#8208;wall CT co&#8208;assembly of B[6]A facilitates the construction of 3D macrocycle&#8208;based co&#8208;crystals (MCCs) with planar electron&#8208;deficient guests, including 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB), tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFTN), and tetrachloroterephthalonitrile (TClTN). These MCCs exhibit tunable fluorescence with emission maxima at 690, 594, and 592&#160;nm, respectively. Notably, activated B[6]A&#8208;TCNB demonstrates selective vapochromic behaviors toward picoline isomers via a dual response mechanism. This study provides new insights into the design of functional macrocyclic arenes and 3D MCCs, paving the way for the development of color&#8208;tunable crystalline luminescent materials and advanced vapochromic systems.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Homogeneous Heterobimetallic&#8208;Oxide Interfaces Enable Synergistic Hydrogen Evolution Passivation for Durable Acidic Zn&#8211;Mn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

An innovative multi&#8208;cation synergistic modulation strategy enables self&#8208;assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces on Zn anodes. The design ingeniously blends the hydrolysis of SnCl4 and the replacement reaction of In3+ and Cu2+ ions with Zn metal to spontaneously generate the heterobimetallic In&#8211;CuZn5 and the oxide SnO2. Heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn&#8208;ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance and the abundant nucleation sites in acidic media. 








Abstract
Acidic Zn&#8211;Mn batteries hold promising prospects in large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their higher discharge voltage and capacity. However, the challenge of developing long&#8208;term acidic Zn&#8211;Mn batteries still remains due to Zn anode instability in acidic media arising from the inevitable proton corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report self&#8208;assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces on the Zn anode surface via a multi&#8208;cation (Cu2+, In3+, and Sn4+) synergistic regulation strategy to achieve &gt;85.5% depth of discharge with over 1000&#160;h of cycling in strongly acidic medium (pH&#160;=&#160;0.9). The design ingeniously blends the SnCl4 hydrolysis and In3+ and Cu2+ ions replacement with Zn metal to spontaneously generate heterobimetallic In&#8211;CuZn5 and SnO2 oxide. Heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn&#8208;ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance of SnO2 and the abundant nucleation sites of heterobimetallic. Crucially, the in situ hydrolysis of SnCl4 establishes a self&#8208;regulated acidic environment without additional acidic medium. Consequently, Zn&#8211;Mn pouch battery within this acidic environment delivers a high capacity of 1.39 mAh cm&#8722;2 and retains 84.9% of initial capacity after 200 cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This direct multi&#8208;cation synergistic modulated self&#8208;assembly interface strategy holds significant potential for expediting the advancement of high&#8208;safety, large&#8208;scale energy storage technology.

         <title>Highly Flexible Porous Aromatic Frameworks with Exceptional Adsorption Capacity Toward Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a synthetic strategy for flexible porous aromatic frameworks (FPAFs). By Yamamoto&#8208;type copolymerization of a rigid tetrahedral monomer (tetrakis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methane) and a flexible counterpart (tetrakis[(4&#8208;bromophenoxy)methyl]methane), we synthesized a series of flexible PAFs (FPAF&#8208;x, x = 0&#8211;2) with tunable flexibility. Both thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamic volatile organic compound (VOC) vapor adsorption studies showed that FPAFs achieved unprecedented VOC adsorption efficiency, establishing flexibility engineering as a principle for the design of next&#8208;generation adsorbents.








Abstract
In this work we report a novel strategy to enhance the adsorption capacity of conventional porous materials by engineering intrinsic framework flexibility into porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). Through Yamamoto&#8208;type copolymerization of a rigid tetrahedral monomer (tetrakis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methane) and a flexible counterpart (tetrakis[(4&#8208;bromophenoxy)methyl]methane), we synthesized a series of flexible PAFs (FPAF&#8208;x, x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;2) with tunable flexibility. FPAF&#8208;0.5 with moderate flexibility and surface area (854&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) achieves exceptionally high volatile organic compound (VOC) adsorption capacities for various VOCs (e.g., 410.7&#160;wt% for THF and 339.4&#160;wt% for 3&#8208;methylthiophene), outperforming many other porous materials reported to date. Both thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamics VOC vapor adsorption studies reveal that optimal flexibility enables guest&#8208;adaptive structural transformation, allowing pore expansion to accommodate additional VOC molecules after initial pore filling. Moreover, polar and aromatic VOCs induce greater framework expansion than nonpolar analogues, which can also enhance the VOC uptake capacity in FPAFs. This work establishes flexibility engineering as a design principle for next&#8208;generation adsorbents, improving the efficiency of VOC adsorption.

         <title>Balancing Solvation Ability of Polymer and Solvent in Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Efficient Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tailing the solvation ability of both polymer and solvent, this work establishes a correlation between Li+ coordination, ion transport, and interphase formation in gel electrolytes. A combination of weakly coordinated polymer and lower donor number (DN) solvent enables the gel electrolyte to achieve fast ion hopping and form a robust interphase for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) show practical potential in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but their development is hindered by insufficient understanding of Li+ solvation chemistry and its impact on ion transport and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. By regulating the solvation abilities of polymer and solvent, this work explores the relationships between GPE composition, Li+ coordination structures, Li+ transference number, and interphase chemistry. The GPE combining weakly coordinated solvents with strongly coordinating polymer results in strong Li+&#8208;polymer attachment, leading to sluggish ion transport. Employing strongly chelating solvents causes complete Li+&#8208;polymer detachment, forming micelle structures that obstruct ion transport. The GPE with both weakly coordinated solvent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)&#160;and polymer 1H,1H,2H,2H&#8208;tridecafluoro&#8208;n&#8208;octyl acrylate (TFOA) enables optimal interactions between Li+ and polymer/solvent, facilitating partial Li+&#8208;polymer detachment and aggregates (AGGs) generation, avoiding micelle formation. This promotes efficient Li+ transport and anion&#8208;derived SEI generation. The resulting GPE achieves 99.2% Coulombic efficiency (CE) in Cu||Li cells and enables 4.5&#160;V LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||Li to demonstrate 81% capacity retention after 140 cycles. These findings provide valuable insights for further advanced GPE design.

         <title>Regioselective Separation and Extraction of Polyalkylthiophene by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

We report a novel MOF&#8208;based method for extracting high&#8208;regioregularity poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from crude mixtures. Nanopore threading&#8208;based adsorption enables recognition of erroneous head&#8211;head linkages, allowing precise isolation of regioregular P3HT. Both chromatography and batch processes demonstrate regioregularity&#8208;dependent sorting, introducing a new paradigm in polymer purification.








Abstract
Here, we report a novel method for selectively extracting high&#8208;regioregularity (RR) poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from crude mixtures using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as nanoporous separation media. This approach leverages a kinetically driven &#8220;threading&#8221; mechanism in one&#8208;dimensional MOF channels, which discriminate subtle differences in the bonding patterns, e.g., head&#8208;head and head&#8208;tail linkages, in the main chain. By employing both MOF column chromatography and batch&#8208;scale separation techniques, higher RR fractions of P3HT were readily extracted from a crude mixture containing lower RR fractions.

         <title>Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation Strategy Enables Rapid Discovery of Potent CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 Interaction Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a novel protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors design strategy named &#8220;Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation (FOLP)&#8221;. Known high&#8208;affinity binders serve as the &#8220;Fulcrum&#8221; by binding to the orthosteric pocket, while suitable moieties extend into allosteric sites near the PPI interface as &#8220;Leverage&#8221;. As a proof of concept, the potent PPI inhibitor LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 was discovered for inhibiting the interaction of CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2.








Abstract
Traditional strategies for developing small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) are time&#8208;consuming and often yield low success rates due to the flat and dynamic interfaces of PPIs. To enable the rapid design of highly potent PPI inhibitors, we proposed a novel strategy named &#8220;Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation (FOLP)&#8221;. In this strategy, high&#8208;affinity fragments serve as the &#8220;Fulcrum&#8221; by binding to the orthosteric pocket, while suitable moieties extend into allosteric sites near the PPI interface as &#8220;Leverage&#8221; to modulate the protein&#8211;protein interaction. As a proof of concept, the potent CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 PPI inhibitor LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3, which fits the &#8220;FOLP&#8221; paradigm, was discovered with an IC50 of 32.1&#160;nM for inhibiting the interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations and cryptic pocket identification were employed, revealing the activation loop (A&#8208;loop) of CDK2 was flexible and targetable. X&#8208;ray crystallography and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX&#8208;MS) analysis showed that LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 indeed bound to and stabilized the A&#8208;loop. LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 effectively inhibited the CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 interaction in CDK2 highly expressed melanoma cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibition of CDK2 mediated signaling. In conclusion, the &#8220;FOLP&#8221; strategy offers a novel approach for PPI inhibitor discovery and could accelerate the development of PPI inhibitors.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanohydrogel&#8208;Based Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Nanozyme for Photocatalytic Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework nanohydrogel (Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG) was prepared by in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on Zn&#8208;porphyrin COF. Compared to bulk COF, it exhibits enhanced oxidase&#8208;like activity and 1O2 generation under visible light irradiation, synergistically boosting bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) via homogeneous catalysis and PNIPAM&#8208;mediated bacterial adhesion, which further accelerates wound disinfection and healing.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble nanozymes have the potential to overcome the limitations of low catalytic efficiency of most heterogeneous nanozymes in aqueous solutions and further expand their applications in the biomedical field, but with significant synthetic challenges. Here we report an oxidase&#8208;mimicking water&#8208;soluble nanozyme based on zinc porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework nanohydrogel (Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG) for photocatalytic antibacterial. The in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on scaffold of Zn&#8208;COF results in the exfoliation of crystalline COF nanosheets and assembly into nanohydrogels in aqueous solution. The obtained Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG can effectively mimic photoresponsive oxidase&#8208;like activity for the chromogenic catalysis of 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by facilitating homogeneous behavior to enhance catalytic efficiency, while also exhibiting intelligent temperature&#8208;response regulation of catalytic oxidation activity. Moreover, the high photodynamic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reinforcement of binding to the exterior of bacteria through noncovalent interactions concurrently boost its bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) by amplifying oxidative stress. In vivo study on S. aureus&#8208;infected murine model further substantiates the superior wound disinfection and healing effect of Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG. Our work paves a way for the utilization of COF nanohydrogel as a potent antibacterial nanozyme agent and provides a novel platform for the development of biomedical applications.

         <title>Rapid and Modular Access to All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Center&#8208;Containing 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes via Cyanocarbene Addition to Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>

Described is a rare example of single&#8208;carbon insertion into the C&#9472;C bond of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) using diazo&#8208;free donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) carbenes, which are generated in situ through reactions of ethynyl hypervalent iodine reagents with azides. This method is used for the synthesis of bridge&#8208;functionalized bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs), including BCP&#8208;Sonidegib, which exhibits superior antitumor activity compared to the anticancer drug Sonidegib.








Abstract
While 1,3&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have garnered considerable interest in medicinal chemistry as bioisosteres of para&#8208;substituted benzenes, the utilization of bridge&#8208;functionalized BCPs, especially those containing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers at the bridge&#8208;positions, in drug design has lagged behind. This is primarily due to the synthetic challenges associated with these scaffolds. Herein, we report the insertion of diazo&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor carbenes into the C&#9472;C bond of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs), enabling the rapid and modular synthesis of 1,2,2,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) bearing three all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers in up to 83% yield. This transformation is metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, operationally simple, and accomodates to a wide range of substrates. The decoration of bioactive molecules with 2,2&#8208;disubstituted BCP exhibits superior antitumor activity compared to the anticancer drug Sonidegib, rendering this method highly practical and appealing. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with control experiments reveal that the reaction proceeds through a stepwise nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening/recyclization pathway, involving the reaction between the singlet carbene species and the BCB skeleton.

         <title>A Photon&#8208;Driven Unimolecular Immunostimulant for Self&#8208;Amplified Pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway by Destroying the Pyroptosis Checkpoint</title>

The proposed Bio&#8208;Cy conjugate emerges as an avant&#8208;garde molecular entity, adeptly activating the pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to heighten the cytocidal impact of photon&#8208;driven immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is a groundbreaking approach for clinically treating tumors, but its effectiveness is hindered by the tumor's immunosuppressive environment and lack of immune cell infiltration, enabling tumors to evade the immune system. Although the activation of both innate and adaptive immunities is a promising strategy to counteract this bottleneck, their synergy remains challenging. Therefore, we developed Bio&#8208;Cy, an unprecedented organic unimolecular photosensitive immunostimulant, which stimulates self&#8208;amplifying pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to enhance adaptive and innate immunity activation. Mechanistic studies have shown that Bio&#8208;Cy can target cancer cells and be transported to lysosomes via endocytosis, generating reactive oxygen species through a Type I photodynamic mechanism to destroy cancer cells, even under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, this lysosomal disruption not only activates the caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;dependent pyroptosis of adaptive immunity through mitochondrial damage by releasing Ca2+, but also enhances the cGAS&#8208;STING innate immune pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA. More importantly, the initial lysosomal damage impairs protective cellular autophagy, destroying the pyroptosis checkpoint and thus preventing the clearance of damaged mitochondria and amplifying immune responses, ultimately boosting immunotherapy. This strategy effectively treats primary tumors and inhibits metastatic growth, offering a new paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.

Therefore, we developed &lt;b&gt;Bio-Cy&lt;/b&gt;, an unprecedented organic unimolecular photosensitive immunostimulant, which stimulates self-amplifying pyroptosis and cGAS-STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to enhance adaptive and innate immunity activation. Mechanistic studies have shown that &lt;b&gt;Bio-Cy&lt;/b&gt; can target cancer cells and be transported to lysosomes via endocytosis, generating reactive oxygen species through a Type I photodynamic mechanism to destroy cancer cells, even under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, this lysosomal disruption not only activates the caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis of adaptive immunity through mitochondrial damage by releasing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, but also enhances the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA. More importantly, the initial lysosomal damage impairs protective cellular autophagy, destroying the pyroptosis checkpoint and thus preventing the clearance of damaged mitochondria and amplifying immune responses, ultimately boosting immunotherapy. This strategy effectively treats primary tumors and inhibits metastatic growth, offering a new paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Umpolung Activation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;catalyzed umpolung of bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) aldehydes enables nucleophilic cycloaddition with carbonyls and imines to form bicyclic lactones and lactams. The resulting oxa&#8208; and aza&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane products can be further transformed into valuable rigid 3D scaffolds, offering a simple and versatile approach to access new chemical space with potential applications in medicinal chemistry. 








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) has predominantly been explored as an electrophile or radical acceptor owing to its inherent polarity. However, its reactivity as a nucleophile remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report an umpolung strategy that reverses the innate polarity of bicyclobutane aldehydes via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This transformation enables the construction of novel rigidified lactones and lactams via coupling with diverse electrophilic partners, including aldehydes, ketones, and imines. The synthetic versatility of this method highlights its potential for applications in medicinal chemistry by providing new building blocks with defined exit vectors.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Engineered Lanthanide Nanocrystals with Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;IIb Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the lattices from distorted to strain&#8208;graded in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) via controllable cation intermixing (Ca2+, Ln3+), the multi&#8208;phonon orbit&#8208;lattice relaxation (MPR) between the host lattice and the lanthanide emitters can be regulated. This enables tunable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) lifetime, which is beneficial for time&#8208;resolved multiplexed bioimaging.








Abstract
Lattice engineering in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) is fundamental for tailoring their versatile optical properties, yet it remains underexplored in manipulating the downconversion characteristics. Here, we engineer the lattices from distorted to strain&#8208;graded in LnNCs by CaF2 deposition on vacancy&#8208;controlled &#946;&#8208;NaxGdF3+x:Yb,A (A = Tm/Er, x = 0.5, 0.75, 1) NCs. We demonstrate that strain&#8208;graded lattices with high phonon energy enhance the multi&#8208;phonon orbit&#8208;lattice relaxation (MPR) in the downconversion process more effectively than distorted lattices, which helps to extend the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb, 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm) lifetime of Er3+/Tm3+ by 2&#8764;4 times. Subsequent epitaxial CaF2 growth further attenuates surface phonon coupling, enabling exponential tunability of NIR&#8208;IIb lifetime (Tm3+: 0.74&#8764;6.28&#160;ms; Er3+: 0.055&#8764;9.2&#160;ms). Finally, we showcase the potential of these LnNCs in time&#8208;resolved multiplexed bioimaging.

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis from Plastic Waste and Ammonia via C&#9472;N Bond Construction Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative photocatalytic strategy was reported for sustainable formamide (FA) synthesis via C&#9472;N bond construction from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste. Specifically, Pt1Au/TiO2 catalyst achieves a FA yield rate of &#8764;7.1&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 alongside concurrent H2 evolution (&#8764;22.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal that single&#8208;atom Pt and Au nanoparticles synergize charge separation, facilitating radical&#8208;mediated photocatalytic redox efficiency. 








Abstract
Photocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into value&#8208;added chemicals represents a sustainable route for plastic valorization. However, previous studies have solely focused on generating oxygenated compounds through intramolecular C&#9472;O bond transformations. Achieving heteroatom&#8208;containing important chemicals via intermolecular coupling reactions is still challenging. Herein, we report the first example of the direct photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) with ammonia to produce formamide (FA) and H2 over a Pt1Au/TiO2 catalyst. Pt1Au/TiO2 delivers a FA yield rate of &#8764;7.1&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, as well as H2 evolution (&#8764;22.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Photoelectrochemical analyses, including time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reveal that monatomic Pt sites can effectively trap electrons, while Au nanoparticles act as hole sinks, thereby synergistically enhancing charge separation efficiency. Mechanistic investigations via in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) elucidate the reaction pathway: EG undergoes hole&#8208;mediated oxidation to yield an aldehyde intermediate, which is subsequently attacked nucleophilically by hole&#8208;derived &#8226;NH2, inducing sequential C&#9472;C bond cleavage and C&#9472;N bond formation. This work provides critical mechanistic insights for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value heteroatom&#8208;containing chemicals from plastic waste.

         <title>Accessing Metal&#8208;Containing Species in Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Precursor Solutions via Molecular Strategies Guided by the Hard&#8211;Soft Acid&#8211;Base Principle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strategies guided by the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base (HSAB) principle enable precise control over metal&#8208;based species in perovskite precursor solutions. This approach enhances the quality of narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.26&#160;eV) mixed tin&#8211;lead perovskite films and improves the performance of the resulting solar cell devices.








Abstract
The properties of metal&#8208;centred species in metal halide perovskite precursor solutions substantially influence the formation and evolution of colloidal particles, which in turn dictate the crystallisation process and the film quality. In this work, we assess the &#8220;hard&#8221; and &#8220;soft&#8221; Lewis acid characteristics of Sn2+ and Pb2+ cations as a strategy to modulate the chemical environment of these metal&#8208;containing species in mixed&#8208;metal tin&#8211;lead perovskite precursor solutions. We observe enhanced simultaneous access to both metal centres upon adding compounds with functional groups suggested by the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principle. Theoretical calculations suggest that the hard base carboxyl group preferentially interacts with Sn2+&#8208;based species, while the softer base thiol group also targets Pb2+&#8208;based species. By effectively accessing and manipulating possible classes of inorganic species and their colloidal particle properties in the precursor solutions, we achieve 1.26 eV perovskite polycrystalline films exhibiting enhanced structural and optoelectronic quality, giving the best quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting values of up to 0.95&#160;eV. As a result, the solar cell devices demonstrate efficiency values of up to 23.3% with an extended operational lifetime, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after over 280 and 180&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 25 and 65 &#176;C, respectively.

Theoretical calculations suggest that the hard base carboxyl group preferentially interacts with Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based species, while the softer base thiol group also targets Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based species. By effectively accessing and manipulating possible classes of inorganic species and their colloidal particle properties in the precursor solutions, we achieve 1.26 eV perovskite polycrystalline films exhibiting enhanced structural and optoelectronic quality, giving the best quasi-Fermi level splitting values of up to 0.95&#160;eV. As a result, the solar cell devices demonstrate efficiency values of up to 23.3% with an extended operational lifetime, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after over 280 and 180&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 25 and 65 &#176;C, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin Frustration Determines the Stability and Reactivity of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Triangular Iron(III)&#8211;Oxo Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Standard DFT fails to capture the spin&#8208;frustrated ground state of triangular Fe(III) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to distorted geometries and incorrect binding predictions. Using flip&#8208;spin DFT, we identify the true ground state of MIL&#8208;101(Fe) and show how magnetic frustration governs temperature&#8208;dependent N2${\rm N}_{2}$ and CO binding, underscoring the need to treat spin effects accurately.








Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) is the standard approach for modeling MIL&#8208;101(Fe) and related Fe&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks, typically assuming a ferromagnetic high&#8208;spin configuration. However, this widely adopted approach overlooks a key electronic feature: Spin frustration in the triangular Fe3(&#956;3${\rm Fe}_{3}(\mu _{3}$&#8208;O) nodes. Using flip&#8208;spin, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT, we identify the true ground state as an antiferromagnetic 2S+1=6$2S+1=6$ state that standard DFT fails to capture. We demonstrate that neglecting spin frustration in MIL&#8208;101(Fe) leads to structural distortions, incorrect energetics, and misleading predictions of stability and reactivity. By explicitly accounting for spin frustration, we recover the correct structure and rationalize the temperature&#8208;dependent N2${\rm N}_{2}$ and CO binding. Spin frustration enhances N2${\rm N}_{2}$ fixation at room temperature, while its loss upon partial FeIII${\rm Fe}^{\mathrm {III}}$ reduction suppresses this activity but promotes CO adsorption via &#960;$\pi$&#8208;backbonding. These findings challenge current computational conventions and highlight spin frustration as a critical electronic feature in these&#160;frameworks.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Nonalternant Nanoribbons with up to 29 Linearly&#8208;Fused Rings and High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three triptycene end&#8208;capped N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons with precise length are prepared through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits. The longest one comprises a 29&#8208;linearly&#8208;fused&#8208;ring backbone, setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the reported soluble nonalternant nanoribbons. Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy measurements indicate high intrinsic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities in these nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, one of the highest values reported for graphene nanoribbons and the highest observed to date for non&#8208;alternant ones.








Abstract
The synthesis of nonalternant graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)&#8212;carbon&#8208;based nanostructures featuring fused pentagonal or heptagonal rings that disrupt hexagonal symmetry&#8212;has remained a significant challenge despite their unique electronic properties, such as tunable bandgaps and topological states. Unlike conventional alternant hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene&#8208;derived systems), nonalternant architectures exhibit distinct electron confinement effects, making them promising for nanoscale optoelectronics and quantum materials. However, achieving precise control over their length, solubility, and structural regularity has had limited progress. Herein, we report a versatile solution&#8208;phase synthesis of a novel family of structurally precise N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons (NRs: NR&#8208;11 to NR&#8208;29) through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits terminated with triptycene end&#8208;caps. The longest one comprises 29 linearly fused rings (particularly including 10 pentagonal rings), setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the soluble nonalternant NRs reported to date. Strategic incorporation of triptycene end&#8208;caps and alkoxyphenyl substituents into their molecular backbones confers high solubility and a unique 3D configuration, enabling comprehensive solution&#8208;phase structural characterization and systematic investigation of length&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. Employing terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we infer high intrinsic charge carrier mobilities in nonalternant nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, highlighting this novel family of nanoribbons as promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications.

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Triangular Pore in Single&#8208;Layer Hexagonal Boron Nitride Membrane for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes that uniquely contain triangular nanopores with a high density (around 1012 pores&#160;per&#160;cm2) are reported. They demonstrate ultrahigh H2 permeance and CO2 permeance as well as good H2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivities, providing a new membrane platform for achieving efficient molecular sieving and understanding nanopore transport. 








Abstract
Single&#8208;layer crystalline films are ideal separation membrane materials because their atomic thickness could yield the highest possible molecular flux once nanopores are generated. However, the development of single&#8208;layer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore structures remains elusive, which makes the realization of efficient molecular sieving and interpretation of molecular transport a difficult task. Herein, we report the fabrication of single&#8208;layer nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes that uniquely contain triangular nanopores with a high density (around 1012&#160;pores&#160;per&#160;cm2). The hBN membranes exhibit a H2 permeance of 5.43&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1&#160;Pa&#8722;1 with a H2/CH4 selectivity of 14.7; they also show a CO2 permeance of 1.37&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1&#160;Pa&#8722;1, with a CO2/N2 selectivity of 12.3. Importantly, we show that straightforward mathematical modeling can predict and describe the gas transport properties of the hBN, providing new insights into the molecular transport across atomically thin nanopores. The results gained from this study could significantly advance our understanding of molecular transport across hBN nanopores and may promote the development of hBN membranes to address critical separation issues.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition of furan ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes is presented. The reaction proceeds in good yields and with high enantioselectivities allowing for the formation of novel classes of cyclooctanoids. DFT calculations point to an intriguing mechanism, where the stereochemical outcome is attributed to protonation of the catalyst&#8208;bound intermediate in the stereo&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
The enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition for the construction of cyclooctanoids is a challenging transformation in organic chemistry. Herein, we present the first organocatalytic enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition of furan ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes, activated by dearomatization of the heteroaromatic compound, which thereby allows for the cycloaddition with dienes. The [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition is catalyzed by a quinine&#8208;derived primary amine in combination with a chiral phosphoric acid and a carboxylic acid affording cyclooctanoids isolated as a single diastereoisomer in good yields and with up to 94% ee. This reaction concept allows for the formation of cyclooctanoids without benzofusion, as demonstrated by oxidative opening of the furan ring. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism for the [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition point to a stepwise process. Surprisingly, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction is attributed to protonation of the two organocatalyst&#8208;bound cyclooctanoid intermediates leading to a preferred set&#8208;up for catalyst elimination to account for the absolute configuration of the cyclooctanoid.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fused Conjugated Alkylfluorene Bridged Naphthalimides Cathode Interlayer Enables Low&#8208;Noise Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work delivers a universal design strategy of a novel nonfused conjugated small molecule, namely FNA, serving as CILs to realize highly sensitive NIR photodetectors. The FNA&#8208;based OPDs exhibit enhanced interfacial contact and augmented photoresponse, achieving a notably low dark current and high specific detectivity, outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as the CIL. This innovative approach offers profound insights into the development of high&#8208;performance photodetectors.








Abstract
The cathode interface layers (CILs) play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of organic photodiodes (OPDs). However, the poor film formation, the tendency of orientation and aggregation, and contact in the interface of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)/CILs/electrode increase the dark current, leading to a limitation of light detection. In this study, we designed and synthesized a nonfused conjugated small molecule (FNA) with dioctyl fluorene (F) as the &#960;&#8208;bridge and N&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NA) as terminal groups. As the CIL, it significantly modifies the interfaces of BHJ/CILs/electrode and minimizes dark current density (Jd). Using PTB7&#8208;Th:IEICO&#8208;4F as the BHJ, FNA&#8208;based OPDs achieve a remarkably low Jd of 1.12&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8&#160;A cm&#8722;2 (at &#8722;0.5&#160;V) and a peak specific detectivity of 8.23&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones (940&#160;nm), outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as CIL. These improvements are attributed to lower Jd by modified interfacial contact and increased photoresponse by reducing depletion region width in FNA&#8208;based photodiodes. Furthermore, uniform photoresponse in 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 OPD pixel arrays further validates its potential for imaging applications.

         <title>Thermodynamic Feedback Mechanisms for Mitigating Polarization in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a thermodynamic negative feedback mechanism in lithium&#8208;ion battery polarization, demonstrating that regions with steep open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) slope can self&#8208;regulate reaction rate distribution, and proposes a design strategy to mitigate polarization heterogeneity by tailoring the OCV profile, offering a new principle for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is intrinsically determined by the interplay between the kinetic and thermodynamic processes, which jointly govern the polarization dynamics across multiple scales. Extensive efforts have been directed toward alleviating kinetic limitations, but the essential role of thermodynamic factors, particularly under extreme operating conditions, has been largely overlooked. This oversight has impeded the development of comprehensive design principle for optimizing LIBs. In this study, we systematically investigate the coupled effects between thermodynamics and kinetics using advanced multiphysics simulations. We identify the slope of the equilibrium potential profile as a pivotal thermodynamic parameter. Steeper slopes have been demonstrated to induce stronger negative feedback, thereby effectively mitigating polarization heterogeneity and realizing the consistent electrode utilization. Based on this insight, we propose a design strategy centered on steepening the equilibrium potential to enhance thermodynamic feedback. This approach achieves a remarkable 80% reduction in polarization heterogeneity, significantly improving operational stability. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for polarization dynamics and offers actionable thermodynamic design principles, paves the way for the development of LIBs capable of extreme operating conditions.

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Electrolyte and Electrode Structures Enhance Ammonium Vanadate Mg&#8208;storage Performance for 100 mAh&#8208;Level Mg&#8208;ion Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a synergistic strategy involving simultaneous regulation of the electrolyte and electrode structure was proposed to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous Mg&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs). The assembled multilayer aqueous Mg&#8208;ion pouch cell delivers the highest capacity of 103.7&#160;mAh among. The integrated solar cell&#8208;pouch cell device demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of photo&#8208;charging AMIBs. These findings provide a novel strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance AMIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous Mg&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) have attracted increasing interest due to their safety, fast kinetics, and sustainability. However, the development of AMIBs is hindered by the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of electrolytes and electrode degradation. Here, a synergistic strategy, regulating both electrolyte and electrode structures, is proposed to enable high&#8208;performance AMIBs. Incorporating a polyethylene glycol crowding agent into Mg(ClO4)2/H2O electrolyte regulates the solvation structure, which suppresses hydrogen evolution, and expands the ESW beyond 3.1&#160;V. Meanwhile, an ammonium vanadate (NHVO) material with enlarged interlayer spacing is synthesized, and a freestanding NHVO/graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (NHVO/GO/CNT) electrode is constructed to enhance Mg2+ diffusion and mitigate vanadium dissolution. Under the synergistic regulation, NHVO/GO/CNT exhibits a high capacity of 284.0 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and the longest cycling lifespan (16&#160;000 cycles with 95.6% capacity retention). The solvation structure of electrolytes and interfacial stabilization mechanisms are elucidated through theory calculations. The Mg&#8208;storage mechanism of NHVO based on a single&#8208;phase insertion/extraction reaction with NH4+/Mg2+ displacement phenomenon is revealed. The constructed multilayer Mg&#8208;ion pouch cell achieves a record&#8208;high capacity of 103.7&#160;mAh. The integrated solar cell&#8208;pouch cell device demonstrates the feasibility of photo&#8208;charging AMIBs for the first time. This work offers a viable strategy toward practical, high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Control in Copper(I) Iodides via Inorganic Structural Engineering Within a Single&#8208;Cation Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Hybrid copper(I) halides have emerged as a new class of optoelectronic materials due to their tunable structure and photophysical properties. However, systematically correlating inorganic polyhedra configurations with emission characteristics remains challenging. Herein, we address this by synthesizing a homologous series of copper(I) iodides templated solely by the [C13H24N]+ cation. Precise control reaction conditions yielded distinct inorganic polyhedral configurations, monomeric [CuI3]2&#8722; (1), dimeric [Cu2I4]2&#8722; (2), trimeric [Cu3I6]3&#8722; (3), and tetrameric [Cu4I6]2&#8722; (4). We establish a direct correlation where increasing inorganic aggregation systematically reduces the bandgap and dictates the luminescence color across a near&#8208;full visible spectrum, from blue (1) to cyan (2), red (3), and yellow (4). Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal the self&#8208;trapped excitons emission mechanism dependent on the Cu&#8208;I configuration, in which the closed [Cu4I6]2&#8722; configuration is more resistant to excited lattice deformation, thereby resulting in a lowest Stokes shift energy. Furthermore, stimuli&#8208;responsive sequential phase transitions between these well&#8208;defined structures were demonstrated, offering insights into their structural dynamics. This work provides critical fundamental understanding of how inorganic framework engineering within a fixed organic host precisely controls both electronic structure and excited&#8208;state relaxation pathways in hybrid copper(I) halides, paving the way for rational design of materials with tailored optical properties.

         <title>Node Flexibility Unlocks Structural Adaptability and Guest Versatility of Anionocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing node flexibility has proved an effective strategy to enhance the structural adaptability and guest versatility of anionocages. Unprecedented, nano&#8208;sized anionocages were obtained, enabling the binding of [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; with a significant increase in quantum yield (&#8764;5&#8208;fold) and lifetime (&#8764;2&#8208;fold), as well as the emergence of circularly polarized luminescence from racemic [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; via host&#8211;guest chirality transfer.








Abstract
Due to their exceptional nodal flexibility, anionocages are promising host molecules capable of mimicking the dynamic self&#8208;assembly and host&#8211;guest chemistry of proteins. However, their application has been limited by the challenges in constructing large internal cavities. Here, we present an effective strategy to overcome this limitation by enhancing node flexibility to improve both structural adaptability and guest encapsulation versatility. Specifically, anion coordination between a C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;urea ligand (L) and an organophosphate, PhPO42&#8722; (A), generates highly flexible nodes that enable adaptive self&#8208;assembly and the encapsulation of guests of unprecedented size. Crystal structures revealed that the same ligand and anion can form three geometrically distinct anionocages (A4L4 tetrahedron 1, A6L6 trigonal antiprism 2, and A6L8 octahedron 3), with cavity sizes ranging from 0.208 to 1.320&#160;nm3. In solution, controlled interconversions among the three anionocages can be achieved by modulating the guest template, A/L ratio, and concentration. These nanoscale cavities successfully encapsulate the luminescent metal complex, [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; (bpy = 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), resulting in a &#8764;5&#8208;fold increase in quantum yield, and a &#8764;2&#8208;fold increase in lifetime. Moreover, circularly polarized luminescence of racemic [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; is induced via chirality transfer using a chiral&#8208;anion&#8208;directed octahedral cage (4) as the host.

         <title>Volcano&#8208;Shaped Relationship Between Interfacial K+&#8208;H2O Ratio and CO2 Reduction Activity in Tandem Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The M4/Ni1NC catalysts featuring single Ni atoms and M4 atomic clusters can dynamically modulate *H supply and ECRR performance through regulating interfacial K+&#8208;H2O ratio. A volcanic relationship was observed between the K+&#8208;H2O ratio near the electrode and ECRR performance. Cu4/Ni1NC with a moderate interfacial K+&#8208;H2O ratio achieves a high FECO of &gt;95% across a 0.8&#160;V potential range, delivering industrially relevant current density of 385&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. 








Abstract
Modulating surface&#8208;active hydrogen (*H) supply represents a critical strategy to boost the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECRR), yet the mechanistic interplay between *H dynamics and catalytic behavior remains ambiguous. Herein, we construct tandem catalysts (M4/Ni1NC, M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Co, Cu, or Mn) by coupling tetranuclear metal clusters (M4) with single&#8208;atom Ni sites on N&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1NC) to regulate *H supply. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the *H supply is governed by both thermodynamics and kinetic factors. The M4 clusters provide the thermodynamic feasibility for *H supply for CO2 activation. The *H supply rate in kinetic perspective is tuned by the K+&#8208;H2O ratio of interfacial water, determined by work function of the decorated M4 clusters. The increased K+&#8208;H2O ratio can promote water dissociation to maintain optimal *H coverage for intermediate hydrogenation, whereas excessive *H accumulation triggers competitive hydrogen evolution. Therefore, a volcanic relationship was observed between the K+&#8208;H2O ratio and ECRR performance. Among these samples, Cu4/Ni1NC with moderate *H supply rate in kinetic exhibits exceptional ECRR performance, achieving &gt;95% Faradaic efficiency for CO across a 0.8&#160;V potential range (&#8722;0.2 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE) and industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&#8764;385&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#160;V) in a flow cell.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed trans&#8208;Hydrostannation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily accessible and cheap iron complex is capable of catalyzing highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrostannation reactions of terminal alkyl alkynes as well as the stannylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. The addition likely follows a &#8220;modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8221; mechanism; the intervention of iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded.








Abstract
The readily accessible iron complex [Cp*FeCl(tmeda)] is an effective catalyst for the highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrostannylation of terminal alkyl alkynes, affording a type of alkenylstannanes that is difficult to make otherwise. The R3Sn&#8208; moiety is faithfully delivered to the terminal C&#8208;atom, unless a propargylic or homo&#8208;propargylic &#9472;OH or &#9472;NH2 group is present in the substrate, which (partly or fully) inverts the regiochemical course; this steering effect, however, can be switched off upon protection of the protic site. The trans&#8208;addition likely starts by insertion of the [Cp*FeCl] fragment into the R3Sn&#9472;H bond, followed by a migratory insertion of the ligated alkyne into the Fe&#9472;Sn unit of the Fe(IV) species thus formed. This &#8220;modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8221; mechanism is manifested in a stannylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enyne derivatives, which has hardly any precedent either; a pathway via iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded on the basis of deuterium labeling experiments.

The R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn- moiety is faithfully delivered to the terminal C-atom, unless a propargylic or homo-propargylic &#9472;OH or &#9472;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group is present in the substrate, which (partly or fully) inverts the regiochemical course; this steering effect, however, can be switched off upon protection of the protic site. The &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-addition likely starts by insertion of the [Cp*FeCl] fragment into the R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&#9472;H bond, followed by a migratory insertion of the ligated alkyne into the Fe&#9472;Sn unit of the Fe(IV) species thus formed. This &#8220;modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8221; mechanism is manifested in a stannylative cyclization of 1,6-enyne derivatives, which has hardly any precedent either; a pathway via iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded on the basis of deuterium labeling experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Freely&#8208;Rotatable Multidentate Molecular Anchor Enables Self&#8208;Adaptive Aqueous Binders for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidentate molecular anchoring strategy was proposed to optimize the binders performance for lithium ion batteries. The BHB possesses a very special molecular rotation properties that can facilitate a multidentate anchoring effect to efficiently withstand the volume change of Si&#8208;based anodes after cross&#8208;linking with the traditional binders.








Abstract
The rational design and synthesis of reliable binders is a big challenge to efficiently mitigate the severe volume change of silicon&#8208;based anodes for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we report a multidentate molecular anchoring strategy to construct a novel self&#8208;adaptive aqueous binder. This binder composes of robust 3D dynamic networks derived from the crosslinking of the freely&#8208;rotatable multidentate molecular anchor (2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)butyric acid, BHB) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) via dynamic hydrogen&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly, which effectively imparts the fabrication of high&#8208;strength Si/C anodes and achieves high areal capacities (6.13&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2) under a high mass loading of 13&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the dynamic and reversible adhesion and the efficient &#8220;net&#8208;to&#8208;point&#8221; bonding characteristic contribute to enhance structural and interfacial stability in the NCM811/Si/C full cells. Consequently, the cells demonstrate superior cyclability and electrochemical performance. Notably, this multidentate molecular anchoring strategy can be further extended to develop other BHB&#8208;derived self&#8208;adaptive binders (i.e., BHB/PVA and BHB/CMC) for the purpose of dynamic structure regulation. This work provides valuable insights into the judicious modulation of aqueous binders from the perspective of molecular chemistry and product engineering, paving the pathway for the design of auqeous binders for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;energy Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Stereoselective Self&#8208;Assembly of a Topologically Chiral [6]Catenane with 18 Crossings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective construction of a record&#8208;complex 24&#8208;metal [6]catenane (1816$18_1^6$ link) with 18 crossings is achieved via one&#8208;step coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands enables exclusive formation of topological enantiomers, each featuring four topologically chiral stereogenic units. Synergistic &#960;&#8208;stacking, hydrogen bonding, and solvophobic effects direct the formation of this six&#8208;ring entangled architecture. 








Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) exhibit unique properties and functions arising from their structural entanglement, features of which are absent in their individual components. However, synthesizing topologically complex architectures, particularly those with topological chirality, remains a significant challenge due to the lack of general methods for controlled entanglement. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of a 24&#8208;metal&#8208;center topologically chiral [6]catenane featuring 18 crossings (1816$18_1^6$ link), representing one of the most intricate MIMs constructed to date. This complex architecture was achieved in high yield (71%) via one&#8208;step coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of 12 chiral semirigid bidentate ligands and 12 conjugated binuclear half&#8208;sandwich organometallic clips. Critically, chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands enabled exclusive formation of topological enantiomer pairs (Rh&#8208;1S/Rh&#8208;1R), each containing four topologically chiral stereogenic units&#8212;three cyclic [3]catenane components and one closed three&#8208;link chain component. The self&#8208;assembly is synergistically directed by integrated noncovalent interactions (sevenfold &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and solvophobic effects), as unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This design strategy, incorporating tailored noncovalent interaction sites in building blocks, provides a viable approach for synthesizing other structurally complex topologically chiral MIMs.

         <title>Solvent Polarity Triggered Rapidly Reversible Quadruple&#8208;Mode Luminescence Adjustment in 0D Hybrid Antimony Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zero&#8208;dimensional metal halide demonstrates quadruple/triple&#8208;mode luminescence switching with a rapid response (&lt;1s) and excellent recyclability (&#8805;100 cycles) triggered with moderately&#8208;polar and strongly&#8208;polar solvents. The solvochromism mechanism links luminescence tuning to solvent polarity, with dipole moment changed from moderately&#8208;polar solvents, and phase transformation induced by strongly&#8208;polar solvents. This crystal shows potential for solvent detection, safety monitoring, and information encryption.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimension (0D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides are highly attractive as smart responsive luminescent materials, but the multiple&#8208;mode luminescence switch is rarely achieved and intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is unclear. Herein, we report a yellowish&#8208;green&#8208;emitting (Me3BzN)3Sb2Cl9 (Me3BzN: trimethylbenzyl ammonium) single crystal, revealing quadruple/triple&#8208;mode luminescence switch with rapid response time (&lt;1&#160;s) and excellent recyclability (&#8805; 100 cycles) when triggered by moderately&#8208;polar and strongly&#8208;polar solvents. Significantly, the intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is systematically proposed, of which the reversibly multiple&#8208;mode luminescence tuning is closely related to solvent polarity, the moderate polarity can lead to luminescence redshift from 560 to 670&#160;nm due to the increase of dipole moment for inorganic polyhedron. Besides, the small molecular solvent with strong polarity can insert into crystal and form &#8220;host&#8208;guest&#8221; system, inducing single crystal&#8208;single crystal phase transformation with structural disorder and Sb&#8208;Sb distance variation. Owing to the unique multiple&#8208;mode luminescence adjustment performance, (Me3BzN)3Sb2Cl9 displays potential candidate in solvent detection, safety monitoring and information encryption scenarios. These findings highlight the significance of solvent polarity and molecule volume on the dynamic luminescence adjustment and offer guidance for the development of new smart responsive 0D hybrid antimony halides in advanced optical switchable fields.

         <title>White Circularly Polarized OLEDs Enabled by Orthogonal Engineering of Achiral Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters and Chiral Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising strategy by orthogonal engineering of achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters and chiral orange assemblies was proposed to fabricate white circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This strategy leverages the high exciton utilization and chiral amplification, yielding a record gEL of 0.34 and EQEmax of 6.3%. This work represented the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art white CP&#8208;OLEDs, delivering the highest reported combination of external quantum efficiency (EQE) and gEL to date. 








Abstract
The development of white circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) faces a critical challenge in simultaneously achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and large dissymmetry factors (g), due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between exciton utilization and chirality amplification. Herein, we propose an orthogonal architecture synergizing an achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with chiral orange assemblies to overcome this limitation. The chiral assemblies, featuring exceptional chiroptical activity (|gabs| = 0.95 and |glum| = 0.85), are engineered as both photon&#8208;selective filters and emitters. When integrated with a blue TADF layer, this dual&#8208;layer design enables 100% internal quantum efficiency through TADF&#8208;enabled triplet harvesting and chiral amplification via selective absorption of blue photons with a specific polarization direction, generating amplified white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). The resulting white CP&#8208;OLED (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) achieves a record |gEL| of 0.34 alongside an EQEmax of 6.3%, demonstrating the unprecedented white CP&#8208;OLEDs when considering both EQE and gEL values. By optimizing the TADF doping ratio, a cool&#8208;white CP&#8208;OLED is realized with an EQE of 14.7% and |gEL| of 0.32. This work establishes a material orthogonal engineering to decouple exciton&#8208;chirality interdependencies, opening avenues for fabricating high&#8208;performance CPEL devices.

&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt; to date. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of white circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) faces a critical challenge in simultaneously achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and large dissymmetry factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;), due to the inherent trade-off between exciton utilization and chirality amplification. Herein, we propose an orthogonal architecture synergizing an achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with chiral orange assemblies to overcome this limitation. The chiral assemblies, featuring exceptional chiroptical activity (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;| = 0.95 and |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| = 0.85), are engineered as both photon-selective filters and emitters. When integrated with a blue TADF layer, this dual-layer design enables 100% internal quantum efficiency through TADF-enabled triplet harvesting and chiral amplification via selective absorption of blue photons with a specific polarization direction, generating amplified white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). The resulting white CP-OLED (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) achieves a record |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| of 0.34 alongside an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 6.3%, demonstrating the unprecedented white CP-OLEDs when considering both EQE and &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt; values. By optimizing the TADF doping ratio, a cool-white CP-OLED is realized with an EQE of 14.7% and |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| of 0.32. This work establishes a material orthogonal engineering to decouple exciton-chirality interdependencies, opening avenues for fabricating high-performance CPEL devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted Dual Acid Sites in WO3&#8208;x Catalysts Facilitate Direct Photocatalytic Hydrodeoxygenation of Hydroxy Groups in Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarity enhancement strategy has been developed to realize the direct photocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation of different alcohols under ambient conditions. A WO3&#8208;x catalyst possessing Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites is developed to drive the whole reaction. The Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites have been&#160;demonstrated to be the main sites for the photocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation of hydroxy groups.








Abstract
Efficient hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the hydroxy groups (C&#9472;OH) in alcohol molecules has attracted substantial attention due to its importance in many research fields such as organic synthesis and biomass conversion. Photocatalytic C&#9472;OH direct HDO is a promising but challenging process because of the difficulty in C&#9472;O bond activation due to the higher bond energy and strong polarity. A polarity enhancement strategy is proposed and a WO3&#8208;x catalyst possessing Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites is developed to realize the direct HDO of alcohols under ambient conditions. The C&#9472;O bond is first heterolytic cleaved to produce the carbocation intermediate and then the carbocation will combine with a proton and photogenerated electrons to form a new C&#9472;H bond. The synergistic effect of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites plays a key role in promoting the C&#9472;O bond cleavage. A series of comparative experiments, spectral characterizations&#160;and DFT calculations were&#160;used to demonstrate this new photocatalytic HDO pathway. Different alcohols, including polyols, can be directly converted into corresponding alkanes over this system. The present work discloses a direct HDO process for the hydroxy groups in alcohols and provides a new horizon for the design of new photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Ring Flipping in a Threaded Pillar[5]Arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical force was used to flip the orientation of a hydroquinone ring in a threaded pillar[5]arene to reach an elusive conformation not accessible to other methods of activation. The flipping can be suppressed with large substituents on the axle or the macrocycle. This unique molecular motion provides a new mechanism to dissipate mechanical energy with rotaxanes.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are popular macrocycles used in various supramolecular systems and materials due to their unique host&#8211;guest properties and ease of synthesis. Their pillar shape originates from the cyclic arrangement of methylene&#8208;bridged hydroquinone groups. They usually exist in one of two conformations where all the hydroquinone rings are oriented in the same direction (left or right), which is the source of their planar chirality. However, the controlled formation of pillar[n]arenes with intermediate conformations, for example, where only one ring is inverted, remains a challenge. Here we show how mechanical force can be used to reach this elusive conformation via the force&#8208;induced flipping of a single hydroquinone ring in a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based rotaxane. We show that the flipping motion can be controlled with the shape of the stopper and the axle, as well as with the nature of the pillar[5]arene substituents. This flipping behavior acts as a mechanical damper by slowing the scission of the polymer under tension. These results show how mechanical force can be used to access synthetically challenging supramolecular architectures, and we anticipate that this new dampening mechanism will prove useful in the formation of tougher materials.

         <title>Probing Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution at Individual Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 Photocatalyst Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;SECM was used to probe the photocurrent and to map H2 and O2 evolution rates during water splitting on individual Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8722;yCryO3 photocatalyst particles, observing catalytic heterogeneity on the microscale.








Abstract
Particle&#8208;based photocatalysts for overall water splitting convert solar energy into hydrogen fuel without the use of any photovoltaic devices. As such they have the potential to revolutionize renewable energy production on Earth. While proven efficiencies have reached 1.1%, further improvements of photocatalyst technology depend on a better understanding of energy loss mechanisms on the individual particle level. Here, we conduct the first in operando photoelectrochemical measurements on individual micrometer&#8208;sized Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 photocatalyst particles. We find that the photocatalyst particles behave mainly as water oxidation photoanodes reaching up to 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#160;V versus RHE and a photovoltage of &#8764;1.00 V under 4.7&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 ultraviolet illumination. This proves that charge separation in the unbiased Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 catalyst is driven by a junction at the n&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;liquid contact. While O2 is detected symmetrically around photocatalyst particles, uneven H2 evolution profiles reflect an irregular Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 cocatalyst distribution. Additionally, the H2 evolution activity varies significantly between different photocatalyst particles. This suggests that performance gains are possible by better controlling catalyst composition on the microscale.

         <title>Abnormal Anti&#8208;Kasha Emission and TADF in Anionic Cycloarylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The removal of {FeCp} moieties in two ferrocene&#8208;dopped cycloarylenes via reductive cleavage approach unveils the intrinsic optical properties of anionic cycloarylenes. 13&#8211; exhibits a mixed emission from S2&#8594;S0 and S1'&#8594;S0, while 24&#8211; follows Kasha's rule displaying an S1'&#8594;S0 emission, notably, both anionic cycloarylenes display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with lifetimes on the millisecond scale.








Abstract
Incorporation of non&#8208;benzoid rings into cycloarylenes significantly alters their molecular geometry and optical behavior. Recently, we synthesized two ferrocene&#8208;doped cycloarylenes, (CpFe)3&#8208;1 and (CpFe)4&#8208;2. However, the {FeCp} moieties in these architectures limited their optical properties. In this work, we report a reductive Fe&#9472;Cp bond cleavage approach that enables the removal of {FeCp} moieties efficiently, yielding two anionic cycloarylenes, 13&#8211; and 24&#8211;. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals different structure deformation between two charged species including molecular symmetry and &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that both 13&#8211; and 24&#8211; exhibit steady emission at 560 and 587&#160;nm, respectively, with noticeable high quantum yields (59.70% and 84.99%). 13&#8211; violates Kasha's rule via a rare mixed emission from S2&#8594;S0 and S1'&#8594;S0, whereas 24&#8211; adheres to the conventional S1'&#8594;S0 decay. Furthermore, both compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as the first example observed in cycloarylenes, with lifetimes reaching the millisecond scale. This work establishes alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated reductive cleavage as an effective strategy to break Fe&#9472;Cp bond and provides new insight into the photophysical behavior of charged molecular nanocarbons, paving the way for the rational design of functional molecular materials.

&lt;sup&gt;3&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits a mixed emission from S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, while &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; follows Kasha's rule displaying an S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; emission, notably, both anionic cycloarylenes display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with lifetimes on the millisecond scale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of non-benzoid rings into cycloarylenes significantly alters their molecular geometry and optical behavior. Recently, we synthesized two ferrocene-doped cycloarylenes, &lt;b&gt;(CpFe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;(CpFe)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-2&lt;/b&gt;. However, the {FeCp} moieties in these architectures limited their optical properties. In this work, we report a reductive Fe&#9472;Cp bond cleavage approach that enables the removal of {FeCp} moieties efficiently, yielding two anionic cycloarylenes, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals different structure deformation between two charged species including molecular symmetry and &#960;-conjugation. Comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that both &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; exhibit steady emission at 560 and 587&#160;nm, respectively, with noticeable high quantum yields (59.70% and 84.99%). &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; violates Kasha's rule via a rare mixed emission from S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; adheres to the conventional S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; decay. Furthermore, both compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as the first example observed in cycloarylenes, with lifetimes reaching the millisecond scale. This work establishes alkali-metal-mediated reductive cleavage as an effective strategy to break Fe&#9472;Cp bond and provides new insight into the photophysical behavior of charged molecular nanocarbons, paving the way for the rational design of functional molecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation of Polystyrene Into Benzene for Recycling and Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical degradation of polystyrene into benzene through ball milling is demonstrated for the first time. The benzene generated can be used to synthesize the styrene monomer for a closed&#8208;loop recycling or be converted into benzophenone through a mechanochemical cascade Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation for upcycling.








Abstract
Synthetic plastics sourced from petroleum have gained widespread use since the 1950s. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most extensively used plastics, as it is colorless, has high mechanical strength, and exhibits excellent chemical and thermal stability; however, it is also one of the least recycled plastics because of the high cost and low profit in recycling. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanochemical recycling approach that allows PS to be efficiently degraded into benzene when it is ground in a ball mill with AlCl3. For example, when 165&#160;kDa PS pellets are milled with AlCl3, the extent of degradation reaches 90% at 15&#160;min. Isotope labeling experiments indicate that both ambient water and the polymer backbone can be proton sources for the formation of benzene. The benzene generated in the mechanochemical degradation can be used to synthesize styrene, which can be repolymerized to produce polystyrene, allowing for the closed&#8208;loop recycling of PS. In addition, a mechanochemical Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation between the generated benzene and the subsequently added benzoic anhydride produces benzophenone in 40%&#8211;50% yield. The mechanochemical degradation process demonstrated here is solvent&#8208;free, cost&#8208;effective, and energy&#8208;efficient, providing a promising route for the chemical recycling and upcycling of PS.

         <title>Design and Preparation of Self&#8208;Adaptive and Robust Solid&#8208;State Elastomeric Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Battery Inspired by Rubber Tire</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adaptive solid&#8208;state elastomeric electrolyte inspired by rubber tires is designed, combining molecular&#8208;level plasticizer dispersion, mechanical flexibility, and interfacial adaptivity. By optimizing the elastomer&#8208;to&#8208;DEE ratio and integrating a polyethylene scaffold, the SSEE achieves high ionic conductivity (2.37 mS cm&#8722;1) and low interfacial resistance. It retains 88.33% capacity after 800 cycles in full&#8208;cell configurations.








Abstract
The development of safe, high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes remains a central challenge for advancing lithium metal batteries (LMBs) toward practical deployment. Inspired by the durable, deformable nature of rubber tires, we report the design and preparation of a self&#8208;adaptive solid&#8208;state elastomeric electrolyte containing a deep eutectic electrolyte, termed PMEC, which integrates molecular&#8208;level plasticizer dispersion, mechanical flexibility, and interfacial adaptivity. The PMEC membrane exhibits high ionic conductivity (2.37 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C), a high Li&#8314; transference number (0.64), excellent elasticity, and robust interfacial adhesion (36.34&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2). Structural characterizations confirm its amorphous and homogeneously mixed nature, while micro&#8208;Raman and XPS/TOF&#8208;SIMS analyses reveal uniform component distribution and the formation of an organic&#8211;inorganic gradient SEI layer on lithium. These features enable exceptional electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full batteries, including over 2000 h of stable cycling and &gt;800 cycles at 0.5&#160;C in LFP|PMEC|Li batteries with &gt;88% capacity retention. Moreover, PMEC&#8208;based pouch batteries maintain functionality under severe mechanical abuse. This tire&#8208;inspired electrolyte&#160;design offers a generalizable platform for high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.
