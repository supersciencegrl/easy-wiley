         <title>A Self&#8208;Catabolic Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanosponge for Programmable Drug Delivery and Efficient Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exquisite cascade DNAzyme&#8208;sustained gene silencing platform was assembled to program the &#8220;mask&#8208;cleave&#8208;release&#8221; of therapeutic DNAzyme from the intelligent DNAzyme nanosponge, where the upstream self&#8208;catabolic DNAzyme mediated the specific and accurate activation of downstream therapeutic DNAzyme for guaranteeing the efficient gene silencing with improved bioavailability.







Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy holds immense prospects for effectively treating severe diseases, yet is constrained with inefficient delivery and unconditional activation. Herein, we designed a bioinspired self&#8208;catabolic DNA nanocapsule for sustaining tumor&#8208;specific cascade activation of therapeutic DNAzyme. The exquisite DNAzyme was temporarily masked by the self&#8208;excising DNAzyme in the hierarchical rolling circle replication (RCR) nanostructures, thus stayed in an inactive state in physiological fluids. Through the multivalent tumor&#8208;anchoring aptamer strands, the RCR nanocapsule was specifically accumulated in cancer cells and was sequentially activated for motivating the ultimate DNAzyme&#8208;mediated gene silencing via the intelligent stimuli&#8208;responsive cascade DNAzyme activation. By virtue of the programmable RCR assembly strategy, our compact DNAzyme nanoplatform shows great promise for developing versatile smart gene therapeutics and personalized nanomedicines.

         <title>Effective Encapsulation of C60 by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Polyamide Macrocyclic Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ditopic flexible benzylic amide macrocycle was employed as an organic ligand for the assembly of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These reticular materials form non&#8208;interpenetrated channels with a remarkable solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46&#8201;%. The incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pockets of these materials was studied, and C60 was able to occupy an impressive 98&#8201;% of them. These materials were selective for the recognition of C60 in the presence of the larger C70.







Abstract
A flexible benzylic amide macrocycle, functionalized with two carboxylic acid groups, was employed as the organic ligand for the preparation of robust copper(II)&#8208; and zinc(II)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These polymers crystallized in the C2/m space group of the monoclinic crystal system, creating non&#8208;interpenetrated channels in one direction with an extraordinary solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46&#8201;%. Unlike metal&#8211;organic rotaxane frameworks having benzylic amide macrocycles as linkers, the absence of the thread in these novel reticular materials causes a decrease of dimensionality and an improvement of pore size and dynamic guest adaptability. We studied the incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pocket generated between two macrocycles connected to the same dinuclear clusters, occupying a remarkable 98&#8201;% of the cavities inside the network. The use of these materials as hosts for the selective recognition of different fullerenes was evaluated, mainly encapsulating the smaller size fullerene derivative in several mixtures of C60 and C70.

         <title>Solar and Visible Light Assisted Peptide Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide coupling reaction is described that relies mechanistically on sunlight activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent in situ. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
Amino acid and peptide couplings are widely used in fields related to pharma and materials. Still, current peptide synthesis continues to rely on the use of expensive, water sensitive, and waste&#8208;generating coupling reagents, which are often prepared in multi&#8208;step sequences and used in excess. Herein is described a peptide coupling reaction design that relies mechanistically on sun&#8208;light activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent in situ. The resulting coupling method is rapid, does not require dry solvents or inert atmosphere, and is compatible with all the most common amino acids and protecting groups. Peptide couplings can be run on gram&#8208;scale, without the use of special equipment. This method has a significantly reduced environmental and financial footprint compared to standard peptide coupling reactions. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.

         <title>The hydrotropic effect of ionic liquids in water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have successfully expanded the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes beyond 2&#160;V. Further improvements in stability can be achieved by partially substituting water with either classical organic solvents or ionic liquids. Here, we study ternary electrolytes composed of LiTFSI, water, and imidazolium ionic liquids. We find that the LiTFSI solubility strongly increases from 21&#160;mol/kg in water to up to 60 mol/kg in the presence of ionic liquid. The solution structure is investigated with Raman and NMR spectroscopy and the enhanced LiTFSI solubility is found to originate from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. The increased reductive stability of the ternary electrolytes enables stable cycling of an aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery with an energy density of 150&#160;Wh/kg on the active material level based on commercially relevant Li4Ti5O12 and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Cooperated Catalytic Mechanism of Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8208;N4 and Zn&#8208;N4 for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual metal single atom catalysts exhibit superior performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, the synergistic catalytic mechanism is not deeply understood. Herein, we report a dual metal single atom catalyst consisted of Cu&#8208;N4  and Zn&#8208;N4  on the N&#8208;doped carbon support (Cu/Zn&#8208;NC). It exhibits high&#8208;efficiency ORR activity with an  E  onset  of 0.98 V and an  E  1/2  of 0.83 V, excellent stability (no degradation after 10000 cycles), surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and great mass of Pt&#8208;free single atom catalysts. Operando XANES demonstrates that the Cu&#8208;N4  as active center experiences the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8208;N4  during ORR process, and then turns to single atom state again after reaction. DFT calculation further indicates that the adjustment effect of Zn on the d&#8208;orbital electron distribution of Cu could benefit to the stretch and cleavage of O&#8208;O on Cu active center, speeding up the process of rate determining step of OOH*.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Metal Substitution in Tuning Anion Redox in Sodium Metal Layered Oxides Revealed by X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy and Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The link between the high&#8208;valent structure of P2&#8208;type sodium layered transition metal oxides and the redox properties involving oxygen redox is demonstrated. By substituting Fe with Cu and Ni from P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2, the antisite&#8208;vacancy defect formation is controlled during desodiation of the positive electrodes.

We investigate high&#8208;valent oxygen redox in the positive Na&#8208;ion electrode P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 (NMF) where Fe is partially substituted with Cu (P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Mn0.66Fe0.20Cu0.14]O2, NMFC) or Ni (P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Mn0.65Fe0.20Ni0.15]O2, NMFN). From combined analysis of resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering and X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge structure with electrochemical voltage hysteresis and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function profiles, we correlate structural disorder with high&#8208;valent oxygen redox and its improvement by Ni or Cu substitution. Density of states calculations elaborate considerable anionic redox in NMF and NMFC without the widely accepted requirement of an A&#8208;O&#8208;A&#8242; local configuration in the pristine materials (where A=Na and A&#8242;=Li, Mg, vacancy, etc.). We also show that the Jahn&#8211;Teller nature of Fe4+ and the stabilization mechanism of anionic redox could determine the extent of structural disorder in the materials. These findings shed light on the design principles in TM and anion redox for positive electrodes to improve the performance of Na&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The link between the high&#8208;valent structure of P2&#8208;type sodium layered transition metal oxides and the redox properties involving oxygen redox is demonstrated. By substituting Fe with Cu and Ni from P2&#8208;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the antisite&#8208;vacancy defect formation is controlled during desodiation of the positive electrodes. Ligand to metal charge transfer and the O 2p state near the Fermi level evoke and stabilize oxygen redox from the electrodes.

         <title>Decarboxylative Polyfluoroarylation of Alkylcarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed decarboxylative polyfluoroarylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids is reported. The defluorinative C&#8722;C bond formation through a radical process enables expedient access to polyfluoroaromatics from abundant carboxylic acids.







Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are useful building blocks in several areas such as drug discovery, materials, and crop protection. Herein, we report the first polyfluoroarylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids via photoredox decarboxylation. The method proceeds with broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Moreover, small complex molecules such as natural products and drugs can be modified by late&#8208;stage modification.

         <title>Impact of In&#8208;Cell and In&#8208;Vitro Crowding on the Conformations and Dynamics of an Intrinsically Disordered Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy reveals the effects of intracellular crowding on the dimensions and dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins.







Abstract
The conformations and dynamics of proteins can be influenced by crowding from the large concentrations of macromolecules within cells. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exhibit chain compaction in crowded solutions in vitro, but no such effects were observed in cultured mammalian cells. Here, to increase intracellular crowding, we reduced the cell volume by hyperosmotic stress and used an IDP as a crowding sensor for in&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy. In these more crowded cells, the IDP exhibits compaction, slower chain dynamics, and much slower translational diffusion, indicating a pronounced concentration and length&#8208;scale dependence of crowding. In vitro, these effects cannot be reproduced with small but only with large polymeric crowders. The observations can be explained with polymer theory and depletion interactions and indicate that IDPs can diffuse much more efficiently through a crowded cytosol than a globular protein of similar dimensions.

         <title>Enhanced Catalysis under 2D Silica: A CO Oxidation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO oxidation taking place under a 2D microporous silicon dioxide film demonstrates a &#8764;12&#8201;% enhancement in CO2 production by creating an interfacial microenvironment that fosters a higher coverage of reactive Pd surface oxide sites that are integral to CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Interfacially confined microenvironments have recently gained attention in catalysis, as they can be used to modulate reaction chemistry. The emergence of a 2D nanospace at the interface between a 2D material and its support can promote varying kinetic and energetic schemes based on molecular level confinement effects imposed in this reduced volume. We report on the use of a 2D oxide cover, bilayer silica, on catalytically active Pd(111) undergoing the CO oxidation reaction. We &#8220;uncover&#8221; mechanistic insights about the structure&#8211;activity relationship with and without a 2D silica overlayer using in situ IR and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. We find that the CO oxidation reaction on Pd(111) benefits from confinement effects imposed on surface adsorbates under 2D silica. This interaction results in a lower and more dispersed coverage of CO adsorbates with restricted CO adsorption geometries, which promote oxygen adsorption and lay the foundation for the formation of a reactive surface oxide that produces higher CO2 formation rates than Pd alone.

         <title>Effect of Zinc&#8208;Doping on the Reduction of the Hot&#8208;Carrier Cooling Rate in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper Zn&#8208;doping (0.34&#8201;%) in perovskites is found to be able to significantly slowdown the hot&#8208;carrier cooling, the cooling rate of the 500&#8197;K hot&#8208;carriers can be reduced down to one third of the un&#8208;doped sample. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations uncover the mechanisms of such efficient retardation of the hot&#8208;carrier cooling via Zn&#8208;doping.







Abstract
The fast hot&#8208;carrier cooling process in the solar&#8208;absorbers fundamentally limits their photon&#8208;conversion efficiencies. It is highly desirable to develop a solar absorber with long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carriers at sun&#8208;illumination intensity, which can be used to develop the hot&#8208;carrier solar cells with enhanced efficiency. Herein, we reveal that zinc&#8208;doped (0.34&#8201;%) halide perovskites have the slower hot&#8208;carrier cooling compared with the pristine sample through the transient absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. The hot&#8208;carrier energy loss rate at the low photoexcitation level of 1017&#8197;cm&#8722;3 is found to be &#8776;3 times smaller than that of un&#8208;doped perovskites for T=500&#8197;K hot carriers, and up to ten times when the hot&#8208;carrier temperature approaches the lattice temperature. The incorporation of zinc&#8208;dopant into perovskites can reduce the nonadiabatic couplings between conduction bands, which retards the photogenerated hot&#8208;carriers relaxation processes. Our findings present a practical strategy to slow down the hot&#8208;carrier cooling in perovskites at low carrier densities, which would be invaluable for the further development of practical hot&#8208;carrier photovoltaics based on perovskites.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Toward a Photoinduced Single&#8208;Chain Magnet Showing High Coercivity Values</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced spin&#8208;crossover switchable single&#8208;chain magnet was discovered in an asymmetric ditopic ligand&#8208;containing cyanide&#8208;bridged compound. A photoinduced opening hysteresis with the highest coercive field of 1.3&#8197;T was realized in pure 3d metal&#8208;based molecular magnets.







Abstract
The production of photo&#8208;switchable molecular nanomagnets with substantial coercivity, which is indispensable for information storage and process applications, is challenging.

&lt;p&gt;A light&#8208;induced spin&#8208;crossover switchable single&#8208;chain magnet was discovered in an asymmetric ditopic ligand&#8208;containing cyanide&#8208;bridged compound. A photoinduced opening hysteresis with the highest coercive field of 1.3&#8197;T was realized in pure 3d metal&#8208;based molecular magnets.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of photo&#8208;switchable molecular nanomagnets with substantial coercivity, which is indispensable for information storage and process applications, is challenging. Introducing photo&#8208;responsive spin&#8208;crossover units provides a feasible means of controlling the magnetic anisotropy, interactions, and overall nanomagnet properties. Herein, we report a cyanide&#8208;bridged chain &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/b&gt; ({[(&lt;sup&gt;Pz&lt;/sup&gt;Tp)Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Pmat)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Prebiotic Phosphorylation and Concomitant Oligomerization of Deoxynucleosides to form DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides under plausible prebiotic conditions with diamidophosphate gives rise to 5&#8242;&#8208;amidophosphorylated nucleotides and concomitantly to the 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;linked DNA oligomers. This direct conversion of deoxynucleosides to DNA oligonucleotides in a single pot scenario&#8212;under conditions compatible with ribonucleosides&#8212;sets the stage for the potential emergence of RNA and DNA from mixtures of nucleosides.







Abstract
Recent demonstrations of RNA&#8211;DNA chimeras (RDNA) enabling RNA and DNA replication, coupled with prebiotic co&#8208;synthesis of deoxyribo&#8208; and ribo&#8208;nucleotides, have resurrected the hypothesis of co&#8208;emergence of RNA and DNA. As further support, we show that diamidophosphate (DAP) with 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (amido)phosphorylates and oligomerizes deoxynucleosides to form DNA&#8212;under conditions similar to those of ribonucleosides. The pyrimidine deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;amidophosphates are formed in good (&#8776;60&#8201;%) yields. Intriguingly, the presence of pyrimidine deoxynucleos(t)ides increased the yields of purine deoxynucleotides (&#8776;20&#8201;%). Concomitantly, oligomerization (&#8776;18&#8211;31&#8201;%) is observed with predominantly 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;phosphodiester DNA linkages, and some (&lt;5&#8201;%) pyrophosphates. Combined with previous observations of DAP&#8208;mediated chemistries and the constructive role of RDNA chimeras, the results reported here help set the stage for systematic investigation of a systems chemistry approach of RNA&#8211;DNA coevolution.

         <title>Ultrastable and Efficient Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 Reduction Triggered by Regenerative Oxygen&#8208;vacancies in Bi2O2CO3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface vacancies can exert positive impact on CO2 photoreduction activity, yet difficultly maintaining long&#8208;term stability. Herein, we first design a fast low&#8208;pressure ultraviolet light irradiation strategy for easily regenerating the nearly equivalent surface vacancies, thus concurrently optimizing CO2 photoreduction activity and stability. Taking the defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets as an example, nearly equal amount of oxygen vacancies can be regenerated under UV light irradiation. Synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8211;ray photoelectron spectra disclose the Bi sites in the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets can act as the highly active sites, which not only help to activate CO2 molecules, but also contribute to stabilizing the rate&#8208;limiting COOH* intermediate. Also, in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ mass spectrometry unravel the UV light irradiation contributes to accelerating CO desorption process. As a result, the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets achieve a stability up to 2640 h over 110 cycling tests and a high evolution rate of 275 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO. This study offers a new way for developing sustainable CO2 reduction photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrocarbons, including methane, ethene, propene, para&#8208;xylene and ortho&#8208;xylene, are of great significance in current and future chemical industry. Separation and purification of hydrocarbons, such as methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, propene/propane and separation of C8 aromatics, are important processes. Nevertheless, traditional distillation&#8208;based separation accounts for a large portion of the world&#8217;s energy consumption. Porous materials&#8208;based separation is believed to be a promising alternative technology with lower energy consumption and operational cost. This review focuses on the developments of the adsorptive separation of methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, propene/propane mixtures as well as on the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e., xylene isomers) with a wide variety of materials, including carbonaceous materials, zeolites, metal&#8208;organic frameworks and porous&#8208;organic frameworks. Some recent important developments for these adsorptive separations are also highlighted. The advantages and disadvantages of each material category are discussed and guidelines for the design of improved materials are proposed. Furthermore, challenges and future developments of each material type and separation processes are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradable Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Glutathione Depletion Induced Ferroptosis and NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Imaging Guided Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8157-8163, April 6, 2021. </description>

Cysteine&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;transfer complex nanoparticles (TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ and TMB&#8208;TCNQ) are prepared by supramolecular assembly. The nanoparticles not only extend absorption to the NIR&#8208;II region with high PCE of over 42&#8201;%, but also inhibit the intracellular biosynthesis of GSH and induce ferroptosis. TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ is further used for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic imaging guided ferroptosis and photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Suffering from the laborious synthesis and undesirable tumor microenvironment response, the exploitation of novel NIR&#8208;II absorbing organic photothermal agents is of importance to promote phototherapeutic efficacy. Herein, two kinds of charge&#8208;transfer complex nanoparticles (TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ and TMB&#8208;TCNQ) are prepared by supramolecular assembly. Because of the larger energy gap between donor and acceptor, TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ presents higher charge&#8208;transfer degree (72&#8201;%) than that of TMB&#8208;TCNQ (48&#8201;%) in nanoaggregates. Therefore, TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ exhibits stronger NIR&#8208;II absorption ability with a mass extinction coefficient of 15.4&#8197;Lg&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 1300&#8197;nm and excellent photothermal effect. Impressively, the specific cysteine response can make the TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ effectively inhibit the intracellular biosynthesis of GSH, leading to redox dsyhomeostasis and ROS&#8208;mediated ferroptosis. TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ can serve as a contrast agent for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic imaging to guide precise and efficient photothermal therapy in vivo.

         <title>Orthogonal Regulation of Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Sites in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Couplings between Indazoles and Isoprene</title>

The Pd&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent coupling reactions between indazoles and isoprene have been developed through the orthogonal regulation of nucleophilic and electrophilic sites.







Abstract
Depending on the reactant property and reaction mechanism, one major regioisomer can be favored in a reaction that involves multiple active sites. Herein, an orthogonal regulation of nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in the regiodivergent hydroamination of isoprene with indazoles is demonstrated. Under Pd&#8208;hydride catalysis, the 1,2&#8208; or 4,3&#8208;insertion pathway with respect to the electrophilic sites on isoprene could be controlled by the choice of ligands. In terms of the nucleophilic sites on indazoles, the reaction occurs at either the N1&#8208; or N2&#8208;position of indazoles is governed by the acid co&#8208;catalysts. Preliminary experimental studies have been performed to rationalize the mechanism and regioselectivity. This study not only contributes a practical tool for selective functionalization of isoprene, but also provides a guide to manipulate the regioselectivity for the N&#8208;functionalization of indazoles.

         <title>Fungal Dioxygenase AsqJ Is Promiscuous and Bimodal: Substrate&#8208;Directed Formation of Quinolones versus Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8297-8302, April 6, 2021. </description>

AsqJ catalyzes a complex rearrangement sequence in quinolone biosynthesis. We show the AsqJ biocatalytic potential to significantly exceed this natural function. An unprecedented reaction pathway leading to quinazolinones is uncovered, functionally and mechanistically characterized in detail, revealing a unique substrate&#8208;dependent product selectivity in enzyme catalysis.







Abstract
Previous studies showed that the FeII/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase AsqJ induces a skeletal rearrangement in viridicatin biosynthesis in Aspergillus nidulans, generating a quinolone scaffold from benzo[1,4]diazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione substrates. We report that AsqJ catalyzes an additional, entirely different reaction, simply by a change in substituent in the benzodiazepinedione substrate. This new mechanism is established by substrate screening, application of functional probes, and computational analysis. AsqJ excises H2CO from the heterocyclic ring structure of suitable benzo[1,4]diazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione substrates to generate quinazolinones. This novel AsqJ catalysis pathway is governed by a single substituent within the complex substrate. This unique substrate&#8208;directed reactivity of AsqJ enables the targeted biocatalytic generation of either quinolones or quinazolinones, two alkaloid frameworks of exceptional biomedical relevance.

         <title>Exclusive Strain Effect Boosts Overall Water Splitting in PdCu/Ir Core/Shell Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8243-8250, April 6, 2021. </description>

By precisely controlling the thickness of the shell layer, an exclusive strain effect and the complete elimination of the ligand effect can be achieved on the PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals to optimize the d&#8208;band center and boost electrocatalytic overall water splitting performance.







Abstract
Core/shell nanocatalysts are a class of promising materials, which achieve the enhanced catalytic activities through the synergy between ligand effect and strain effect. However, it has been challenging to disentangle the contributions from the two effects, which hinders the rational design of superior core/shell nanocatalysts. Herein, we report precise synthesis of PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals, which can significantly boost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via the exclusive strain effect. The heteroepitaxial coating of four Ir atomic layers onto PdCu nanoparticle gives a relatively thick Ir shell eliminating the ligand effect, but creates a compressive strain of ca. 3.60%. The strained PdCu/Ir catalysts can deliver a low OER overpotential and a high mass activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain in Ir shell downshifts the d&#8208;band center and weakens the binding of the intermediates, causing the enhanced OER activity. The compressive strain also boosts hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and the strained nanocrystals can be served as excellent catalysts for both anode and cathode in overall water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysis.

         <title>Inhibition of Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis and Regulation of Oxidative Stress Based on {SbW8O30} Determined by Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics Analysis</title>

Polyoxometalates (POMs) are shown to act as specific oxidative/antioxidant regulatory agents. Based on proteomics analysis, Na4Ni2Sb2W2&#8208;SbW8 inhibits ATP production by affecting the expression of 16 related proteins and related pathways, hindering metabolic functions in vivo and cell proliferation due to ROS stress.







Abstract
The 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {SbW8O30} was successfully synthesized and exhibited inhibitory activity (IC50=0.29&#8197;&#956;M). Based on proteomics analysis, Na4Ni2Sb2W2&#8208;SbW8 inhibited ATP production by affecting the expression of 16 related proteins, hindering metabolic functions in vivo and cell proliferation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. In particular, the low expression of FAD/FMN&#8208;binding redox enzymes (relative expression ratio of the experimental group to the control=0.43843) could be attributed to the redox mechanism of Na4Ni2Sb2W2&#8208;SbW8, which was consistent with the effect of polyoxometalates (POMs) and FMN&#8208;binding proteins on ATP formation. An electrochemical study showed that Na4Ni2Sb2W2&#8208;SbW8 combined with FMN to form Na4Ni2Sb2W2&#8208;SbW8&#8208;2FMN complex through a one&#8208;electron process of the W atoms. Na4Ni2Sb2W2&#8208;SbW8 acted as catalase and glutathione peroxidase to protect the cell from ROS stress, and the inhibition rates were 63.3&#8201;% at 1.77&#8197;&#956;M of NADPH and 86.06&#8201;% at 10.62&#8197;&#956;M of 2&#8208;hydroxyterephthalic acid. Overall, our results showed that POMs can be specific oxidative/antioxidant regulatory agents.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Anaerobic Mukaiyama&#8208;Type Hydration of Alkenes using Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8313-8320, April 6, 2021. </description>

The highly diastereoselective Fe&#8208;catalyzed anaerobic Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes as oxygenation reagents is reported.







Abstract
Hydration of alkenes using first row transition metals (Fe, Co, Mn) under oxygen atmosphere (Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration) is highly practical for alkene functionalization in complex synthesis. Different hydration protocols have been developed, however, control of the stereoselectivity remains a challenge. Herein, highly diastereoselective Fe&#8208;catalyzed anaerobic Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes as oxygenation reagents is reported. The nitro moiety is not well explored in radical chemistry and nitroarenes are known to suppress free radical processes. Our findings show the potential of cheap nitroarenes as oxygen donors in radical transformations. Secondary and tertiary alcohols were prepared with excellent Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity. The method features large functional group tolerance and is also applicable for late&#8208;stage chemical functionalization.

&lt;p&gt;The highly diastereoselective Fe&#8208;catalyzed anaerobic Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes as oxygenation reagents is reported.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydration of alkenes using first row transition metals (Fe, Co, Mn) under oxygen atmosphere (Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration) is highly practical for alkene functionalization in complex synthesis. Different hydration protocols have been developed, however, control of the stereoselectivity remains a challenge. Herein, highly diastereoselective Fe&#8208;catalyzed anaerobic Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes as oxygenation reagents is reported. The nitro moiety is not well explored in radical chemistry and nitroarenes are known to suppress free radical processes. Our findings show the potential of cheap nitroarenes as oxygen donors in radical transformations. Secondary and tertiary alcohols were prepared with excellent Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity. The method features large functional group tolerance and is also applicable for late&#8208;stage chemical functionalization. The anaerobic protocol outperforms existing hydration methodology in terms of reaction efficiency and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Quantitative Mapping of Glutathione within Intracranial Tumors through Interlocked MRI Signals of a Responsive Nanoprobe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8130-8138, April 6, 2021. </description>

A structurally simple and dimensionally small Fe3O4 nanoparticle&#8208;based GSH responsive MRI probe can form particle aggregates within tumors in vivo to give rise to strong GSH concentration dependent interlocked relaxivities (R1 and R2). This probe was applied to the mapping of the heterogeneous distribution of GSH within an intracranial tumor in vivo.







Abstract
Studies reveal that malignant tumors feature uneven distributions of some key biomarkers across the entire tumorous region. Nevertheless, only very limited progress has been made towards non&#8208;invasive and quantitative detection of tumor&#8208;specific biomarkers in vivo, especially with clinically compatible imaging modalities. Reported here is an Fe3O4 nanoparticle&#8208;based glutathione (GSH) responsive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe that can form particle aggregates within tumors in vivo to give rise to strong GSH concentration dependent interlocked relaxivities. A quantitative correlation between the interlocked MRI signals and local GSH concentration was established, and further applied for mapping the heterogeneous distribution of GSH within an intracranial tumor (2.4&#8197;mm &#215; 1.6&#8197;mm) in vivo. This methodology will offer a practical route for quantitatively mapping tumor&#8208;specific biomarkers in vivo with unlimited detection depth, which largely challenges optical&#8208;imaging&#8208;based approaches.

         <title>Advanced Real&#8208;Time Process Analytics for Multistep Synthesis in Continuous Flow**

Process analytical technologies hold tremendous promise in multistep continuous flow synthesis. Here, four orthogonal real&#8208;time analytical tools are employed in a three step synthesis, with phase separations. Advanced data processing techniques, such as indirect hard modeling and deep learning, facilitate quantification of up to 9 process components. These analytical capabilities are demonstrated for both steady state and dynamic experiments.







Abstract
In multistep continuous flow chemistry, studying complex reaction mixtures in real time is a significant challenge, but provides an opportunity to enhance reaction understanding and control. We report the integration of four complementary process analytical technology tools (NMR, UV/Vis, IR and UHPLC) in the multistep synthesis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, mesalazine. This synthetic route exploits flow processing for nitration, high temperature hydrolysis and hydrogenation reactions, as well as three inline separations. Advanced data analysis models were developed (indirect hard modeling, deep learning and partial least squares regression), to quantify the desired products, intermediates and impurities in real time, at multiple points along the synthetic pathway. The capabilities of the system have been demonstrated by operating both steady state and dynamic experiments and represents a significant step forward in data&#8208;driven continuous flow synthesis.

         <title>Enhanced Concanavalin&#8197;A Binding to Preorganized Mannose Nanoarrays in Glycodendrimersomes Revealed Multivalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8352-8360, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent interactions mediated by the cellular glycocalix are ubiquitous in biological processes. We utilized glycodendrimersomes, a type of synthetic cell membrane mimic to probe the carbohydrate biological activity towards lectins. We demonstrated that mannose could organize the sugar moieties into periodic nanoarrays resulting in a new effective ligand yielding a ten&#8208;fold increase in the kinetic and thermodynamic constant of association.







Abstract
The effect of the two&#8208;dimensional glycan display on glycan&#8208;lectin recognition remains poorly understood despite the importance of these interactions in a plethora of cellular processes, in (patho)physiology, as well as its potential for advanced therapeutics. Faced with this challenge we utilized glycodendrimersomes, a type of synthetic vesicles whose membrane mimics the surface of a cell and offers a means to probe the carbohydrate biological activity. These single&#8208;component vesicles were formed by the self&#8208;assembly of sequence&#8208;defined mannose&#8208;Janus dendrimers, which serve as surrogates for glycolipids. Using atomic force microscopy and molecular modeling we demonstrated that even mannose, a monosaccharide, was capable of organizing the sugar moieties into periodic nanoarrays without the need of the formation of liquid&#8208;ordered phases as assumed necessary for rafts. Kinetics studies of Concanavalin A binding revealed that those nanoarrays resulted in a new effective ligand yielding a ten&#8208;fold increase in the kinetic and thermodynamic constant of association.

         <title>Non&#8208;Carbohydrate Glycomimetics as Inhibitors of Calcium(II)&#8208;Binding Lectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8104-8114, April 6, 2021. </description>

A screening yields the first non&#8208;carbohydrate small molecules mimicking the interaction of carbohydrates in the binding sites of bacterial lectins. The catechols, known as PAINS, were carefully validated in numerous biophysical assays. A crystal structure in complex with Pseudomonas aeruginosa LecA and NMR analyses with mammalian C&#8208;type lectin Langerin prove the catechol moiety as a general replacement motif for carbohydrates in calcium(II)&#8208;binding lectins.







Abstract
Because of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, lectins are considered novel drug targets. Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes LecA and LecB in the infection process. Inhibition of both lectins with carbohydrate&#8208;derived molecules can reduce biofilm formation to restore antimicrobial susceptibility. Here, we focused on non&#8208;carbohydrate inhibitors for LecA to explore new avenues for lectin inhibition. From a screening cascade we obtained one experimentally confirmed hit, a catechol, belonging to the well&#8208;known PAINS compounds. Rigorous analyses validated electron&#8208;deficient catechols as millimolar LecA inhibitors. The first co&#8208;crystal structure of a non&#8208;carbohydrate inhibitor in complex with a bacterial lectin clearly demonstrates the catechol mimicking the binding of natural glycosides with LecA. Importantly, catechol 3 is the first non&#8208;carbohydrate lectin ligand that binds bacterial and mammalian calcium(II)&#8208;binding lectins, giving rise to this fundamentally new class of glycomimetics.

         <title>Photochemical Electrocyclization of Poly(phenylacetylene)s: Unwinding Helices to Elucidate their 3D Structure in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8095-8103, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s in solution was utilized to obtain important structural information that allows determining their helical structures (cis&#8208;cisoidal (&#969;1&lt;90&#176;) or cis&#8208;transoidal (&#969;1&gt;90&#176;)) while it also provides an estimated value of &#969;1. When applied to mixtures, it allows the identification of the different helical scaffolds that coexist in solution.







Abstract
Photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is used for the structural elucidation of a polyene backbone. This method not only allows classification of PPAs in cis&#8208;cisoidal (&#969;1&lt;90&#176;) or cis&#8208;transoidal structures (&#969;1&gt;90&#176;), but also approximating &#969;1.

PPAs with a cis&#8208;cisoidal structure show a reduction of the ECD signal of at least 50&#8201;% before 30&#8197;min of irradiation, while cis&#8208;transoidal helices need much longer time because the transoidal bond must be isomerized. The different cis&#8208;cisoidal and cis&#8208;transoidal helices require different times to decrease their ECD signal by 50&#8201;% (t1/2), depending on the degree of compression or stretching of the helix, establishing a relationship between the secondary structure adopted by PPA (&#969;1) and the time required to lose the ECD vinylic signal by light irradiation.

&lt;p&gt;The photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s in solution was utilized to obtain important structural information that allows determining their helical structures (cis&#8208;cisoidal (&lt;i&gt;&#969;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is used for the structural elucidation of a polyene backbone. This method not only allows classification of PPAs in cis&#8208;cisoidal (&#969;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;90&#176;) or cis&#8208;transoidal structures (&#969;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;90&#176;), but also approximating &#969;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. A PPA solution is illuminated with visible light and monitoring the photochemical electrocyclization of the PPA helix by measuring the ECD spectra at different times. PPAs with a cis&#8208;cisoidal structure show a reduction of the ECD signal of at least 50&#8201;% before 30&#8197;min of irradiation, while cis&#8208;transoidal helices need much longer time because the transoidal bond must be isomerized.

         <title>Highly Efficient Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Molecular Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8337-8343, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic molecular passivators with different terminal groups are synthesized, which can effectively passivate the surface defects of MAPbI3&#8208;based films by forming mixed&#8208;phase perovskite nanograins. Moreover, highly efficient PeLEDs with EQE of 15.6&#8201;% are achieved by utilizing an imidazolium terminated passivator. This work opens up a new opportunity of molecular engineering for the development of high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are promising for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), but still suffer from defects&#8208;mediated nonradiative losses, which represent a major efficiency&#8208;limiting factor in perovskite&#8208;based LEDs (PeLEDs). Reported here is a strategy to synthesize molecular passivators with different anchoring groups for defects passivation. The passivated perovskite thin films exhibit improved optoelectronic properties as well as reduced grain size and surface roughness, thus enable highly efficient PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency of 15.6&#8201;% using an imidazolium terminated passivator. Further demonstrated is that the in situ formation of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite phase on the surface of three&#8208;dimensional perovskite nanograins is responsible for surface defects passivation, which leads to significantly enhanced device performance. Our results provide new fundamental insights into the role of organic molecular passivators in boosting the performance of PeLEDs.

         <title>Iron Oxidation in Escherichia coli Bacterioferritin Ferroxidase Centre, a Site Designed to React Rapidly with H2O2 but Slowly with O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8361-8369, April 6, 2021. </description>

The kinetics of E. coli bacterioferritin di&#8208;ferrous ferroxidase centre reacting with O2 and H2O2 shows that H2O2 reacts circa 1000 times faster than O2 implying that the primary in vivo role of the protein is ROS detoxification rather than iron sequestering.







Abstract
Both O2 and H2O2 can oxidize iron at the ferroxidase center (FC) of Escherichia coli bacterioferritin (EcBfr) but mechanistic details of the two reactions need clarification. UV/Vis, EPR, and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopies have been used to follow the reactions when apo&#8208;EcBfr, pre&#8208;loaded anaerobically with Fe2+, was exposed to O2 or H2O2. We show that O2 binds di&#8208;Fe2+ FC reversibly, two Fe2+ ions are oxidized in concert and a H2O2 molecule is formed and released to the solution. This peroxide molecule further oxidizes another di&#8208;Fe2+ FC, at a rate circa 1000 faster than O2, ensuring an overall 1:4 stoichiometry of iron oxidation by O2. Initially formed Fe3+ can further react with H2O2 (producing protein bound radicals) but relaxes within seconds to an H2O2&#8208;unreactive di&#8208;Fe3+ form. The data obtained suggest that the primary role of EcBfr in vivo may be to detoxify H2O2 rather than sequester iron.

         <title>Development of High&#8208;Performance Pyrimidine Nucleoside and Oligonucleotide Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8164-8173, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a library of 26 deoxyuridine&#8208; and deoxycytidine&#8208;derived diarylethenes we identified two high&#8208;performance photoswitches with near&#8208;quantitative, fully reversible back&#8208;and&#8208;forth switching, high reaction quantum yields and no detectable thermal or photochemical deterioration. Incorporated into an oligonucleotide, these nucleotides allowed the optochemical modulation of the activity of T7 RNA polymerase.







Abstract
Nucleosidic and oligonucleotidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes with high application potential. However, their further development is hampered by the poor understanding of how the chemical structure modulates the photochromic properties. Here we synthesized 26 systematically varied deoxyuridine&#8208; and deoxycytidine&#8208;derived DAEs and analyzed reaction quantum yields, composition of the photostationary states, thermal and photochemical stability, and reversibility. This analysis identified two high&#8208;performance photoswitches with near&#8208;quantitative, fully reversible back&#8208;and&#8208;forth switching and no detectable thermal or photochemical deterioration. When incorporated into an oligonucleotide with the sequence of a promotor, the nucleotides maintained their photochromism and allowed the modulation of the transcription activity of T7 RNA polymerase with an up to 2.4&#8208;fold turn&#8208;off factor, demonstrating the potential for optochemical control of biological processes.

         <title>Vapochromic Behaviors of A Solid&#8208;State Supramolecular Polymer Based on Exo&#8208;Wall Complexation of Perethylated Pillar[5]arene with 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetracyanobenzene</title>

A vapochromic solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer is constructed based on the exo&#8208;wall complexation between perethylated pillar[5]arene and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene. It changes its color from brown to reddish brown or black after adsorption of CH2Cl2 and aldehyde vapors. This vapochromic property is attributed to the change of charge&#8208;transfer interaction between these two compounds caused by the molecular rearrangement induced by vapor capture.







Abstract
The research for the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymers with specific functions accelerates the development of supramolecular and materials sciences. Herein, we discover the different complexation modes of perethylated pillar[5]arene (EtP5) with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) in various solvents. Driven by charge&#8208;transfer interaction, TCNB is enclosed in the cavity of EtP5 in CHCl3, while TCNB complexes with EtP5 at the exo&#8208;wall of EtP5 in CH2Cl2. This is because the size of CH2Cl2 matches the cavity of EtP5, forcing TCNB to complex with the exo&#8208;wall of EtP5. Furthermore, we fabricate a vapochromic solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer by exploiting the exo&#8208;wall complexation, which turns from brown to reddish brown or black after adsorption of alkyl aldehyde vapors. The adsorptive nature for alkyl aldehyde vapors comes from the unoccupied cavity of EtP5 based on C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The vapochromic property is attributed to the change of the charge&#8208;transfer interaction caused by molecular rearrangement induced by vapor&#8208;capture in the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer.

This vapochromic property is attributed to the change of charge&#8208;transfer interaction between these two compounds caused by the molecular rearrangement induced by vapor capture.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research for the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymers with specific functions accelerates the development of supramolecular and materials sciences. Herein, we discover the different complexation modes of perethylated pillar[5]arene (&lt;b&gt;EtP5&lt;/b&gt;) with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (&lt;b&gt;TCNB&lt;/b&gt;) in various solvents. Driven by charge&#8208;transfer interaction, &lt;b&gt;TCNB&lt;/b&gt; is enclosed in the cavity of &lt;b&gt;EtP5&lt;/b&gt; in CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, while &lt;b&gt;TCNB&lt;/b&gt; complexes with &lt;b&gt;EtP5&lt;/b&gt; at the exo&#8208;wall of &lt;b&gt;EtP5&lt;/b&gt; in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because the size of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matches the cavity of &lt;b&gt;EtP5&lt;/b&gt;, forcing &lt;b&gt;TCNB&lt;/b&gt; to complex with the exo&#8208;wall of &lt;b&gt;EtP5&lt;/b&gt;. Furthermore, we fabricate a vapochromic solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer by exploiting the exo&#8208;wall complexation, which turns from brown to reddish brown or black after adsorption of alkyl aldehyde vapors. The adsorptive nature for alkyl aldehyde vapors comes from the unoccupied cavity of &lt;b&gt;EtP5&lt;/b&gt; based on C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The vapochromic property is attributed to the change of the charge&#8208;transfer interaction caused by molecular rearrangement induced by vapor&#8208;capture in the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bright and Robust Phosphorescence Achieved by Non&#8208;Covalent Clipping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8212-8219, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;organized tweezer receptor has been constructed to encapsulate triplet emitters. The emitters displayed bright and robust phosphorescence in versatile media upon non&#8208;covalent clipping, regardless of emitter concentration, oxygen content, and environmental polarity variations.







Abstract
Phosphorescent materials with bright emission in versatile media are important for their practical applications, which require to lower the susceptibility of triplet excitons to surroundings. Herein a non&#8208;covalent clipping strategy has been developed to attain this objective, by designing a tweezer receptor to encapsulate PtII&#8208;based triplet emitters through two&#8208;fold &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. The PtII emitters display robust phosphorescence by virtue of synergistic rigidifying and shielding effects, which are hardly influenced by emitter concentration, oxygen content, and solvent polarity changes. The phosphorescent colors are elaborately modulated by varying ligand substitutes on PtII emitters. Circularly polarized phosphorescence is further amplified for chiral PtII emitters, by taking advantage of dual phosphorescence and chirality enhancement upon non&#8208;covalent tweezer complexation. Overall, the clipping approach paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance phosphorescent materials with bright emission, environmental robustness, and facile color tunability.

         <title>Ferroptosis Photoinduced by New Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes and Its Synergism with Apoptosis in Tumor Cell Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8174-8181, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced cell ferroptosis was observed for two new IrIII complexes. A mitochondria&#8208;targeting IrIII complex demonstrated synergism of ferroptosis and apoptosis, which effectively suppressed refractory tumor cell lines upon photoirradiation.







Abstract
Limited therapeutic efficacy to hypoxic and refractory solid tumors has hindered the practical application of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Two new benzothiophenylisoquinoline (btiq)&#8208;derived cyclometalated IrIII complexes, IrL1 and MitoIrL2, were constructed as potent photosensitizers, with the latter being designed for mitochondria accumulation. Both complexes demonstrated a type&#8197;I PDT process and caused photoinduced ferroptosis in tumor cells under hypoxia. This ferroptosis featured lipid peroxide accumulation, mitochondria shrinkage, down&#8208;regulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and ferrostatin&#8208;1 (Fer&#8208;1)&#8208;inhibited cell death. Upon photoirradiation under hypoxia, mitochondria targeting MitoIrL2 caused mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) collapse, ATP production suppression, and induced cell apoptosis. The synergetic effect of ferroptosis and apoptosis causes MitoIrL2 to outperform IrL1 in inhibiting the growth of MCF&#8208;7, PANC&#8208;1, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells and multicellular spheroids. This study demonstrates the first example of ferroptosis induced by photosensitizing IrIII complexes. Moreover, the synergism of ferroptosis and apoptosis provides a promising approach for combating hypoxic solid tumors through type&#8197;I PDT processes.

         <title>Li&#8208;Rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8289-8296, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 (Li2NCM811) contains twice as much Li as NCM811 and can be converted into NCM811 by de&#8208;intercalation of Li&#8208;ions. When applied in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries, Li2NCM811 can release a large amount of Li&#8208;ions during the first charging process to supplement the Li loss in the anode, then convert into NCM811, thus extending the lifespan of the battery without the introduction of inactive elements.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries can maximize the energy density at the cell level. However, without the Li compensation from the anode side, it faces much more challenging to achieve a long cycling life with a competitive energy density than Li metal&#8208;based batteries. Here, we prolong the lifespan of an anode&#8208;free Li metal battery by introducing Li&#8208;rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 into the cathode as a Li&#8208;ions extender. The Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 can release a large amount of Li&#8208;ions during the first charging process to supplement the Li loss in the anode, then convert into NCM811, thus extending the lifespan of the battery without the introduction of inactive elements. By the benefit of Li&#8208;rich cathode and high reversibility of Li metal on Cu foil, the anode&#8208;free pouch cells enable to achieve 447&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 energy density and 84&#8201;% capacity retention after 100 cycles in the condition of limited electrolyte addition (E/C ratio of 2&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1).

         <title>Photo&#8208;responsive Helical Motion by Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors in a Liquid&#8208;Crystal Network</title>

By exploiting the dynamic chirality, directionality of motion and shape change of a single light&#8208;driven motor embedded in a liquid&#8208;crystal network, complex mechanical motions including bending, walking and helical motion, in soft polymer materials are achieved which offers fascinating opportunities toward inherently photo&#8208;responsive materials.







Abstract
Controlling sophisticated motion by molecular motors is a major goal on the road to future actuators and soft robotics. Taking inspiration from biological motility and mechanical functions common to artificial machines, responsive small molecules have been used to achieve macroscopic effects, however, translating molecular movement along length scales to precisely defined linear, twisting and rotary motions remain particularly challenging. Here, we present the design, synthesis and functioning of liquid&#8208;crystal network (LCN) materials with intrinsic rotary motors that allow the conversion of light energy into reversible helical motion. In this responsive system the photochemical&#8208;driven molecular motor has a dual function operating both as chiral dopant and unidirectional rotor amplifying molecular motion into a controlled and reversible left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed macroscopic twisting movement. By exploiting the dynamic chirality, directionality of motion and shape change of a single motor embedded in an LC&#8208;network, complex mechanical motions including bending, walking and helical motion, in soft polymer materials are achieved which offers fascinating opportunities toward inherently photo&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Dually&#8208;Passivated Perovskite Solar Cells with Reduced Voltage Loss and Increased Super Oxide Resistance</title>

A practical and straightforward method to reduce the defects of polycrystalline perovskite films is exploited by introducing functional fluorinated molecules at two different stages of film formation. The PSCs based on the DP strategy can simultaneously improve device performance and stability by effectively inhibiting the formation of superoxide species due to minimized defects at the perovskite surface and GBs.







Abstract
In recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has witnessed rapid progress. Nevertheless, the pervasive defects prone to non&#8208;radiative recombination and decomposition exist at the surface and the grain boundaries (GBs) of the polycrystalline perovskite films. Herein, we report a comprehensive dual&#8208;passivation (DP) strategy to effectively passivate the defects at both surface and GBs to enhance device performance and stability further. Firstly, a fluorinated perylene&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide derivative is permeated in the perovskite metaphase during antisolvent treatment, and then a fluorinated bulky aromatic ammonium salt is introduced over the annealed perovskite. The reduction of defect density can be unambiguously proved by the superoxide species generation/quenching reaction. As a result, optimized planar PSCs demonstrate a decreased open&#8208;circuit voltages deficit from 0.47 to 0.39&#8197;V and the best efficiency of 23.80&#8201;% from photocurrent scanning with a stabilized maximum power output efficiency of 22.99&#8201;%. Without encapsulation, one typical device can maintain over 85&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after heating on a hot plate at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8197;h under relative humidity (RH) of 70&#8201;%. When the device is aged under 30&#177;5&#8201;% RH, over 97&#8201;% of its initial PCE is retained after 1700&#8197;h.

Genetic activation artificially induced a plasmid&#8208;encoded natural product biosynthetic gene cluster and activated the complex biosynthesis of a previously unknown cytotoxin named sandarazol. Its biosynthesis is unique in featuring the genetic blueprint for the formation of intriguing structural features such as an &#945;&#8208;chlorinated ketone, an epoxyketone, and a rare (2R)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)&#8208;propionic acid building block.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new plasmid found in Sandaracinus&#8197;sp. MSr10575 named pSa001 spanning 209.7&#8197;kbp that harbors a cryptic secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC). Activation of this BGC by homologous&#8208;recombination&#8208;mediated exchange of the native promoter sequence against a vanillate inducible system led to the production and subsequent isolation and structure elucidation of novel secondary metabolites, the sandarazols&#8197;A&#8211;G. The sandarazols contain intriguing structural features and very reactive functional groups such as an &#945;&#8208;chlorinated ketone, an epoxyketone, and a (2R)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)&#8208;propionic acid building block. In&#8208;depth investigation of the underlying biosynthetic machinery led to a concise biosynthetic model for the new compound family, including several uncommon biosynthetic steps. The chlorinated congener sandarazol&#8197;C shows an IC50&#8197;value of 0.5&#8197;&#956;m against HCT&#8197;116 cells and a MIC of 14&#8197;&#956;m against Mycobacterium smegmatis, which points at the sandarazols&#8217; potential function as defensive secondary metabolites or toxins.

         <title>Hysteretic Control of Near&#8208;infrared Transparency Using a Liquescent Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8284-8288, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;dependent hysteretic changes in near&#8208;infrared transparency were achieved for a liquescent bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#8208;(dihydrophenazine radical cation) salt. These hysteretic changes were attributed to dynamic dissociation and association of a dimer structure for the radical cations, which accompanied the solid&#8211;liquid phase transitions even under neat conditions with no measurable degradation of the compound.







Abstract
A liquescent dihydrophenazine radical cation, 1.+&#8901;NTf2&#8722;, showed drastic changes in near&#8208;infrared (near&#8208;IR) transparency and opaqueness through hysteretic phase transitions with no measurable degradation of the compound even under aerated conditions. During the heating and slow cooling process (0.5&#8197;K&#8201;min&#8722;1), its electronic and magnetic properties were altered clearly and repeatedly changed between solid and liquid states. The liquid state was transparent to near&#8208;IR light (940&#8197;nm), but the solid state was opaque, despite both samples exhibiting a similar green color under room light. Additionally, the liquid state was changed to a glass state under a fast cooling process (2&#8211;10&#8197;K&#8201;min&#8722;1). UV/Vis/near&#8208;IR and electron spin&#8208;resonance spectroscopy revealed that these drastic changes were attributable to the dynamic dissociation and association of a &#960;&#8208;dimer structure for 1.+ accompanying with the solid&#8211;liquid phase transitions even under the neat conditions.

Enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) enabled the monomer&#8211;excimer transition of a coumarin dye (Cou) at low molecular concentrations. The resulting higher ordered luminescent supramolecular assemblies (that is, nanofibers) efficiently recorded the spatiotemporal details of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
It is challenging to construct high&#8208;performing excimer&#8208;based luminescent analytic tools at low molecular concentrations. We report that enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) enables the monomer&#8211;excimer transition of a coumarin dye (Cou) at low molecular concentrations, and the resulting higher ordered luminescent supramolecular assemblies (i.e., nanofibers) efficiently record the spatiotemporal details of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Cou was conjugated to short self&#8208;assembly peptides with a hydrophilic ALP&#8208;responsive group. By ALP triggering, EISA actuated a nanoparticles&#8211;nanofibers transition at low peptide concentrations followed by monomer&#8211;excimer transition of Cou. Analysis of structure&#8211;property relationships revealed that the self&#8208;assembly motif was a prerequisite for peptides to induce the monomer&#8211;excimer transition of Cou. Luminescent supramolecular nanofibers of pYD (LSN&#8208;pYD) illuminated the intercellular bridge of cancer cells and distinguished cancer cells (tissues) from normal cells (tissues) efficiently and rapidly, promising potential use for the early diagnosis of cancer. This work extends the functions of EISA and provides a new application of supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2) Cycloadditions of Alkynylidenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8182-8188, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective cycloaddition of alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) promoted by an earth&#8208;abundant metal is described. A chiral low&#8208;valent CoI complex generated in situ from a CoII precursor, catalyzes an intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition between ACPs and alkynes, to give fused bicyclic products in good yields and with excellent er values.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent cobalt complexes equipped with chiral ligands can efficiently promote highly enantioselective (3+2) cycloadditions of alkyne&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes. The annulation allows to assemble bicyclic systems containing five&#8208;membered rings in good yields and with excellent enantiomeric ratios. We also present a mechanistic discussion based on experimental and computational data, which support the involvement of CoI/CoIII catalytic cycles.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Enabled O3 Phase Stabilization for Manganese&#8208;Rich Layered Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8258-8267, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
O3 to P3 phase transition in layered sodium cathode materials induces large volume change and is detrimental to the performance. This work shows that the creation of transition metal and oxygen vacancies in the layered material can trigger multiple metastable intermediate phases, which substantially prohibits the O3 to P3 phase transition and enables high&#8208;performance Na and Mn&#8208;rich layered materials.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide materials hold great potential as low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, they usually form a P2 phase and suffer from fast capacity fade. In this work, an O3 phase sodium cathode has been developed out of a Li and Mn&#8208;rich layered material by leveraging the creation of transition metal (TM) and oxygen vacancies and the electrochemical exchange of Na and Li. The Mn&#8208;rich layered cathode material remains primarily O3 phase during sodiation/desodiation and can have a full sodiation capacity of ca. 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. It delivers ca. 160&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific capacity between 2&#8211;3.8&#8197;V with &gt;86&#8201;% retention over 250&#8197;cycles. The TM and oxygen vacancies pre&#8208;formed in the sodiated material enables a reversible migration of TMs from the TM layer to the tetrahedral sites in the Na layer upon de&#8208;sodiation and sodiation. The migration creates metastable states, leading to increased kinetic barrier that prohibits a complete O3&#8208;P3 phase transition.

         <title>Site Selective Chlorination of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds Suitable for Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8276-8283, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing methods for the chlorination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds occur with low site&#8208;selectivity and tolerance for functional groups. We report a highly selective chlorination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients by a reaction design that separates the components abstracting the H&#8208;atom (an azidoiodinane) and transferring the chlorine atom (a copper(II) chloride complex).







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;Cl bonds are present in numerous biologically active small molecules, and an ideal route for their preparation is by the chlorination of a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond. However, most current methods for the chlorination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds are insufficiently site selective and tolerant of functional groups to be applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. We report a method for the highly selective chlorination of tertiary and benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to produce the corresponding chlorides, generally in high yields. The reaction occurs with a mixture of an azidoiodinane, which generates a selective H&#8208;atom abstractor under mild conditions, and a readily&#8208;accessible and inexpensive copper(II) chloride complex, which efficiently transfers a chlorine atom. The reaction's exceptional functional group tolerance is demonstrated by the chlorination of &gt;30 diversely functionalized substrates and the late&#8208;stage chlorination of a dozen derivatives of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <title>Large&#8208;Peptide Permeation Through a Membrane Channel: Understanding Protamine Translocation Through CymA from Klebsiella Oxytoca**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8089-8094, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprisingly, large peptides (Protamine, 5.1&#8197;kDa) can permeate through bacterial outer membrane channels. The use of fluorescence, electrophysiology, and all&#8208;atom modeling allows to quantify the flux. This approach can be transferred to related problems.







Abstract
Quantifying the passage of the large peptide protamine (Ptm) across CymA, a passive channel for cyclodextrin uptake, is in the focus of this study. Using a reporter&#8208;pair&#8208;based fluorescence membrane assay we detected the entry of Ptm into liposomes containing CymA. The kinetics of the Ptm entry was independent of its concentration suggesting that the permeation through CymA is the rate&#8208;limiting factor. Furthermore, we reconstituted single CymA channels into planar lipid bilayers and recorded the ion current fluctuations in the presence of Ptm. To this end, we were able to resolve the voltage&#8208;dependent entry of single Ptm peptide molecules into the channel. Extrapolation to zero voltage revealed about 1&#8211;2&#8197;events per second and long dwell times, in agreement with the liposome study. Applied&#8208;field and steered molecular dynamics simulations added an atomistic view of the permeation events. It can be concluded that a concentration gradient of 1&#8197;&#956;m Ptm leads to a translocation rate of about one molecule per second and per channel.

         <title>Efficient n&#8208;Doping of Polymeric Semiconductors through Controlling the Dynamics of Solution&#8208;State Polymer Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8189-8197, April 6, 2021. </description>

The dynamic behaviors of conjugated polymer aggregates in solution are correlated with the solid&#8208;state doping efficiency of polymer films. The n&#8208;type electrical conductivity of the polymer P(PzDPP&#8208;CT2) can be significantly enhanced by controlling the dynamics of solution&#8208;state aggregates. The method is general and can be used for other polymer systems with different aggregation tendencies and dynamic behaviors.







Abstract
Doping of polymeric semiconductors limits the miscibility between polymers and dopants. Although significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing miscibility through chemical modification, the electrical conductivities of n&#8208;doped polymeric semiconductors are usually below 10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. We report a different approach to overcome the miscibility issue by modulating the solution&#8208;state aggregates of conjugated polymers. We found that the solution&#8208;state aggregates of conjugated polymers not only changed with solvent and temperature but also changed with solution aging time. Modulating the solution&#8208;state polymer aggregates can directly influence their solid&#8208;state microstructures and miscibility with dopants. As a result, both high doping efficiency and high charge&#8208;carrier mobility were simultaneously obtained. The n&#8208;doped electrical conductivity of P(PzDPP&#8208;CT2) can be tuned up to 32.1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. This method can also be used to improve the doping efficiency of other polymer systems (e.g. N2200) with different aggregation tendencies and behaviors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doping of polymeric semiconductors limits the miscibility between polymers and dopants. Although significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing miscibility through chemical modification, the electrical conductivities of n&#8208;doped polymeric semiconductors are usually below 10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. We report a different approach to overcome the miscibility issue by modulating the solution&#8208;state aggregates of conjugated polymers. We found that the solution&#8208;state aggregates of conjugated polymers not only changed with solvent and temperature but also changed with solution aging time. Modulating the solution&#8208;state polymer aggregates can directly influence their solid&#8208;state microstructures and miscibility with dopants. As a result, both high doping efficiency and high charge&#8208;carrier mobility were simultaneously obtained. The n&#8208;doped electrical conductivity of P(PzDPP&#8208;CT2) can be tuned up to 32.1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This method can also be used to improve the doping efficiency of other polymer systems (e.g. N2200) with different aggregation tendencies and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Surface Modification of Black Phosphorus with Group 13 Lewis Acids for Ambient Protection and Electronic Tuning</title>

A match made for black P: Modifying black P with chemically&#8208;matched Lewis acids imparts remarkable ambient stability, excellent transport properties, and persistent p&#8208;doping. Compatible with device fabrication and relying on commercially available reagents, this facile protocol opens a path for deterministic and persistent tuning of electronic properties in black P.







Abstract
Herein we introduce a facile, solution&#8208;phase protocol to modify the Lewis basic surface of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (bP) and demonstrate its effectiveness at providing ambient stability and tuning of electronic properties. Commercially available group 13 Lewis acids that range in electrophilicity, steric bulk, and Pearson hard/soft&#8208;ness are evaluated. The nature of the interaction between the Lewis acids and the bP lattice is investigated using a range of microscopic (optical, atomic force, scanning electron) and spectroscopic (energy dispersive, X&#8208;ray photoelectron) methods. Al and Ga halides are most effective at preventing ambient degradation of bP (&gt;84&#8197;h for AlBr3), and the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors show excellent IV characteristics, photocurrent, and current stability, and are significantly p&#8208;doped. This protocol, chemically matched to bP and compatible with device fabrication, opens a path for deterministic and persistent tuning of the electronic properties in bP.

         <title>The Design of a GLP&#8208;1/PYY Dual Acting Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8268-8275, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A GLP&#8208;1/PYY hybrid analogue of the two non&#8208;homologous peptides, GLP&#8208;1 and PYY, activating both GLP&#8208;1 and Y2 receptors that belong to different receptor families, was designed and shown to have increased in vivo efficacy compared to the mono&#8208;agonist analogue versions in an acute food intake study in mice.







Abstract
The two gut hormones GLP&#8208;1 and PYY3&#8211;36, which are both secreted from the L&#8208;cells upon food stimuli, have a stronger inhibitory effect on food intake when they are combined, compared to their individual effects as single agonists. Although they are not homologous and share no sequence similarity, we show that a GLP&#8208;1 analogue can be designed to exhibit potent activity on both the Y2 and GLP&#8208;1 receptors. Dual acting hybrid analogues were realized by designing truncated and potent Y2 receptor PYY analogues, followed by integrating the critical residues into GLP&#8208;1. In this study, we show that one of these dual acting agonists acutely reduces food intake significantly more than the respective mono&#8208;agonist counterparts.

         <title>Towards Photoswitchable Contrast Agents for Absolute 3D Temperature MR Imaging</title>

Temperature is a clinical marker for tissue metabolism and can be used for the detection of diseases. Besides intrinsic magnetic resonance (MR) methods for relative temperature changes, there are only limited methods for absolute temperature imaging. In this study we present an in vitro method with a photoswitchable contrast agent for absolute and concentration independent 3D temperature imaging.







Abstract
Temperature can be used as clinical marker for tissue metabolism and the detection of inflammations or tumors. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for monitoring physiological parameters like the temperature noninvasively is steadily increasing. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study of MRI contrast agents (CA) for absolute and concentration independent temperature imaging. These CAs are based on azoimidazole substituted NiII porphyrins, which can undergo Light&#8208;Driven Coordination&#8208;Induced Spin State Switching (LD&#8208;CISSS) in solution. Monitoring the fast first order kinetic of back isomerisation (cis to trans) with standard clinical MR imaging sequences allows the determination of half&#8208;lives, that can be directly translated into absolute temperatures. Different temperature responsive CAs were successfully tested as prototypes in methanol&#8208;based gels and created temperature maps of gradient phantoms with high spatial resolution (0.13&#215;0.13&#215;1.1&#8197;mm) and low temperature errors (&lt;0.22&#8201;&#176;C). The method is sufficiently fast to record the temperature flow from a heat source as a film.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Water Stable Uranyl(V) Complexes</title>

The tridentate dipicolinate ligand dpa2&#8722;, allowed to stabilize and isolate mononuclear and trinuclear uranyl(V) species in anoxic basic water providing the second example ever isolated of a water stable uranyl(V) and further demonstrating the environmental relevance of UV. The uranyl(VI), uranyl(V) and UIV dipicolinate complexes show very different measurable luminescent spectra characteristic of the uranium oxidation state.







Abstract
The importance of uranyl(V) (UO2+) species associated with environmental and geologic applications is becoming increasingly evident, but the tendency of the uranyl(V) cation to disproportionate in water has prevented the isolation of stable complexes. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of the tridentate complexing dipicolinate (dpa2&#8722;), a ligand highly abundant in soil, the uranyl(V) species can be stabilized and isolated in anoxic basic water. Stable uranyl(V) dipicolinate complexes are readily formed from the reduction of the uranyl(VI) analogue both in organic solution and in basic water, and their solution and solid&#8208;state structure were determined. A bis&#8208;dpa UVO2+ complex was obtained from water at pH&#8197;10, while at higher pH values, a trinuclear mono&#8208;dpa cation&#8208;cation complex was isolated. These results present the second ever isolated water stable uranyl(V) complex. Moreover, we demonstrate that dipicolinate complexes of UVIO22+, UVO2+ and UIV are strongly luminescent with a signature characteristic of each oxidation state. This provides unique examples of luminescent UV and UIV compounds.

         <title>Steering Electron&#8211;Hole Migration Pathways Using Oxygen Vacancies in Tungsten Oxides to Enhance Their Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8236-8242, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In photocatalytic oxygen evolution, some excited electrons can be trapped more easily to form trapped state electrons due to the presence of oxygen vacancies in Ov&#8208;WO3&#8208;600. This process can partially inhibit direct recombination and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charges. In addition, photodeposited Pt can serve as an active site to capture the trapped state electrons to react with electron sacrificial agents.







Abstract
The overall water splitting efficiency is mainly restricted by the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution. Therefore, it is essential to develop active oxygen evolution catalysts. In this context, we designed and synthesized a tungsten oxide catalyst with oxygen vacancies for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, which exhibited a higher oxygen evolution rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 than that of pure WO3 (159&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1). Subsequent studies through transient absorption spectroscopy found that the oxygen vacancies can produce electron trapping states to inhibit the direct recombination of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a Pt cocatalyst can promote electron trap states to participate in the reaction to improve the photocatalytic performance further. This work uses femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to explain the photocatalytic oxygen evolution mechanism of inorganic materials and provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;efficiency water&#8208;splitting catalysts.

         <title>Heterometallic Actinide&#8208;Containing Photoresponsive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Dynamic and Static Tuning of Electronic Properties</title>

The merging of heterometallic actinide&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic frameworks and photochromic moieties allowed for dynamic tailoring of electronics properties as a function of excitation wavelength. Visualization of material photoswitchable behavior was demonstrated by construction of the first photochromic MOF&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor.







Abstract
Acquiring fundamental knowledge of properties of actinide&#8208;based materials is a necessary step to create new possibilities for addressing the current challenges in the nuclear energy and nuclear waste sectors. In this report, we established a photophysics&#8211;electronics correlation for actinide&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (An&#8208;MOFs) as a function of excitation wavelength, for the first time. A stepwise approach for dynamically modulating electronic properties was applied for the first time towards actinide&#8208;based heterometallic MOFs through integration of photochromic linkers. Optical cycling, modeling of density of states near the Fermi edge, conductivity measurements, and photoisomerization kinetics were employed to shed light on the process of tailoring optoelectronic properties of An&#8208;MOFs. Furthermore, the first photochromic MOF&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor, in which the field&#8208;effect response could be changed through light exposure, was constructed. As a demonstration, the change in current upon light exposure was sufficient to operate a two&#8208;LED fail&#8208;safe indicator circuit.

         <title>Observation of Transition from Ferroelasticity to Ferroelectricity by Solvent Selective Effect in Anilinium Bromide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8198-8202, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent selective effect for the regulation of ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity of anilinium bromide is described, which is unprecedented in organic molecular ferroelectrics. Two forms of crystal structure were obtained from different crystallization solvents: ferroelastic AB&#8208;1 and ferroelectric AB&#8208;2. Atom key: Br (green), N (blue), H (light blue), C (gray).







Abstract
Organic ferroelectrics are highly desirable for their light weight, mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility. However, the rational design of organic ferroelectrics has always faced great challenges. Anilinium bromide (AB) has two structures reported in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, which might be an mmmF2/m type ferroelastic (AB&#8208;1). When we studied its ferroelasticity, we were surprised to discover that there was another crystal (AB&#8208;2) in H2O besides this one, and they were very difficult to separate. By changing the solvent, we found that AB&#8208;1 crystals could be formed in ethanol, where ferroelastic domains were visualized by polarized light microscopy, and AB&#8208;2 crystals could be obtained from various crystallization solvents of methanol, isopropanol, N&#8208;butanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide, which undergo a ferroelectric phase transition with mm2Fm, showing clear ferroelectricity in two phases. To our knowledge, the regulation of ferroelasticity to ferroelectricity by solvent selective effect is unprecedented in the field of ferroelectrics. This work reveals the important role of solvent effect in organic ferroelectrics.

         <title>Mixed Noble&#8208;Gas Compounds of Krypton(II) and Xenon(VI); [F5Xe(FKrF)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FKrF)2AsF6]</title>

KrF2 and [XeF5][AsF6] react in anhydrous HF to form [F5Xe(FKrF)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FKrF)2AsF6]. The complexes were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The KrF2 ligands interact with xenon(VI) through Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;FKrF secondary bonds that are shown by computational studies to be noncovalent, electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The complexes provide unique examples of mixed noble&#8208;gas compounds.







Abstract
The coordination chemistry of KrF2 has been limited in contrast with that of XeF2, which exhibits a far richer coordination chemistry with main&#8208;group and transition&#8208;metal cations. In the present work, reactions of [XeF5][AsF6] with KrF2 in anhydrous HF solvent afforded [F5Xe(FKrF)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FKrF)2AsF6], the first mixed krypton/xenon compounds. X&#8208;ray crystal structures and Raman spectra show the KrF2 ligands and [AsF6]&#8722; anions are F&#8208;coordinated to the xenon atoms of the [XeF5]+ cations. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are consistent with essentially noncovalent ligand&#8722;xenon bonds that may be described in terms of &#963;&#8208;hole bonding. These complexes significantly extend the XeF2&#8211;KrF2 analogy and the limited chemistry of krypton by introducing a new class of coordination compound in which KrF2 functions as a ligand that coordinates to xenon(VI). The HF solvates, [F5Xe(FH)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FH)SbF6], are also characterized in this study and they provide rare examples of HF coordinated to xenon(VI).

         <title>Oxalohydrazide Ligands for Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;O Coupling Reactions with High Turnover Numbers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8203-8211, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl halides with phenols and aliphatic alcohols to form biaryl ethers and alkyl aryl ethers, with loadings down to 125&#8197;ppm of the combination of CuBr and oxalohydrazide ligands with broad scope, is reported. Experiments on reaction rates show that the copper catalysts ligated by oxalohydrazide ligands are long lived with measurably higher initial rates than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art copper catalysts.







Abstract
Here, we report a class of ligands based on oxalohydrazide cores and N&#8208;amino pyrrole and N&#8208;amino indole units that generates long&#8208;lived copper catalysts for couplings that form the C&#8722;O bonds in biaryl ethers. These Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling of phenols with aryl bromides occurred with turnovers up to 8000, a value which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than those of prior couplings to form biaryl ethers and nearly an order of magnitude higher than those of any prior copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of aryl bromides and chlorides. This ligand also led to copper systems that catalyze the coupling of aryl chlorides with phenols and the coupling of aryl bromides and iodides with primary benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. A wide variety of functional groups including nitriles, halides, ethers, ketones, amines, esters, amides, vinylarenes, alcohols and boronic acid esters were tolerated, and reactions occurred with aryl bromides in pharmaceutically related structures.

     alt="Oxalohydrazide Ligands for Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;O Coupling Reactions with High Turnover Numbers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl halides with phenols and aliphatic alcohols to form biaryl ethers and alkyl aryl ethers, with loadings down to 125&#8197;ppm of the combination of CuBr and oxalohydrazide ligands with broad scope, is reported. Experiments on reaction rates show that the copper catalysts ligated by oxalohydrazide ligands are long lived with measurably higher initial rates than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art copper catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

         <title>Inside Cover: Interplay between a Foldamer Helix and a Macrocycle in a Foldarotaxane Architecture (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 15/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 7986-7986, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A foldarotaxane molecular architecture is reported by Yann Ferrand, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Coutrot et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;8380. It comprises a molecular axle encircled by a macrocycle and wrapped with a foldamer helix. Through its controlled localization, the macrocycle alters the association between the helix and the axle, while the helix compartmentalizes the molecular shuttle. In the picture and X&#8208;ray structure, the snake wraps itself around the tree branch and pushes that way the bulky surrounding wheel.

Advanced process analytics are becoming an increasingly important part of continuous flow chemistry. In their Research Article on page&#8197;8139, Jason D. Williams, C. Oliver Kappe and co&#8208;workers describe the use of four different process analytical technologies, controlled by one central system, in a multistep continuous flow process. Advanced data processing methods, including artificial intelligence, are used to accurately quantify up to nine process species in real time, toward self&#8208;optimization and model predictive control applications.

Mechanofunctional polymers that exhibit color change, fluorescence, and self&#8208;strengthening ability were developed by Hideyuki Otsuka et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;8406. It is the first example of force&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking reactions achieved by only the extension or compression of a bulk film. The cross&#8208;linking reaction can be visualized via color change and fluorescence and evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Mediated by Hydrogen Bonding in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8035-8048, April 6, 2021. </description>

Hydrogen bonding is weakened by water, and thus hard to deploy under biological conditions. Nonetheless, there is increasing interest in solving the problems so that supramolecular chemistry can be exploited in medicine. This Minireview highlights recent developments, including some with genuine promise for real&#8208;world applications.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonding is a key governing force in molecular recognition, notably in biological systems. While it has been studied and exploited by supramolecular chemists for many years, most of this work has been conducted in organic solvents. Investigations in water, the biological solvent, have proceeded more slowly, largely because the interaction is weakened by solvation and less easy to detect. Recently it has become appreciated that the problems should be addressed, and work towards the deployment of H&#8208;bonding in water has accelerated. This Minireview discusses a range of synthetic receptors designed to bind organic molecules in aqueous media by combining hydrogen bonding with hydrophobic interactions. Some of these systems are capable of high affinities and selectivities, raising the hope of biomedical applications in the near future.

         <title>Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1): Sowing Seeds in the Fields of Chemistry and Biology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8050-8071, April 6, 2021. </description>

The 14&#8208;amino acid cyclic peptide SFTI&#8208;1 is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable prototypic peptide and has planted seeds for thought in a growing number of fields. This Review surveys the applications of SFTI&#8208;1 in the design of protease inhibitors that have blossomed since its discovery, and the new shoots that have recently sprouted in the areas of pharmaceutical design, synthetic chemistry, and molecular biology.







Abstract
Nature&#8208;derived cyclic peptides have proven to be a vast source of inspiration for advancing modern pharmaceutical design and synthetic chemistry. The focus of this Review is sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1), one of the smallest disulfide&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides found in nature. SFTI&#8208;1 has an unusual biosynthetic pathway that begins with a dual&#8208;purpose albumin precursor and ends with the production of a high&#8208;affinity serine protease inhibitor that rivals other inhibitors much larger in size. Investigations on the molecular basis for SFTI&#8208;1&#8242;s rigid structure and adaptable function have planted seeds for thought that have now blossomed in several different fields. Here we survey these applications to highlight the growing potential of SFTI&#8208;1 as a versatile template for engineering inhibitors, a prototypic peptide for studying inhibitory mechanisms, a stable scaffold for grafting bioactive peptides, and a model peptide for evaluating peptidomimetic motifs and platform technologies.

         <title>From Parkesine to Celluloid: The Birth of Organic Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8012-8016, April 6, 2021. </description>

The period beginning with the 20th century has been referred to as the Age of Plastics. While many trace the start of this to the production of Bakelite in 1907, this was proceeded by semi&#8208;synthetic plastics dating back to the mid&#8208;1800s. The history and development of these early materials is presented, while also attempting to clarify the differences between the related materials collodion, Parkesine, and celluloid.







Abstract
The birth of modern organic plastics can be traced back to the mid&#8208;1800s with various semi&#8208;synthetic plastics derived from cellulose nitrate. Examples of such materials include Parkesine introduced by Alexander Parkes in 1860 and celluloid introduced by John Wesley Hyatt in 1870. The history and development of these early materials is presented, while also attempting to clarify the differences between the related materials collodion, Parkesine, and celluloid.

         <title>Cell Death Mediated by the Pyroptosis Pathway with the Aid of Nanotechnology: Prospects for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8018-8034, April 6, 2021. </description>

Pyroptosis, a unique form of programmed cell death (PCD), has been proven to have a close relationship with human disease, especially malignant tumors. In this Minireview, the recent progress of cancer treatment based on pyroptosis induced by nanotechnology will be described in detail, and necessary toxicological studies of nanoformulations involving pyroptosis are also introduced.







Abstract
Pyroptosis, a unique form of programmed cell death (PCD) that is characterized by DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, cellular swelling with big bubbles, and leakage of cell content, has been proven to have a close relationship with human diseases, such as inflammatory diseases and malignant tumors. Since a new gasdermin&#8208;D (GSDMD) protein was identified in 2015, various strategies have been developed to induce pyroptosis for cancer therapy, including ions, small&#8208;molecule drugs and nanomaterials. Although there are a number of reviews about the close relationship between the pyroptosis mechanism and the occurrence of various cancers, a summary covering recent progress in the field of nanomedicines in pyroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy has not yet been presented. Therefore, it is urgent to fill this gap and light up future directions for the use of this powerful tool to combat cancer. In this Minireview, recent progress in cancer treatment based on pyroptosis induced by nanoparticles will be described in detail, the design highlights and the therapeutic advantages are emphasized, and future perspectives in this emerging area are proposed.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Mediated Intermolecular Coupling of Alkenes with Ketones via Acyloxy Nitroso Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8547-8551, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free intermolecular radical addition reaction of acyloxy nitroso compounds to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is presented. Readily accessible acyloxy nitroso compounds, obtained upon oxidation of the corresponding ketone&#8208;derived oximes, are shown to be efficient C&#8208;radical precursors and provide a wide range of synthetically useful functionalized oximes. The overall transformation represents an oxidative coupling of a ketone with a Michael acceptor.







Abstract
An atom&#8208;economic intermolecular radical addition reaction of acyloxy nitroso compounds to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes mediated by visible light is reported. The starting nitroso derivatives are readily prepared by oxidation of the corresponding oximes prepared from ketones and the overall transformation represents an oxidative coupling of a ketone with a Michael acceptor. The cascade proceeds smoothly under mild conditions, providing a series of valuable functionalized oximes in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that these cascades proceed via addition/coupling processes that are controlled by the persistent radical effect (PRE) with NO acting as the persistent species.

         <title>Nucleation and Growth Mechanism of Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8521-8525, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation and growth behavior of anion&#8208;derived SEI on graphite electrode is revealed, the number of nucleation sites increases progressively, and each nucleus undergoes 2D growth before overlapping with others. Only when the whole electrode surface is completely covered by reduced products, an ion&#8208;conducting but electron&#8208;insulating polycrystalline film forms, which marks the end of SEI growth.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been widely employed to describe the new phase formed between anode and electrolyte in working batteries. Significant advances have been achieved on the structure and composition of SEI as well as on the possible ion transport mechanism. However, the nucleation and growth mechanism of SEI catches little attention, which requires the establishment of isothermal electrochemical crystallization theory. Herein we explore the virgin territory of electrochemically crystallized SEI. By using potentiostatic method to regulate the decomposition of anions, an anion&#8208;derived SEI forms on graphite surface at atomic scale. After fitting the cur&#8208;rent&#8208;time transients with Laviron theory and Avrami formula, we conclude that the formation of anion&#8208;derived interface is surface reaction controlled and obeys the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) progressive nucleation and growth model. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images emphasize the conclusion, which reveals the mystery of isothermal electrochemical crystallization of SEI.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Promoted C&#8211;O Bond Formation with an Integrated Carbon Nitride&#8211;Nickel Heterogeneous Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8494-8499, April 6, 2021. </description>

A Ni&#8208;deposited carbon nitride material was developed as a fully heterogeneous dual photocatalyst. Visible light&#8208;driven C&#8211;O cross&#8208;coupling is demonstrated free of organic ligands and additives. This dual catalytic system operates with very low nickel loadings and the heterogeneous photocatalyst can be easily recycled.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;deposited mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx) is introduced as an inexpensive, robust, easily synthesizable and recyclable material that functions as an integrated dual photocatalytic system. This material overcomes the need of expensive photosensitizers, organic ligands and additives as well as limitations of catalyst deactivation in the existing photo/Ni dual catalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The dual catalytic Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx is demonstrated for C&#8211;O coupling between aryl halides and aliphatic alcohols under mild condition. The reaction affords the ether product in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields (60&#8211;92&#8201;%) with broad substrate scope, including heteroaryl and aryl halides bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing, &#8208;donating and neutral groups. The heterogeneous Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx can be easily recovered from the reaction mixture and reused over multiple cycles without loss of activity. The findings highlight exciting opportunities for dual catalysis promoted by a fully heterogeneous system.

         <title>Perovskite Nanosheet Hydrogels with Mechanochromic Structural Color</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8466-8471, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite nanosheet colloid with structural color was prepared by a simple and low&#8208;cost method, and a mechanochromic gel was prepared by immobilizing the nanosheet liquid crystal colloid into the 3D network of hydrogel. The gel is highly sensitive to stress and is expected to be applied to mechano&#8208;sensors.







Abstract
Structural color colloidal sols of perovskite nanosheets were synthesized and were immobilized in a polymer hydrogel film by in situ photopolymerization, leading to a novel mechanochromic material. Visible absorption spectroscopy, polarized optical microscopy and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering revealed that the nanosheets are aligned parallel to the film surface with the periodic distance of up to ca. 300&#8197;nm, giving the structural color tunable over full color range. The present structural color gel showed reversible mechanochromic response that detects weak stress of 1&#8197;kPa with the quick response time less than 1&#8197;ms as well as high mechanical toughness (compressive breaking stress of up to 3&#8197;MPa). These excellent properties are suitable for applications for mechano&#8208;sensors and displays.

         <title>Ultrafast Size Expansion and Turn&#8208;On Luminescence of Atomically Precise Silver Clusters by Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8505-8509, April 6, 2021. </description>

Two similar Ag18 clusters are assembled via NO3&#8722; anions to form a chain&#8208;like thiolated AgI complex (abbreviated as Ag18). The solution containing Ag18 reacted with H2S with controlled concentration, promptly producing another identifiable and bright red&#8208;emitting high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) cluster Ag62. Based on this cluster transformation, an ultra&#8208;sensitive turn&#8208;on sensor was developed to the detection of H2S gas with an ultrafast response time (30&#8197;s) at a low concentration (0.13&#8197;ppm).







Abstract
The formation of high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) clusters remains elusive and their potential applications are still underdeveloped. Herein, we firstly prepared a chain&#8208;like thiolated AgI complex {[Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)2(H2O)2] &#8901; [Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)6]}n (abbreviated as Ag18) in which two similar Ag18 clusters are assembled by NO3&#8722; anions. The solution containing Ag18 reacted with hydrogen sulfide with controlled concentration, promptly producing another identifiable and bright red&#8208;emitting high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) cluster, Ag62(S)13(StBu)32(NO3)4 (abbreviated as Ag62). We tracked the transformation using time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), UV/Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra. Based on this cluster transformation, we further developed an ultra&#8208;sensitive turn&#8208;on sensor detecting H2S gas with an ultrafast response time (30&#8197;s) at a low detection limit (0.13&#8197;ppm). This work opens a new way of understanding the growth of metal clusters and developing their luminescent sensing applications.

&lt;/sub&gt; (abbreviated as &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) in which two similar &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; clusters are assembled by NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions. The solution containing &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; reacted with hydrogen sulfide with controlled concentration, promptly producing another identifiable and bright red&#8208;emitting high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) cluster, Ag&lt;sub&gt;62&lt;/sub&gt;(S)&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (abbreviated as &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;62&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). We tracked the transformation using time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), UV/Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra. Based on this cluster transformation, we further developed an ultra&#8208;sensitive turn&#8208;on sensor detecting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gas with an ultrafast response time (30&#8197;s) at a low detection limit (0.13&#8197;ppm). This work opens a new way of understanding the growth of metal clusters and developing their luminescent sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Responsive Emulsions for Sequential Multienzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8410-8414, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2, pH, and thermo&#8208;responsive emulsion was developed to perform multienzyme cascades without incompatibility and cross&#8208;reactivity issues. This emulsion allows the on&#8208;demand control of morphology and phase composition, and therefore exchanging enzymes and separate yielding/recycling of products and polymers. A three&#8208;enzyme cascade was performed sequentially, each step was carried out under the optimal conditions of the corresponding enzyme.







Abstract
Multienzyme cascade biocatalysis is an efficient synthetic process, avoiding the isolation/purification of intermediates and shifting the reaction equilibrium to the product side.. However, multienzyme systems are often limited by their incompatibility and cross&#8208;reactivity. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;responsive emulsion to proceed multienzyme reactions sequentially for high reactivity. The emulsion is achieved using a CO2, pH, and thermo&#8208;responsive block copolymer as a stabilizer, allowing the on&#8208;demand control of emulsion morphology and phase composition. Applying this system to a three&#8208;step cascade reaction enables the individual optimal condition for each enzyme, and a high overall conversion (ca. 97&#8201;% of the calculated limit) is thereby obtained. Moreover, the multi&#8208;responsiveness of the emulsion allows the facile and separate yielding/recycling of products, polymers and active enzymes. Besides, the system could be scaled up with a good yield.

A Cu&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative desaturation&#8208;triggered cascade reaction of &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted alkyl (hetero)aryl ketones with primary amines has been developed to rapidly construct &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams. An intramolecular 1,2&#8208;(hetero)aryl migration is induced by amide C&#8722;N bond formation, providing the products in generally good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields across a broad substrate scope with respect to both coupling partners.







Abstract
Rearrangement reactions incorporated into cascade reactions play an important role in rapidly increasing molecular complexity from readily available starting materials. Reported here is a Cu&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted alkyl (hetero)aryl ketones with primary amines that incorporates an unusual 1,2&#8208;aryl migration induced by amide C&#8722;N bond formation to produce a class of structurally novel &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams in generally good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. This cascade reaction has a broad substrate scope with respect to primary amines, allows a wide spectrum of (hetero)aryl groups to smoothly undergo 1,2&#8208;migration, and tolerates electronically diverse &#945;&#8208;substituents on the (hetero)aryl ring of the ketones. Mechanistically, this 1,2&#8208;aryl migration may stem from the intramolecular amide C&#8722;N bond formation which induces nucleophilic migration of the aryl group from the acyl carbon center to the electrophilic carbon center that is conjugated with the resulting iminium moiety.

The diborane(4) B2(o&#8208;tolyl)4 reacts with species with B&#8722;H bonds giving a complex mixture arising from hydride/aryl exchange, dimerization and borane elimination. Use of BH3 sources led to the isolation of the first tetra&#8208;substituted pentaborane(9) HB[B(o&#8208;tolyl)(&#956;&#8208;H)]4.







Abstract
Reactions of the diborane(4) B2(o&#8208;tolyl)4 and monohydridoboranes are shown to give B(o&#8208;tolyl)3 and (o&#8208;tolyl)BR2 (R2=(C8H14) 3, cat 4, pin 5, (C6F5)2 6) as the major products. The corresponding reaction with BH3&#8208;sources gives complex mixtures, resulting from hydride/aryl exchange, dimerization and borane elimination. This led to the isolation of the first tetra&#8208;substituted pentaborane(9) HB[B(o&#8208;tolyl)(&#956;&#8208;H)]4 8. The reaction pathways are probed experimentally and by computations.

         <title>Oxidative Indole Dearomatization for Asymmetric Furoindoline Synthesis by a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenase Involved in the Biosynthesis of Bicyclic Thiopeptide Thiostrepton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8401-8405, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic approach for oxidative indole dearomatization is reported. TsrE, a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase involved in the biosynthesis of bicyclic thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton, catalyzes 2,3&#8208;epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening during the conversion of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid or 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tryptophol to furoindoline, with up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and &gt;99&#8201;% ee under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
The interest in indole dearomatization, which serves as a useful tool in the total synthesis of related alkaloid natural products, has recently been renewed with the intention of developing new methods efficient in both yield and stereoselective control. Here, we report an enzymatic approach for the oxidative dearomatization of indoles in the asymmetric synthesis of a variety of furoindolines with a vicinal quaternary carbon stereogenic center. This approach depends on the activity of a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase, TsrE, which is involved in the biosynthesis of bicyclic thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton. TsrE catalyzes 2,3&#8208;epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening in a highly enantioselective manner during the conversion of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid or 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tryptophol to furoindoline, with up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and &gt;99&#8201;% ee under mild reaction conditions. Complementing current chemical methods for oxidative indole dearomatization, the TsrE activity&#8208;based approach enriches the toolbox in the asymmetric synthesis of products possessing a furoindoline skeleton.

TsrE catalyzes 2,3&#8208;epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening in a highly enantioselective manner during the conversion of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid or 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tryptophol to furoindoline, with up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% conversion and &amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; under mild reaction conditions. Complementing current chemical methods for oxidative indole dearomatization, the TsrE activity&#8208;based approach enriches the toolbox in the asymmetric synthesis of products possessing a furoindoline skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electrofluorescence from a Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecule</title>

A highly efficient NIR&#8208;TADF emitter with high kRISC is developed for NIR&#8208;OLEDs. The NIR&#8208;TADF&#8208;OLED showed a significantly high EQE of 13.4&#8201;% with an EL peak at 734&#8197;nm. Notably, the NIR&#8208;TADF molecule can sensitize a deeper&#8208;NIR&#8208;fluorophore, resulting in an EQE of 1.1&#8201;% at over 900&#8197;nm in the TADF&#8208;sensitized NIR&#8208;OLED.







Abstract
Near&#8208;IR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR&#8208;OLEDs) are potential light&#8208;sources for various sensing applications as OLEDs have unique features such as ultra&#8208;flexibility and low&#8208;cost fabrication. However, the low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE) of NIR&#8208;OLEDs is a critical obstacle for potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR emitter with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and its application to NIR&#8208;OLEDs. The NIR&#8208;TADF emitter, TPA&#8208;PZTCN, has a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 40&#8201;% with a peak wavelength at 729&#8197;nm even in a highly doped co&#8208;deposited film. The EL peak wavelength of the NIR&#8208;OLED is 734&#8197;nm with an EQE of 13.4&#8201;%, unprecedented among rare&#8208;metal&#8208;free NIR&#8208;OLEDs in this spectral range. TPA&#8208;PZTCN can sensitize a deeper NIR fluorophore to achieve a peak wavelength of approximately 900&#8197;nm, resulting in an EQE of over 1&#8201;% in a TADF&#8208;sensitized NIR&#8208;OLED with high operational device durability (LT95&gt;600&#8197;h.).

Preparation of multifunctional tertiary alcohols featuring an &#945;&#8208;ethynyl or &#945;&#8208;triazole moiety is described via enantioselective CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) of tertiary alcohols in the presence of phosphonate&#8208;functionalized pyridinebisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands. The method achieves kinetic resolution of racemates with a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter.







Abstract
The first highly enantioselective CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) of tertiary alcohols and their kinetic resolution is reported. This approach allows facile access to multifunctional tertiary alcohols featuring an &#945;&#8208;ethynyl or &#945;&#8208;triazole moiety, and represents the first successful kinetic resolution of racemates with a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter via CuAAC. Newly developed pyridinebisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands with a C4 phosphonate group play a key role.

         <title>Segmented Polyurethane Elastomers with Mechanochromic and Self&#8208;Strengthening Functions</title>

Mechanochromic elastomers that exhibit force&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking reactions in the bulk state are prepared to demonstrate damage detection ability by color change and fluorescence, and changes in the mechanical properties of bulk elastomers induced by simple compression or extension.







Abstract
Mechanochromic elastomers that exhibit force&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking reactions in the bulk state are introduced. The synthesis of segmented polyurethanes (SPUs) that contain difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN) moieties in the main chain and methacryloyl groups in the side chains was carried out. DFSN was selected as the mechanophore because it dissociates under mechanical stimuli to form pink cyanofluorene (CF) radicals, which can also initiate the radical polymerization of methacrylate monomers. The obtained elastomers generated CF radicals and changed color by compression or extension; they also became insoluble due to the mechanically induced cross&#8208;linking reactions. Additionally, an SPU containing diphenylmethane units also exhibited highly sensitive mechanofluorescence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate damage detection ability and changes in the mechanical properties of bulk elastomers induced by simple compression or extension.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Hydrogen/Deuterium Isotope Exchange in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8446-8449, April 6, 2021. </description>

Hydrogen plays multiple important roles in the on&#8208;surface synthesis of carbon&#8208;based materials. Here, the interactions between surface&#8208;adsorbed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and hydrogen are explored by combining on&#8208;surface H&#8594;D isotope exchange chemistry with in situ time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). It is shown that PAHs at hot surfaces continuously exchange hydrogen atoms.







Abstract
Hydrogen plays important roles in the on&#8208;surface synthesis of carbon&#8208;based materials in ultra&#8208;high vacuum. The complex interplay between hydrogen and surface&#8208;adsorbed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is tracked by in situ time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) combined with isotope labeling. In situ deuterium labeling of prototypical PAHs, coronene (CR) and 7&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), on Au(111) is achieved by annealing either in D2 gas or in the vapor of perdeuterio&#8208;acenaphthene. By following the mass spectra of in situ deuterated CR mixed with hydrogen&#8208;CR, it is demonstrated that PAHs adsorbed at hot Au(111) surfaces continuously exchange hydrogen atoms. Also, D2 present during the Ullmann coupling step leads to incorporation of deuterium and to shorter GNRs.

         <title>Electron Transfer from Haem to the Di&#8208;Iron Ferroxidase Centre in Bacterioferritin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8376-8379, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The haem in bacterioferritins has been shown before to provide an electron to the ferritin's mineral core&#8212;to reduce Fe3+ to water soluble Fe2+. This work shows that the haem can also provide an electron, over a distance of approximately 13&#8197;&#197;, to the di&#8208;iron ferroxidase centre of the protein, in a redox process not yet known.







Abstract
The iron redox cycle in ferritins is not completely understood. Bacterioferritins are distinct from other ferritins in that they contain haem groups. It is acknowledged that the two iron motifs in bacterioferritins, the di&#8208;nuclear ferroxidase centre and the haem B group, play key roles in two opposing processes, iron sequestration and iron mobilisation, respectively, and the two redox processes are independent. Herein, we show that in Escherichia coli bacterioferritin, there is an electron transfer pathway from the haem to the ferroxidase centre suggesting a new role(s) haem might play in bacterioferritins.

     alt="Electron Transfer from Haem to the Di&#8208;Iron Ferroxidase Centre in Bacterioferritin"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The haem in bacterioferritins has been shown before to provide an electron to the ferritin's mineral core&#8212;to reduce Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to water soluble Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. This work shows that the haem can also provide an electron, over a distance of approximately 13&#8197;&#197;, to the di&#8208;iron ferroxidase centre of the protein, in a redox process not yet known.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Electrolyte as a Cathode Interlayer for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8526-8531, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid electrolyte with aligned energy levels, self&#8208;doping behavior, and improved electron mobility and conductivity was developed. It facilitates electron transport and boosts the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells to 17.19&#8201;%.







Abstract
An organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid electrolyte based on a cyclic Ti&#8208;oxo cluster as the inorganic core and naphthalene&#8208;based organic ammonium bromide salts as the electrolyte was developed with easy synthesis and low cost. The new hybrid electrolyte exhibits excellent solubility in methanol, aligned work function, good conductivity, and amorphous state in thin film, enabling its successful application as a cathode interlayer in organic solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency of 17.19&#8201;%. This work demonstrates that the hybrid electrolytes are a new kind of semiconductor, exhibiting promising applications in organic electronics.

The synthesis of the first mesogenic donor&#8208;acceptor polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based hybrid is presented. In the solid state, the compound displays a lamellar organization in which the sub&#8208;unit organizations are similar to that observed for the individual POM and organic donor precursors. The fluorescence of the donor is considerably quenched both in solution and in the solid state, which is attributed to the occurrence of charge transfer.







Abstract
The synthesis of the first mesogenic donor&#8208;acceptor polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based hybrid is herein described. The structural and electronic properties of the hybrid compound were evaluated through combination of small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, optical microscopy, electrochemistry and photoluminescence. In the solid state, the compound behaves as a birefringent solid, displaying a lamellar organization in which double&#8208;layers of POMs and bis(thiophene)thienothiophene organic donors alternate regularly. Noticeably, the sub&#8208;unit organizations in the composite are similar to that observed for the individual POM and organic donor precursors. Photophysical studies show that in the hybrid, the fluorescence of the organic donor unit is considerably quenched both in solution and in the solid state, which is attributed to occurrence of intramolecular charge&#8208;separated state.

C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;isoquinolylanilines catalyzed by chiral rhodium(III) cyclopentadienyls has been realized in [3+2] annulation with four classes of internal alkynes under mild oxidative condition and allowed the atroposelective synthesis of biaryl indoles in high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (&gt;50 examples, 71&#8211;96&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Reported herein is the rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of anilines bearing an N&#8208;isoquinolyl directing group for oxidative [3+2] annulation with four classes of internal alkynes, leading to atroposelective indole synthesis via dynamic kinetic annulation with C&#8208;N reductive elimination constituting the stereo&#8208;determining step. This reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Chiral Lead&#8208;Free Hybrid Perovskites for Self&#8208;Powered Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8415-8418, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral lead&#8208;free double hybrid perovskites are successfully acquired by assembling chiral organic cation with Ag+ and Bi3+ double metals. Benefitting from chiral polar bulk photovoltaic effects induced by polar structure, self&#8208;powered circularly polarized light detection with a high anisotropy factor of 0.3 is unprecedentedly achieved in chiral hybrid perovskites.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites are recently emerging as the promising alternative for CPL detection owing to their CPL&#8208;sensitive property induced by chiral organics and efficient charge transport of inorganic frameworks. However, most of these reported chiral perovskites involve high concentrations of toxic Pb which will become the potential bottleneck for their further application. Herein, we successfully developed two lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites, [(R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;MPA]4AgBiI8 ((R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;MPA=(R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylphenethylammonium, 1&#8208;R), and [(S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;MPA]4AgBiI8 ((S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;MPA=(S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylphenethylammonium, 1&#8208;S). Circular dichroism measurements reveal that these perovskites exhibit notable chirality induced by organic cations to distinguish different polarization states of CPL photons. Significantly, they present unique chiral polar photovoltaic, and resulting self&#8208;powered CPL detection without an external power source is unprecedentedly achieved. Furthermore, an anisotropy factor up to 0.3 is acquired for the self&#8208;powered CPL detection, reaching the highest value among reported chiral perovskites. This work suggests hybrid double perovskites are promising photoelectronic candidates, and provides a new approach for exploring new &#8220;green&#8221; circularly polarized light&#8208;sensitive materials with high performance.

         <dc:description>
An open space microfluidic probe has been developed to stably synthesize reactive intermediates in situ for subcellular chemistry. Reactant systems (A, B) mix and react with each other within a chemical reaction microregion (several &#956;m). The continuously produced free radicals can attack cellular compounds within the microregion before quenching, realizing subcellular radical stimulation.







Abstract
Subcellular stimulation by free radicals is crucial for deeper insight of cell behaviors. However, it remains a tough challenge due to the high spatial precision requirement and short life of radicals. Herein, we report a versatile open microfluidic probe for stable generation of free radical and subcellular stimulation. By optimizing parameters, the chemical reaction can be confined in a microregion with a diameter of several &#956;m, and the real&#8208;time produced reactive radicals can attack the desired subcellular region of a single cell. In order to reveal the attacked region, fluorescent cyanine 3 labeled tyramide free radicals are synthesized, and the target microregion on a single cell is successfully stained by the covalent linking reaction between radicals and membrane proteins, which proves the feasibility of our method. We believe this method will open new avenues for short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates stimulation at the single&#8208;cell/sub&#8208;cell level and selective membrane labeling.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Directed C&#8722;H Borylation of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8500-8504, April 6, 2021. </description>

An efficient metal&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of pyrroles by using only BBr3 directed by pivaloyl groups. The site&#8208;selectivity is generally dominated by chelation and electronic effects, thus forming diverse C2&#8208;borylated pyrroles against the steric effect.







Abstract
Robust strategies to enable the rapid construction of complex organoboronates in selective, practical, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly modes remain conspicuously underdeveloped. Here, we develop a general strategy for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of pyrroles by using only BBr3 directed by pivaloyl groups, avoiding the use of any metal. The site&#8208;selectivity is generally dominated by chelation and electronic effects, thus forming diverse C2&#8208;borylated pyrroles against the steric effect. The formed products can readily engage in downstream transformations, enabling a step&#8208;economic process to access drugs such as Lipitor. DFT calculations (wB97X&#8208;D) demonstrate the preferred positional selectivity of this reaction.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Amorphous Zn&#8211;Carbon Multichannel Fibers for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8515-8520, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped amorphous Zn&#8211;carbon multichannel fibers decorated with carbon cages (denoted as CC&#8208;Zn&#8208;CMFs) have been synthesized as a multifunctional host for lithium metal anodes. With the unique hierarchical hollow architecture and functional composition, these CC&#8208;Zn&#8208;CMFs exhibit enhanced electrochemical properties for lithium metal anodes in terms of high Coulombic efficiency, superior rate capability, and long cycle life.







Abstract
The application of lithium metal anodes for practical batteries is still impeded by safety issues and low Coulombic efficiency caused mainly by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites. Herein, two types of free&#8208;standing nitrogen&#8208;doped amorphous Zn&#8211;carbon multichannel fibers are synthesized as multifunctional hosts for lithium accommodation. The 3D&#8197;macroporous structures endow effectively reduced local current density, and the lithiophilic nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon and functional Zn&#8197;nanoparticles serve as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to guide uniform lithium deposition. As a result, the developed anodes exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high Coulombic efficiency for more than 500&#8197;cycles at various current densities from 1 to 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and symmetric cells show long&#8208;term cycling duration over 2000&#8197;h. Moreover, full cells based on the developed anode and a LiFePO4 cathode also demonstrate superior rate capability and stable cycle life.

         <title>Giant Optical Activity and Second Harmonic Generation in 2D Hybrid Copper Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8441-8445, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 2D hybrid metal halides ((R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)2CuCl4) were synthesized, and their optical activity was investigated. The materials exhibited a record anisotropic g&#8208;factor of up to about 0.06 and efficient second harmonic generation (see picture). Calculations demonstrated that their giant optical activity is induced by the high joint density of states. Hence, the chiral (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)2CuCl4 films should be suitable for use in chiral and nonlinear photonic devices.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have emerged as highly promising materials for a wide range of applications in optoelectronics. Incorporating chiral organic molecules into metal halides enables the extension of their unique optical and electronic properties to chiral optics. By using chiral (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;methylbenzylamine (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA) as the organic component, we synthesized chiral hybrid copper halides, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)2CuCl4, and investigated their optical activity. Thin films of this material showed a record anisotropic g&#8208;factor as high as approximately 0.06. We discuss the origin of the giant optical activity observed in (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)2CuCl4 by theoretical modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) and demonstrate highly efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) in these samples. Our study provides insight into the design of chiral materials by structural engineering, creating a new platform for chiral and nonlinear photonic device applications of the chiral hybrid copper halides.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Decorated Cuprous Oxide Nanowires for Long&#8208;lived Charges Applied in Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8455-8459, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2O nanowires are decorated with Cu3(BTC)2 by a surfactant&#8208;free method. The Cu2O@Cu3(BTC)2 core&#8211;shell structure offers enlarged active surfaces and prolonged lifetime of separated electrons for CO2 reduction into CH4, exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability compared to the bare Cu2O.







Abstract
Improving the stability of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is imperative to its practical applications in artificial photosynthesis. In this work, Cu2O nanowires are encapsulated by metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) of Cu3(BTC)2 (BTC=1,3,5&#8208;benzene tricarboxylate) using a surfactant&#8208;free method. Such MOFs not only suppress the water vapor&#8208;induced corrosion of Cu2O but also facilitate charge separation and CO2 uptake, thus resulting in a nanocomposite representing 1.9 times improved activity and stability for selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction into CH4 under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, direct transfer of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of Cu2O to the LUMO level of non&#8208;excited Cu3(BTC)2 has been evidenced by time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence. This work proposes an effective strategy for CO2 conversion by a synergy of charge separation and CO2 adsorption, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic reaction when MOFs are integrated with metal oxide photocatalyst.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Catalyzed Polymerization of Dienyltriphenylarsonium Ylides: On the Way to Pure C5 Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8431-8434, April 6, 2021. </description>

Reported for the first time is an unusual borane&#8208;initiated polymerization of arsonium ylide monomers, where the main&#8208;chain grows by five carbon atoms, from the monomer, at a time and leads to unique structures.







Abstract
The first C5 polymerization is reported, where the main&#8208;chain is growing by five carbon atoms of the monomer at a time. Three dienyltriphenylarsonium ylide monomers were synthesized and polymerized with triethylborane as an initiator, leading to random terpolymers (C1, C3, C5) with mainly C5 repeating units (up to 84.1&#8201;%). It has been found that the methyl group (electron&#8208;donating substituent) on the conjugated double bond of the ylides facilitates the formation of C5 segments. A mechanism was proposed based on NMR characterization and DFT calculations. The high C5 content ensures that things are on the right track for pure C5 homopolymerization.

         <title>Interplay between a Foldamer Helix and a Macrocycle in a Foldarotaxane Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8380-8384, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel foldarotaxanes have been synthesized that combine both the mechanically interlocked rotaxane architecture and the foldaxane supramolecular assembly. The localization of the encircling macrocycle influences the association between the helix and the axle, while the helix is able to displace the macrocycle elsewhere than its preferred site of interaction through the compartmentalization of the axle.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of a novel rotaxane/foldaxane hybrid architecture is reported. The winding of an aromatic oligoamide helix host around a dumbbell&#8208;shaped thread&#8208;like guest, or axle, already surrounded by a macrocycle was evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The process proved to depend on the position of the macrocycle along the axle and the associated steric hindrance. The macrocycle thus behaves as a switchable shield that modulates the affinity of the helix for the axle. Reciprocally, the foldamer helix acts as a supramolecular auxiliary that compartmentalizes the axle. In some cases, the macrocycle is forced to move along the axle to allow the foldamer to reach its best recognition site.

         <title>Genome&#8208;Mining&#8208;Based Discovery of the Cyclic Peptide Tolypamide and TolF, a Ser/Thr Forward O&#8208;Prenyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8460-8465, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
TolF is a novel O&#8208;prenyltransferase which catalyzes forward O&#8208;prenylation on threonine and serine residues. A combination of genome mining, natural product chemistry, and biochemical assays were used to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster and natural product, and to functionally validate the enzyme. This study fills a gap in the sequence&#8208;function space of prenyltransferases and introduces TolF as a promising tool in synthetic biology.







Abstract
Cyanobactins comprise a widespread group of peptide metabolites produced by cyanobacteria that are often diversified by post&#8208;translational prenylation. Several enzymes have been identified in cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways that carry out chemically diverse prenylation reactions, representing a resource for the discovery of post&#8208;translational alkylating agents. Here, genome mining was used to identify orphan cyanobactin prenyltransferases, leading to the isolation of tolypamide from the freshwater cyanobacterium Tolypothrix sp. The structure of tolypamide was confirmed by spectroscopic methods, degradation, and enzymatic total synthesis. Tolypamide is forward&#8208;prenylated on a threonine residue, representing an unprecedented post&#8208;translational modification. Biochemical characterization of the cognate enzyme TolF revealed a prenyltransferase with strict selectivity for forward O&#8208;prenylation of serine or threonine but with relaxed substrate selectivity for flanking peptide sequences. Since cyanobactin pathways often exhibit exceptionally broad substrate tolerance, these enzymes represent robust tools for synthetic biology.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Kagome Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8370-8375, April 6, 2021. </description>

Nitrogen&#8208;doped Kagome graphene is predicted to display a topological band gap and unconventional superconductivity. Two&#8208;dimensional graphene sheets possessing a long&#8208;range honeycomb Kagome lattice have now been synthesized by a substrate&#8208;assisted Ullmann reaction on Ag(111). Scanning probe microscopy supported by density functional theory proves the appearance of Kagome flat bands, opening the design of graphene&#8208;based topological materials.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped Kagome graphene (N&#8208;KG) has been theoretically predicted as a candidate for the emergence of a topological band gap as well as unconventional superconductivity. However, its physical realization still remains very elusive. Here, we report on a substrate&#8208;assisted reaction on Ag(111) for the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional graphene sheets possessing a long&#8208;range honeycomb Kagome lattice. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a CO&#8208;terminated tip supported by density functional theory (DFT) are employed to scrutinize the structural and electronic properties of the N&#8208;KG down to the atomic scale. We demonstrate its semiconducting character due to the nitrogen doping as well as the emergence of Kagome flat bands near the Fermi level which would open new routes towards the design of graphene&#8208;based topological materials.

         <title>Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanochromism from Metal&#8208;free Polycrystals: Noncovalent Conformational Locks Facilitating Wide&#8208;Range Redshift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8510-8514, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncovalent conformational locks are shown to be an effective strategy to endow the highly coplanar luminophore with good stability and high fluorescence efficiency. The high degree of conformational coplanarity is responsible for red to near&#8208;infrared mechanochromism of metal&#8208;free crystals.







Abstract
Piezochromic organic materials that present a large difference in fluorescence wavelength in the near&#8208;infrared region have important potential applications; however, few such metal&#8208;free luminophores have been reported. In this study, we design and prepare &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron acceptors whose planar conformation can be locked by the noncovalent interactions. The planar fused&#8208;ring geometry can narrow the optical band gap, enhance the molecular stability and rigidity, as well as increase the radiative rate. As expected, the polymorphs Re&#8208;phase and Ni&#8208;phase emit the high&#8208;brightness fluorescence with wavelength maxima (&#955;em,max) at 615 and 727&#8197;nm, respectively. Upon full grinding, the &#955;em,max of Re&#8208;phase is bathochromically shifted to 775&#8197;nm. The ground powder of Re&#8208;phase becomes metastable as a consequence of noncovalent conformational locking and that the red to near&#8208;infrared (large colour difference) mechanochromism arises from the high degree of conformational coplanarity. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a promising approach to the development of organic piezochromic materials with wide&#8208;range redshift and excellent penetrability.

Chiral RhIII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective methyl C&#8722;H amidation via desymmetrization of gem&#8208;dimethyl groups afforded functionalized &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in high enatioselectivity (&gt;30 examples, up to 92&#8201;% ee). The high enantioselectivity is ascribed to judicious choice of oxime directing groups, sterically biased gem&#8208;groups in the C&#8722;H substrate, and high reactivity of the iodonium imide reagents.







Abstract
Desymmetrization of gem&#8208;dimethyl groups en route to the rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective sp3 C&#8722;H amidation is reported. Synthetically important &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives were accessed in moderate to good yields and high enantioselectivity. The high enantioselectivity is enabled by an appropriate oxime directing group, sterically biased gem&#8208;groups in the C&#8722;H substrate, and high reactivity of the amidating reagent.

A variety of porphyrin@MOF hybrids were synthesized by grafting porphyrins on MOFs through ligand exchange. These hybrids showed boosted activity and significantly improved selectivity for the four&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen. Zn&#8208;air batteries assembled with these hybrids exhibited comparable performance to that with Pt&#8208;based materials. Combining various molecular catalysts and MOFs is appealing to develop materials with diverse applications.







Abstract
Synthesizing molecule@support hybrids is appealing to improve molecular electrocatalysis. We report herein metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported Co porphyrins for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with improved activity and selectivity. Co porphyrins can be grafted on MOF surfaces through ligand exchange. A variety of porphyrin@MOF hybrids were made using this method. Grafted Co porphyrins showed boosted ORR activity with large (&gt;70&#8197;mV) anodic shift of the half&#8208;wave potential compared to ungrafted porphyrins. By using active MOFs for peroxide reduction, the number of electrons transferred per O2 increased from 2.65 to 3.70, showing significantly improved selectivity for the 4e ORR. It is demonstrated that H2O2 generated from O2 reduction at Co porphyrins is further reduced at MOF surfaces, leading to improved 4e ORR. As a practical demonstration, these hybrids were used as air electrode catalysts in Zn&#8208;air batteries, which exhibited equal performance to that with Pt&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Probing the Intracellular Dynamics of Nitric Oxide and Hydrogen Sulfide Using an Activatable NIR II Fluorescence Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8450-8454, April 6, 2021. </description>

Activatable NIR II probe: A dual&#8208;stimuli responsive probe was developed. This probe endowed the capability of reversibly switching the fluorescence from NIR II at 936&#8197;nm to NIR at 645&#8197;nm when successively treated with NO and H2S, enabling visualization of the dynamic and alternating existence of NO and H2S.







Abstract
Understanding the complex interplay among gasotransmitters is of great significance but remains technically challenging. In this study, we present the design and synthesis of a dually responsive BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC reporter for probing the dynamic and alternating existence of NO and H2S in living cells. This designed reporter can repeatedly cycle S&#8208;nitrosation and transnitrosation reactions when successively treated with NO and H2S, thus affording the interchange of NIR fluorescence at 645&#8197;nm (NO) and NIR II fluorescence at 936&#8197;nm (H2S). In light of this unique fluorescence alternation between two colors, we synthesized water&#8208;soluble BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC dots to visualize the intracellular dynamics of NO and H2S. These molecular probes thus provide a toolbox to elucidate the interplaying roles of NO and H2S in the complex interaction networks of various signal transduction pathways.

         <title>Chiral Spiro&#8208;Axis Induced Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Material for Efficient Circularly Polarized OLEDs with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>

A chiral spiro&#8208;axis skeleton introduced the circularly polarized luminescence property into TADF molecules and enhanced the intramolecular through space charge transfer process. The resulting TADF enantiomers display obvious CPEL signals with |gEL| factor up to 3.0&#215;10&#8722;3 and EQE of 20.0&#8201;% with remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;off, which are among the top results of CP&#8208;OLEDs.







Abstract
A spiro&#8208;axis skeleton not only introduces circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules but also enhances the intramolecular through space charge transfer (TSCT) process. Spiral distributed phenoxazine and 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one&#8208;10,10&#8208;dioxide act as donor and acceptor units, respectively. The resulting TADF enantiomers, (rac)&#8208;OSFSO, display emission maxima at 470&#8197;nm, small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.022&#8197;eV and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 81.2&#8201;% in co&#8208;doped film. The circularly polarized OLEDs (CP&#8208;OLEDs) based on (R)&#8208;OSFSO and (S)&#8208;OSFSO display obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with dissymmetry factor up to 3.0&#215;10&#8722;3 and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.0&#8201;%. Moreover, the devices show remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;off with an EQE of 19.3&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 (roll&#8208;off ca. 3.5&#8201;%), which are among the top results of CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalysed Hydroarylation of Highly Substituted Styrenes</title>

Hydroarylation is an effective strategy to rapidly increase the complexity of organic structures by transforming flat alkene moieties into 3D frameworks. A new method is reported for the selective hydroheteroarylation of multiply substituted styrenes and heteroaromatic styrenes to give multiple ring&#8208;substituted products. Mechanistic exploration revealed that commercially available terthiophene is central to the reactivity of this novel catalytic system.







Abstract
Hydroarylation is an effective strategy to rapidly increase the complexity of organic structures by transforming flat alkene moieties into three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. Many strategies have already been developed to achieve the hydroarylation of styrenes, however most of these reports examine the hydroarylation of unpolar, &#946;&#8208;mono&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;unsubstituted styrenes, while exploring mainly electron&#8208;rich benzene nucleophiles. Herein, we report a mild and general catalytic system for the selective hydroheteroarylation of multiply substituted styrenes and heteroaromatic styrenes. Mechanistic analysis of the reaction led to the discovery of commercially available 2,2&#8242;:5&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terthiophene as a key reagent.

         <title>Consecutive &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;Selective C(sp3)&#8722;H Silylation of Tertiary Amines with Dihydrosilanes Catalyzed by B(C6F5)3</title>

         <dc:description>
Acyclic tertiary amines with alkyl substitution undergo two consecutive C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation reactions with dihydrosilanes to form 4&#8208;silapiperidines. Bond formation occurs &#946; to the nitrogen atom at two of the alkyl residues. The reaction is catalyzed by the strong boron Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 and involves enamine intermediates generated by dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane has been found to catalyze the two&#8208;fold C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation of various trialkylamine derivatives with dihydrosilanes, furnishing the corresponding 4&#8208;silapiperidines in decent yields. The multi&#8208;step reaction cascade involves amine&#8208;to&#8208;enamine dehydrogenation at two alkyl residues and two electrophilic silylation reactions of those enamines, one inter&#8208; and one intramolecular.

         <title>Connecting Hydrophobic Surfaces in Cyclic Peptides Increases Membrane Permeability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 15, Page 8385-8390, April 6, 2021. </description>

N&#8208; or C&#945;&#8208;methylation of a cyclic peptide increases cell&#8208;membrane permeability only when it connects or extends existing hydrophobic patches. Positional isomers, with the same molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, calculated LogP, topological polar surface area, and total hydrophobic surface area, can have different membrane permeabilities that correlate with the size of the largest continuous hydrophobic surface patch.







Abstract
N&#8208; or C&#8208;methylation in natural and synthetic cyclic peptides can increase membrane permeability, but it remains unclear why this happens in some cases but not others. Here we compare three&#8208;dimensional structures for cyclic peptides from six families, including isomers differing only in the location of an N&#8208; or C&#945;&#8208;methyl substituent. We show that a single methyl group only increases membrane permeability when it connects or expands hydrophobic surface patches. Positional isomers, with the same molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, calculated LogP, topological polar surface area, and total hydrophobic surface area, can have different membrane permeabilities that correlate with the size of the largest continuous hydrophobic surface patch. These results illuminate a key local molecular determinant of membrane permeability.

         <title>Reorganization of self&#8208;assembled DNA&#8208;based polymers using orthogonally addressable building blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature uses the breaking and making of non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve the reversible formation and structural reconfiguration of biopolymers, a strategy that permits dynamic adaptation in response to external cues and to changes in the environment. Inspired by this observation and taking advantage of the addressability and programmability of DNA/DNA non&#8208;covalent interactions we report here the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that self&#8208;assemble into polymer&#8208;like structures that can be reconfigured and reorganized by external inputs. The different tiles share the same 5&#8208;nucleotide sticky ends responsible for self&#8208;assembly but are rationally designed to contain a specific regulator&#8208;binding domain that can be orthogonally targeted by different DNA regulator strands (activators and inhibitors). We show that by sequentially adding specific activators and inhibitors it is possible to re&#8208;organize in a dynamic and reversible way the formed polymer&#8208;like structures to display well&#8208;defined distributions: homopolymers made of a single tile, random polymers in which different tiles are distributed randomly and block structures in which the tiles are organized in segments. The versatility of the systems presented in this study shows the ease with which DNA&#8208;based addressable monomers can be designed to create reconfigurable synthetic micron&#8208;scale DNA structures offering a new approach to the growing field of supramolecular polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Triplet Blinking Using Cyclooctatetraene to Access the Dynamics of Biomolecules at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore the dynamics of biomolecules, tracing the kinetics of photo&#8208;induced chemical reactions via the triplet excited state (T1) of probe molecules offers a timescale that is ~10^6  &#160;  times wider than via the singlet excited state (S1). Here, using cyclooctatetraene (COT) as a triplet energy acceptor and at the same time as a photostabilizer, the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTET) kinetics governed by oligonucleotide (oligo) dynamics were studied at the single&#8208;molecule level by measuring fluorescence blinking. TTET kinetics measurement allowed us to access the length&#8208; and sequence&#8208;dependent dynamics of oligos, and realize the single&#8208;molecule detection of a model microRNA biomarker. In sharp contrast to the singlet&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that occurs in the 1&#8211;10 nm range, TTET requires a Van der Waals contact. Thus, the present method serves as a complementary method to FRET and provides direct information on biomolecular dynamics on the &#956;s to ms timescale.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Assemblies of Thiophosphopeptides Instantly Target Golgi Apparatus and Selectively Kill Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Golgi apparatus is emerging as a key signaling hub of cells and an important target for cancer therapy, but there are few approaches for targeting Golgi and selectively killing cancer cells. Here we show an unexpected result that changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phosphopeptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S&#8208;phosphate to the C&#8208;terminal of a self&#8208;assembling peptide generates a thiophosphopeptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP&#8208;catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self&#8208;assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi by themselves and with Golgi proteins. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (e.g., HeLa) with the IC  50  (about 3 &#956;M), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide. This work, as the first report of thiophosphopeptide for targeting Golgi, illustrates a new molecular platform for designing enzyme and redox responsive molecules that target subcellular compartment for functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Selective Protection of Peptides from Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic nanoparticles act as protecting agents for peptides from enzymatic action, enabling selective proteolysis of peptides in a mixture and selective hydrolysis at degenerate cleavage sites.







Abstract
Proteolysis of proteins and peptides is involved in the infection of cells by enveloped viruses and also in the invasion and spread of cancer cells. Shutting down broad&#8208;specificity proteases, however, is problematic because normal functions by these proteases will be affected. Herein, nanoparticle receptors were prepared from molecular imprinting for complex biological peptides. Their strong and selective binding enabled them to protect their targeted sequences from proteolysis in aqueous solution at stoichiometric amounts. Generality of the method was demonstrated by the protection of hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides from different proteases, selective protection of a segment of a long peptide, and selective protection of a targeted peptide in a mixture. Most interestingly, two receptors targeting different parts of a long peptide could work in cooperation to protect the overall sequence, highlighting the versatility of the method.

         <title>One&#8208;step Ethylene Purification from an Acetylene/Ethylene/Ethane Ternary Mixture by Cyclopentadiene Cobalt&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new modification method for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can realize one&#8208;step purification of ethylene in ternary gas mixture with a single adsorbent. 







Abstract
The separation of ethylene (C2H4) from a mixture of ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), and acetylene (C2H2) at normal temperature and pressure is a significant challenge. The sieving effect of pores is powerless due to the similar molecular size and kinetic diameter of these molecules. We report a new modification method based on a stable ftw topological Zr&#8208;MOF platform (MOF&#8208;525). Introduction of a cyclopentadiene cobalt functional group led to new ftw&#8208;type MOFs materials (UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613), which increase the host&#8208;guest interaction and achieve efficient ethylene purification from the mixture of hydrocarbon gases. The high performance of UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613 for C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 separation has been verified by gas sorption isotherms, density functional theory (DFT), and experimentally determined breakthrough curves. This work provides a one&#8208;step separation of the ternary gas mixture and can further serve as a blueprint for the design and construction of function&#8208;oriented porous structures for such applications.

         <title>A Balance Between Capture and Release: How Nanochaperones Regulate Refolding of Thermally Denatured Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two working mechanisms of nanochaperones in regulating the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme were fully deciphered. The balance between the capture and release of client proteins that are controlled by nanochaperones plays a key role in regulating the refolding of denatured proteins, regardless of the ATP&#8208;independent or ATP&#8208;dependent chaperones.







Abstract
Nanochaperones have been designed and used for regulating the (re)folding of proteins, treating protein misfolding&#8208;related diseases, and, more recently, in drug delivery. Despite various successes, a complete understanding of the working mechanisms remains elusive, which represents a challenge for the realization of their full potential. Here, we thoroughly investigated the functioning of differently charged nanochaperones that regulate the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme. We found that the balance between the capture and release of lysozyme clients that are controlled by nanochaperones plays a key role in regulating refolding. More importantly, the findings could be applied to other enzymes with various physicochemical properties. On the basis of these results, we could recover the activity of enzymes with high efficiency either after 20&#8197;days of storage at 40&#8201;&#176;C or heating at high temperatures for 30&#8211;60&#8197;min. Our results provide important new design strategies for nanochaperone systems to improve their properties and expand their applications.

         <title>Unprecedented 2D Homochiral Hybrid Lead&#8208;Iodide Perovskite Thermochromic Ferroelectrics with Ferroelastic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D homochiral lead&#8208;iodide perovskites were constructed by the introduction of a chiral center. The perovskites exhibit coexisting ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and reversible thermochromism, offering great application prospects for next&#8208;generation smart devices.







Abstract
Chiral perovskites have emerged as a significant class of materials showing promising optoelectronic and spintronic applications. Reports of chiral perovskite ferroelectrics, however, have been scarce. In this work, we have successfully synthesized homochiral lead&#8211;iodide perovskite ferroelectrics [(R)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 and [(S)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 by introducing a methyl group into the organic cation of the parent (N&#8208;benzylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium)PbI4. Vibrational circular dichroism spectra identify the chiral mirroring relationship. They both undergo 222F2&#8208;type paraelectric&#8211;ferroelectric behavior at around 378&#8197;K coupled with clear ferroelastic domain &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switching. Besides, they exhibit an evident thermochromism with color change from orange&#8211;yellow to orange&#8211;red. To our knowledge, the discovery of integrated ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and reversible thermochromism in chiral perovskites is unprecedented.

         <title>Implantable Biosupercapacitor Inspired by the Cellular Redox System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study describes an implantable supercapacitor using NAD+, which is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction.







Abstract
The carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn supercapacitor has high potential for in vivo energy storage because it can be used in aqueous environments and stitched to inner parts of the body, such as blood vessels. The biocompatibility issue for frequently used pseudocapacitive materials, such as metal oxides, is controversial in the human body. Here, we report an implantable CNT yarn supercapacitor inspired by the cellular redox system. In all living cells, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Based on this redox system, CNT yarn electrodes were fabricated by inserting a twist in CNT sheets with electrochemically deposited NAD and benzoquinone for redox shuttling. Consequently, the NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes exhibited the maximum area capacitance (55.73&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under physiological conditions, such as phosphate&#8208;buffered saline and serum. In addition, the yarn electrodes showed a negligible loss of capacitance after 10&#8201;000 repeated charge/discharge cycles and deformation tests (bending/knotting). More importantly, NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes implanted into the abdominal cavity of a rat's skin exhibited the stable in vivo electrical performance of a supercapacitor. Therefore, these findings demonstrate a redox biomolecule&#8208;applied platform for implantable energy storage devices.

         <title>Rotaxanes as Cages to Control DNA Binding, Cytotoxicity, and Cellular Uptake of a Small Molecule**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties including low bioavailability and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. Herein we demonstrate the potential for using mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane, leading to enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity in cancer cells compared to the &#8220;uncaged&#8221; metallodrug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity and translocation to the cell nucleus.







Abstract
The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties, such as poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. To combat this, various drug carriers have been investigated to enhance the pharmacological profile of therapeutic agents. In this work, we demonstrate the use of mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane. More specifically, we report the synthesis of rotaxanes incorporating as a stoppering unit a known G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binder, namely a PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This compound cannot interact with DNA when it is part of the mechanically interlocked assembly. The second rotaxane stopper can be cleaved by either light or an esterase, releasing the PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This system shows enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity within osteosarcoma cells compared to the free drug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity, arising from the translocation of PtII&#8208;salphen to the nucleus and its binding to DNA.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of 3d&#8208;Block Metal (Hydro)oxides by Ligand&#8208;Induced Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general ligand&#8208;induced conversion strategy was proposed to boost the electrocatalytic activities of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides. After the introduction of an organic ligand, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) increased by &#8776;5.7 times.







Abstract
The 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal (hydro)oxides belong to a group of highly efficient, scalable and inexpensive electrocatalysts for widespread energy&#8208;related applications that feature easily tailorable crystal and electronic structures. We propose a general strategy to further boost their electrocatalytic activities by introducing organic ligands into the framework, considering that most 3d&#8208;metal (hydro)oxides usually exhibit quite strong binding with reaction intermediates and thus compromised activity due to the scaling relations. Involving weakly bonded ligands downshifts the d&#8208;band center, which narrows the band gap, and optimizes the adsorption of these intermediates. For example, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be greatly promoted by &#8776;5.7 times over a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) after a terephthalic acid (TPA)&#8208;induced conversion process, arising from the reduced energy barrier of the deprotonation of OH* to O*. Impressively, the proposed ligand&#8208;induced conversion strategy is applicable to a series of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides, including NiFe2O4, NiCo2O4, and NiZn LDH, providing a general structural upgrading scheme for existing high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Rhodium Catalyzed Regioselective C&#8722;H Allylation of Simple Arenes via C&#8722;C Bond Activation of Gem&#8208;difluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium catalyzed C(aryl)&#8722;C(allyl) bond&#8208;forming reaction is achieved via a combination of C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C activation. Gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates, enabling C&#8722;H allylation of a variety of simple arenes under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a rhodium catalyzed directing&#8208;group free regioselective C&#8722;H allylation of simple arenes. Readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates via a sequence of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F bond activation, providing allyl arene derivatives in good yields with high regioselectivity under mild conditions. The robust methodology enables facile late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules. The high efficiency of this reaction is also demonstrated by the high turnover number (TON, up to 1700) of the rhodium catalyst on gram&#8208;scale experiments. Preliminary success on kinetic resolution of this transformation is achieved, providing a promising access to enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.

         <title>(&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A, a Naturally Occurring Immunosuppressive Meroditerpenoid: Structure Elucidation and Scalable Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the isolation, structure determination of (&#8722;)&#8208;isoscopariusin&#8197;A by spectroscopic analysis and concise chemical synthesis. The unprecedented meroditerpenoid bears a 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters, and exhibits selective inhibition of T&#8208;cell proliferation. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from (+)&#8208;sclareolide.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A was isolated from the aerial parts of Isodon scoparius. Chemical synthesis and spectroscopic analysis established its structure as an unsymmetrical meroditerpenoid bearing a sterically congested 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from commercially available (+)&#8208;sclareolide. A cobalt catalyzed, hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;based olefin isomerization was used to prepare a trisubstituted alkene, which underwent stereoselective [2+2] cycloaddition with a substituted keteniminium ion generated in situ from the corresponding amide. The cyclobutanone product was further elaborated into the fully substituted cyclobutane core through face&#8208;selective homologation, and the two side chains were installed by using nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and carbodiimide&#8208;mediated esterification, respectively. (&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A displayed selective inhibition of T&#8208;cell proliferation.

         <title>Strong Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acidic Sites in the Borosulfate Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ever&#8208;expanding chemistry of borosulfates is enriched by the novel borosulfate Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 featuring an unprecedented Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct of water to the anion [B(SO4)3]3&#8722;. Isodesmic exchange calculations revealed high Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acidity, opening new insights and perspectives for this fascinating silicate&#8208;analogous material class.







Abstract
Borosulfates provide fascinating structures and properties that go beyond a pure analogy to silicates. Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 is the first borosulfate featuring a boron atom solely coordinated by three tetrahedra. Thus, the free Lewis acidic site forms a Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct with a water molecule. This is unprecedented for borosulfate chemistry and even for borates. Quantum chemical calculations on water exchange reactions with BF3 and B(C6F5)3 revealed a higher Lewis acidity for the borosulfate anion. Moreover, proton exchange reactions showed a higher Br&#248;nsted acidity than comparable silicates or phosphates. Additionally, Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 was characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8594;B(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the first borosulfate featuring a boron atom solely coordinated by three tetrahedra. Thus, the free Lewis acidic site forms a Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct with a water molecule. This is unprecedented for borosulfate chemistry and even for borates. Quantum chemical calculations on water exchange reactions with BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; revealed a higher Lewis acidity for the borosulfate anion. Moreover, proton exchange reactions showed a higher Br&#248;nsted acidity than comparable silicates or phosphates. Additionally, Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8594;B(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Binding Molecular Photothermal Agent for Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal therapy usually requires a high power density to activate photothermal agent for effective treatment, which inevitably leads to damage to normal tissues and inflammation in tumor tissues. Herein, we rationally design a protein&#8208;binding strategy to build a molecular photothermal agent for photothermal ablation of tumor. The synthesized photothermal agent can covalently bind to the thiol groups on the intracellular proteins. The heat generated by the photothermal agent directly destroyed the bioactive proteins in the cells, effectively reducing the heat loss and the molecular leakage. Under a low power density of 0.2 W/cm2, the temperature produced by the photothermal agent was sufficient to induce apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the therapeutic effect of photothermal therapy can be efficiently improved with the protein&#8208;binding strategy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel concept of  NORD  (  NO R  elaxation  D  elay) NMR spectroscopy is introduced. The idea is to design concatenated experiments in a way that the magnetization used in the first relaxes toward equilibrium during the second and vice versa, thus saving instrument time. Applications include complete well&#8208;resolved  1  H&#8208;  1  H and  1  H&#8208;  13  C one&#8208;bond and long&#8208;range correlation maps of an 80 mM solution of a trisaccharide recorded in less than two minutes and hydrocortisone with extensive spectral overlap.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Rotor&#8208;Driven Advanced Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;driven advanced porous materials (MR&#8208;APMs) can expand the chemical and physical properties of conventional rigid porous solids and drive the development of sophisticated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. This Minireview emphasizes the strategies for the localization and characterization of molecular rotors in porous materials as well as the exploration of their rotor&#8208;induced specific functionalities.







Abstract
Advanced porous materials (APMs)&#8212;such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs)&#8212;have emerged as an exciting research frontier of chemistry and materials science. Given their tunable pore size and extensive diversity, APMs have found widespread applications. In addition, adding dynamic functional groups to porous solids furthers the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. By incorporating moving elements&#8212;molecular rotors&#8212;into the porous frameworks, molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;driven advanced porous materials (MR&#8208;APMs) can respond reversibly to chemical and physical stimuli, thus imparting dynamic functionalities that have not been found in conventional porous materials. This Minireview discusses exemplary MR&#8208;APMs in terms of their design, synthesis, rotor dynamics, and potential applications.

         <dc:description>
An aptamer blocking strategy is demonstrated by Honglin Chen, Yanling Song, Chaoyong Yang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100225) to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. An aptamer probe was engineered to bind to the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, which inhibits infection of the virus by blocking the interaction of the virus with ACE2 receptors on human cell membrane.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive phenomena are widely observed in nature. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202017089), Chongli Zhong, Dan Zhao, and co&#8208;workers report pressure&#8208;responsive MOF composite membranes based on the gate&#8208;opening effect of CO2 molecules which function as a &#8220;key&#8221; to open the MOF gates. Large jumps of the CO2 permeance and the CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities occur above the gate&#8208;opening pressure of the flexible MOF, demonstrating a smart gas separation behavior.

Maize to medicine! With annual production at &gt;85&#8197;million tons/year, ethanol is the world's largest&#8208;volume renewable small molecule carbon source, yet its use as a C2&#8208;feedstock in enantioselective C&#8722;C coupling is unknown.

         <title>Regulative Electronic States around Ruthenium/Ruthenium Disulphide Heterointerfaces for Efficient Water Splitting in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting from the rearranged charge density around the abundant interface and the enhanced electronic states, in acidic media, the Ru/RuS2 heterostructure exhibits prominent catalytic activity toward oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, and consequent remarkably high overall water splitting performance, demonstrating promising application prospect for industrial proton exchange membrane&#8208;water electrolysis.







Abstract
Theoretical calculations unveil the charge redistribution over abundant interfaces and the enhanced electronic states of Ru/RuS2 heterostructure. The resulting surface electron&#8208;deficient Ru sites display optimized adsorption behavior toward diverse reaction intermediates, thereby reducing the thermodynamic energy barriers. Experimentally, for the first time the laminar Ru/RuS2 heterostructure is rationally engineered by virtue of the synchronous reduction and sulfurization under eutectic salt system. Impressively, it exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for both OER (201&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and HER (45&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in acidic media due to favorable kinetics and excellent specific activity, consequently leading to a terrific performance in acidic overall water splitting devices (1.501&#8197;V @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The in&#8208;depth insight into the internal activity origin of interfacial effect could offer precise guidance for the rational establishment of hybrid interfaces.

         <title>Cage&#8208;Like Porous Materials with Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Excellent C2H2/CO2 Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cage&#8208;like FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;R (R=Me, Et, nPr and iPr) series all exhibit excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance, which may overcome the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation performance.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based separation is an important technology for C2H2 purification due to the environmentally friendly and energy&#8208;efficient advantage. In addition to the high selectivity of C2H2/CO2, the high uptake of C2H2 also plays an important role in the separation progress. However, the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation performance is still in a dilemma. Herein, we report a series of cage&#8208;like porous materials named FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;R (R=Me, Et, nPr and iPr) which all have high C2H2 uptakes at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K. Dynamic breakthrough studies show that they all exhibit excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance. Particularly, FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;Me possesses a long breakthrough time up to 90&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation reveals that the suitable pore space and geometry contribute much to the excellent separation performance.

         <title>Au&#8211;Ag Bimetallic Catalysis: 3&#8208;Alkynyl Benzofurans from Phenols via Tandem C&#8722;H Alkynylation/Oxy&#8208;Alkynylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and general synthesis of 3&#8208;alkynylbenzofurans from readily available phenols by Au&#8211;Ag bimetallic catalysis has been developed. Importantly, this also advances our mechanistic understanding of the &#8220;silver effect&#8221; in gold redox chemistry.







Abstract
The development of new methodologies enabling a facile access to valuable heterocyclic frameworks still is an important subject of research. In this context, we describe a dual catalytic cycle merging C&#8722;H alkynylation of phenols and oxy&#8208;alkynylation of the newly introduced triple bond by using a unique redox property and the carbophilic &#960;&#8197;acidity of gold. Mechanistic studies support the participation of a bimetallic gold&#8211;silver species. The one&#8208;pot protocol offers a direct, simple, and regio&#8208;specific approach to 3&#8208;alkynyl benzofurans from readily available phenols. A broad range of substrates, including heterocycles, is transferred with excellent functional group tolerance. Thus, this methodology can be used for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of benzofurans.

         <title>Conversion of Dinitrogen into Nitrile: Cross&#8208;Metathesis of N2&#8208;Derived Molybdenum Nitride with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of N2 splitting on a Mo complex followed by nitrile&#8211;alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis results in the direct synthesis of nitrile from dinitrogen under mild conditions. This provides a new strategy for functionalizing N2&#8208;derived metal nitrido complexes.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of nitrile from N2 under mild conditions is of great importance and has attracted much interest. Herein, we report a direct conversion of N2 into nitrile via a nitrile&#8211;alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis (NACM) process involving a N2&#8208;derived Mo nitride. Treatment of the Mo nitride with alkyne in the presence of KOTf afforded an alkyne&#8208;coordinated nitride, which was then transformed into MoV carbyne and the corresponding nitrile upon 1&#8201;e&#8722; oxidation. Both aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes underwent this process smoothly. Experiments and DFT calculations have proved that the oxidation state of the Mo center plays a crucial role. This method does not rely on the nucleophilicity of the N2&#8208;derived metal nitride, offering a novel strategy for N2 fixation chemistry.

         <title>Regulating the Local Charge Distribution of Ni Active Sites for the Urea Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient W&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;WOx UOR catalyst for the urea oxidation reaction has been devised which could be used in CO2 electroreduction devices. A low cell voltage of 2.16&#8197;V was achieved in a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolyzer, saving 15&#8201;% energy compared to standard devices based on the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) accounts for a large proportion of the energy consumption. The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising alternatives to OER, owing to its low thermodynamic potential. However, owing to the sluggish UOR kinetics, its potential in practical use has not been unlocked. Herein, we developed a tungsten&#8208;doped nickel catalyst (Ni&#8208;WOx) with superior activity towards UOR. The Ni&#8208;WOx catalyst exhibited record fast reaction kinetics (440&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and a high turnover frequency of 0.11&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is 4.8 times higher than that without W dopants. In further experiments, we found that the W dopant regulated the local charge distribution of Ni atoms, leading to the formation of Ni3+ sites with superior activity and thus accelerating the interfacial catalytic reaction. Moreover, when we integrated Ni&#8208;WOx into a CO2 flow electrolyzer, the cell voltage is reduced to 2.16&#8197;V accompanying with &#8776;98&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards carbon monoxide.

         <title>Making Waxy Salts in Water: Synthetic Control of Hydrophobicity for Anion&#8208;Induced and Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition in water is an unperfected art in synthetic supramolecular chemistry. We demonstrate that the inherent hydrophobicity of tripodal fluorogenic cations can be synthetically modulated to control the sensitivity toward large, non&#8208;spherical, and charge&#8208;diffuse anions in water.







Abstract
We show that multipodal polycationic receptors function as anion&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitters in water. Prevailing paradigms utilize rigid holes and cavities for ion recognition. We instead built open amphiphilic scaffolds that trigger polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar environment transitions around cationic fluorophores upon anion complexation. This ion&#8208;pairing and aggregation event produces a dramatic enhancement in the emission intensity, as demonstrated by perchlorate as a non&#8208;spherical hydrophobic anion model. A synergetic interplay of C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion hydrogen bonding and tight anion&#8211;&#960;+ contacts underpins this supramolecular phenomenon. By changing the aliphatic chain length, we demonstrate that the response profile and threshold of this signaling event can be controlled at the molecular level. With appropriate molecular design, inherently weak, ill&#8208;defined, and non&#8208;directional van der Waals interaction enables selective, sensitive, and tunable recognition in water.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Pyroglutamic Acid Esters from Glycinate via Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of chiral pyridoxal 5&#8201;d as a carbonyl catalyst, asymmetric 1,4&#8208;conjugated addition at the &#945;&#8208;position of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and subsequent in situ lactamization formed chiral pyroglutamic acid esters 4 in 43&#8211;96&#8201;% yields with 81&#8211;97&#8201;% enantioselectivities, providing an interesting and straightforward way to make chemically and biologically significant pyroglutamic acid derivatives.







Abstract
Direct &#945;&#8208;functionalization of NH2&#8208;free glycinates with relatively weak electrophiles such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters still remains a big challenge in organic synthesis. With chiral pyridoxal 5&#8201;d as a carbonyl catalyst, direct asymmetric conjugated addition at the &#945;&#8208;C of glycinate 1&#8201;a with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters 2 has been successfully realized, to produce various chiral pyroglutamic acid esters 4 in 14&#8211;96&#8201;% yields with 81&#8211;97&#8201;% ee's after in situ lactamization. The trans and cis diastereomers can be obtained at the same time by chromatography and both of them can be easily converted into chiral 4&#8208;substituted pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones such as Alzheimer's drug Rolipram (11) with the same absolute configuration via tert&#8208;butyl group removal and subsequent Barton decarboxylation.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Separation of n&#8208;Hexane by a Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Reduced Energy Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic metal&#8208;organic framework with breathing effect shows unique separation properties toward hexane isomers. A reversed relationship between uptake capacity and diffusion rate as a function of temperature caused by the structure dynamic provides a new perspective for optimized separation performance at lower temperatures and with less energy consumption.







Abstract
The separation of n&#8208;alkanes from their branched isomers is vitally important to improve octane rating of gasoline. To facilitate mass transfer, adsorptive separation is usually operated under high temperatures in industry, which require considerable energy. Herein, we present a kind of dynamic pillar&#8208;layered MOF that exhibits self&#8208;adjustable structure and pore space, a behavior induced by guest molecules. A combination of the flexibility of the framework with the commensurate adsorption for n&#8208;hexane results in exceptional performance in separating hexane isomers. More significantly, lower temperature prompts the guest molecules to open the dynamic pores, which may provide a new perspective for optimized separation performance at lower temperatures with less energy consumption.

         <title>Ultrafast Excimer Formation and Solvent Controlled Symmetry Breaking Charge Separation in the Excitonically Coupled Subphthalocyanine Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent polarity tunes the interplay of excimer formation and symmetry breaking charge separation (SB&#8211;CS) in the photoexcited subphthalocyanine dimer.







Abstract
Knowledge of the factors controlling excited state dynamics in excitonically coupled dimers and higher aggregates is critical for understanding natural and artificial solar energy conversion. In this work, we report ultrafast solvent polarity dependent excited state dynamics of the structurally well&#8208;defined subphthalocyanine dimer, &#956;&#8208;OSubPc2. Stationary electronic spectra demonstrate strong exciton coupling in &#956;&#8208;OSubPc2. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements reveal ultrafast excimer formation from the initially excited exciton, mediated by intramolecular structural evolution. In polar solvents the excimer state decays directly through symmetry breaking charge transfer to form a charge separated state. Charge separation occurs under control of solvent orientational relaxation.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Benzyl Alcohols via Palladium/Chiral Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a highly enantioselective kinetic resolution of tertiary benzyl alcohols via palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis. With simple aryl iodides as the resolution reagent, a wide range of readily available racemic tertiary benzyl alcohols are applicable to this method. Both chiral tertiary benzyl alcohols and benzo[c]chromene products are obtained in good to excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity factor up to 544). The appealing synthetic utility of the obtained enantioenriched tertiary alcohols is demonstrated by the facile preparation of several valuable chiral heterocycles. Preliminary mechanism studies include DFT calculations to explain the origin of enantiodiscrimination and control experiments to uncover the formation of a transient axial chirality during the kinetic resolution step.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry uncovers guest&#8208;induced distortions in a supramolecular organometallic metallosquare</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The encapsulation of the tetracationic palladium metallosquare with four pyrene&#8208;bis&#8208;imidazolylidene ligands [  1  ]  4+  with a series of organic molecules was studied by Electrospray ionization Travelling Wave Ion&#8208;Mobility Mass Spectrometry (ESI TWIM&#8208;MS). The method allowed to determine the Collision Cross Sections (SCCs), which were used to assess the size changes experienced by the host upon encapsulation of the guest molecules. When fullerenes were used as guests, the host is expanded &#916;CCS 13 &#197;  2  and 23 &#197;  2  , for C  60  or C  70  , respectively. The metallorectangle [  1  ]  4+  was also used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and naphtalenetetracarboxylic diimide (NTCDI), to form complexes of formula [(NTCDI)  2  (PAH)@  1  ]  4+  , in which the PAH molecule is sandwiched between the two NTCDI guests. For these host:guest adducts, the ESI IM&#8208;MS studies revealed that [  1  ]  4+  is expanded by 47&#8208;49 &#197;  2  , regardless the nature of the PAH molecule used. The energy&#8208;minimized structures of [  1  ]  4+  , [C  60  @  1  ]  4+  , [C  70  @  1  ]  4+  , [(NTCDI)  2  (corannulene)@  1  ]  4+  in the gas phase were obtained by DFT calculations.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The encapsulation of the tetracationic palladium metallosquare with four pyrene&#8208;bis&#8208;imidazolylidene ligands [  1  ]  4+  with a series of organic molecules was studied by Electrospray ionization Travelling Wave Ion&#8208;Mobility Mass Spectrometry (ESI TWIM&#8208;MS). The method allowed to determine the Collision Cross Sections (SCCs), which were used to assess the size changes experienced by the host upon encapsulation of the guest molecules. When fullerenes were used as guests, the host is expanded &#916;CCS 13 &#197;  2  and 23 &#197;  2  , for C  60  or C  70  , respectively. The metallorectangle [  1  ]  4+  was also used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and naphtalenetetracarboxylic diimide (NTCDI), to form complexes of formula [(NTCDI)  2  (PAH)@  1  ]  4+  , in which the PAH molecule is sandwiched between the two NTCDI guests. For these host:guest adducts, the ESI IM&#8208;MS studies revealed that [  1  ]  4+  is expanded by 47&#8208;49 &#197;  2  , regardless the nature of the PAH molecule used. The energy&#8208;minimized structures of [  1  ]  4+  , [C  60  @  1  ]  4+  , [C  70  @  1  ]  4+  , [(NTCDI)  2  (corannulene)@  1  ]  4+  in the gas phase were obtained by DFT calculations.

         <title>Multicolor Mechanofluorophores for the Quantitative Detection of Covalent Bond Scission in Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fracture of polymer materials is a multiscale process starting with the scission of a single molecular bond advancing to a site of failure within the bulk. Quantifying the bonds broken during this process remains a big challenge yet would help to understand the distribution and dissipation of macroscopic mechanical energy. We here show the design and synthesis of fluorogenic molecular optical force probes (mechanofluorophores) covering the entire visible spectrum in both absorption and emission. Their dual fluorescent character allows to track non&#8208;broken and broken bonds in dissolved and bulk polymers by fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. Importantly, we develop an approach to determine the absolute number and relative fraction of intact and cleaved bonds with high local resolution. We anticipate that our mechanofluorophores in combination with our quantification methodology will allow to quantitatively describe fracture processes in materials ranging from soft hydrogels to high&#8208;performance polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated glycan assembly of 19F labelled glycan probes enables high&#8208;throughput NMR studies of protein&#8208;glycan interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;glycan interactions mediate important biological processes, including pathogen host invasion and cellular communication. Major challenges to monitoring these low affinity interactions are the required high sensitivity of a biophysical assay and to cover a breath of synthetic well&#8208;defined structures. Here, we showcase an expedite approach that integrates automated glycan assembly (AGA) of  19  F labelled probes and high&#8208;throughput NMR methods, enabling the study of protein&#8208;glycan interactions. Synthetic Lewis type 2 antigens were screened against seven glycan binding proteins (GBPs), including DC&#8208;SIGN and BambL, respectively involved in HIV&#8208;1 and lung infections in immunocompromised patients, confirming the preference for fucosylated glycans (Le  x  , H type 2, Le  y  ). Previously unknown glycan&#8208;lectin weak interactions were detected, and thermodynamic data were obtained. Enzymatic reactions were monitored in real&#8208;time, delivering kinetic parameters. These results demonstrate the utility of AGA combined with  19  F NMR for the discovery and characterization of glycan&#8208;protein interactions, opening up new perspectives for  19  F labelled complex glycans.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring structure and function of redox intermediates of [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenases by an advanced experimental approach for solvated, lyophilized and crystallized metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A profound mechanistic characterization of complex metalloenzymes requires a multitude of complementary techniques. In this context, we developed a new experimental setup allowing controlled preparation of catalytic intermediates for characterization by various spectroscopic techniques. The  in situ  monitoring of redox transitions by infrared spectroscopy in enzyme lyophilizate, crystals and solution during gas exchange in a wide temperature range can be accomplished as well. As a proof of concept, two O  2  &#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenases were investigated as model systems. First, we utilized our platform to prepare highly concentrated hydrogenase lyophilizate in a paramagnetic state harboring a bridging hydride. This procedure proved beneficial for  57  Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy and revealed, in combination with density functional theory calculations, the vibrational fingerprint of this catalytic intermediate. Furthermore, in combination with resonance Raman spectroscopy, the same  in situ  IR setup provided detailed insights into the redox chemistry of enzyme crystals, underlining the general necessity to complement X&#8208;ray crystallographic data with spectroscopic analyses.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a concise, collective, and asymmetric total synthesis of sarpagine alkaloids and biogenetically related koumine alkaloids, which structurally feature a rigid cage scaffold, with L&#8208;tryptophan as the starting material. Two key bridged skeleton&#8208;forming reactions, namely tandem sequential oxidative cyclopropanol ring&#8208;opening cyclization and ketone &#945;&#8208;allenylation, ensure concurrent assembly of the caged sarpagine scaffold and installation of requisite derivative handles. With a common caged intermediate as the branch point, by taking advantage of ketone and allene groups therein, total synthesis of five sarpagine alkaloids (affinisine, normacusine B, trinervine, Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine, and vellosimine) with various substituents and three koumine alkaloids (koumine, koumimine, and N&#8208;demethylkoumine) with more complex cage scaffolds has been accomplished.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards the Highly Efficient Synthesis and Selective Methylation of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged [6]Cycloparaphenylenes from Fluoren[3]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach to the highly efficient synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylenes (C[6]CPPs) from fluoren[3]arenes (F[3]As) was developed. Consequently, F[3]As as a new kind of macrocyclic arenes were synthesized. Followed by the demethylation, triflation and intramolecular aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, C[6]CPPs were then conveniently obtained. Interestingly, C[6]CPPs could be selectively methylated to produce their fully outer&#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted derivatives. The crystal structures showed the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted F[3]As had bowl&#8208;shaped conformations, and the C[6]CPPs exhibited rigid belt&#8208;shaped structures with deep cavities. Moreover, C[6]CPPs exhibited high HOMO energies and narrow energy gaps. An unclosed belt was further obtained, and it not only showed a similar narrow energy gap to those of the aromatic belts, but also displayed strong fluorescence property, which can play a vital role in the design and synthesis of new aromatic belts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are attractive targets for bioengineering to generate useful peptides . F moA3 is a single modular NRPS composed of heterocyclization (Cy), adenylation (A), and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains. It use s &#945; &#8208; methyl&#8208; l &#8208;serine to synthesize a 4&#8208;methyloxazoline ring, probably with another Cy domain in the preceding module FmoA2. Here, we determined the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail homodimeric structures of FmoA3 by X&#8208;ray crystallography (  apo  &#8208;form, with adenylyl&#8208;imidodiphosphate and &#945; &#8208;methyl&#8208; l &#8208;seryl&#8208;AMP) and cryogenic electron microscopy single particle analysis, and performed site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments. The data revealed that &#945; &#8208;methyl&#8208; l &#8208;serine can be accommodated in the active site because of the extra space around Ala688. The Cy domains of FmoA2 and FmoA3 catalyze peptide bond formation and heterocyclization, respectively. FmoA3&#8217;s Cy domain seems to lose its donor PCP binding activit y. The collective data support a proposed catalytic cycle of FmoA3.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced low&#8208;flammable electrolytes for stable operation of high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite being an effective flame retardant, trimethyl phosphate (TMP  a  ) is generally considered as an unqualified solvent for fabricating electrolytes used in graphite (Gr) based lithium&#8208;ion batteries as it readily leads to Gr exfoliation and cell failure. In this work, by adopting the unique solvation structure of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to TMP  a  and tuning the composition of the solvation sheathes  via  electrolyte additives, excellent electrochemical performance can be achieved with TMP  a  based electrolytes in Gr||LiNi  0.8  Mn  0.1  Co  0.1  O  2  cells. After 500 charge/discharge cycles within the voltage range of 2.5&#8208;4.4 V, the batteries containing TMP  a  based LHCEs with proper additive can achieve a capacity retention of 85.4%, being significantly higher than cells using a LiPF  6  &#8208;organocarbonates baseline electrolyte (75.2%). Meanwhile, due to the flame retarding effect of TMP  a  , TMP  a  based LHCEs exhibit significantly reduced flammability compared with the conventional LiPF  6  &#8208;organocarbonates electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Halide Replacement with Complete Preservation of Crystal Lattice in Mixed&#8208;Anion Lanthanide Oxyhalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed anion compounds afford considerable compositional diversity and tunability of function. A challenging aspect of anion control of properties of periodic solids is to preserve the crystal lattice while substituting for different anions of widely varying size and hardness. Post&#8208;synthetic modification routes that place cations or anions in non&#8208;equilibrium configurations represent a promising means of decoupling composition and crystal structure and for accessing metastable solids; however, such methods remain relatively unexplored for anion placement. Here, we report the synthesis of LaOI nanocrystals by a non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel condensation reaction and their transformation into LaOBr, LaOCl, and LaOF nanocrystals along hard&#8212;soft&#8212;acid&#8212;base principles using post&#8208;synthetic metathesis reactions with ammonium halides. Anion displacement proceeds along halide planes preserving the tetragonal matlockite structure. Energy&#8208;variant X&#8208;ray excited optical luminesce signatures of alloyed Tb3+&#8208;ions serves as a sensitive quantum reporter of the preservation of the cation sublattice and hardening of the crystal structure upon anion replacement.</dc:description>

         <title>25 years of Reticular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At its core, reticular chemistry has translated the precision and expertise of organic and inorganic synthesis to the solid state. While initial excitement over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) was undoubtedly fueled by their unprecedented porosity and surface areas, the most profound scientific innovation of the field has been the elaboration of design strategies for the synthesis of extended crystalline solids through strong directional bonds. In this contribution we highlight the different classes of reticular materials that have been developed, how these frameworks can be functionalized and how complexity can be introduced into their backbones. Finally, we show how the structural control over these materials is being extended from the molecular scale to their crystal morphology and shape on the nanoscale, all the way to their shaping on the bulk scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirogenesis and Amplification of Molecular Chirality Using Optical Vortices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of chirogenesis of organic molecules is important to elucidate the origin of the homochirality of biomolecules on Earth. Here, we have accomplished chiral symmetry breaking from a racemate using optical vortices with orbital angular momentum and a helical wavefront. We propose a new methodology of asymmetric transformation by the combination of (1) enantioselective crystal nucleation by irradiation with optical vortices and (2) crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic optical resolution of conglomerate crystals. Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532 nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization. This transfer of the physical chirality of light quanta to molecular chirality was performed for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Photocatalyzed Hydroboration of Alkynes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes is reported. The use of newly&#8208;designed copper photocatalysts with B  2  Pin  2  &#160;permits the formation a boryl radical, which is used for hydroboration of a large panel of alkenes and alkynes. The hydroborated products were isolated in high yields, with excellent diastereoselectivities and a high functional group tolerance under mild conditions. The hydroboration reactions were developed under continuous flow conditions to demonstrate their synthetic utility. The reaction mechanism was studied and suggested an oxidation reaction between an in situ formed borate and the Cu&#8208;photocatalyst in its excited state for the boryl radical formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and biosynthesis of a structurally dynamic antibacterial diterpenoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new bicyclic diterpenoid, benditerpenoic acid, was isolated from soil&#8208;dwelling&#160;Streptomyces&#160;sp. (CL12&#8208;4). We sequenced the bacterial genome, identified the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster, verified the function of the terpene synthase, and heterologously produced the core diterpene. Comparative bioinformatics indicated this&#160;Streptomyces&#160;strain is phylogenetically unique and possesses nine terpene synthases. The absolute configurations of the new&#160;trans&#8208;fused bicyclo[8.4.0]tetradecanes were achieved by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including Mosher&#8217;s analysis,&#160;J&#8208;based coupling analysis, and computations based on sparse NMR&#8208;derived experimental restraints. Interestingly, benditerpenoic acid exists in two distinct ring&#8208;flipped bicyclic conformations with a rotational barrier of ~16 kcal mol&#8208;1&#160;in solution. The diterpenes exhibit moderate antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including methicillin and multi&#8208;drug resistant&#160;Staphylococcus aureus. This is the first isolation of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Potassium&#8208;Rich Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode for High Power Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most of the cathode materials for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) suffer from poor structural stability due to the large ionic radius of K +  , resulting in poor cycling stability. Here we report a low&#8208;strain potassium&#8208;rich K 1.84  Ni[Fe(CN) 6  ] 0.88  &#8729;0.49H 2  O (KNiHCF) as a cathode material for PIBs. The as&#8208;prepared KNiHCF cathode can deliver reversible discharge capacity of 62.8 mAh g &#8722;1  at 100 mA&#183;g &#8722;1  , with a high discharge voltage of 3.82 V. It can also achieve a superior rate performance of 45.8 mAh g &#8722;1  at 5000 mA g &#8722;1  , with a capacity retention of 88.6% after 100 cycles. The combination of in situ  characterizations and theoretical calculations unveils that the superior performance of KNiHCF cathode results from low&#8208;strain de&#8208;/intercalation mechanism, intrinsic semiconductor property and low potassium diffusion energy barrier. In addition, the high power density and long term stability of KNiHCF//graphite full cell have further proved the feasibility of K&#8208;rich KNiHCF cathode in PIBs. This work is expected to provide meaningful guidance to develop Prussian blue analogues as cathode materials for high&#8208;performance PIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of the Elusive 9&#8208;Carbene&#8208;9&#8208;Borafluorene Monoanion</title>

The electronic structure, bonding, and aromaticity of the boracyclic anions were comprehensively investigated via computational studies. Compounds&#160;  5  &#160;and&#160;  8  &#160;react with metal halides via salt elimination to give new B&#8722;E (E = Au, Se, Ge)&#8208;containing materials (  9  &#8208;  12  ). Upon reaction with diketones, the carbene ligand cleanly dissociates from&#160;  5  &#160;or&#160;  8  &#160;to yield new B&#8722;O containing spirocycles (  13  &#8208;  14  ) that cannot be easily obtained using "normal" valent borafluorene compounds.

         <title>High Pressure In Situ Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Reveals Turnstile Linker Rotation Upon Room&#8208;Temperature Stepped Uptake Of Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rare availability of suitable single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) structural data allows for the direct interpretation of the response of a framework to gas sorption and may lead to the development of improved functional porous materials. We report an  in situ  SCXRD structural investigation of a flexible MOF subjected to methane, ethane, propane and butane gas pressures. Supporting theoretical investigations indicate weak host&#8208;guest interactions for the crystallographically modeled gaseous guests and, in addition, reveal that a turnstile mechanism facilitates the transport of alkanes through the seemingly nonporous system. Inflections present in the adsorption isotherms are furthermore rationalized as due to gate&#8208;opening, but without the expected creation of new accessible space.</dc:description>

         <title>An electrically conducting three&#8208;dimensional iron&#8208;catecholate porous framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the synthesis of a unique cubic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), the Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF, comprising hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) supertetrahedral units and FeIII ions, arranged in a diamond topology. The MOF is synthesized under solvothermal conditions, yielding a highly crystalline, deep black powder, with crystallites of 300&#8208;500&#160;nm size and tetrahedral morphology. Nitrogen sorption analysis indicates a highly porous material with a surface area exceeding 1400&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF shows broadband absorption from 475 nm up to 1900 nm with excellent absorption capability of 98.5% of the incoming light over the visible spectral region. Electrical conductivity measurements of pressed pellets reveal a high intrinsic electrical conductivity of up to 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. Quantum mechanical calculations predict Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF to be an efficient electron conductor, exhibiting continuous charge&#8208;carrier pathways throughout the structure. This report expands the paradigm of intrinsically electroactive MOFs, serving as a solid basis for the development of highly porous, ordered frameworks with enhanced electrical conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics that target the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8209;catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein complexes are defined by the three&#8208;dimensional structure of participating binding partners. Knowledge about these structures can facilitate the design of peptidomimetics which have been applied e.g. as inhibitors of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Even though &#946;&#8208;sheets participate widely in PPIs, they have only rarely served as the basis for peptidomimetic PPI inhibitors, in particular when addressing intracellular targets. Here, we present the structure&#8208;based design of &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics targeting the intracellular protein &#946;&#8208;catenin, a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on a protein binding partner of &#946;&#8208;catenin, a macrocyclic peptide was designed and its crystal structure in complex with &#946;&#8208;catenin obtained. Using this structure, we designed a library of bicyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics employing a late&#8208;stage diversification strategy. Several mimetics were identified that compete with transcription factor binding to &#946;&#8208;catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling in cells. The presented design strategy can support the development of inhibitors for other &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;mediated PPIs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclotetrabenzoin Acetate: A Macrocyclic Porous Molecular Crystal for CO2 Separations by Pressure Swing Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A porous molecular crystal (PMC) assembled by macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is an efficient adsorbent for CO2 separations. The 7.1&#215;7.1 &#197; square pore of PMC and its ester C=O groups play important roles in improving its affinity for CO2 molecules. The benzene walls of macrocycle engage in an apparent [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interaction with the molecule of CO2 at low pressure. In addition, the polar carbonyl groups pointing inward the square channels reduce the size of aperture to a 5.0&#215;5.0 &#197; square, which offers kinetic selectivity for CO2 capture. The PMC features water tolerance and high structural stability under vacuum and various gas adsorption conditions, which are rare among intrinsically porous organic molecules. Most importantly, the moderate adsorbate&#8211;adsorbent interaction allows the PMC to be readily regenerated, and therefore applied to pressure swing adsorption processes. The eluted N2 and CH4 are obtained with over 99.9% and 99.8% purity, respectively, and the separation performance is stable for 30 cycles. Coupled with its easy synthesis, cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is a promising adsorbent for CO2 separations from flue and natural gases.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric total synthesis of cage&#8208;like indole alkaloid arborisidine is presented. The new synthetic strategy features a catalytic parallel kinetic resolution based on ambident nucleophilicity (C3/N) of indole to set the absolute configurations of the two quaternary chiral centers, and a 5&#8208; exo&#8208;trig  radical cyclization to form the bridged nitrogen&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Halogen Bonded Ternary Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Higher cocrystal synthesis depends acutely on a knowledge of supramolecular synthons. We report three synthetic approaches towards ternary halogen bonded cocrystals that illustrate specificity and generality. Electrophilicity/nucleophilicity differences are needed among alternative sites of halogen bond formation. The two halogen bonds A&#8230;B and B&#8230;C in a halogen bonded ternary cocrystal ABC need to of different strength. Interaction mimicry of hydrogen bonds by halogen bonds is a viable approach towards ternaries as illustrated with the pyrene structure. Finally, the crystal engineer should well be able to anticipate halogen bonds that are stronger than hydrogen bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Terminal Imido Complex of an Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of the first terminal imido complex of an Fe&#8211;S cluster, (IMes)3Fe4S4=NDipp (2; IMes = 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphen&#173;yl), which is generated by oxidative group transfer from DippN3&#160;to the all&#8208;ferrous cluster (IMes)3Fe4S4(PPh3). This two&#8208;electron process is achieved by formal one&#8208;electron oxidation of the imido&#8208;bound Fe site and one&#8208;electron oxidation of two IMes&#8208;bound Fe sites. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies establish that the Fe&#8211;imido site is best described as a high&#8208;spin Fe3+&#160;center, which is reflected in its long Fe&#8211;N(imido) distance of 1.763(2)&#160;&#197;. Cluster&#160;2&#160;abstracts hydrogen atoms from 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene to yield the corresponding anilido complex, demonstrating competency for C&#8211;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Atom Pd Nanozyme for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal therapy (PTT) is extremely promising tumor therapeutic modality. However, excessive heat inevitably injures normal tissues nearby tumors, and the cancer cells damage caused by mild hyperthermia is easily repaired by stress&#8208;induced heat shock proteins (HSPs). Thus, maximizing the PTT efficiency and minimizing healthy tissues damage simultaneously by adopting appropriate therapeutic temperature is imperative. Herein, an innovative strategy is firstly reported of ferroptosis&#8208;boosted mild PTT based on single atom nanozyme (SAzyme). The Pd SAzyme with atom&#8208;economic utilization of the catalytic centers exhibits peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimic enzyme activities, and photothermal conversion performance, which can result in ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving HSPs, which enables Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aromatic Oligomer Micelle: Large Enthalpic Stabilization and Selective&#160;Oligothiophene Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An aromatic oligomer micelle, featuring both&#160;  high stability  and&#160;  high uptake ability  , was quantitatively formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers,&#160;composed of three bent polyaromatic amphiphiles connected alternately by two hydrophilic chains. The well&#8208;defined micelle, with a diameter of ~2 nm,&#160;remains intact even under highly diluted conditions (~3 &#956;M) and at elevated temperature (&gt;130 &#186;C), due to the polyaromatic chelate effect. The&#160;thermodynamic studies reveal that large enthalpic gain (  &#916; H&#160;  =&#160;&#8211;110 kJ mol  &#8211;1  ) is the key for the micelle formation. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes (&#8805;4&#8208;mer) to a high degree and the resultant, aqueous host&#8208;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers. Furthermore, facile uptake and release of unsubstituted polythiophenes can be achieved using the oligomer micelle.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid Electrolyte Interphase Design for Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn batteries are challenged by water decomposition and dendrite growth due to the absence of a dense Zn&#8208;ion conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we design a low&#8208;concentration aqueous Zn(OTF)2&#8208;Zn(NO3)2  electrolyte to in situ form a robust inorganic ZnF2&#8208;Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6&#8208;organic bi&#8208;layer SEI where the inorganic inner layer promotes Zn&#8208;ion diffusion while the organic outer layer suppresses water penetration. Comprehensive characterization reveals that insulating Zn5(OH)8(NO3)2&#183;2H2O layer is first formed on Zn anode surface by self&#8208;terminated chemical reaction of NO3&#8208;  with Zn2+  and OH&#8208;  generated via HER, and then it transforms into Zn&#8208;ion conducting Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6  which in&#8208;turn promots ZnF2  formation as the inner layer. The organic dominated outer layer is formed by the reduction of OTF&#8208;  . The in situ formed SEI enables a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.8% for 200 h in Ti||Zn cells, and a high energy density (168&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8211;1  ) with 96.5% retention for 700 cycles in Zn||MnO2  cells with a low Zn/MnO2  capacity ratio of 2:1.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Fluorescence Diagnosis of Cancer Cells/Tissues Based on &#946;&#8208;Lapachone&#8208;Triggered ROS Amplification Specific in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrimination of cancer cells/tissues from normal ones is of critical importance for early diagnosis and treatment of cancers.

         <title>Vapochromism and Magnetochemical Switching of a Ni(II) Paddlewheel Complex by Reversible NH3 Uptake and Release</title>

         <dc:description>Reaction of [NiCl  2  (  PnH  )  4  ] (  1  ) (  PnH  = 6&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;pyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;thione) with NiCl  2  affords the binuclear paddlewheel (PW) complex [Ni  2  (  Pn  )  4  ] (  2  ). Diamagnetic complex  2  is the first example of a PW complex capable of reversibly binding and releasing NH  3  . The NH  3  ligand in [Ni  2  (  Pn  )  4  (NH  3  )] (  2  &#183;NH  3  ) enforces major spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility changes, thus displaying vapochromic properties (&#955;  max  (  2  ) = 532 nm, &#955;  max  (  2  &#183;NH  3  ) = 518 nm) and magnetochemical switching (  2  : S&#160;= 0;  2  &#183;NH  3  : S&#160;= 1). Upon repeated adsorption/desorption cycles of NH  3  the PW core remains intact. Compound  2  can be embedded into thin polyurethane films (  2  P  ) under retention of its sensing abilities. Therefore,  2  qualifies as reversible optical probe for ammonia. The magnetochemical switching of  2  and  2  &#183;NH  3  was studied in detail by SQUID measurements showing that in  2  &#183;NH  3  , solely the Ni atom coordinated the NH  3  molecule is responsible for the paramagnetic behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating concentration gradient generator and single&#8208;cell trapper array for high&#8208;throughput screening bioeffects of nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The need of generating nanomaterial gradients is increasing. However, the previously reported gradient generators may lead to the aggregation or uneven dilution of nanomaterials, which will inevitably hinder their applications. To address this issue, we herein develop a concentration gradient generator (CGG) on a microfluidic chip for diluting different nanoparticles. Specifically designed compact disk (CD)&#8208;shaped microchannels in the CGG module could thoroughly mix the flowing solutions and generate linear concentration gradient of nanoparticles without aggregation. We combine the CGG with a single&#8208;cell trapper array (SCA) on microfluidics to evaluate the concentration&#8208;dependent bioeffects of the nanoparticles.  The precise control of the spatiotemporal generation of nanoparticle concentration on the CGG module and the single&#8208;cell&#8208;level monitoring of the cell behaviors on the SCA module by a high&#8208;content system in real&#8208;time,  render  the CGG&#8208;SCA system a highly precise platform, which can exclude the average effect of cell population and reflect the response of individual cells to the gradient concentrations accurately. In addition, the CGG&#8208;SCA system provides an automated platform for high&#8208;throughput screening of nanomedicines with high precision and low sample consumption.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Prebiotic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Threofuranosyl Cytidine by Photochemical Anomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TNA cytidine, a candidate precursor to RNA cytidine at the origin of life, is synthesized from prebiotic precursors via a high&#8208;yielding, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective, protecting&#8208;group free synthesis utilizing an efficient photochemical anomerization. Phosphorylation also enables selective photodestruction of the contaminating erythro&#8208;diastereomer enriching any potential pool of TNA monomers.







Abstract
The structure of life's first genetic polymer is a question of intense ongoing debate. The &#8220;RNA world theory&#8221; suggests RNA was life's first nucleic acid. However, ribonucleotides are complex chemical structures, and simpler nucleic acids, such as threose nucleic acid (TNA), can carry genetic information. In principle, nucleic acids like TNA could have played a vital role in the origins of life. The advent of any genetic polymer in life requires synthesis of its monomers. Here we demonstrate a high&#8208;yielding, stereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and furanosyl&#8208;selective prebiotic synthesis of threo&#8208;cytidine 3, an essential component of TNA. Our synthesis uses key intermediates and reactions previously exploited in the prebiotic synthesis of the canonical pyrimidine ribonucleoside cytidine 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that erythro&#8208;specific 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic phosphate synthesis provides a mechanism to photochemically select TNA cytidine. These results suggest that TNA may have coexisted with RNA during the emergence of life.

         <title>A Rod&#8208;Packing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Suitable Pore Confinement for Benchmark Ethane/Ethylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rod&#8208;packing microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonding framework with functional surfaces and suitable cavity spaces for C2H6 uptake exhibited simultaneously high capacity and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (see picture). The excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation occurred with record&#8208;high C2H4 productivity of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 under high humidity and ambient conditions.







Abstract
For the separation of ethane from ethylene, it remains challenging to target both high C2H6 adsorption and selectivity in a C2H6&#8208;selective material. Herein, we report a reversible solid&#8208;state transformation in a labile hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework to generate a new rod&#8208;packing desolvated framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;1) with suitable cavity spaces and functional surfaces to optimally interact with C2H6. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;1 thus exhibits simultaneously high C2H6 uptake (88&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K) and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (2.25), which are significantly higher than those of most top&#8208;performing materials. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cage&#8208;like cavities and functional sites synergistically &#8220;match&#8221; better with C2H6 to provide stronger multipoint interactions with C2H6 than C2H4. In combination with its high stability and ultralow water uptake, this material can efficiently capture C2H6 from 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures in ambient conditions under 60&#8201;% RH, providing a record polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 productivity of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1.

This enables the combination of Lewis acid and available &#8208;NH2 sites in sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides. MUV&#8208;12 displays full conversion of propylene oxide at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in absence of additional co&#8208;catalysts and with excellent cyclability.







Abstract
We introduce the first example of isoreticular titanium&#8211;organic frameworks, MUV&#8208;10 and MUV&#8208;12, to show how the different affinity of hard Ti(IV) and soft Ca(II) metal sites can be used to direct selective grafting of amines. This enables the combination of Lewis acid titanium centers and available &#8208;NH2 sites in two sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The selective grafting of molecules to heterometallic clusters adds up to the pool of methodologies available for controlling the positioning and distribution of chemical functions in precise positions of the framework required for definitive control of pore chemistry.

         <title>Opening up the Single&#8208;Cell Toolbox for Microbial Natural Products Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New chemistry from single cells: The challenge of studying uncultivated microbes is a significant impediment to efforts to mine the natural world for useful molecules. Single&#8208;cell analysis techniques have achieved significant success in the study of microbial ecology but are only beginning to gain traction in the search for microbial natural products. This review highlights successful implementations and promising techniques for future studies.







Abstract
The diverse microbes that produce natural products represent an important source of novel therapeutics, drug leads, and scientific tools. However, the vast majority have not been grown in axenic culture and are members of complex communities. While meta&#8208;&#8217;omic methods such as metagenomics, &#8208;transcriptomics, and &#8208;proteomics reveal collective molecular features of this &#8220;microbial dark matter&#8221;, the study of individual microbiome members can be challenging. To address these limits, a number of techniques with single&#8208;bacterial resolution have been developed in the last decade and a half. While several of these are embraced by microbial ecologists, there has been less use by researchers interested in mining microbes for natural products. In this review, we discuss the available and emerging techniques for targeted single&#8208;cell analysis with a particular focus on applications to the discovery and study of natural products.

         <title>Asymmetric Core&#8208;shell Gold Nanoparticles and Controllable Assemblies for SERS Ratiometric Detection of MicroRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their unique optical properties that depend on shape, morphology, and orientation, diverse plasmonic nanostructures have been the focus of vigorous development and study. Herein, we present a series of Janus nanogap gold nanoparticles (JAuNNPs) with varying proportions of Au shell coverage of approximately 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. The internal nanogap between the partial Au shell and core caused asymmetric optical behavior, in addition to their tunability being highly dependent on the degree of Au shell coverage and structural asymmetry. Importantly, the &#8220;shell&#8208;to&#8208;shell&#8221; or &#8220;core&#8208;to&#8208;core&#8221; JAuNNDs(50%) were self&#8208;assembled from amphiphilic JAuNNPs(50%) merely by tuning the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer brushes on the Au core or shell. The positions of electromagnetic field enhancement of JAuNNDs varied with geometrical configurations because of hybridized plasmonic coupling effects based on the calculation results. Furthermore, DNA linkers were utilized to form JAuNND  12  (50%). By combining with Raman molecules, ratiometric SERS signals could be generated, enabling JAuNND  12  (50%) to image the distribution of miR&#8208;21 in living cells and tumors. Consequently, asymmetric JAuNNPs allowed facile conjugation of various linkage molecules to fabricate dimeric nanostructures, representing powerful SERS ratiometric nanoprobes for biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Primed Native Chemical Ligation Produces Autoinducing Cyclopeptides in Clostridia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The genome&#8208;guided discovery of an autoinducing peptide (AIP) that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum is reported. A combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain reveals that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP).







Abstract
Clostridia coordinate many important processes such as toxin production, infection, and survival by density&#8208;dependent communication (quorum sensing) using autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Although clostridial AIPs have been proposed to be (thio)lactone&#8208;containing peptides, their true structures remain elusive. Here, we report the genome&#8208;guided discovery of an AIP that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Through a combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain, we reveal that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP). Kinetic analyses indicate that the mature cAIP is produced via a cryptic thiolactone intermediate that undergoes a rapid S&#8594;N acyl shift, in a manner similar to intramolecular native chemical ligation (NCL). Finally, by implementing a chemical probe in a targeted screen, we show that this novel enzyme&#8208;primed, intramolecular NCL is a widespread feature of clostridial AIP biosynthesis.

         <title>ReI Tricarbonyl Complexes as Coordinate Covalent Inhibitors for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Cysteine Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;coronavirus 2 has impacted the life quality and cost hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;thousands of lives worldwide. Herein, a novel approach using ReI tricarbonyl complexes as coordinate covalent inhibitors for the main protease is presented. These complexes target the active site cysteine residue and show selective inhibition of the main protease over several human proteases.







Abstract
Since its outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has impacted the quality of life and cost hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;thousands of lives worldwide. Based on its global spread and mortality, there is an urgent need for novel treatments which can combat this disease. To date, the 3&#8208;chymotrypsin&#8208;like protease (3CLpro), which is also known as the main protease, is considered among the most important pharmacological targets. The vast majority of investigated 3CLpro inhibitors are organic, non&#8208;covalent binders. Herein, the use of inorganic, coordinate covalent binders is proposed that can attenuate the activity of the protease. ReI tricarbonyl complexes were identified that demonstrate coordinate covalent enzymatic inhibition of 3CLpro. Preliminary studies indicate the selective inhibition of 3CLpro over several human proteases. This study presents the first example of metal complexes as inhibitors for the 3CLpro cysteine protease.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Photopolymerization of Hybrid Acrylate&#8208;Oxetane Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization process of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture was developed. Control over the sequence and rate of both polymerizations allows for control over phase separation within the interpenetrating network structure. The structurally colored cholesteric coatings could be used to monitor the phase separation.







Abstract
We report on the wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture. By controlling the sequence and rate of the orthogonal free&#8208;radical and cationic photopolymerization reactions, it is possible to control the degree of phase separation in the resulting liquid crystal interpenetrating networks. We show that this can be used to tune the reflective color of the structurally colored coatings produced. Conversely, the structural color can be used to monitor the degree of phase separation. Our new photopolymerization procedure allows for structuring liquid crystal networks in three dimensions, which has great potential for fabricating liquid crystal polymer materials with programmable functional properties.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Silver Active Sites in Gold Nanoclusters for Chemical Fixation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made catalytic sites for the chemical fixation of CO2 were achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different levels of liberation in atomically precise Au clusters. Au19Ag4(S&#8208;Adm)15 with a completely open surface Ag site has the best catalytic activity, Au20Ag1(S&#8208;Adm)15 with a partially open Ag site is least efficient, and Au21(S&#8208;Adm)15 without a Ag site exhibits decent catalytic performance.







Abstract
Precise control of the composition and structure of active sites in an atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fashion remains insuperable for heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we introduce tailor&#8208;made catalytic sites for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different levels of liberation in atomically precise Au nanoclusters. Our results reveal that a single open Ag site on the Au19Ag4 cluster improves the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides and sequent CO2 insertion, while the partially exposed Ag site on the Au20Ag1 cluster exhibits a weak affinity for epoxides and poor efficiency for CO2 capture. Structural tunability imparted by the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring and unusual atomic charges distributed on Au and Ag atoms of the three clusters seem to be crucial for promoting challenging bond cleavages and formations in the chemical utilization of CO2.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Design Strategy to Construct Smart Fluorescent Probes for the Precise Tracking of Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;dimensional design strategy to construct smart fluorescent probes for the precise tracking of senescence. Our approach relies on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity in combination with the monitoring of lysosomal microenvironmental pH since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells.







Abstract
The tracking of cellular senescence usually depends on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal). Previous probes for SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal with this purpose only cover a single dimension: the accumulation of this enzyme in lysosomes. However, this is insufficient to determine the destiny of senescence because endogenous &#946;&#8208;gal enriched in lysosomes is not only related to senescence, but also to some other physiological processes. To address this issue, we introduce our fluorescent probes including a second dimension: lysosomal pH, since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells. With this novel design, our probes achieved excellent discrimination of SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal from cancer&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal, which enables them to track cellular senescence as well as tissue aging more precisely. Our crystal structures of a model enzyme E. coli &#946;&#8208;gal mutant (E537Q) complexed with each probe further revealed the structural basis for probe recognition.

         <title>Honeycomb Carbon Nanofibers: A Superhydrophilic O2&#8208;Entrapping Electrocatalyst Enables Ultrahigh Mass Activity for the Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Honeycomb carbon nanofibers behave as a superb electrocatalyst for selective H2O2 production (97.3&#8201;%) via 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction, capable of attaining an ultrahigh mass activity of 220&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a H2O2 yield rate of 6.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The catalytic mechanism is revealed by in situ Raman analysis and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction has emerged as a promising alternative to the energy&#8208; and waste&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process for distributed H2O2 production. This process, however, suffers from strong competition from the four&#8208;electron pathway leading to low H2O2 selectivity. Herein, we report using a superhydrophilic O2&#8208;entrapping electrocatalyst to enable superb two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction electrocatalysis. The honeycomb carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) are robust and capable of achieving a high H2O2 selectivity of 97.3&#8201;%, much higher than that of its solid carbon nanofiber counterpart. Impressively, this catalyst achieves an ultrahigh mass activity of up to 220&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, surpassing all other catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The superhydrophilic porous carbon skeleton with rich oxygenated functional groups facilitates efficient electron transfer and better wetting of the catalyst by the electrolyte, and the interconnected cavities allow for more effective entrapping of the gas bubbles. The catalytic mechanism is further revealed by in situ Raman analysis and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Mechanochemical Prebiotic Peptide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of amino acids on the prebiotic Earth, either stemming from endogenous chemical routes or delivered by meteorites, is consensually accepted. In contrast, prebiotically plausible pathways to achieve peptides from inactivated amino acids are still unclear since most oligomerization approaches rely on thermodynamically disfavored reactions in solution. Here, we show that the combination of prebiotically plausible minerals and mechanochemical activation enables the oligomerization of glycine at ambient temperature in the absence of water. Raising the reaction temperature increases the degree of oligomerization concomitantly with the formation of a commonly unwanted cyclic glycine dimer (DKP). However, we show here that DKP is a productive intermediate in the mechanochemical oligomerization of glycine. The findings of this research show that mechanochemical peptide bond formation is a dynamic process that provides alternative routes towards oligopeptides and establishes new synthetic approaches for prebiotic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubling the Stakes: The Promise of Halide Double Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two B sites in combination dictate the properties of halide double perovskites (A2BB&#8242;X6; A=monocation, X=halide). This Minireview gives a brief overview of the rich history of halide double perovskites, highlights key structural and electronic aspects, and describes the current understanding on how to correctly select the B&#8208;site pairs that afford the desired properties.







Abstract
When the stakes are doubled in a wager, a player must correctly place two consecutive bets to win, but the payout is larger. Similarly, two B sites in combination dictate the properties of A2BB&#8242;X6 (A=monocation, X=halide) double perovskites. Correctly picking two B sites is more challenging than picking just one, as in the AIBIIX3 single perovskites, but the options are greater and, we believe, the rewards are higher when the stakes are doubled. In this Minireview, we emphasize fundamental aspects of halide double perovskites to provide a foundation for interested readers to explore this extraordinary class of materials. In particular, we highlight the differences and similarities between double and single perovskites and describe how the double perovskite structure potentially offers greater control over photophysical properties.

         <title>Controlled Ligand Exchange Between Ruthenium Organometallic Cofactor Precursors and a Na&#239;ve Protein Scaffold Generates Artificial Metalloenzymes Catalysing Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium organometallic complex is transformed into an effective transfer hydrogenation catalyst upon exchanging ligands with a na&#239;ve protein. The direct coordination of protein sidechains to the metal is an underutilised feature in artificial metalloenzymes.







Abstract
Many natural metalloenzymes assemble from proteins and biosynthesised complexes, generating potent catalysts by changing metal coordination. Here we adopt the same strategy to generate artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) using ligand exchange to unmask catalytic activity. By systematically testing RuII(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(bipyridine) complexes designed to facilitate the displacement of functionalised bipyridines, we develop a fast and robust procedure for generating new enzymes via ligand exchange in a protein that has not evolved to bind such a complex. The resulting metal cofactors form peptidic coordination bonds but also retain a non&#8208;biological ligand. Tandem mass spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy were used to characterise the organometallic cofactors and identify the protein&#8208;derived ligands. By introduction of ruthenium cofactors into a 4&#8208;helical bundle, transfer hydrogenation catalysts were generated that displayed a 35&#8208;fold rate increase when compared to the respective small molecule reaction in solution.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Pairing Interactions in a Molecular Switch Evidenced by Ion Mobility Spectrometry and Infrared Ion Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;phase non&#8208;dissociative electron transfer is used for charge reduction of a donor&#8208;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamer (green). The consecutive co&#8208;conformational transition is monitored using ion mobility spectrometry and infrared ion spectroscopy. Comparing the collision cross section distributions (blue) and infrared spectra (red) recorded for analogous closed&#8208;shell and radical systems highlights differences that can be attributed to radical&#8208;pairing interactions.







Abstract
The digital revolution sets a milestone in the progressive miniaturization of working devices and in the underlying advent of molecular machines. Foldamers involving mechanically entangled components with modular secondary structures are among the most promising designs for molecular switch&#8208;based applications. Characterizing the nature and dynamics of their intramolecular network following the application of a stimulus is the key to their performance. Here, we use non&#8208;dissociative electron transfer as a reductive stimulus in the gas phase and probe the consecutive co&#8208;conformational transitions of a donor&#8208;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamer using electrospray mass spectrometry interfaced with ion mobility and infrared ion spectroscopy. A comparison of collision cross section distributions for analogous closed&#8208;shell and radical molecular ions sheds light on their respective formation energetics, while variations in their respective infrared absorption bands evidence changes in intramolecular organization as the foldamer becomes more compact. These differences are compatible with the advent of radical&#8208;pairing interactions.

         <title>Selective Inhibition of the Hsp90&#945; Isoform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. A structure&#8208;based approach was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.







Abstract
The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. Many of these proteins contribute to the progression of cancer, and consequently, inhibition of the Hsp90 protein folding machinery represents an innovative approach toward cancer chemotherapy. However, clinical trials with Hsp90 N&#8208;terminal inhibitors have encountered deleterious side effects and toxicities, which appear to result from the pan&#8208;inhibition of all four Hsp90 isoforms. Therefore, the development of isoform&#8208;selective Hsp90 inhibitors is sought to delineate the pathological role played by each isoform. Herein, we describe a structure&#8208;based approach that was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.

         <title>Aqueous&#8208;Organic Solvent Derived Recombinant Spider Silk Gels as Depots for Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels are widely used in various biomedical applications, as they cannot only serve as materials for biofabrication but also as depots for the administration of drugs. However, the possibilities of formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in hydrogels are rather limited. In this study, we assembled recombinant spider silk gels using a new processing route with aqueous&#8208;organic co&#8208;solvents, and the properties of these gels could be controlled by the choice of the co&#8208;solvent. The presence of the organic co&#8208;solvent further enabled the incorporation of hydrophobic drugs as exemplary shown for 6&#8208;mercaptopurine. The developed gels showed shear&#8208;thinning behaviour and could be easily injected to serve e.g. as drug depots and could even be 3D printed to serve as scaffolds for biofabrication. With this new processing route, the formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in spider silk&#8208;based depots is possible, circumventing common pharmaceutical solubility issues.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron Catalyzed Water Oxidation: O&#8208;O Bond Formation via Intramolecular Two Oxo Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported the importance of structure regulation on the O&#8208;O bond formation process in binuclear iron catalysts. Three complexes, [Fe  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(OH  2  )  2  (TPA)  2  ]  4+  (  1  ), [Fe  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(OH  2  )  2  (6&#8208;HPA)]  4+  (  2  ) and [Fe  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(OH  2  )  2  (BPMAN)]  4+  (  3  ) have been designed as electrocatalysts for water oxidation in 0.1 M NaHCO  3  solution(pH 8.4). All results indicate that  1  and  2  are the molecular catalysts and the O&#8208;O bond formation via oxo&#8208;oxo coupling rather than WNA pathway. However, complex  3  displays negligible catalytic activity in both cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis. DFT calculations suggested that the  anti  to  syn  isomerization of the two high&#8208;valent Fe=O moieties has to take place via the axial rotation of one Fe=O around the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Fe center. This is followed by the O&#8208;O bond formation via an oxo&#8208;oxo coupling pathway with a barrier of 19.2 kcal/mol at the Fe(IV)Fe(IV) state or via oxo&#8208;oxyl coupling pathway with a barrier of 12.7 kcal/mol at the Fe(IV)Fe(V) state for  2  . The alternative water nucleophilic attack pathway has a much higher barrier of 23.8 kcal/mol. Importantly, the rigid ligand of BPMAN based diiron(III) complex  3  limits the  anti  to  syn  isomerization and axial rotation of the Fe=O moiety, which has a barrier of over 30 kcal/mol and thus accounts for the negligible catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cavity&#8208;Tailored Metal&#8208;Organic Cage Entraps Gases Selectively in Solution and the Amorphous Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the subcomponent self&#8208;assembly of a truxene&#8208;faced Zn4L4  tetrahedron, which is capable of binding the smallest hydrocarbons in solution under ambient conditions. By deliberately incorporating inward&#8208;facing ethyl groups on the truxene faces, the resulting partially&#8208;filled cage cavity was tailored to encapsulate methane, ethane, and ethene  via  van der Waals interactions at atmospheric pressure in acetonitrile, and also in the amorphous solid state. Interestingly, gas capture followed a contrasting selectivity in solution and the amorphous solid state, in which an order of methane &gt; ethane &gt; ethene was observed for the former. The selective binding may prove useful in designing new processes for the purification of methane and ethane as feedstocks for chemical synthesis</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controls the activity of light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalyzed by nickel(II) porphyrin complexes in neutral homogeneous aqueous solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Finding photostable, first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;based molecular systems for photocatalytic water oxidation is a critical milestone towards sustainable solar fuel production. Herein, we discovered that nickel(II) hydrophilic porphyrins form great molecular catalysts for photocatalytic water oxidation in neutral to acidic aqueous solutions using [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  as photosensitizer and [S  2  O  8  ]  2&#8208;  as sacrificial electron acceptor. Electron&#8208;poorer Ni&#8208;porphyrins bearing 8 fluorine or 4 methylpyridinium substituents as electron&#8208;poorer porphyrins afforded 6&#8208;fold higher TOFs (~0.65 min  &#8208;1  ) than electron&#8208;richer analogues. However, the electron&#8208;poorest Ni&#8208;porphyrin bearing 16 fluorine substituents was found photocatalytically inactive under such conditions, because the potential at which catalytic O  2  evolution starts was too high (+1.23 V vs. NHE) to be driven by the photochemically generated [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  3+  . Critically, these Ni&#8208;porphyrin catalysts showed excellent stability in photocatalytic conditions, as a second photocatalytic run re&#8208;plenished with a new dose of photosensitizer, afforded only 1&#8208;3% less O  2  than during the first photocatalytic run. Overall, optimizing the balance between the overpotential of the water oxidation catalyst and the driving force of electron transfer between the catalyst and the photogenerated oxidant [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  3+  , appears as critical for photocatalytic water oxidation kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Bisfunctionalization of Two&#8208;dimensional Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent functionalization of two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum disulfide (2D MoS2) holds great promise in developing robust organic&#8208;MoS2 hybrid structures. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate an approach to building up a bisfunctionalized MoS2 hybrid structure through successively reacting activated MoS2 with alkyl iodide and aryl diazonium salts. This approach can be utilized to modify both colloidal and substrate supported MoS2 nanosheets. We have discovered that compared to the adducts formed through the reactions of MoS2 with diazonium salts, those formed through the reactions of MoS2 with alkyl iodides display higher reactivity towards further reactions with electrophiles. We are convinced that our systematic study on the formation and reactivity of covalently functionalized MoS2 hybrids will provide some practical guidance on multi&#8208;angle tailoring of the properties of 2D MoS2 for various potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Gate&#8208;Controlled Therapeutics for Overcoming Bacterium&#8208;Induced Drug Resistance and Potentiating Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of bacteria in the tumor can cause cancer resistance to chemotherapeutics. To fight against bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance, herein we design self&#8208;traceable nanoreservoirs that are simultaneously loaded with gemcitabine and antibiotics ciprofloxacin and are decorated with hyaluronic acid for active tumor targeting. The nanoreservoirs have a pH&#8208;sensitive gate and an enzyme&#8208;responsive gate that can be opened in the acidic and hyaluronidase&#8208;abundant tumor microenvironment to control drug release rates. Moreover, the nanoreservoirs can specifically target the tumor regions without eliciting evident toxicity to normal tissues, kill the intratumoral bacteria, and inhibit the tumor growth even in the presence of the bacteria. Unexpectedly, the nanoreservoirs can activate T cell&#8208;mediated immune responses through promoting antigen&#8208;presenting dendritic cell maturation and depleting immunosuppressive myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells in bacterium&#8208;infected tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets as Robust Oxygen Evolution Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) on nickel foam (NF) by assembling nickel chloride hexahydrate and 1,1&#180;&#8208;ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF). The NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 195 mV and 241 mV at 10 and 100 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  , respectively and long&#8208;term stability up to 40 h under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical results demonstrate that the superb OER performance originates from the ferrocene units that serve as efficient electron transfer intermediates. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52 eV, which is lower than that (0.81 eV) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NiFe double hydroxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis and mechanism of action of the cell wall targeting antibiotic hypeptin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypeptin is a cyclodepsipeptide antibiotic produced by  Lysobacter sp.  K5869, isolated from an environmental sample by the iChip technology, dedicated to the cultivation of previously uncultured microorganisms. Hypeptin shares structural features with teixobactin and exhibits potent activity against a broad spectrum of gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Using comprehensive  in vivo  and  in vitro  analyses, we show that hypeptin blocks bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by binding to multiple undecaprenyl pyrophosphate&#8208;containing biosynthesis intermediates, forming a stoichiometric 2:1 complex. Resistance to hypeptin did not readily develop  in vitro.  Analysis of the hypeptin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) supported a model for the synthesis of the octapeptide. Within the BGC, two hydroxylases were identified and characterized, responsible for the stereoselective &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of four building blocks when bound to peptidyl carrier proteins.  In vitro  hydroxylation assays corroborate the biosynthetic hypothesis and lead to the proposal of a refined structure for hypeptin.</dc:description>

         <title>Local deuteration enables NMR observation of methyl groups in proteins from eukaryotic and cell&#8208;free expression systems.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutically relevant proteins such as GPCRs, antibodies and kinases face clear limitations in NMR studies due to the challenges in site&#8208;specific isotope labeling and deuteration in eukaryotic expression systems. Here we describe an efficient and simple method to observe the methyl groups of leucine residues in proteins expressed in bacterial, eukaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems without modification of the expression protocol. The method relies on simple stereo&#8208;selective&#160;  13C&#8208;labeling and deuteration of leucine that alleviates the need for additional deuteration of the protein. The spectroscopic benefits of &#8216;local&#8217; deuteration are examined in detail through Forbidden Coherence Transfer (FCT) experiments and simulations. The utility of this labeling method is demonstrated in the cell&#8208;free synthesis of bacteriorhodopsin and in the insect&#8208;cell expression of the RRM2 domain of human RBM39.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles of CeO  2  obtained in molecular form, so&#8208;called &#8216;molecular nanoparticles&#8217;, have been limited to date to a family whose largest member is of nuclearity Ce  40  with a {Ce  40  O  58  } core atom count. Herein we report that a synthetic procedure has been developed to the cation [Ce  100  O  149  (OH)  18  (O  2  CPh)  60  (PhCO  2  H)  12  (H  2  O)  20  ]  16+  , a member with a much higher Ce  100  nuclearity and a {Ce  100  O  167  } core that is more akin to the smallest ceria nanoparticles. Its crystal structure reveals it to possess a 2.4 nm size and high D  2d  symmetry, and it has also allowed identification of core surface features including facet composition, the presence and location of Ce  3+  and H  +  (i.e. HO  &#8208;  ) ions, and the binding modes of the ligand monolayer of benzoate, benzoic acid, and water ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical probe identification of a small&#8208;molecule inhibitor binding site in Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mammalian membrane&#8208;bound  O  &#8208;acyltransferase (MBOAT) superfamily is involved in biological processes including growth, development and appetite sensing. MBOATs are attractive drug targets in cancer and obesity; however, information on the binding site and molecular mechanisms underlying small&#8208;molecule inhibition is elusive. This study reports rational development of a photochemical probe to interrogate a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor binding site in the human MBOAT Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT). Structure&#8208;activity relationship investigation identified single enantiomer  IMP&#8208;1575  , the most potent HHAT inhibitor reported to&#8208;date, and guided design of photocrosslinking probes that maintained HHAT&#8208;inhibitory potency. Photocrosslinking and proteomic sequencing of HHAT delivered identification of the first small&#8208;molecule binding site in a mammalian MBOAT. Topology and homology data suggested a potential mechanism for HHAT inhibition which was confirmed via kinetic analysis. Our results provide an optimal HHAT tool inhibitor  IMP&#8208;1575  (  K  i  &#160;=&#160;38&#160;nM) and a strategy for mapping small molecule interaction sites in MBOATs.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Direct Cyclization Constructs Spiro&#8208;acridan Derivatives for Highly Efficient TADF emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro&#8208;acridan (  SpA  ) derivatives possess a great potential in preparing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters. However, the conventional synthetic routes are cost&#8208;expensive and time&#8208;consuming. The development of a simple procedure to synthesize  SpA  s is still in urgent pursuing appreciated by academic and industrial communities. In this contribution, we present a feasible acid&#8208;catalyzed solvent&#8208;free metal&#8208;free cyclization between diarylamines and ketones to construct  SpA  s. The as&#8208;constructed moieties provide a wide possibility to assemble efficient TADF emitters. As an illustrated example,  D2T&#8208;TR  with high photoluminescent quantum yield and proper TADF character is applied in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) which achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.1%. This work shows us a bright inspiration on developing excellent organic optoelectronic materials and an effective tool to realize it.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8211;Antibody Conjugates (PACs) &#8211; A Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Strategy for Covalent Conjugation and Targeted Intracellular Delivery of Pristine Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>W e report here on protein&#8208;antibody conjugates (PACs) that are used for antibody&#8208;directed delivery of protein therapeutics to specific cells. PACs have the potential to judiciously combine the merits of two prolific therapeutic approaches,&#160;  viz.  biologics and antibody&#8208;drug conjugates. We utilize&#160;spherical polymer brushes to construct PACs using the combination of two simple and efficient functionally orthogonal click chemistries. In addition to the synthesis and characterization of these nanoparticles, we demonstrate that PACs are indeed capable of specifically targeting cells based on the presence of target antigen on the cell surface to deliver proteins. The potentially broad adaptability of PACs opens up new opportunities for targeted biologics in therapeutics and sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Electrochemistry: Expanding the Scope of Paired Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paired electrochemical reactions offer an exciting opportunity to optimize both the atom and energy economy of oxidation and reduction reactions. While many paired electrochemical reactions take advantage of perfectly matched reactions at the anode and cathode, this matching of substrates in not necessary. In a constant current electrolysis, the potential at both electrodes will adjust to the substrates in solution. So, in principle any oxidation reaction can be paired with any reduction reaction. Previously, various oxidation reactions conducted on the anodic side of the electrolysis were paired with the generation and use of hydrogen gas at the cathode. This work nicely demonstrated the generality of the anodic process in a paired electrolysis and how the auxiliary reaction required for the oxidation could be used to generate a substrate for a non&#8208;electrolysis reaction. In this manuscript, this work is combined with variations on the cathodic side of the electrolysis in order to complete the picture and illustrate how various oxidation and reduction reactions can be mixed and matched</dc:description>

         <title>Unified Synthesis of Polycyclic Alkaloids via Complementary Carbonyl Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complementary dual carbonyl activation strategy for the syn&#173;thesis of polycyclic alkaloids has been developed.    Successful appli&#173;cations include the synthesis of tetracyclic alkaloids harmalanine, harmalacinine, pentacyclic indolo&#173;quinolizidine alkaloid nortetoyobyrine, and octacyclic &#946;&#8209;carboline alkaloid peganumine A. The latter synthesis features a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free assembly and an asymmetric disulfon&#173;imide catalyzed cyclization. Furthermore, formal syntheses of hirsutine, deplancheine, 10&#8208;desbromo&#173;arborescidine A, and oxindole alkaloids rhynchophylline and isorhyncho&#173;phylline have been achieved. Finally, a concise synthesis of berberine alkaloid ilicifoline B was completed.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic engineering in combination with semisynthesis leads to a new route for gram&#8208;scale production of the immunosuppressive natural product brasilicardin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brasilicardin A (    1    ) consists of an unusual anti/syn/anti&#8208;perhydrophenanthrene skeleton with a carbohydrate side chain and an amino acid moiety. It exhibits potent immunosuppressive activity, yet its mode of action differs from standard drugs that are currently in use. Further pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of this promising, biologically active natural product is hampered by restricted access to the ready material, as its synthesis requires both a low&#8208;yielding fermentation process using a pathogenic organism and an elaborate, multi&#8208;step total synthesis. Our semi&#8208;synthetic approach included a) the heterologous expression of the brasilicardin A gene cluster in different non&#8208;pathogenic bacterial strains producing brasilicardin A aglycone (    5    ) in excellent yield and b) the chemical transformation of the aglycone    5    into the trifluoroacetic acid salt of brasilicardin A (    1a    ) via a short and straightforward 5 step synthetic route. Additionally, we report the first preclinical data for brasilicardin A.</dc:description>

         <title>The interrelated effect of cations and electrolyte pH on the hydrogen evolution reaction on gold electrodes in alkaline media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we study the role of alkali metal cation concentration and electrolyte pH in altering the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at gold (Au) electrodes. We show that at moderately alkaline pH (pH =11), increasing cation concentration significantly enhances the HER activity on Au electrodes (with a reaction order ~0.5). Based on these results we suggest that cations play a central role in stabilizing the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step by favorably interacting with the dissociating water molecule (*H&#8208;&#8208;OH  &#948;&#8208;  &#8208;&#8208;cat  +  ). Moreover, we show that increasing electrolyte pH (pH 10 to pH 13) tunes the local field strength which in turn indirectly enhances the activity of HER by tuning the near&#8208;surface cation concentration. Interestingly, a too high near&#8208;surface cation concentration (at high pH and high cation concentration) leads to a lowering of the HER activity, which we ascribe to a blockage of the surface by near&#8208;surface cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective directed cationic cascades enabled by molecular anchoring in terpene cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CCascade reactions appeared as a cutting&#8208;edge strategy  [1]  to streamline the assembly of complex structural scaffolds from naturally available precursors in an atom&#8208;, as well as time, labor&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient way  [2,3]  . We herein report a strategy to control cationic cyclization cascades by exploiting the ability of anchoring dynamic substrates in the active site of terpene cyclases  via  designed hydrogen bonding. Thereby, it is possible to induce &#8216;directed&#8217; cyclizations in contrast to established &#8216;non&#8208;stop&#8217; cyclizations  [4,5]  (99:1) and predestinate cascade termination at otherwise catalytically barely accessible intermediates. As a result, we are able to provide efficient access to naturally widely occurring apocarotenoids  [6,7]  , value&#8208;added flavors and fragrances in gram&#8208;scale by replacing multi&#8208;stage synthetic routes to a single step with unprecedented selectivity (&gt;99.5%  ee  ) and high yields (up to 89%).</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Highly Ordered Glyco&#8208;Inside Nano&#8208;Assemblies through RAFT Dispersion Polymerization of Galactose&#8208;Decorated Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing numerous intermediate morphologies are fabricated by leveraging RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated monomer for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. This method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to expand the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.







Abstract
Glyco&#8208;assemblies derived from amphiphilic sugar&#8208;decorated block copolymers (ASBCs) have emerged prominently due to their wide application, for example, in biomedicine and as drug carriers. However, to efficiently construct these glyco&#8208;assemblies is still a challenge. Herein, we report an efficient technology for the synthesis of glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies by utilizing RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated methacrylate for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Using this approach, a series of highly ordered glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing intermediate morphologies were fabricated by adjusting the length of the hydrophobic glycoblock and the polymerization solids content. A specific morphology of complex vesicles was captured during the PISA process and the formation mechanism is explained by the morphology of its precursor and intermediate. Thus, this method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to enable the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.

(NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx decorated GO is used as a hole booster in all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC. A champion efficiency of 10.95&#8201;% is achieved arising from the charge transfer doping effect between (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx and GO.







Abstract
The precise regulation of interfacial charge distribution highly determines the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inorganic (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide (GO) is successfully demonstrated as a hole booster for all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC free of precious metal electrode. Arising from the spontaneous electron transfer induced p&#8208;type doping of GO from edged oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups to (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx, the best all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC achieves an efficiency of 10.95&#8201;% under one standard sun owing to the eliminated paradox between charge extraction and charge localization in GO surface. Furthermore, the champion device exhibits an excellent long&#8208;term stability at 10&#8201;% relative humidity without encapsulation over 70&#8197;days because of the suppressed ions migration.

         <title>Single&#8208;Stranded DNA as Supramolecular Template for One&#8208;Dimensional Palladium(II) Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids with an uninterrupted one&#8208;dimensional PdII array running through the center of the helixes have been prepared using a bottom&#8208;up approach by a self&#8208;assembly reaction between adenine homopolymers (dA) and complementary palladium complexes. The complexes bind to each adenine forming sequential Watson&#8211;Crick Pd&#8208;mediated base pairs.







Abstract
Atomic&#8208;level control over the position and growth of a single and continuous metal chain is an ambitious goal that often requires complex and costly processes. Herein, we demonstrate that 1Pd&#8208;DNA molecules, comprising a continuous single chain of PdII ions, can be prepared by a simple self&#8208;assembly reaction between the complex [Pd(Cheld)(CH3CN)] (1Pd_CH3CN) (Cheld=chelidamic acid) and single&#8208;stranded DNA homopolymers (ss&#8208;DNA) containing adenine (A) or 7&#8208;deazaadenine (X) bases. The single PdII&#8208;base pairs [1Pd(N1&#8208;A)] and [1Pd(N1&#8208;X)] were synthesized and characterized in solution and solid&#8208;state (X&#8208;ray diffraction) revealing an arrangement similar to that of natural Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. Subsequently, 1Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids were prepared, characterized, and their structures studied by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results indicate that the 1Pd&#8208;DNA structures resemble that of double&#8208;stranded DNA, with one strand being replaced by a supramolecular stack of continuous PdII complexes.

         <title>Division and Regrowth of Phase&#8208;Separated Giant Unilamellar Vesicles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate division of phase&#8208;separated lipid vesicles following quantitative predictions from an analytical model. The division is controlled by metabolic decomposition or light&#8208;triggered uncaging of a fluorophore. This provides spatiotemporal control over the division of a target vesicle. We regrow phase&#8208;separated vesicles by targeted fusion using DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
Success in the bottom&#8208;up assembly of synthetic cells will depend on strategies for the division of protocellular compartments. Here, we describe the controlled division of phase&#8208;separated giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). We derive an analytical model based on the vesicle geometry, which makes four quantitative predictions that we verify experimentally. We find that the osmolarity ratio required for division is 
, independent of the GUV size, while asymmetric division happens at lower osmolarity ratios. Remarkably, we show that a suitable osmolarity change can be triggered by water evaporation, enzymatic decomposition of sucrose or light&#8208;triggered uncaging of CMNB&#8208;fluorescein. The latter provides full spatiotemporal control, such that a target GUV undergoes division whereas the surrounding GUVs remain unaffected. Finally, we grow phase&#8208;separated vesicles from single&#8208;phased vesicles by targeted fusion of the opposite lipid type with programmable DNA tags to enable subsequent division cycles.

         <title>Consecutive O&#8722;S/N&#8722;S Bond Cleavage in Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Rearrangement Reactions of Alkynyl N&#8208;Sulfinylimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The O&#8722;S and N&#8722;S bonds of alkynyl N&#8208;sulfinylimines were cleaved in gold&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement reactions to afford S&#8208;functionalized 2H&#8208;azirines in good to excellent yields (see scheme). The reactions proceed via a thiooxime intermediate directly bound to an &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbene moiety.







Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkynyl N&#8208;sulfinylimines were used to produce the corresponding 2H&#8208;azirines possessing sulfenyl and acyl groups at the 3&#8208;position of the azirine ring in good to excellent yields. These reactions involved internal transfer of the sulfinyl oxygen atom to form a thiooxime intermediate tethered to an &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbene moiety. Subsequent insertion of the carbene into the N&#8722;S bond resulted in ring construction.

         <title>Crystal Structures and Catalytic Mechanism of l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;Diaminohexanoate Dehydrogenase and Rational Engineering for Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate binding and catalytic mechanism of l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase, the only known member of the &#946;&#8208;amino acid dehydrogenase family, are shown to be quite different from those of its &#945;&#8208;counterparts. Subsequent rational engineering expanded the substrate scope without reducing the enantioselectivity, enabling efficient asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
Amino acid dehydrogenases (AADHs) have shown considerable potential as biocatalysts in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amino acids. However, compared to the widely studied &#945;&#8208;AADHs, limited knowledge is available about &#946;&#8208;AADHs that enable the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids. Herein, we report the crystal structures of a l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase and its variants, the only known member of &#946;&#8208;AADH family. Crystal structure analysis, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies and quantum chemical calculations revealed the differences in the substrate binding and catalytic mechanism from &#945;&#8208;AADHs. A number of rationally engineered variants were then obtained with improved activity (by 110&#8211;800 times) toward various aliphatic &#946;&#8208;amino acids without an enantioselectivity trade&#8208;off. Two &#946;&#8208;amino acids were prepared by using the outstanding variants with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) and high isolated yields (86&#8211;87&#8201;%). These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of 3,5&#8208;DAHDH, and establish a solid foundation for further design of &#946;&#8208;AADHs for the asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides: Ultrafast and Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerizations Towards Well&#8208;defined Functionalized Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;carboxyanhydride (SCA) monomers derived from amino acids are introduced. The SCA monomers are significantly more reactive than thiolactones for ultrafast and selective ring&#8208;opening polymerization. The polymerizations reach complete conversion within minutes at room temperature, yielding polythioesters with predictable molecular weight, low dispersities, and retained stereoregularity.







Abstract
Aliphatic polythioesters are popular polymers because of their appealing performance such as metal coordination ability, high refractive indices, and biodegradability. One of the most powerful approaches for generating these polymers is the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic monomers. However, the synthesis of precisely controlled polythioesters via ROP of thiolactones still faces formidable challenges, including the minimal functional diversity of available thiolactone monomers, as well as inevitable transthioesterification side reactions. Here we introduce a hyperactive class of S&#8208;carboxyanhydride (SCA) monomers derived from amino acids that are significantly more reactive than thiolactones for ultrafast and selective ROP. Inclusion of the initiator PPNOBz ([PPN]=bis(triphenylphosphine)&#8208;iminium) with chain transfer agent benzoic acid, the polymerizations that can be operated in open vessels reach complete conversion within minutes (1&#8211;2&#8197;min) at room temperature, yielding polythioesters with predictable molecular weight, low dispersities, retained stereoregularity and chemical recyclability. Most fascinating are the functionalized SCAs that allow the incorporating of functional groups along the polythioester chain and thus finely tune their physicochemical performance. Computational studies were carried out to explore the origins of the distinctive rapidity and exquisite selectivity of the polymerizations, offering mechanistic insight and explaining why high polymerizability of SCA monomer is able to facilitate exquisitely selective ring&#8208;opening for enchainment over competing transthioesterification and backbiting reactions.

         <title>Iodide&#8208;Mediated Rapid and Sensitive Surface Etching of Gold Nanostars for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We outline a rapid and sensitive nanoparticle etching&#8208;based strategy for biosensing. Iodide modulates the plasmonic features of gold nanostars by etching them into spherical nanoparticles, being a versatile biosensing platform for enzyme detection and plasmonic immunoassays.







Abstract
Iodide&#8208;mediated surface etching can tailor the surface plasmon resonance of gold nanostars through etching of the high&#8208;energy facets of the nanoparticle protrusions in a rapid and sensitive way. By exploring the underlying mechanisms of this etching and the key parameters influencing it (such as iodide, oxygen, pH, and temperature), we show its potential in a sensitive biosensing system. Horseradish peroxidase&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of iodide enables control of the etching of gold nanostars to spherical gold nanoparticles, where the resulting spectral shift in the surface plasmon resonance yields a distinct color change of the solution. We further develop this enzyme&#8208;modulated surface etching of gold nanostars into a versatile platform for plasmonic immunoassays, where a high sensitivity is possible by signal amplification via magnetic beads and click chemistry.

         <title>MOF Nanosheet Reconstructed Two&#8208;Dimensional Bionic Nanochannel for Protonic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF thin film&#8208;based bionic proton field&#8208;effect transistor (H+&#8208;FET) has been fabricated for the first time. It displays the highest proton mobility and highest on&#8211;off ratio among all reported H+&#8208;FETs.







Abstract
The construction of hydrophobic nanochannel with hydrophilic sites for bionic devices to proximally mimick real bio&#8208;system is still challenging. Taking the advantages of MOF chemistry, a highly oriented CuTCPP thin film has been successfully reconstructed with ultra&#8208;thin nanosheets to produce abundant two&#8208;dimensional interstitial hydrophobic nanochannels with hydrophilic sites. Different from the classical active&#8208;layer material with proton transport in bulk, CuTCPP thin film represents a new type of active&#8208;layer with proton transport in nanochannel for bionic proton field&#8208;effect transistor (H+&#8208;FETs). The resultant device can reversibly modulate the proton transport by varying the voltage on its gate electrode. Meanwhile, it shows the highest proton mobility of &#8776;9.5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and highest on&#8208;off ratio of 4.1 among all of the reported H+&#8208;FETs. Our result demonstrates a powerful material design strategy for proximally mimicking the structure and properties of bio&#8208;systems and constructing bionic electrical devices.

         <title>Prediction of Novel van der Waals Boron Oxides with Superior Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An 18&#8208;membered&#8208;ring boron oxide (18MR&#8208;B2O3) is predicted with 1:1 ratio of [BO3] triangles and [B3O6] boroxol rings. Its van der Waals stackings, AA and AB, satisfy all the stringent criteria for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) materials, exhibiting short second harmonic generation (SHG) phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength and large SHG response.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) materials are attracting increasing attention because of their structural diversity and complexity. Using the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystal structure prediction method combined with the first&#8208;principles calculations, here we propose layered 18&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (18MR) boron oxide B2O3 polymorphs as high&#8208;performance NLO materials. 18MR&#8208;B2O3 with the AA and AB stackings are potential DUV NLO materials. The superior performing 18MR&#8208;B2O3AB has an unprecedentedly high second harmonic generation coefficient of 1.63&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1, the largest among the DUV NLO materials, three times larger than that of the advanced DUV NLO material KBe2BO3F2 and comparable to that of &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4. Its unusually large birefringence of 0.196 at 400&#8197;nm guarantees the phase&#8208;matching wavelength &#955;PM to reach this material's extreme absorption edge of &#8776;154&#8197;nm.

         <title>Linear Paired Electrolysis&#8212;Realising 200&#8201;% Current Efficiency for Stoichiometric Transformations&#8212;The Electrochemical Bromination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromination of Alkenes 2.0&#8212;can a stoichiometric chemical transformation exceed a 100&#8201;% yield? No! But there is a way to achieve an eletrochemical current efficiency of up to 200&#8201;% when oxygen is used as the sacrifical starting material. The cathodic reduction of oxygen to H2O2 led to the bromination of alkenes in a linear paired electrolysis in up to perfect 200&#8201;% current efficiency.







Abstract
The generation of bromine by oxidation of bromide anions at the anode and reduction of molecular oxygen at the cathode to hydrogen peroxide resulted in the overall formation of two molecules of Br2 (=four electron oxidation) by passing just two electrons through the solution. The bromine was used for the bromination of alkenes and thereby a linear paired electrolysis was attained which resulted in current efficencies of up to 200&#8201;%. Also, the diiodination of cyclohexene as well as the electrophilic aromatic bromination of an electron&#8208;rich arene were realised both in 168&#8201;% current efficiencies.

The complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide consisting of two molecules of DON (6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine) and one alanine, is revealed. The heterologous production of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;DON in Streptomyces albus was also established. Most interestingly, the transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5&#8208;oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates.







Abstract
DON (6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine), a diazo&#8208;containing amino acid, has been studied for more than 60&#8197;years as a potent antitumor agent, but its biosynthesis has not been elucidated. Here we reveal the complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide Ala&#8208;DON&#8208;DON, which has antitumor activity, by gene inactivation and in vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes. We also established heterologous production of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;DON in Streptomyces albus. DON is synthesized from lysine by three enzymes and converted to alazopeptin by five enzymes and one carrier protein. Most interestingly, transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5&#8208;oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of AzpL indicated that the hydroxy group of Tyr&#8208;93 is important for the diazotization. These findings expand our knowledge of the enzymology of N&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Based Identification of New IDO1 Modulator Chemotypes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme&#8208;competitive idoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO1) small&#8208;molecule modulators are under&#8208;represented as heme displacement is delayed in in&#8197;vitro assays. This limitation can be overcome by cell&#8208;based screening as employed in this study, which revealed novel chemotypes that potently inhibit IDO1 activity and kynurenine production by competing with heme.







Abstract
The immunoregulatory enzyme idoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO1) strengthens cancer immune escape, and inhibition of IDO1 by means of new chemotypes and mechanisms of action is considered a promising opportunity for IDO1 inhibitor discovery. IDO1 is a cofactor&#8208;binding, redox&#8208;sensitive protein, which calls for monitoring of IDO1 activity in its native cellular environment. We developed a new, robust fluorescence&#8208;based assay amenable to high throughput, which detects kynurenine in cells. Screening of a ca. 150&#8201;000&#8208;member compound library discovered unprecedented, potent IDO1 modulators with different mechanisms of action, including direct IDO1 inhibitors, regulators of IDO1 expression, and inhibitors of heme synthesis. Three IDO1&#8208;modulator chemotypes were identified that bind to apo&#8208;IDO1 and compete with the heme cofactor. Our new cell&#8208;based technology opens up novel opportunities for medicinal chemistry programs in immuno&#8208;oncology.

Screening of a ca. 150&#8201;000&#8208;member compound library discovered unprecedented, potent IDO1 modulators with different mechanisms of action, including direct IDO1 inhibitors, regulators of IDO1 expression, and inhibitors of heme synthesis. Three IDO1&#8208;modulator chemotypes were identified that bind to apo&#8208;IDO1 and compete with the heme cofactor. Our new cell&#8208;based technology opens up novel opportunities for medicinal chemistry programs in immuno&#8208;oncology.&lt;/p&gt;
