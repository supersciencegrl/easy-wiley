         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Halo&#8208;Halodifluoromethylation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Fluorinated Carboxylic Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component halo&#8208;halofluoroalkylation of alkenes/alkynes using fluorinated carboxylic anhydrides and alkali metal halides was developed, enabling the introduction of halodifluoromethyl (CF2X) and halogen (X&#8217;) groups with the desired combination of X and X&#8217;. The reactivity of the resulting products as building blocks was examined, and the detailed reaction mechanism was discussed with a focus on the ligand effect.







Abstract
Polyhalogenated molecules are often found as bioactive compounds in nature and are used as synthetic building blocks. Fluoroalkyl compounds hold promise for the development of novel pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as the introduction of fluoroalkyl groups is known to improve lipophilicity, membrane permeability, and metabolic stability. Three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;halo&#8208;halodifluoromethylation reactions of alkenes are useful for their synthesis. However, general methods enabling the introduction of halodifluoromethyl (CF2X) and halogen (X&#8217;) groups in the desired combination of X and X&#8217; are lacking. To address this gap, for the first time, we report a three&#8208;component halo&#8208;halodifluoromethylation of alkenes and alkynes using combinations of commercially available fluorinated carboxylic anhydrides ((CF2XCO)2O, X=Cl and Br) and alkali metal halides (X&#8217;=Cl and Br). In situ prepared fluorinated diacyl peroxides were identified as important intermediates, and the use of appropriate bipyridyl&#8208;based ligands and a copper catalyst was essential for achieving high product selectivity. The synthetic utility of the polyhalogenated products was demonstrated by exploiting differences in the reactivities of their C&#8722;X and C&#8722;X&#8217; bonds to achieve selective derivatization. Finally, the reaction mechanism and ligand effect were investigated using experimental and theoretical methods to provide important insights for the further development of catalytic reactions.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Solvent Coordination Enables Comprehensive Trap Passivation for Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a ligand/anti&#8208;solvent coordination strategy to resurface the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) perovskite quantum dots. The short and conductive agent dissolved in the antisolvent improved conductivity and ensured well passivation. We fabricate NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LED) with these high&#8208;mobility and trap&#8208;free films, and achieved an EQE of ~21&#8201;%. We further demonstrate that this strategy applies to large&#8208;area NIR LEDs up to 900&#8197;mm2.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LEDs) based on perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have produced external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~15&#8201;%. However, these high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;QLEDs suffer from immediate carrier quenching because of the accumulation of migratable ions at the surface of the QDs. These uncoordinated ions and carriers&#8212;if not bound to the nanocrystal surface&#8212;serve as centers for exciton quenching and device degradation. In this work, we overcome this issue and fabricate high&#8208;performance NIR QLEDs by devising a ligand anchoring strategy, which entails dissolving the strong&#8208;binding ligand (Guanidine Hydroiodide, GAI) in the mediate&#8208;polar solvent. By employing the dye&#8208;sensitized device structure (phosphorescent indicator), we demonstrate the elimination of the interface defects. The treated QDs films exhibit an exciton binding energy of 117&#8197;meV: this represents a 1.5&#8208;fold increase compared to that of the control (74&#8197;meV). We report, as a result, the NIR QLEDs with an EQE of 21&#8201;% which is a record among NIR perovskite QLEDs. These QLEDs also exhibit a 7&#8208;fold higher operational stability than that of the best previously reported NIR QLEDs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the QDs are compatible with large&#8208;area QLEDs: we showcase 900&#8197;mm2 QLEDs with EQE approaching 20&#8201;%.

         <title>&#945;&#8217;&#8208;Selective Selenium&#8208;catalyzed Allylic C&#8722;H Amination of Enol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selenium catalyst allows C&#8722;H amination of a wide range of potentially cross&#8208;reactive enol derivatives with unique selectivity for the &#945;&#8217;&#8208;position, thereby unlocking the reactive potential of both ketone &#945;&#8208;positions. Stereoconvergent formation of Z enol derivatives from E/Z mixtures eliminates the need for selective enolization methods. Resonance donation from the oxygen in the ene transition state is responsible for the high regioselectivity.







Abstract
A transition metal&#8208;free Se&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amination protocol for &#945;&#8217;&#8208;amination of enol derivatives has been developed. This reaction can be used to functionalize a wide variety of oxygen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;substituted alkenes spanning a vast range of nucleophilicities, giving &#945;&#8217;&#8208;aminated enol derivatives with high regioselectivity. Amination of E/Z mixtures of alkenes proceeds stereoconvergently to give the (Z)&#8208;enol derivatives exclusively. Mechanistic studies revealed that the relative reactivity and &#945;&#8217;&#8208;regioselectivity of these transformations is determined by substantial resonance donation to the heteroatom&#8208;bound carbon in the transition state. These products participate in traditional reactions of enol derivatives, allowing for efficient functionalization of both &#945;&#8208; and &#945;&#8217;&#8208;positions from a single enol derivative with high diastereocontrol.

         <title>Multiplexed and Quantitative Imaging of Live&#8208;Cell Membrane Proteins by a Precise and Controllable DNA&#8208;Encoded Amplification Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The template adhesion reaction represents a simple and precisely controllable amplification approach, which enables to assemble amplifiable DNA sequences with affinity ligands for proportional amplification and sensitive visualization of multiple membrane protein targets with enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios while maintaining their original concentration ratios.







Abstract
Amplifying DNA conjugated affinity ligands can improve the sensitivity and multiplicity of cell imaging and play a crucial role in comprehensively deciphering cellular heterogeneity and dynamic changes during development and disease. However, the development of one&#8208;step, controllable, and quantitative DNA amplification methods for multiplexed imaging of live&#8208;cell membrane proteins is challenging. Here, we introduce the template adhesion reaction (TAR) method for assembling amplifiable DNA sequences with different affinity ligands, such as aptamers or antibodies, for amplified and multiplexed imaging of live&#8208;cell membrane proteins with high quantitative fidelity. The precisely controllable TAR enables proportional amplification of membrane protein targets with variable abundances by modulating the concentration ratios of hairpin templates and primers, thus allowing sensitive visualization of multiple membrane proteins with enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios (SNRs) without disturbing their original ratios. Using TAR, we achieved signal&#8208;enhanced imaging of six proteins on the same live&#8208;cell within 1&#8211;2&#8197;h. TAR represents an innovative and programmable molecular toolkit for multiplexed profiling of membrane proteins in live&#8208;cells.

Kawamata, Baran, and Shenvi disclose a solitary iron&#8208;catalyzed conceptually distinct platform for constructing quaternary carbons using readily available and structurally diverse redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) and olefins as modular coupling fragments. The heteroselective radical quaternization exhibits appreciable functional group tolerance and enables the synthesis of a palette of quaternary carbon&#8208;containing molecules under practical conditions.







Abstract
Quaternary carbons are embedded in various natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic materials. However, constructing this valuable motif is far from trivial. Conventional approaches mainly rely on classical polar disconnections and encounter bottlenecks concerning harsh conditions, functional group tolerance, regioselectivity, and step economy. In this context, Kawamata, Baran, Shenvi, and co&#8208;workers recently demonstrated that two feedstock chemicals, alkyl carboxylic acids and olefins, could be utilized to construct tetrasubstituted carbons in the presence of an inexpensive iron porphyrin catalyst and a suitable reductant combination through quaternization of the radical intermediates. The method enables access to various sterically encumbered quaternary carbons under mild and robust conditions. Taking a complete detour from conventional approaches, the present heteroselective radical&#8211;radical coupling simplifies the synthesis of quaternary carbon&#8208;containing molecules through an innovative and distinctive disconnection approach.

         <title>Dilute Electrolytes with Fluorine&#8208;Free Ether Solvents for 4.5&#8197;V Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through salt modulation, high oxidation stability can be achieved for a 0.8&#8197;M dilute electrolyte consisting of a single fluorine (F)&#8208;free ether solvent. The boron (B)&#8208;containing cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed by the salt decomposition enable stable cycling of lithium metal batteries with a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode at the voltage range of 3&#8211;4.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
The limited oxidation stability of ether solvents has posed significant challenges for their applications in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To tackle this issue, the prevailing strategy either adopts a high concentration of fluorinated salts or relies on highly fluorinated solvents, which will significantly increase the manufacturing cost and create severe environmental hazards. Herein, an alternative and sustainable salt engineering approach is proposed to enable the utilization of dilute electrolytes consisting of fluorine (F)&#8208;free ethers in high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The proposed 0.8&#8197;M electrolyte supports stable lithium plating&#8208;stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.47&#8201;% and effectively mitigates the metal dissolution, phase transition, and gas release issues of the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode upon charging to high voltages. Consequently, the 4.5&#8197;V high&#8208;loading Li||NCM 811&#8197;cell shows a capacity retention of 75.2&#8201;% after 300 cycles. Multimodal experimental characterizations coupled with theoretical investigations demonstrate that the boron&#8208;containing salt plays a pivotal role in forming the passivation layers on both anode and cathode. The present simple and cost&#8208;effective electrolyte design strategy offers a promising and alternative avenue for using commercially mature, environmentally benign, and low&#8208;cost F&#8208;free ethers in high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Synthesis of a Gold&#8211;Silver Alloy Nanocluster within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate and Its Photocatalytic Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalates (POMs) can serve as an effective stabilizing ligand for metal nanoclusters to impart distinctive structures and properties. We report the synthesis of a surface&#8208;exposed Au&#8722;Ag alloy nanocluster within a ring&#8208;shaped POM through reaction of an Ag nanocluster with Au ions (Au+). The resulting Au&#8722;Ag alloy nanocluster demonstrated remarkably enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalytic activity in the aerobic oxidation reactions and stability compared to the parent Ag nanocluster.







Abstract
Alloying is an effective method for modulating metal nanoclusters to enrich their structural diversity and physicochemical properties. Recent investigations have demonstrated that polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as effective multidentate ligands for silver (Ag) nanoclusters to endow them with synergistic properties, reactivity, catalytic properties, and stability. However, the application of POMs as ligands has been confined predominantly to monometallic nanoclusters. Herein, we report a synthetic method for fabricating surface&#8208;exposed gold (Au)&#8722;Ag alloy nanoclusters within a ring&#8208;shaped POM ([P8W48O184]40&#8722;). Reacting an Ag nanocluster stabilized by the ring&#8208;shaped POM with Au ions (Au+) was found to substitute several Ag atoms at the core of the nanocluster with Au atoms. The resultant {Au8Ag26} alloy nanocluster demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity and stability compared to the pristine Ag nanocluster in the aerobic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene under visible&#8208;light irradiation. These findings provide fundamental insights into the formation and catalytic properties of POM&#8208;stabilized alloy nanoclusters and advance exploration into the synthesis and applications of diverse metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Enriched Alginate&#8211;Graphene Hydrogel Microreactor for Enhanced Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes a graphene&#8211;alginate hydrogel system cross&#8208;linked by metal ions M(n), addressing the challenges of insufficient proton supply and stable detachment of the intermediate *OOH in photocatalytic ORR reactions. The alginate framework facilitates proton relay, while the role of metal ions was evident through Lewis acidity&#8208;dependent activity for H2O2 production.







Abstract
Efficient synthesis of H2O2 via photocatalytic oxygen reduction without sacrificial agents is challenging due to inadequate proton supply from water and difficulty in maintaining O&#8722;O bond during O2 activation. Herein, we developed a straightforward strategy involving a proton&#8208;rich hydrogel cross&#8208;linked by metal ions [M(n)], which is designed to facilitate the selective production of H2O2 through proton relay and metal ion&#8208;assisted detachment of crucial intermediates. The hydrogel comprises CdS/graphene and alginate cross&#8208;linked by metal ions via O=C&#8722;O&#8722;M(n) bonds. Efficient O2 reduction and hydrogenation occurred, benefitting from the collaboration between proton&#8208;rich alginate and the photocatalytically active CdS/graphene. Meanwhile, the O=C&#8722;O&#8722;M(n) bonds enhance the electron density of &#945;&#8208;carbon sites on graphene, crucial for O2 activation and *OOH intermediate detachment, preventing deeper O&#8722;O bond cleavage. The role of metal ions in promoting *OOH desorption was demonstrated through Lewis acidity&#8208;dependent activity, with Y(III) having the highest activity, followed by Lu(III), La(III), and Ca(II).

         <title>The Coking of a Solid Catalyst Rationalized with Combined Raman and Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined Raman, fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime microscopy allows to study the coke formation process of an industrial equilibrium catalyst for fluid catalytic cracking. The changing fluorescence dynamics, together with extensive coke graphitization observed during in situ coking experiments with hexane as feedstock show that combining these three microscopy techniques provides a detailed physicochemical picture of the coking of a highly complex hydrocarbon conversion catalyst.







Abstract
The formation of carbon deposits is a major deactivation pathway for solid catalysts. Studying coking on industrially relevant catalysts is, however, often challenging due to the sample heterogeneity. That is especially true for zeolite&#8208;containing catalysts where fluorescence often hampers their characterization with Raman spectroscopy. We turned this disadvantage into an advantage and combined Raman and fluorescence (lifetime) microscopy to study the coking behavior of an equilibrium catalyst material used for fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons. The results presented illustrate that this approach can yield new insights in the physicochemical processes occurring within zeolite&#8208;containing catalyst particles during their coking process. Ex situ analyses of single catalyst particles revealed considerable intra&#8208;sample heterogeneities. The sample&#8208;averaged Raman spectra showed a higher degree of graphitization when the sample was exposed to more hexane, while the sample&#8208;averaged fluorescence lifetime showed no significant trend. Simultaneous in situ Raman and fluorescence (lifetime) microscopy, used to follow the coking and the regeneration of single particles, gave more insights in the changing fluorescence dynamics. During the coking, the rise and decline of the average fluorescence lifetime suggested the prolonged presence of smaller coke species that are quenched more and more by adjacent larger polyaromatics acting as F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance&#8208;energy&#8208;transfer acceptors.

         <title>Potent and Selective Oxidatively Labile Ether&#8208;Based Prodrugs through Late&#8208;Stage Boronate Incorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Late&#8208;stage alkene functionalization reactions can be used to convert non&#8208;biologically active entities into boron&#8208;containing cancer cell&#8208;selective toxins. The rapid cleavage of borylallyl groups in the presence of peroxide allows for the use of ether&#8208;based prodrugs for oxidatively stressed cells. The utility of ethers in de novo prodrug synthesis is demonstrated through the conversion of a protecting group into an oxidatively cleavable group.







Abstract
This manuscript describes a new strategy for prodrug synthesis in which a relatively inert ether group is introduced at an early stage in a synthetic sequence and functionalized in the final step to introduce a prodrug&#8208;activating group through a chemoselective process. Boryl allyloxy (BAO) ether groups are synthesized through several metal&#8208;mediated processes to form entities that are readily cleaved under oxidative conditions commonly found in cancer cells. The high cleavage propensity of the BAO group allows for ether cleavage, making these compounds substantially more hydrolytically stable in comparison to acyl&#8208;linked prodrugs while retaining the ability to release alcohols. We report the preparation of prodrug analogues of the natural products camptothecin and pederin from acetal precursors that serve as protecting groups in their synthetic sequences. The BAO acetal groups cleave in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to release the cytotoxic agents. The pederin&#8208;based prodrug shows dramatically greater cytotoxicity than negative controls and outstanding selectivity and potency toward cancer cell lines in comparison to non&#8208;cancerous cell lines. This late&#8208;stage functionalization approach to prodrug synthesis should be applicable to numerous systems that can be accessed through chemoselective processes.

         <title>Carbonate Ester&#8208;Based Sodium Metal Battery with High&#8208;Capacity Retention at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C Enabled by Weak Solvents and Electrodeposited Anode</title>

         <dc:description>
This work proposes a new approach to achieving an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;temperature carbonate ester&#8208;based sodium metal battery working at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C, which is benefited from a wide liquid&#8208;range electrolyte and an electrodeposited Na (Cu/Na) anode with stable inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have received increasing attention due to the abundant sodium resources and high energy density, but suffered from the sluggish interfacial kinetic and unstable plating/stripping of sodium anode at low temperature, especially when matched with ester electrolytes. Here, we develop a stable ultra&#8208;low&#8208;temperature SMBs with high&#8208;capacity retention at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C in a weak solvated carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolyte, combined with an electrodeposited Na (Cu/Na) anode. The Cu/Na anode with electrochemically activated &#8220;deposited sodium&#8221; and stable inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is favor for the fast Na+ migration, therefore accelerating the interfacial kinetic process. As a result, the Cu/Na||NaCrO2 battery exhibited the highest capacity retention (compared to room&#8208;temperature capacity) in carbonate ester&#8208;based SMBs (98.05&#8201;% at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C, 91.3&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, 87.9&#8201;% at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C, respectively). The cyclic stability of 350 cycles at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C with a high energy efficiency of 96.15&#8201;% and 70 cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C can be achieved. Even in chill atmospheric environment with the fluctuant temperature, the battery can still operate over one month. This work provides a new opportunity for the development of low&#8208;temperature carbonate ester&#8208;based SMBs.

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd&#8208;CeOx Nanoparticles in Zeolite Nanosheets for Efficient CO2&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Storage and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the synthesis of bimetallic Pd&#8208;based nanocatalysts on zeolite nanosheets, demonstrating exceptional catalytic performance in formic acid dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation to formate. The outstanding catalytic performance is attributed to significantly enhanced thermal stability, metal utilization, and transport efficiency. These findings offer crucial insights for advancing safe, efficient, and sustainable hydrogen technology development.







Abstract
Formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation to FA/formate represent promising methodologies for the efficient and clean storage and release of hydrogen, forming a CO2&#8208;neutral energy cycle. Here, we report the synthesis of highly dispersed and stable bimetallic Pd&#8208;based nanoparticles, immobilized on self&#8208;pillared silicalite&#8208;1 (SP&#8208;S&#8208;1) zeolite nanosheets using an incipient wetness co&#8208;impregnation technique. Owing to the highly accessible active sites, effective mass transfer, exceptional hydrophilicity, and the synergistic effect of the bimetallic species, the optimized PdCe0.2/SP&#8208;S&#8208;1 catalyst demonstrated unparalleled catalytic performance in both FA dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation to formate. Remarkably, it achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 5974&#8197;molH2&#8201;molPd&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a formate production rate of 536&#8197;molformate&#8201;molPd&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, surpassing most previously reported heterogeneous catalysts under similar conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the interfacial effect between Pd and cerium oxide clusters substantially reduces the activation barriers for both reactions, thereby increasing the catalytic performance. Our research not only showcases a compelling application of zeolite nanosheet&#8208;supported bimetallic nanocatalysts in CO2&#8208;mediated hydrogen storage and release but also contributes valuable insights towards the development of safe, efficient, and sustainable hydrogen technologies.

         <title>Fluorine Doping Mediated Epitaxial Growth of NaREF4 on TiO2 for Boosting NIR Light Utilization in Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine doping&#8208;mediated epitaxial growth strategy was developed for the synthesis of TiO2&#8208;NaREF4 heteronanocrystals (HNCs). Due to the epitaxial growth connection, NaREF4 can transfer energy through phonon&#8208;assisted pathway to TiO2, which is more efficient than the traditional indirect secondary photon excitation.







Abstract
By integrating TiO2 with rare earth upconversion nanocrystals (NaREF4), efficient energy transfer can be achieved between the two subunits under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitation, which hold tremendous potential in the fields of photocatalysis, photodynamic therapy (PDT), etc. However, in the previous studies, the combination of TiO2 with NaREF4 is a non&#8208;epitaxial random blending mode, resulting in a diminished energy transfer efficiency between the NaREF4 and TiO2. Herein, we present a fluorine doping&#8208;mediated epitaxial growth strategy for the synthesis of TiO2&#8208;NaREF4 heteronanocrystals (HNCs). Due to the epitaxial growth connection, NaREF4 can transfer energy through phonon&#8208;assisted pathway to TiO2, which is more efficient than the traditional indirect secondary photon excitation. Additionally, F doping brings oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 subunit, which further introduces new impurity energy levels in the intrinsic band gap of TiO2 subunit, and facilitates the energy transfer through phonon&#8208;assisted method from NaREF4 to TiO2. As a proof of concept, TiO2&#8208;NaGdF4&#8201;:&#8201;Yb,Tm@NaYF4@NaGdF4&#8201;:&#8201;Nd@NaYF4 HNCs were rationally constructed. Taking advantage of the dual&#8208;model up&#8208; and downconversion luminescence of the delicately designed multi&#8208;shell structured NaREF4 subunit, highly efficient photo&#8208;response capability of the F&#8208;doped TiO2 subunit and the efficient phonon&#8208;assisted energy transfer between them, the prepared HNCs provide a distinctive nanoplatform for bioimaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;triggered PDT.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Pomegranate&#8208;Like CuF2 Cathode Derived from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electroltyte of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries is utilized as fluorine source to in situ fluorinate the 3D porous Cu foam through a facile and mild solvothermal method. Benefiting from the protective solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cross&#8208;linked sodium alginate (SA) layer, the optimized CuF2@void@SEI@SA cathode with pomegranate&#8208;like (yolk&#8208;shell) structure exhibits large specific capacity and superb cycling stability. This work not only provides new options for exploiting novel materials for large&#8208;scale high&#8208;density energy storage, the combined utilization of organic electrolyte of spent LIBs also realizes the unity of environmental, social and economic benefits.







Abstract
With the large&#8208;scale application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), a huge amount of spent LIBs will be generated each year and how to realize their recycling and reuse in a clean and effective way poses a challenge to the society. In this work, using the electrolyte of spent LIBs as solvent, we in situ fluorinate the conductive three&#8208;dimensional porous copper foam by a facile solvent&#8208;thermal method and then coating it with a cross&#8208;linked sodium alginate (SA) layer. Benefiting from the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) that accommodating the volume change of internal CuF2 core and SA layer that inhibiting the dissolution of CuF2, the synthesized CuF2@void@SEI@SA cathode with a pomegranate&#8208;like structure (yolk&#8208;shell) exhibits a large reversible capacity of ~535&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superb cycling stability. This work conforms to the development concept of green environmental protection and comprehensively realizes the unity of environmental, social and economic benefits.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes via Sequential Povarov Reaction and Aromatizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular and efficient enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes has been developed through the sequential chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed Povarov reaction and subsequent aromatizations. With the excellent compatibility of the Povarov reaction and the development of distinct aromatization methods, a wide range of structurally diverse novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes were produced with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes represent a unique type of chiral molecules with significant applications, yet their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains largely underexplored. We report herein the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes through the sequential organocatalyzed enantioselective Povarov reaction and aromatizations. The chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed three&#8208;component Povarov reaction involving amino group&#8208;substituted calix[4]arenes, aldehydes and (di)enamides desymmetrized the prochiral calix[4]arene substrates, which was followed by various aromatization methods, resulting in a diverse array of novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 75&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee). The large&#8208;scale enantioselective synthesis and diverse derivatizations of the chiral calix[4]arene products highlight the value of this method. Furthermore, preliminary exploration into their photophysical and chiroptical properties demonstrate the potential applications of these novel calix[4]arene molecules.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Enabled Droplet Biobattery for Powering Synthetic Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A droplet biobattery built from nanolitre droplets, fuelled by the enzyme&#8208;enabled oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, generates electrical outputs and powers ion fluxes in droplet networks. The enzyme&#8208;enabled droplet biobattery opens new avenues in bioelectronics and bioiontronics, exemplified by tasks such as the ability to drive chemical signalling when integrated into synthetic tissues.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;enabled biobatteries are promising green options to power the next&#8208;generation of bioelectronics and implantable medical devices. However, existing power sources based on enzymatic biofuel chemistry exhibit limited scale&#8208;down feasibility due to the solid and bulky battery structures. Therefore, miniature and soft alternatives are needed for integration with implants and tissues. Here, a biobattery built from nanolitre droplets, fuelled by the enzyme&#8208;enabled oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, generates electrical outputs and powers ion fluxes in droplet networks. Optimization of the droplet biobattery components ensures a stable output current of ~13,000&#8197;pA for over 24&#8197;h, representing a more than 600&#8208;fold increase in output over previous approaches, including light&#8208;driven processes. The enzyme&#8208;enabled droplet biobattery opens new avenues in bioelectronics and bioiontronics, exemplified by tasks such as the ability to drive chemical signal transmission in integrated synthetic tissues.

         <title>Iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;7 Selective NH2 Amination of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indole via directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS), enabled by identifying N&#8211;P(O)t&#8722;Bu2 (TBPO) as the directing group. Important features of this reaction include the broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, good functional groups tolerance, use of earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst and low catalyst loading, and the ease to scale up.







Abstract
7&#8208;Aminoindoles are important synthetic intermediates to a broad range of bioactive molecules. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H amination is among the most straightforward route for their synthesis, whereas methods that could directly incorporate an NH2 group in a highly selective manner remains elusive. Moreover, there is still high demand for the development of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis for such attractive reactivity. We present here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indoles through a directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) with iron&#8208;aminyl radical. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerates variety of functional groups, and is readily scalable with catalyst loading down to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover number (TON) up to 4500.

         <title>Pomotrelvir and Nirmatrelvir Binding and Reactivity with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease: Implications for Resistance Mechanisms from Computations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study the inhibition mechanism of pomotrelvir against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease, using MM and QM/MM simulations and free energy calculations. Transforming pomotrelvir's groups to those in nirmatrelvir revealed that tertiary amines are favored at P2, while flexible side chains at this position may disrupt active site organization. These insights may aid in designing improved inhibitors for current and future SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants.







Abstract
We investigate the inhibition mechanism between pomotrelvir and the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease using molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations. Alchemical transformations where each Pi group of pomotrelvir was transformed into its counterpart in nirmatrelvir were performed to unravel the individual contribution of each group to the binding and reaction processes. We have shown that while a &#947;&#8208;lactam ring is preferred at position P1, a &#948;&#8208;lactam ring is a good alternative for the design of inhibitors for variants presenting mutations at position&#8197;166. For the P2 position, tertiary amines are preferred with respect to secondary amines. Flexible side chains at the P2 position can disrupt the preorganization of the active site, favouring the exploration of non&#8208;reactive conformations. The substitution of the P2&#8197;group of pomotrelvir by that of nirmatrelvir resulted in a compound, named as C2, that presents a better binding free energy and a higher population of reactive conformations in the Michaelis complex. Analysis of the chemical reaction to form the covalent complex has shown a similar reaction mechanism and activation free energies for pomotrelvir, nirmatrelvir and C2. We hope that these findings could be useful to design better inhibitors to fight present and future variants of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Ring Morphology of Ag7NCs and Light&#8208;Induced Reversible Interconversion of FCC Ag14NCs via Cu2+ ions&#8208;Mediated Particle&#8208;Assisted Reversible Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present investigation demonstrates the light&#8208;induced reversible interconversion of FCC Ag14NCs to Ag7NCs. UV light triggers the transformation of FCC Ag14NCs to Ag7NCs, whereas visible light induces the reversible interconversion of Ag7NCs to Ag14NCs. This study also reveals the formation of micro&#8208;ring morphology, a unique supramolecular assembly in metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress made on intercluster conversion in atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) and their self&#8208;organization to develop microscopic molecular architecture with well&#8208;defined size and shape, achieving light&#8208;induced reversible structural transformation and the development of micro&#8208;ring self&#8208;assembly in MNCs have, so far, remained elusive. The present investigation touches on these two long&#8208;standing quests by showcasing a new route, light&#8208;induced Particle&#8208;Assisted Reversible Interconversion (PARI) for the reversible transformation from Face Centered Cubic (FCC) Ag14NCs to Ag7NCs. Our studies reveal that the lack of plasmonic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the system results in the formation of Ag7NCs with metallic kernels having centrosymmetric crystal packing. The molecular self&#8208;organization of Ag7NCs through various non&#8208;covalent interactions such as C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; leads to the formation of micro&#8208;ring morphology, a unique molecular architecture in MNCs. The in situ generated AgNPs due to the acceleration of the reaction kinetics by Cu2+ ions facilitate the growth of Ag14NCs with FCC metallic kernel. These two structural units of AgNCs show light&#8208;induced reversible structural transformation which is also associated with the reversible tuning of their spectroscopic and morphological signatures. This PARI&#8208;guided interconversion strategy put forward a most appropriate example of a structure&#8211;property relationship in MNCs.

         <title>Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;ion Storage in A Bifunctional Nanoreactor Based on Single&#8208;atom Mn Supported on N&#8208;doped Carbon over MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoreactor of single&#8208;atom Mn supported on N&#8208;doped carbon is constructed over MoS2 nanosheets. It facilitates the reversible conversion of MoS2 during sodium storage by not only confining the volume change and agglomeration of discharge products but also providing catalytic Mn&#8722;N4 sites for the charging process.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type electrode materials have gained massive research attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but their limited reversibility hampers practical use. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoreactor to boost highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage, wherein a record&#8208;high reversible degree of 85.65&#8201;% is achieved for MoS2 anodes. Composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported single atom Mn (NC&#8208;SAMn), this bifunctional nanoreactor concurrently confines active materials spatially and catalyzes reaction kinetics. In situ/ex situ characterizations including spectroscopy, microscopy, and electrochemistry, combined with theoretical simulations containing density functional theory and molecular dynamics, confirm that the NC&#8208;SAMn nanoreactors facilitate the electron/ion transfer, promote the distribution and interconnection of discharging products (Na2S/Mo), and reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier. As a result, the nanoreactor&#8208;promoted MoS2 anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a capacity retention of 99.86&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates the superiority of bifunctional nanoreactors with two&#8208;dimensional confined and catalytic effects, providing a feasible approach to improve the reversibility for a wide range of conversion&#8208;type electrode materials, thereby enhancing the application potential for long&#8208;cycled SIBs.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Evolution of Ethanolamine upon Microhydration: Insights from Hyperfine Resolved Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How many water molecules are needed to dissolve a base molecule? Using rotational spectroscopy, we explored the electronic environment of the &#8722;NH2 group in ethanolamine under microhydration. By measuring the 14N nuclear&#8208;spin quadrupole coupling, we found a strong correlation between the ionicity of &#8722;NH2 and nearby hydrogen bonds, pushing it towards the &#8722;NH3+ configuration.







Abstract
Ethanolamine hydrates containing from one to seven water molecules were identified via rotational spectroscopy with the aid of accurate quantum chemical methods considering anharmonic vibrational corrections. Ethanolamine undergoes significant conformational changes upon hydration to form energetically favorable hydrogen bond networks. The final structures strongly resemble the pure (H2O)3&#8211;9 complexes reported before when replacing two water molecules by ethanolamine. The 14N nuclear quadrupole coupling constants of all the ethanolamine hydrates have been determined and show a remarkable correlation with the strength of hydrogen bonds involving the amino group. After addition of the seventh water molecule, both hydrogen atoms of the amino group actively contribute to hydrogen bond formation, reinforcing the network and introducing approximately 21&#8211;27&#8201;% ionicity towards the formation of protonated amine. These findings highlight the critical role of microhydration in altering the electronic environment of ethanolamine, enhancing our understanding of amine hydration dynamics.

         <title>Reproducing Reaction Mechanisms with Machine&#8208;Learning Models Trained on a Large&#8208;Scale Mechanistic Dataset</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning models trained on mechanistic datasets created using expert reaction templates demonstrate the ability to successfully predict known reaction mechanisms. This study illustrates how such mechanistic models can explain how reaction outcomes are produced, recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents, and suggest potential side products and impurities.







Abstract
Mechanistic understanding of organic reactions can facilitate reaction development, impurity prediction, and in principle, reaction discovery. While several machine learning models have sought to address the task of predicting reaction products, their extension to predicting reaction mechanisms has been impeded by the lack of a corresponding mechanistic dataset. In this study, we construct such a dataset by imputing intermediates between experimentally reported reactants and products using expert reaction templates and train several machine learning models on the resulting dataset of 5,184,184&#8197;elementary steps. We explore the performance and capabilities of these models, focusing on their ability to predict reaction pathways and recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of mechanistic models in predicting impurities, often overlooked by conventional models. We conclude by evaluating the generalizability of mechanistic models to new reaction types, revealing challenges related to dataset diversity, consecutive predictions, and violations of atom conservation.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Chiral 9,10&#8208;Dihydrophenanthrenes via Ligand&#8208;Enabled Enantioselective Cascade &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Diarylation of Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cascade &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H diarylation of free carboxylic acids using bidentate chiral mono&#8208;protected amino thioether ligands (MPAThio), enabling one&#8208;step synthesis of a complex chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthrene scaffolds with high enantioselectivity was presented. In this process, two methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and three C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds were activated, leading to the formation of four C&#8722;C bonds and three chiral centers in one pot. Mechanistic studies revealed the intermediacy and crucial role of chiral &#946;,&#947;&#8208;cyclohexene derived from enantioselective &#946;,&#947;&#8208;dehydrogenation as a norbornene&#8208;type reagent, orchestrating two successive Catellani reactions to furnish chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthrenes.







Abstract
Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a versatile platform for constructing point, axial, and planar chirality.

In this process, two methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and three C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds were activated, leading to the formation of four C&#8722;C bonds and three chiral centers in one pot. A plausible catalytic pathway starts with enantioselective &#946;,&#947;&#8208;dehydrogenation to form chiral &#946;,&#947;&#8208;cyclohexene. Intriguingly, this olefin serves as a norbornene&#8208;type reagent (presumably assisted by the carboxyl directing effect), relaying two successive Catellani arylation reactions and a C&#8722;H arylation reaction to furnish chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthrenes along with meta&#8208;selective homocoupling products of iodoarene.

         <title>Synthesis and Comprehensive Studies of Be&#8208;IV&#8208;N2 (IV=Si, Ge): Solving the Mystery of Wurtzite&#8208;Type Pmc21 Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BeSiN2 was synthesized in a radio&#8208;frequency furnace, forming a structure typical for wurtzite&#8208;type nitride materials. The behavior under high&#8208;pressure conditions was elucidated in a diamond anvil cell. Reacting Be3N2 with Ge3N4 in a high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature approach gains access to a new substance class and to the unique structure of BeGeN2, which differs from that of the Si analog. Both materials show a second harmonic generation effect.







Abstract
The research for wurtzite&#8208;type ternary nitride semiconductors containing earth abundant elements with a stoichiometry of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;2 was focused on metals like Mg or Zn, so far. The vast majority of these Grimm&#8211;Sommerfeld analogue compounds crystallize in the &#946;&#8208;NaFeO2 structure, although a second arrangement in space group Pmc21 is predicted to be a viable alternative. Despite extensive theoretical and experimental studies, this structure has so far remained undiscovered. Herein, we report on BeGeN2 in a Pmc21 structure, synthesized from Be3N2 and Ge3N4 using a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 6&#8197;GPa and 800&#8201;&#176;C. The compound was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;dependent PXRD, second harmonic generation (SHG) and UV/Vis measurements and in addition also compared to its lighter homologue BeSiN2 in all mentioned analytic techniques. The synthesis and investigation of both the first beryllium germanium nitride and the first ternary wurtzite&#8208;type nitride crystallizing in space group Pmc21 open the door to a new field of research on wurtzite&#8208;type related structures.

         <title>Half&#8208;Curcumin&#8208;Based Chemiluminescence Probes and Their Applications in Detecting Quasi&#8208;Stable Oxidized Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;curcumin analogue, CRANAD&#8208;164, was developed as a novel chemiluminescence probe. It is sensitive to quasi&#8208;stable oxidized proteins with strong chemiluminescence emission, which could be exploited for in vivo liver imaging and in vitro blood tests.







Abstract
Numerous methods have been reported for detecting ROS/RNS in vitro and in vivo; however, detecting methods for the secondary products of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS) reactions, particularly quasi&#8208;stable oxidized products, have been much less explored. In this report, we observed that half&#8208;curcumins could generate chemiluminescence (CL). In contrast to other chemiluminescence scaffolds, the distinguishing feature of a half&#8208;curcumin is the formation of a carbanion intermediate of its acetylacetone moiety, opening unique avenues for applications. In this study, we designed a series of half&#8208;curcumins CRANAD&#8208;Xs and found that CRANAD&#8208;164 could be used to detect quasi&#8208;stable oxidized proteins (QSOP) in vivo and in patient serum samples. We illustrated that CRANAD&#8208;164 could be used to monitor the responses of taurine, an amino acid with newly reported anti&#8208;aging capacity, in an inflammatory mouse model. Remarkably, we further demonstrated that the QSOP levels were much higher in the disease serum samples, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), compared to the samples from healthy controls. Moreover, our results revealed that the sera chemiluminescence intensities were higher in aged healthy controls compared to young healthy subjects, suggesting that CRANAD&#8208;164 can be used to monitor the increase of QSOP during aging.

         <title>Design of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials: Transition from Carbonyl to Amide&#8208;Based Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transitioning from a carbonyl (O=C) to an amide (O=C&#8722;N) skeleton as the acceptor significantly enhances the electrochemical stability of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Benzoyl carbazole and carbazoline&#8208;based TADF materials function as efficient emitters for constructing non&#8208;doped OLEDs and serve as hosts for assembling narrowband red fluorescent OLEDs.







Abstract
Benzophenone skeletons containing a carbonyl unit (O=C) have been widely used as electron acceptors in the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Herein, we present a novel molecular design concept for TADF materials by transitioning from a carbonyl to an amide (O=C&#8722;N) skeleton as the acceptor. The amide unit, compared to its carbonyl counterpart, offers a more stable electronic configuration. Leveraging this insight, we have developed a series of high&#8208;performance TADF molecules based on benzoyl carbazole and carbazoline acceptors. These molecules exhibit exceptionally small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps and pronounced aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission properties, achieving photoluminescence quantum yields in neat films as high as 99&#8201;%. Consequently, these materials serve as efficient emitters in non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;eimtting diodes (OLEDs), reaching a maximum quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of up to 26.0&#8201;%, significantly higher than the 17.0&#8201;% obtained with benzophenone acceptor&#8208;based TADF molecules. Additionally, they have been used as TADF hosts in narrowband red fluorescent OLEDs, setting a record&#8208;high EQEmax of 22.4&#8201;%.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence Energy Transfer Combined with Chirality&#8208;Selective Absorption for Modulating Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work establishes a novel and universal strategy which combines circularly polarized phosphorescence energy transfer (CPP&#8208;ET) with chirality&#8208;selective absorption (CSA) of chiral polyacetylenes to construct full&#8208;color tunable circularly polarized long afterglow (CPLA). According to the strategy, full&#8208;color and white CPLA films with afterglow lasting for more than 20&#8197;min are prepared.







Abstract
Circularly polarized long afterglow (CPLA) attracts great interests in multi&#8208;disciplinary fields with significant potentials in optical multiplexing applications, but achieving full&#8208;color and white CPLA is still challenging. The present contribution reports the first success in utilizing circularly polarized phosphorescence energy transfer (CPP&#8208;ET) combined with chirality&#8208;selective absorption (CSA) to construct full&#8208;color and white CPLA materials. Blue CPLA with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 3&#215;10&#8722;2 is firstly obtained via the CSA effect of chiral helical polyacetylene and blue ultralong afterglow of inorganic phosphor BP. Significantly, full&#8208;color and white CPLA films are prepared by simply blending different fluorophores into the blue&#8208;CPLA films via CPP&#8208;ET. Benefited from the persistent luminescence of BP, the lifetimes of the fluorophores increase from nanoseconds to minutes, and ultralong full&#8208;color CPLA emissions lasting for more than 20&#8197;min are realized with glum of 10&#8722;3. Also noticeably, chiral optoelectronic devices, multi&#8208;dimension information encryption and chiral logic gate are developed based on the full&#8208;color tunable CPLA&#8208;active materials. The established strategy provides a universal platform for future development of CPLA&#8208;active materials with great applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized long afterglow (CPLA) attracts great interests in multi-disciplinary fields with significant potentials in optical multiplexing applications, but achieving full-color and white CPLA is still challenging. The present contribution reports the first success in utilizing circularly polarized phosphorescence energy transfer (CPP-ET) combined with chirality-selective absorption (CSA) to construct full-color and white CPLA materials. Blue CPLA with luminescence dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) of 3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is firstly obtained via the CSA effect of chiral helical polyacetylene and blue ultralong afterglow of inorganic phosphor BP. Significantly, full-color and white CPLA films are prepared by simply blending different fluorophores into the blue-CPLA films via CPP-ET. Benefited from the persistent luminescence of BP, the lifetimes of the fluorophores increase from nanoseconds to minutes, and ultralong full-color CPLA emissions lasting for more than 20&#8197;min are realized with &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Also noticeably, chiral optoelectronic devices, multi-dimension information encryption and chiral logic gate are developed based on the full-color tunable CPLA-active materials. The established strategy provides a universal platform for future development of CPLA-active materials with great applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Pendant Groups for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microenvironment near the catalytic sites in covalent organic frameworks is tuned with different pendant groups to improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The COF with electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) near the active site exhibited superior CO2RR activity and selectivity, compared with the COF with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way of converting CO2 into value&#8208;added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO2RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push&#8208;pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of &#8722;CH2NH2 can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO2RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Emissive B&#8211;N Lewis Pair&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes via Selective LUMO Extension in Conjugated Dimer and Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of B&#8211;N Lewis pair functionalized anthracene into a vinylene&#8208;linked dimer and polymer leads to selective extension of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), thus significantly lowering the band gap, shifting the emission into the near&#8208;infrared region, and modulating the self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward oxygen and release of singlet oxygen from the corresponding endoperoxides.







Abstract
Acenes are attractive as building blocks for low gap organic materials with applications, for example, in organic light emitting diodes, solar cells, bioimaging and diagnostics. Previously, we have shown that modification of dipyridylanthracene via B&#8211;N Lewis pair fusion (BDPA) strongly redshifts the emission, while facilitating self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward O2 to reversibly generate the corresponding endoperoxides. Herein, we report on the further expansion of the &#960;&#8208;system of BDPA to a vinyl&#8208;substituted monomer, vinylene&#8208;bridged dimer, and a polymer with an average of 20 chromophores. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation results in largely reduced band gaps of 1.8&#8197;eV for the dimer and 1.7&#8197;eV for the polymer, the latter giving rise to NIR emission with a maximum at 731&#8197;nm and an appreciable quantum yield of 7&#8201;%. Electrochemical and computational studies reveal efficient delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) along the pyridyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;pyridyl axis, which results in effective electronic communication between BDPA units, selectively lowers the LUMO, and ultimately narrows the band gap. Time&#8208;resolved emission and transient absorption (TA) measurements offer insights into the pertinent photophysical processes. Extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation also slows down the self&#8208;sensitized formation of endoperoxides, while significantly accelerating the thermal release of singlet oxygen to regenerate the parent acenes.

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;solution&#8211;processing&#8211;transformation&#8221; strategy with methanol scaffolds for fabricating high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes for gas separation is explored by Zixi Kang, Daofeng Sun et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407779). The methanol scaffolds contribute in two ways: vapor&#8208;activated monomer dissolution&#8211;precipitation equilibrium shifts, and hydrogen bonding&#8208;guided monomer rearrangement. As a result, these HOF membranes display improved hydrogen separation performance.

         <title>A Versatile Reversible, Degenerative Chain Transfer Mechanism for the Catalytic Living Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The typical termination procedure of a ROMP polymerization leaves with a methylene group at the polymer chain end. Here, we show that such end groups are capable of further reversible exchange between themselves when treated with catalytic amount of Grubbs catalysts under slow monomer addition condition. This newly discovered exchange mechanism uses inexpensive styrenes as the chain transfer agents for catalytic living ROMP to produce complex polymeric architectures.







Abstract
Most metathesis polymers based on norbornene derivatives carry a vinyl end group. Here we show that these vinyl end groups readily undergo a degenerative exchange of the terminal methylene unit in the presence of sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of a propagating metathesis polymer carrying a Grubbs ruthenium complex. We show that this degenerative exchange can be exploited in synthesizing ROMP polymers in a catalytic living fashion. Chain transfer agents based on styrene, or monosubstituted conjugated 1,3&#8197;diene derivatives are used as initiating sites for the catalytic living polymerization. Suitable derivatives of these chain transfer agents not only allow the linear living growth of polymers but also the synthesis of block copolymers from macro&#8208;initiators or star polymers from multi&#8208;functional chain transfer agents. This reversible exchange mechanism offers a cheaper, greener, and more sustainable alternative for the synthesis of living ROMP polymers compared to the classical synthetic route.

         <title>Modular and Diverse Synthesis of Acrylamides by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminocarbonylation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of acetylene towards important acrylamide derivatives is presented. The novel synthetic protocol shows high functional group&#8208;compatibility, high atom efficiency and good chemoselectivity to obtain a variety of bio&#8208;active compounds including several actual drugs.







Abstract
The development of all kinds of covalent drugs had a major impact on the improvement of the human health system. Covalent binding to target proteins is achieved by so&#8208;called electrophilic warheads, which are incorporated in the respective drug molecule. In the last decade, specifically acrylamides emerged as attractive warheads in covalent drug design. Herein, a straightforward palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of acetylene has been developed, allowing a modular and diverse synthesis of bio&#8208;active acrylamides. This general protocol features high atom efficiency, wide functional group compatibility, high chemoselectivity and proceeds additive free under mild reaction conditions. The synthetic utility of this protocol is showcased in the synthesis of ibrutinib, osimertinib, and other bio&#8208;active compound derivatives.

In the last decade, specifically acrylamides emerged as attractive warheads in covalent drug design. Herein, a straightforward palladium-catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of acetylene has been developed, allowing a modular and diverse synthesis of bio-active acrylamides. This general protocol features high atom efficiency, wide functional group compatibility, high chemoselectivity and proceeds additive free under mild reaction conditions. The synthetic utility of this protocol is showcased in the synthesis of ibrutinib, osimertinib, and other bio-active compound derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfacial Acidity Regulation Enhances Electrocatalytic Performances of Alcohol Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2&#8208;x Lewis acid component has been employed as a supporter to couple with active metal Au nanoparticles to accelerate the diffusion and enrichment of OH&#8722; toward the anode surface, which ensures the much enhanced electrochemical activity (current density of 693&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (81&#8201;%) for lactic acid production, so as to accelerate the electrocatalytic oxidation of other alcohols.







Abstract
The local acidity at the anode surface during electrolysis is apparently stronger than that in bulk electrolyte due to the deprotonation from the reactant, which leads to the deteriorated electrocatalytic performances and product distributions. Here, an anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial acidity regulation strategy has been proposed to inhibit local acidification at the surface of anode and enhance the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of anodic reactions. As a proof of the concept, CeO2&#8208;x Lewis acid component has been employed as a supporter to load Au nanoparticles to accelerate the diffusion and enrichment of OH&#8722; toward the anode surface, so as to accelerate the electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation reaction. As the result, Au/CeO2&#8208;x exhibits much enhanced lactic acid selectivity of 81&#8201;% and electrochemical activity of 693&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 current density in glycerol oxidation reaction compared to pure Au. Mechanism investigation reveals that the introduced Lewis acid promotes the mass transport and concentration of OH&#8722; on the anode surface, thus promoting the generation of lactic acid through the simultaneous enhancements of Faradaic and non&#8208;Faradaic processes. Attractively, the proposed strategy can be used for the electro&#8208;oxidation performance enhancements of a variety of alcohols, which thereby provides a new perspective for efficient alcohol electro&#8208;oxidations and the corresponding electrocatalyst design.

         <title>Tailored Supramolecular Interactions in Host&#8211;Guest Complexation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipole moment of crown ethers indicates their supramolecular interactions with perovskites. Higher dipole moments enhance coordination with lead cations, improving film morphology and optoelectronic properties. Optimized host&#8211;guest complexation led to perovskite solar modules reaching a 21.5&#8201;% efficiency over 14.0&#8197;cm2.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest complexation offers a promising approach for mitigating surface defects in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Crown ethers are the most widely used macrocyclic hosts for complexing perovskite surfaces, yet their supramolecular interactions and functional implications require further understanding. Here we show that the dipole moment of crown ethers serves as an indicator of supramolecular interactions with both perovskites and precursor salts. A larger dipole moment, achieved through the substitution of heteroatoms, correlates with enhanced coordination with lead cations. Perovskite films incorporating aza&#8208;crown ethers as additives exhibited improved morphology, reduced defect densities, and better energy&#8208;level alignment compared to those using native crown ethers. We report power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25&#8201;% for PSCs, which show enhanced long&#8208;term stability, and a record PCE of 21.5&#8201;% for host&#8211;guest complexation&#8208;based perovskite solar modules with an active area of 14.0&#8197;cm2.

         <title>Living Hybrid Exciton Materials: Enhanced Fluorescence and Chiroptical Properties in Living Supramolecular Polymers with Strong Frenkel/Charge&#8208;Transfer Exciton Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrically L/D&#8208;glutamate&#8208;derived PDIs having linear alkyl chains exhibit living supramolecular polymerization in thermodynamically stable chiral molecular orientation, which shows the coupling of Frenkel and charge transfer exciton states, resulting in significantly enhanced fluorescence quantum yield, CD and CPL properties. Meanwhile, PDIs with branched chains only show common H&#8208;aggregates. Thus, molecular control on living hybrid exciton nanomaterials is achieved.







Abstract
A family of chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) was newly developed as excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They are asymmetrically derivatized with a double&#8208;alkyl&#8208;chained L&#8208; or D&#8208;glutamate unit and a linear or branched alkyl chain. When water is added to the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of glutamate&#8208;PDI&#8208;linear&#8208;alkyl chain compounds, kinetically formed H&#8208;aggregates are formed in globular nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs undergo spontaneous transformation into thermodynamically stable nanotubes via helical nanostructures, which showed structured broad spectra originating from the strong coupling of delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge transfer excitations (CTE). Significant enhancement of circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence quantum yield, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) are observed during the transformation of NPs to the FE/CTE&#8208;coupled helical and tubular structures. This transformation process is significantly accelerated by applying physical stimuli, i.e., ultrasonication or adding helical aggregates as seed crystals, a feature unique to living supramolecular polymerization. Meanwhile, the branched chain&#8208;containing PDIs only form H&#8208;aggregates and did not show FE/CTE hybrid exciton states with living supramolecular polymerization properties. This study unveils that suitably designed chiral PDI derivatives show FE/CTE coupling accompanied by high fluorescence quantum yields, enhanced chiroptical properties, and supramolecular living polymerization characteristics.

         <title>Intrinsically Flexible Phase Change Fibers for Intelligent Thermal Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents intrinsically flexible solid&#8208;solid phase change fibers through wet&#8208;spinning for the first time. The fibers also exhibit excellent knittability, dyeability, recyclability, heat&#8208;induced shape recovery, washing resistance, and long&#8208;term thermal cycle stability. This intrinsically flexible phase change fiber has promising application prospects in wearable intelligent thermal management.







Abstract
Owing to the significant latent heat generated at constant temperatures, phase change fibers (PCFs) have recently received much attention in the field of wearable thermal management. However, the phase change materials involved in the existing PCFs still experience a solid&#8211;liquid transition process, severely restricting their practicality as wearable thermal management materials. Herein, we, for the first time, developed intrinsically flexible PCFs (polyethylene glycol/4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis(cyclohexyl isocyanate) fibers, PMFs) through polycondensation and wet&#8208;spinning process, exhibiting an inherent solid&#8208;solid phase transition property, adjustable phase transition behaviors, and outstanding knittability. The PMFs also present superior mechanical strength (28&#8197;MPa), washability (&gt;100 cycles), thermal cycling stability (&gt;2000 cycles), facile dyeability, and heat&#8208;induced recoverability, all of which are highly significant for practical wearable applications. Additionally, the PMFs can be easily recycled by directly dissolving them in solvents for reprocessing, revealing promising applications as sustainable materials for thermal management. Most importantly, the applicability of the PMFs was demonstrated by knitting them into permeable fabrics, which exhibit considerably improved thermal management performance compared with the cotton fabric. The PMFs offer great potential for intelligent thermal regulation in smart textiles and wearable electronics.

Quasi&#8208;1D chain antiferromagnets are considered a rich playground for investigating complex magnetic properties. We reported the synthesis, crystal structures, and magnetism of two novel copper&#8208;based 1D chain tellurates &#946;&#8208;PbCu2(TeO3)2Cl2 and PbCu2(TeO3)2Br2. The short&#8208; and long&#8208;range magnetic ordering is stabilized through the cooperative effect of 1D [CuO4]&#8734; Chains and [CuO2X2] quadrilateral in this quasi&#8208;1D spin&#8208;1/2 System.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;1D chain antiferromagnets with reduced structural dimensionality are a rich playground for investigating novel quantum phenomena. We report the synthesis, crystal structure, and magnetism of two novel quasi&#8208;1D antiferromagnets, &#946;&#8208;PbCu2(TeO3)2Cl2 (I) and PbCu2(TeO3)2Br2 (II).

         <title>Halogen Bond Unlocks Ultra&#8208;High Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The halogen aliovalent substitution of the Cl&#8722; anion with a I+ cation results in the formation of an [O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N] halogen bond, which then bridges &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups to form a novel halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular framework, INA. This crystal exhibits a record&#8208;high birefringence (&#916;nexp.=0.778@550&#8197;nm), making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance optical devices such as polarizers, isolators, and phase retarders.







Abstract
Anisotropy is crucial for birefringence (&#916;n) in optical materials, but optimizing it remains a formidable challenge (&#916;n &gt;0.3). Supramolecular frameworks incorporating &#960;&#8208;conjugated components are promising for achieving enhanced birefringence because of their structural diversity and inherent anisotropy. Herein, we first synthesized (C6H6NO2)+Cl&#8722; (NAC) and then constructed a halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular framework I+(C6H4NO2)&#8722; (INA) by halogen aliovalent substitution of Cl&#8722; with I+. The organic moieties are protonated and deprotonated nicotinic acid (NA), respectively. The antiparallel arrangement of birefringent&#8208;active units in NAC and INA leads to significant differences in the bonding characteristics between the interlayer and intralayer domains. Moreover, the [O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N] halogen bond in 1D [I+(C6H4NO2)&#8722;] chain exhibits stronger interactions and stricter directionality, resulting in a more pronounced in&#8208;plane anisotropy between the intrachain and interchain directions. Consequently, INA exhibits exceptional birefringent performance, with a value of 0.778 at 550&#8197;nm, twice that of NAC (0.363 at 550&#8197;nm). This value significantly exceeds those of commercial birefringent crystals, such as CaCO3 (0.172 at 546&#8197;nm), and is the highest reported value among ultraviolet birefringent crystals. This work presents a novel design strategy that employs halogen bonds as connection sites and modes for birefringent&#8208;active units, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;performance birefringent crystals.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectrics with Exceptional Conductivity by Polymer&#8208;Dopant Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Impressive n&#8208;type thermoelectric performances with a conductivity of 326&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor as high as 114&#8197;&#956;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 were realized through the approach of polymer&#8208;dopant matching, which involved blending two n&#8208;type polymers, f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN, with a julolidine functionalized benzimidazoline n&#8208;dopant (JLBI) in addition to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art TAM and N&#8208;DMBI dopants.







Abstract
Achieving high electrical conductivity (&#963;) and power factor (PF) simultaneously remains a significant challenge for n&#8208;type organic themoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, we demonstrate the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OTEs performance through blending a fused bithiophene imide dimer&#8208;based polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and its selenophene&#8208;substituted analogue f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN with a julolidine&#8208;functionalized benzimidazoline n&#8208;dopant JLBI, vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis when blended with commercially available n&#8208;dopants TAM and N&#8208;DMBI. The advantages of introducing a more lipophilic julolidine group into the dopant structure of JLBI are evidenced by the enhanced OTEs performance that JLBI&#8208;doped films show when compared to those doped with N&#8208;DMBI or TAM. In fact, thanks to the enhanced intermolecular interactions and the lower&#8208;lying LUMO level enabled by the increase of selenophene content in polymer backbone, JLBI&#8208;doped films of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN exhibit a unprecedent &#963; of 206&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a PF of 114&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. Interestingly, &#963; can be further enhanced up to 326&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 by using TAM dopant as a consequence of its favorable diffusion behavior into densely packed crystalline domains. These values are the highest to date for solution&#8208;processed molecularly n&#8208;doped polymers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the polymer&#8208;dopant matching approach carried out in this work.

         <title>A Soft, Fatigue&#8208;free, and Self&#8208;healable Ionic Elastomer via the Synergy of Skin&#8208;like Assembly and Bouligand Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of skin&#8208;like functional properties (softness, strain stiffening, self&#8208;healing, and stretchability) together with ultra&#8208;high fracture toughness and fatigue resistance are realized by fusing a unique structural&#8208;compositional design involving dermal binary assembly and Bouligand structure.







Abstract
Soft ionic elastomers that are self&#8208;healable, fatigue&#8208;free, and environment&#8208;tolerant are ideal structural and sensing materials for artificial prosthetics, soft electronics, and robotics to survive unpredictable service conditions. However, most synthetic strategies failed to unite rapid healing, fatigue resistance, and environmental robustness, limited by their singular compositional/structural designs. Here, we present a soft, tough, fatigue&#8208;resistant, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer (STFSI elastomer), which fuses skin&#8208;like binary assembly and Bouligand helicoidal structure into a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers and a supramolecular ionic biopolymer. The interlocked binary assembly enables skin&#8208;like softness, high stretchability, and strain&#8208;adaptive stiffening through a matrix&#8208;to&#8208;scaffold stress transfer. The Bouligand structure contributes to superhigh fracture toughness (101.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2) and fatigue resistance (4937&#8197;J&#8201;m&#8722;2) via mechanical toughening by interlayer slipping and twisted crack propagation path. Besides, the STFSI elastomer is self&#8208;healable through a &#8220;bridging&#8221; method and environment&#8208;tolerant (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, strong acid/alkali, saltwater). To demonstrate the versatile structural and sensing applications, we showcase a safety cushion with efficient damping and suppressed rebounding, and a robotic sensor with excellent fatigue crack tolerance and instant sensation recovery upon cutting&#8208;off damage. Our presented synthetic strategy is generalizable to other fiber&#8208;reinforced tough polymers for applications involving demanding mechanical/environmental conditions.

Here, we present a soft, tough, fatigue-resistant, and self-healable ionic elastomer (STFSI elastomer), which fuses skin-like binary assembly and Bouligand helicoidal structure into a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers and a supramolecular ionic biopolymer. The interlocked binary assembly enables skin-like softness, high stretchability, and strain-adaptive stiffening through a matrix-to-scaffold stress transfer. The Bouligand structure contributes to superhigh fracture toughness (101.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and fatigue resistance (4937&#8197;J&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) via mechanical toughening by interlayer slipping and twisted crack propagation path. Besides, the STFSI elastomer is self-healable through a &#8220;bridging&#8221; method and environment-tolerant (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, strong acid/alkali, saltwater). To demonstrate the versatile structural and sensing applications, we showcase a safety cushion with efficient damping and suppressed rebounding, and a robotic sensor with excellent fatigue crack tolerance and instant sensation recovery upon cutting-off damage. Our presented synthetic strategy is generalizable to other fiber-reinforced tough polymers for applications involving demanding mechanical/environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Induced Rh Monocoodination on Diphosphine Ligand Enables Catalytic Hydroformylation of Aliphatic Olefins at Room Temperature and Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Zr&#8208;MOF, constructed from a conventional chelated diphosphine ligand underwent post&#8208;modification to afford a monophosphine Rh catalyst, which display exceptionally high regioselectivity, reactivity and recyclability in hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins at room temperature and pressure. The structural transformation of the reactive Rh species within the framework during catalysis is elucidated through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8211;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr&#8208;MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh&#8208;MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1. Due to the framework&#8216;s capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8211;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Photo&#8208;Assisted Phase Switching of Antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;Ferroelectric Orders in an I3&#8208;&#8208;Intercalated 2D Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiferroelectric (AFE) has emerged as a promising branch of electroactive materials, due to their intriguing physical attributes stemming from the electric field&#8208;induced antipolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar phase transformation. However, the requirement of an extremely high electric field strength to switch adjacent sublattice polarization poses great challenges for exploiting molecular AFE system. Although photoirradiation is striking as a noncontact and nondestructive manipulation tool to optimize physical properties, the optical control of antiferroelectricity is still unexplored. Here, by adopting light&#8208;sensitive triiodide I3&#8208; anion into the 2D perovskite family, we have designed the first I3&#8208;&#8208;intercalated molecular AFE of (t&#8208;ACH)2EA2Pb3I10(I3)0.5&#183;((H3O)(H2O))0.5 (1, t&#8208;ACH = trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclohexanecarboxylate, EA = ethylammonium). The I3&#8208;&#8208;intercalating gives an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap of 1.65 eV with strong absorption. In terms of AFE structure, the&#160;anti&#8208;parallel alignment of electric dipoles results in a spontaneous polarization of 4.3 &#181;C/cm2. Strikingly,&#160;1&#160;merely shows AFE behaviour in the dark even under ultrahigh voltage, while the field&#8208;induced ferroelectric state can be facilely obtained upon visible illumination. Such&#160;unprecedented photo&#8208;assisted phase switching ascribes to the incorporation of photoactive I3&#8208; anions, which reduce the AFE&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric switching barrier for 1. This pioneering work on the photo&#8208;assisting transformation of ferroic orders paves a new way to develop future photoactive materials with significant potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A High Capacity p&#8208;Type Organic Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;type organic cathode materials typically exhibit high redox potentials and fast redox kinetics, presenting broad application prospects in aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs). However, most of the reported P&#8208;type organic cathode materials exhibit limited capacity (&lt; 100 mAh g&#8208;1), which is attributable to the low mass content ratio of oxidation&#8208;reduction active functional groups in these materials. Herein, we report a high&#8208;capacity p&#8208;type organic material, 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazatetracene (DHTAT), for aqueous zinc batteries. Both experiments and calculation indicate the charge storage of DHTAT involves the adsorption/ desorption of ClO4&#8208; on the &#8211;NH&#8211; group. Benefitting from the high mass content ratio of the &#8211;NH&#8211; group in DHATA molecule, the DHATA electrode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 224 mAh g&#8208;1 at a current density of 50 mA g&#8208;1 with a stable voltage of 1.2 V. Notably, after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g&#8208;1, DHTAT retains 73% of its initial capacity, showing a promising cycling stability. In addition, DHTAT also has good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8208;40 &#176;C for 4000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extension of Multiple Resonance Core: Double Helical and Heptagon Embedded Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) boron&#8211;nitrogen doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) showed compelling thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), surpassing those of their hydrocarbon analogs. However, the structural variety of &#960;&#8208;extended BN&#8208;PAHs remains narrow. In this study, we synthesized three double helical BN&#8208;doped nanographenes (BN&#8208;NGs), 2a&#8211;2c, via the &#960;&#8208;extension of the MR core. During the formation of 2a, a nanographene with one heptagon (1a) was obtained, whereas subsequent dehydrocyclization of the [6]helicene units within 2b&#8211;2c led to heptagon structures, yielding other two BN&#8208;NGs containing double heptagons (1b&#8211;1c). These BN&#8208;NGs (2a&#8211;2c and 1a&#8211;1c) showed pronounced redshifts of 100&#8211;190 nm compared to the parent MR core while preserving the TADF characteristics and prolonging the delayed fluorescence lifetime to the millisecond level. Furthermore, the integration of heptagon ring into 1a&#8211;1c expanded the conjugation, reduced the oxidation potentials, and yielded a more flexible framework compared to those of 2a&#8211;2c. The enantiomers of 2a&#8211;2c, 1a, and 1c were resolved and their chiroptical properties were studied. Notably, 1a and 1c exhibited the increased chiroptical dissymmetry factors.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Anisotropic Memristive Behavior of Borophene Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neuromorphic computing, marked by its parallel computational abilities and low power usage, has become pivotal in advancing artificial intelligence. However, the advancement of neuromorphic computing has faced significant obstacles due to the performance limitations of traditional memory devices struggling with high power consumption and limited reliability. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively investigated as high&#8208;performance memristive materials, but they are often restricted by fixed memristive properties, which complicate circuit design and limit flexibility. Here, we report that multilayer borophene nanosheets represent a breakthrough material, displaying anisotropic variable memristive properties. The nanosheets, comprising semiconductor &#945;&#8217;&#8208;4H&#8208;borophene sheets and metal &#946;12&#8208;borophene sheets, have been synthesized on aluminum foil surface through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The multilayer borophene nanosheets exhibit volatile memory behavior in the vertical direction and non&#8208;volatile memory behavior in the planar direction. This innovative class of 2D nanosheets not only overcomes the limitations of conventional memory devices but also expands the potential applications of borophene&#8208;based memories in information storage and in&#8208;memory computing.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Disialyllacto&#8208;N&#8208;Tetraose (DSLNT) and Related Human Milk Oligosaccharides Reveals Broad Siglec Recognition to the Atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialic acids (Sias) are ubiquitously expressed on all types of glycans, typically as terminating residues. They usually link to galactose, N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine, or other Sia residues, forming ligands of many glycan&#8208;binding proteins. An atypical linkage to the C6 of N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) has been identified in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs, e.g., DSLNT) and tumor&#8208;associated glycoconjugates. Herein, we achieved the systematic synthesis of these HMOs in an enzymatic modular manner. The synthetic strategy relies on a novel activity of ST6GalNAc6 for efficient construction of the Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc linkage, and another 12 specific enzyme modules for sequential HMO assembly. The structures enabled comprehensive exploration into their structure&#8208;function relationships using glycan microarray, revealing broad yet distinct recognitions by Siglecs to the atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc motif. The work provides tools and new insights for functional study and potential applications of Siglecs and HMOs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide Allows Bioorthogonal Coupling of Type&#8208;I AIEgens for Pyroptosis&#8208;Induced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enrichment of photosensitizers (PSs) on cancer cell membranes via bioorthogonal reactions is considered to be a very promising therapeutic modality. However, azide&#8208;modified sugars&#8208;based metabolic labeling processes usually lack targeting and the labeling speed is relatively slow. Moreover, it has been rarely reported that membrane&#8208;anchoring pure type&#8208;I PSs can induce cancer cell pyroptosis. Here, we report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholecystokinin&#8208;2 receptor (CCK2R) dual&#8208;targeting peptide named DBCO&#8208;pYCCK6, which can selectively and rapidly self&#8208;assemble on cancer cell membrane, and then bioorthogonal enrich type&#8208;I aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) PSs (SAIE&#8208;N3) on the cell membrane. Upon light irradiation, the membrane&#8208;anchoring SAIE&#8208;N3 could effectively generate type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the bioorthogonal combination strategy of peptide and AIEgen PSs could significantly inhibit tumor growth, which is accompanied by CD8+ cytotoxic T cell infiltration. This work provides a novel self&#8208;assembly peptide&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reaction strategy to bridge the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and AIE field through strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and elucidates that pure type&#8208;I membrane&#8208;anchoring PSs can be used for cancer therapy via GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hemilabile and Redox&#8208;Active Quinone Ligands Unlock sp3&#8208;Rich Couplings in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Carbosulfenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component coupling approach toward structurally complex dialkylsulfides is described via the nickel&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation of unactivated alkenes with organoboron nucleophiles and alkylsulfenamide (N&#8211;S) electrophiles. Efficient catalytic turnover is facilitated using a tailored N&#8211;S electrophile containing an N&#8208;methyl methanesulfonamide leaving group, allowing catalyst loadings as low as 1 mol%. Regioselectivity is controlled by a collection of monodentate, weakly coordinating native directing groups, including sulfonamides, amides, sulfinamides, phosphoramides, and carbamates. Key to the development of this transformation is the identification of quinones as a family of hemilabile and redox&#8208;active ligands that tune the steric and electron properties of the metal throughout the catalytic cycle. DFT calculations show that the duroquinone (DQ) ligand adopts different coordination modes in different stages of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation&#8212;binding as an &#951;6 capping ligand to stabilize the precatalyst/resting state and prevent catalyst decomposition, binding as an X&#8208;type redox&#8208;active durosemiquinone radical anion to promote alkene migratory insertion with a less distorted square planar Ni(II) center, while binding as an &#951;1 L&#8208;type ligand to promote N&#8211;S oxidative addition at a relatively more electron&#8208;rich and sterically less crowded Ni(I) center.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hysteresis of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich Cathodes via Gradient Penetration of Nonmagnetic Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are considered a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high capacity. However, they still suffer from the practical challenges of low discharge capacity and poor rate capability due to the hysteresis of Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Herein, based on the regulation of the lattice magnetic frustration, the Li/Ni intermixing defects as the primary origin of kinetic hysteresis are radically addressed via the doping of the nonmagnetic Si element. Meanwhile, by adopting gradient penetration doping, a robust Si&#8208;O surface structure with reversible lattice oxygen evolution and low lattice strain is constructed on Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes to suppress the formation of&#160;surface dense&#160; barrier layer. With the remarkably enhanced Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics in atomic and electrode particle scales, the as&#8208;obtained cathodes (LiNixMn1&#8208;xSi0.01O2, 0.6 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.9) achieve superior performance in discharge capacity, rate capability, and durability. This work highlights the coupling effect of magnetic structure and interfacial chemicals on Li&#8208;ion transport properties, and the concept will inspire more researchers to conduct an intensive study.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Synthesis of Acetic Acid from Hydroxyl&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of Methane at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct methane conversion and, in particular, the aerobic oxidation to acetic acid, remain an eminent challenge. Here, we reported&#160;a&#160;zeolite&#8208;supported Au&#8208;Fe catalyst (Au&#8208;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5)&#160;that converted&#160;methane to acetic acid with molecular oxygen as an oxidant in the presence of CO. Specifically, Au nanoparticles catalyzed&#160;the formation of hydroxyl species from the reaction&#160;of&#160;CO, O2, and H2O, meanwhile ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;supported atomically dispersed Fe species were responsible for the hydroxyl&#8208;mediated coupling of CH4&#160;and CO to generate&#160;acetic acid.&#160;The reaction over 50&#160;mg of Au&#8208;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#160;under 62 bar (CH4:&#160;CO:&#160;O2&#160;= 14:&#160;14:&#160;3)&#160;at 120 &#176;C for 3.0 h&#160;yielded 5.7&#160;millimoles of acetic acid per gram of the catalyst (mmol&#160;gcat&#8208;1) with the selectivity of 92%, outperformed most of reported catalysts. Significantly, the catalyst remained active even at 60 &#176;C. We anticipate that this hydroxyl&#8208;mediated route may guide the design of optimized catalysts for the direct methane functionalization&#160;at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Enantioconvergent Reductive Couplings of Racemic Allenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;based enantioconvergent reactions have become a powerful strategy to synthesize enantiopure compounds from racemic starting materials. However, existing methods primarily address precursors with central chirality, neglecting those with axial chirality. Herein, we describe the enantioconvergent reductive coupling of racemic allenes with aldehydes, facilitated by a photoredox, chromium, and cobalt triple catalysis system. This method selectively affords one product from sixteen possible regio&#8208; and stereoisomers. The protocol leverages CoIII&#8208;H mediated hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and Cr&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;polar crossover for efficient stereoablation of axial chirality and asymmetric addition, respectively. Supported by mechanistic insights from control experiments, deuterium labeling, and DFT calculations, our approach offers synthetic chemists a valuable tool for creating enantioenriched chiral homoallylic alcohols, promising to advance radical&#8208;based strategies for synthesizing complex chiral molecules.</dc:description>

The protocol leverages CoIII-H mediated hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and Cr-catalyzed radical-polar crossover for efficient stereoablation of axial chirality and asymmetric addition, respectively. Supported by mechanistic insights from control experiments, deuterium labeling, and DFT calculations, our approach offers synthetic chemists a valuable tool for creating enantioenriched chiral homoallylic alcohols, promising to advance radical-based strategies for synthesizing complex chiral molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Helicates as Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) Substrates with High Tailorability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of novel functionalized supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) can enable new applications in domains that include purification and sensing. In this study, employing a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy, we designed and prepared a series of benzochalcogenodiazole&#8208;based metallohelicates as high&#8208;efficiency charge transfer surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, expanding the range of applications for these metallohelicates. Through structural modifications, including the substitution of single heteroatoms on ligands, replacement of coordinating metals, and alteration of ligand framework linkages, the Raman performance of these metallohelicates as substrates were systematically optimized. Notably, the SERS enhancement factors (EFs) of the metallohelicate&#8208;based SERS substrates were significantly enhanced to levels as high as 1.03 &#215; 107, which rivals the EFs of noble metals devoid of "hot spots". Additionally, the underlying Raman enhancement mechanisms of these metallohelicates have been investigated through a combination of control experiments and theoretical calculations. This study not only demonstrates the utility of metallohelicates as SERS substrates but also offers insights and materials for the development of high&#8208;efficiency new charge transfer SERS substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesostructure&#8208;Specific Configuration of *CO Adsorption for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols produced by electrochemical CO2 reduction, such as ethanol and n&#8208;propanol, are considered as indispensable liquid energy carriers. In most C&#8211;C coupling cases, however, the concomitant gaseous C2H4 product results in the low selectivity of C2+ alcohols. Here, we report rational construction of mesostructured CuO electrocatalysts, specifically mesoporous CuO (m&#8208;CuO) and cylindrical CuO (c&#8208;CuO), enables selective distribution of C2+ products. The m&#8208;CuO and c&#8208;CuO showed similar selectivity towards total C2+ products (&#8805;76%), but the corresponding predominant products were C2+ alcohols (55%) and C2H4 (52%), respectively. The ordered mesostructure not only induced the surface hydrophobicity, but selectively tailored the adsorption configuration of *CO intermediate: m&#8208;CuO preferred bridged adsorption, whereas c&#8208;CuO favored top adsorption as revealed by in situ spectroscopies. Computational calculations unraveled that bridged *CO adsorbate is prone to deep protonation into *OCH3 intermediate, thus accelerating the coupling of *CO and *OCH3 intermediates to generate C2+ alcohols; by contrast, top *CO adsorbate is apt to undergo the favorable conventional C&#8211;C coupling process to produce C2H4. This work illustrates selective C2+ products distribution via mesostructure manipulation, and paves new path into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with tunable adsorption configuration of key intermediates for targeted products.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Modulation for Selective Mechanochemical Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a mechanochemical Fe&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of olefins with a sustainable and benign procedure holds significant promise for industrial applications. However, navigating the intricate interactions inherent in ball&#8208;milling conditions to fine&#8208;tune reaction selectivity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, leveraging the dispersive and/or trapping properties of cyclodextrins, an innovative mechanochemical approach is developed through the integration of cyclodextrins into a Fe&#8208;catalyzed system, enabling a streamlined Wacker oxidation process from simple and/or commercially available alkenes. Our efforts have yielded optimized mechanochemical conditions demonstrating exceptional reactivity and selectivity in generating a diverse array of ketone products, markedly enhancing catalytic efficiency compared to conventional batch methods. Mechanistic investigations have revealed a predominantly Markovnikov&#8208;selective catalytic cycle, effectively minimizing undesired alcohol formation, hydrogenation, and the other competing pathways, boosting both reaction yield and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Supramolecular Deep Eutectic Electrolyte Enhancing Interfacial Stability and Solution Phase Discharge in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) have gained widespread recognition for their exceptional energy densities. However, a major challenge faced by LOBs is the lack of appropriate electrolytes that can effectively balance reactant transport, interfacial compatibility, and non&#8208;volatility. To address this issue, a novel supramolecular deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) has been developed, based on synergistic interaction between Li&#8208;bonds and H&#8208;bonds through a combination of lithium salt (LiTFSI), acetamide (Ace) and boric acid (BA). The incorporation of BA serves as an interface modification additive, acting as both Li&#8208;bonds acceptor and H&#8208;bonds donor/acceptor, thereby enhancing the redox stability of the electrolyte, facilitating a solution phase discharge process and improving compatibility with the Li anode. Our proposed DEE demonstrates a high oxidation voltage of 4.5 V, an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 15225 mAh g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance of 196 cycles in LOBs. Additionally, the intrinsic non&#8208;flammability and successful operation of a Li&#8208;O2 pouch cell indicate promising practical applications of this electrolyte. This research broadens the design possibilities for LOBs electrolytes and provides theoretical insights for future studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning Algorithm Guides Catalyst Choices for Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carefully curated dataset of reactions catalyzed by magnesium&#8208;based catalysts underlies a Machine&#8208;Learning model guiding the choices of catalysts &#8220;optimal&#8221; for reactions unseen during training. When this model is tested by experiment, it suggests catalysts that yield higher ee values, replace rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal catalysts, or improve the efficiency of stereoselective transformations relevant to drug discovery.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;chemical literature encompasses large numbers of catalysts and reactions they can effect. Many of these examples are published merely to document the catalysts&#8217; scope but do not necessarily guarantee that a given catalyst is &#8220;optimal&#8221;&#8212;in terms of yield or enantiomeric excess&#8212;for a particular reaction. This paper describes a Machine Learning model that aims to improve such catalyst&#8208;reaction assignments based on the carefully curated literature data. As we show here for the case of asymmetric magnesium catalysis, this model achieves relatively high accuracy and offers out of&#8208;the&#8208;box predictions successfully validated by experiment, e.g., in synthetically demanding asymmetric reductions or Michael additions.

         <title>CdS Quantum Dot Gels as a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalyst for C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdS quantum dot gels are potent direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalysts for C&#8722;H bond activation, in which photoexcited CdS directly attracts a hydrogen atom from a C&#8722;H substrate to generate a neutral radical.







Abstract
Here, we report CdS quantum dot (QD) gels, a three&#8208;dimensional network of interconnected CdS QDs, as a new type of direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalyst for C&#8722;H activation. We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;&#8208;amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds. Its C&#8722;H activation ability imparts a broad substrate and reaction scope. The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8722;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d&#8208;HAT mechanism. This d&#8208;HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8722;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &#945;=0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Inducing Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death through Oxygen&#8208;Economized Photodynamic Therapy with Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two NO&#8208;releasing phthalocyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers have been prepared which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration through the NO released upon the interaction with the intracellular glutathione, sparing more oxygen for the photodynamic action. This oxygen&#8208;economized photodynamic therapy can also elicit the release of various damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, effectively triggering immunogenic cell death.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) for eradication of cancer cells. Its effectiveness is governed by the oxygen content, which is scarce in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We report herein two zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing moieties, namely ZnPc&#8208;2NO and ZnPc&#8208;4NO, which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration, thereby sparing more intracellular oxygen for PDT. Using HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and A549 human lung carcinoma cells, we have demonstrated that both conjugates release NO upon interaction with the intracellular glutathione, which can reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate and adenosine triphosphate generation and alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. They can also relieve the hypoxic status of cancer cells and decrease the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor protein HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Upon light irradiation, both conjugates can generate ROS and induce cytotoxicity even under a hypoxic condition, overcoming the oxygen&#8208;dependent nature of PDT. Interestingly, the photodynamic action of ZnPc&#8208;2NO elicits the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, inducing the maturation of dendritic cells and triggering an antitumor immune response. The immunogenic cell death caused by this oxygen&#8208;economized PDT has been demonstrated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.

A D&#8211;A type selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide derivative (SePDI3) is developed as CIM for OSCs. SePDI3 shows simultaneous superior charge transport and extraction capacity. Finally, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displayed a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy in the development of high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.







Abstract
The cathode interlayer is crucial for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), but the research on simple and efficient interlayer materials is lagging behind. Here, a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) typed selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) derivative (SePDI3) is developed as cathode interlayer material (CIM) for OSCs, and a non&#8208;fused PDI derivative (PDI3) is used as the control CIM for comparison. Compared to PDI3, SePDI3 shows a stronger self&#8208;doping effect and better crystallinity, resulting in better charge transport ability. Furthermore, the interaction between SePDI3 and L8&#8208;BO can form an efficient extraction channel, leading to superior charge extraction behavior. Finally, benefitting from significantly enhanced charge transport and extraction capacity, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displays a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO active layer, which is one of the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs based novel CIMs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy to develop high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Spinel Octahedral Sites via a &#960;&#8211;&#960; Type Orbital Coupling to Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in Co3O4 can be fine&#8208;regulated by a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling involving the CoOh t2g, O 2p, and Ce t2u orbital. Mechanism investigations reveal that&#160;a &#960;&#8208;donation interaction between the bridging O 2p and Ce fyz2 orbital effectively bolsters the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. The obtained electrocatalyst with the eg occupancy optimized to 1.094 presents an excellent water oxidation performance.







Abstract
Spin state is often regarded as the crucial valve to release the reactivity of energy&#8208;related catalysts, yet it is also challenging to precisely manipulate, especially for the active center ions occupied at the specific geometric sites. Herein, a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling of 3d (Co)&#8208;2p (O)&#8208;4f (Ce) was employed to regulate the spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in the composite of Co3O4/CeO2. More specifically, the equivalent high&#8208;spin ratio of CoOh can reach to 54.7&#8201;% via tuning the CeO2 content, thereby triggering the average eg filling (1.094) close to the theoretical optimum value. The corresponding catalyst exhibits a superior water oxidation performance with an overpotential of 251&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, rivaling most cobalt&#8208;based oxides state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; type coupling corroborated by the matched energy levels between Ce t1u/t2u&#8208;O and CoOh t2g&#8208;O &#960; type bond in the calculated crystal orbital Hamilton population and partial density of states profiles, stimulates a &#960;&#8208;donation between O 2p and &#960;&#8208;symmetric Ce 4fyz2 orbital, consequently facilitating the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. This work offers an in&#8208;depth insight into understanding the 4f and 3d orbital coupling for spin state optimization in composite oxides.

         <title>A Fragment&#8208;Based Competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR Platform For Hotspot&#8208;Directed Ligand Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fragment screening identified three ligand binding hotspots across the active site of 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from Mycobacterium abscessus. Fragment sized fluorinated reporters were developed for each hotspot and used in competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR experiments to quantify hotspot&#8208;specific ligand binding affinities across three orders of magnitude, from low mM to low &#956;M.







Abstract
Ligand binding hotspots are regions of protein surfaces that form particularly favourable interactions with small molecule pharmacophores. Targeting interactions with these hotspots maximises the efficiency of ligand binding. Existing methods are capable of identifying hotspots but often lack assays to quantify ligand binding and direct elaboration at these sites. Herein, we describe a fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F Ligand Based&#8197;NMR (LB&#8208;NMR) screening platform that enables routine, quantitative ligand profiling focused at ligand&#8208;binding hotspots. As a proof of concept, the method was applied to 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) from Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs). X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterisation of the hits from a 960&#8208;member fragment screen identified three ligand&#8208;binding hotspots across the PPAT active site. From the fragment hits a collection of 19F reporter candidates were designed and synthesised. By rigorous prioritisation and use of optimisation workflows, a single 19F reporter molecule was generated for each hotspot. Profiling the binding of a set of structurally characterised ligands by competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR with this suite of 19F reporters recapitulated the binding affinity and site ID assignments made by ITC and X&#8208;ray crystallography. This quantitative mapping of ligand binding events at hotspot level resolution establishes the utility of the fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR screening platform for hotspot&#8208;directed ligand profiling

         <title>The Dependence of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Crystal Facet of Current Collector in Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of Cu facets on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Li deposition behavior are demonstrated using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The strong adsorption of Cu(100) facet to anions guides more anions to participate in the inner Helmholtz plane and promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foil with a single [100] orientation display outstanding performance.







Abstract
The continuous electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have largely hindered the development of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the facet of current collector can regulate the composition of SEI and the subsequent Li deposition behavior using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the (100) facet of Cu possesses strong adsorption to anions, guiding more anions to participate preferentially in the inner Helmholtz plane and further promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foils with a single [100] orientation (s&#8208;Cu(100)) achieve the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition with enhanced Li plating/stripping reversibility. Moreover, the Li anode deposited on s&#8208;Cu(100) can stabilize the operation of an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (350&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with a low negative/positive capacity ratio (~2) and lean electrolyte (2.4&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1) for 150&#8197;cycles. Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of electrolytes employed different anions. This work provides new insights into the correlation between the SEI and current collector, opening a universal avenue towards high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

         <title>Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Autoantibodies in the Sera of Pancreatic Cancer Patients Using Engineered MUC1 Glycopeptide Nanoparticle Probes</title>

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. We describe the development of a diagnostic assay based on the detection of tumor&#8208;associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) in the sera using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. The best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers.







Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic approaches to identify the disease as early as possible. We have developed a diagnostic assay for pancreatic cancer based on the detection of naturally occurring tumor associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. We used a structure&#8208;guided approach to develop unnatural glycopeptides as model antigens for tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. We designed a collection of 13 glycopeptides to bind either SM3 or 5E5, two monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes known to recognize tumor associated MUC1. Glycopeptide binding to SM3 or 5E5 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These model antigens were conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in a dot&#8208;blot assay to detect autoantibodies in serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Nanoparticle probes with glycopeptides displaying the SM3 epitope did not have diagnostic potential. Instead, nanoparticle probes displaying glycopeptides with high affinity for 5E5 could discriminate between cancer patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19&#8208;9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

         <title>Electron Transfer Enhanced by a Minimal Energetic Driving Force at the Organic&#8208;Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transfer from the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state to the first triplet excited state (T1) are investigated in upconversion organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with 45 different material combinations. According to our analysis based on the semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory, CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV) and is expressed by a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV.







Abstract
The energetic driving force for electron transfer must be minimized to realize efficient optoelectronic devices including organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Exploring the dynamics of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state at an interface leads to a comprehension of the relationship between energetics, electron&#8208;transfer efficiency, and device performance. Here, we investigate the electron transfer from the CT state to the triplet excited state (T1) in upconversion OLEDs with 45 material combinations. By analyzing the CT emission and the singlet excited&#8208;state emission from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation via the dark T1, their energetics and electron&#8208;transfer efficiencies are extracted. We demonstrate that the CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by the stronger CT interaction and a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV), which is explained using the Marcus theory with a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV. Through our analysis, a novel donor&#8211;acceptor combination for the OLED is developed and shows an efficient blue emission with an extremely low turn&#8208;on voltage of 1.57&#8197;V. This work provides a solution to control interfacial CT states for efficient optoelectronic devices without energy loss.

         <title>Highly Fluorinated Nanospace in Porous Organic Salts with High Water Stability/Capability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully constructed uniform highly fluorinated nanospaces without impurities such as metals. This highly hydrophobic nanospace exhibits high water stability, and is the first all&#8208;organic hydrophobic nanospace where water molecules can enter. Furthermore, this nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity of 1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH.







Abstract
Water in hydrophobic nanospaces shows specific dynamic properties different from bulk water. The investigation of these properties is important in various research fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology. The elucidation of the correlation between properties of water and hydrophobic nanospaces requires nanospaces covered only with simple hydrophobic group (e.g., fluorine) without impurities such as metals. This work successfully fabricated all&#8208;organic diamondoid porous organic salts (d&#8208;POSs) with highly fluorinated nanospaces, wherein hydrophobic fluorine atoms are densely exposed on the void surfaces, by combining fluorine substituted triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) derivatives with tetrahedral tetrasulfonic acid. This d&#8208;POSs with a highly fluorinated nanospace significantly improved their water stability, retaining their crystal structure even when immersed in water over one week. Moreover, this highly hydrophobic and fluorinated nanospace adsorbs 160&#8197;mL(STP)/g of water vapor at Pe/P0=0.90; this is the first hydrophobic nanospace, which water molecules can enter, in an all&#8208;organic porous material. Furthermore, this highly fluorinated nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm) at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH. POSs with tailorable nanospaces may significantly advance the elucidation of the properties of specific &#8220;water&#8221; in pure hydrophobic environments.

         <title>Fabrication of Azacrown Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cathode Performance in Aqueous Ni&#8722;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical linker derived from azacrown ether, utilized in COF synthesis via reticular synthesis. The embedded crown ether moieties and imine linkages faciltate Ni2+ ions immobilization via post&#8208;modification. The resulting composite COF materials exhibit high nickel loading capacity, maintaining porosity and crystallinity, demonstrate promise as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries, offering high discharge capacity and exceptional cycling stability.







Abstract
Crown ethers (CEs), known for their exceptional host&#8211;guest complexation, offer potential as linkers in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for enhanced performance in catalysis and host&#8211;guest binding. However, their highly flexible conformation and low symmetry limit the diversity of CE&#8208;derived COFs. Here, we introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown&#8208;6 (TPy18C6), for COF fabrication (ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni2+ ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni2+&#8208;doped COFs (Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 8&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and exceptional cycling stability (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic&#8208;synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Local Electric Field Induced by Dual Heteroatoms on Copper Boosts Efficient CO2 Reduction Over Ultrawide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver and tin heteroatoms are injected into the nano&#8208;porous copper to construct an asymmetric local electric field, thereby realizing excellent selectivity up to a nearly 100&#8201;% Faraday efficiency for CO over ultrawide potential window, a superior CO local current density of 340&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and high energy efficiency of 90&#8201;% for CO production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity provides an elegant route for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and feedstocks, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. Herein, Ag and Sn heteroatoms were simultaneously introduced into nanoporous Cu (np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu) mainly in the form of an asymmetric local electric field for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. The designed np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90&#8201;% energy efficiency and a 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (&#916;E=1.4&#8197;V), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Au and Ag&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO2 molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR.

         <title>Pendant Proton&#8208;Relays Systematically Tune the Rate and Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Ammonia Generation in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Installation of secondary sphere proton relaying functionalities within an iron&#8208;porphyrin based MOF, enables systematic adjustment of heterogeneous electrocatalytic nitrite reduction performance in aqueous solution. Thus, high rates of NH3 production at more than 90&#8201;% faradaic efficiency were obtained.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction (eNO2RR) is a promising alternative route to produce ammonia (NH3). Until now, several molecular catalysts have shown capability to homogeneously reduce nitrite to NH3, while taking advantage of added secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities to direct catalytic performance. Yet, realizing such control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that heterogenization of a Fe&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst within a 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), allows efficient eNO2RR to NH3. On top of that, installation of pendant proton relaying moieties proximal to the catalytic site, resulted in significant improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity. Notably, systematic manipulation of NH3 faradaic efficiency (up to 90&#8201;%) and partial current (5&#8208;fold increase) was achieved by varying the proton relay&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst molar ratio. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis show that the proton relays simultaneously aid in generating and stabilizing of reactive Fe&#8208;bound NO intermediate. Thus, this concept offers new molecular tools to tune heterogeneous electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Selective Cleavage of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 Bond for Lignin Depolymerization via Paired&#8208;Electrolysis in an Undivided Cell</title>

         <dc:description>
For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the lignin (models) depolymerization and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in a selective and energy&#8208;effective manner.







Abstract
The cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds is one of the most promising strategies for lignin&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, current catalytic system capable of selectively breaking C&#8722;O bonds in lignin often requires a precious metal catalyst and/or harsh conditions such as high&#8208;pressure H2 and elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a novel protocol of paired electrolysis to effectively cleave the C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 bond of lignin model compounds and real lignin at room temperature and ambient pressure. For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in an energy&#8208;effective manner. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, remarkable yield with excellent chemoselectivity, and feasibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that indirect H* (chemical absorbed hydrogen) reduction instead of direct electron transfer might be the pathway for the cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Stability of Mg Metal Anodes: High&#8208;Exposure (002) Facets and Nanosheet Arrays for Superior Mg Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mg foil, featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and nanosheet arrays architecture, is fabricated via a selective etching strategy. The facet property encourages smooth nucleation and dense deposition, while the distinctive morphology ensures uniform electric field and Mg ion flux distributions. As a result, an improved Mg plating/stripping reversibility and extended cycle stability is achieved.







Abstract
Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs), recognized as promising contenders for post&#8208;lithium battery technologies, face challenges such as uneven magnesium (Mg) plating and stripping behaviors, leading to uncontrollable dendrite growth and irreversible structural damage. Herein, we have developed a Mg foil featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and an architecture of nanosheet arrays (termed (002)&#8208;Mg), created through a one&#8208;step acid etching method. Specifically, the prominent exposure of Mg (002) facets, known for their inherently low surface and adsorption energies with Mg atoms, not only facilitates smooth nucleation and dense deposition but also significantly mitigates side reactions on the Mg anode. Moreover, the nanosheet arrays on the surface evenly distribute the electric field and Mg ion flux, enhancing Mg ion transfer kinetics. As a result, the fabricated (002)&#8208;Mg electrodes exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;cycle performance, lasting over 6000&#8197;h (&gt;8 months) at a current density of 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for a capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells equipped with various electrolytes and cathodes demonstrate remarkable capacity and cycling stability, highlighting the superior electrochemical compatibility of the (002)&#8208;Mg electrode. This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.

         <title>Modularization of Immobilized Multienzyme Cascades for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;enzyme cascade has been developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective C&#8722;H amination of aromatic alkanes by constructing two immobilized bienzymatic modules and integrating them in tandem packed&#8208;bed reactors. The resulting flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multienzyme cascades (MECs) have gained much attention in synthetic chemistry but remain far from being a reliable synthetic tool. Here we report a four&#8208;enzyme cascade comprising a cofactor&#8208;independent and a cofactor self&#8208;sustaining bienzymatic modules for the enantioselective benzylic C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes, a challenging transformation from bulk chemicals to high value&#8208;added chiral amines. The two modules were subsequently optimized by enzyme co&#8208;immobilization with microenvironmental tuning, and finally integrated in a gas&#8208;liquid segmented flow system, resulting in simultaneous improvements in enzyme performance, mass transfer, system compatibility, and productivity. The flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is a 90&#8208;fold increase over the highest value previously reported.

         <title>Development of Iron&#8208;Based Single Atom Materials for General and Efficient Synthesis of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;based single atoms (Fe&#8208;SACs) as reductive amination catalysts have been prepared by the pyrolysis of Fe&#8208;nitrogen complexes on SiO2 and subsequent removal of silica. Applying these Fe&#8208;SACs, all kinds of amines including N&#8208;methylated products, amino acid esters, amino acid amides and selected drug molecules are synthesized starting from inexpensive and easily accessible carbonyl compounds and ammonia or amines in presence of molecular hydrogen.







Abstract
Earth abundant metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with highly active and at the same time stable isolated metal sites constitute a key factor for the advancement of sustainable and cost&#8208;effective chemical synthesis. In particular, the development of more practical, and durable iron&#8208;based materials is of central interest for organic synthesis, especially for the preparation of chemical products related to life science applications. Here, we report the preparation of Fe&#8208;single atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) entrapped in N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon support with unprecedented potential in the preparation of different kinds of amines, which represent privileged class of organic compounds and find increasing application in daily life. The optimal Fe&#8208;SACs allow for the reductive amination of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with ammonia and amines to produce diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amines including N&#8208;methylated products as well as drugs, agrochemicals, and other biomolecules (amino acid esters and amides) utilizing green hydrogen.

         <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Li7P3S7.5O3.5 with Low Density and Excellent Anode Compatibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>

The solid electrolyte showing the combination of strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density, and anode compatibility is indispensable for the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries, but none of the previously reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets this requirement. Here, a solid electrolyte, Li7P3S7.5O3.5, is discovered, and it displays all these three characteristics simultaneously.







Abstract
The commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs) demands solid electrolytes with strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density (for enabling satisfactory energy densities), and decent anode compatibility (the need for cathode compatibility can be circumvented by the cathode coating techniques that are widely applied in sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs). However, none of the reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets these requirements simultaneously. Here, we design a Li7P3S7.5O3.5 (LPSO) solid electrolyte, which shows a combination of all the aforementioned characteristics. The synthesis of this material does not need the expensive Li2S, so the raw materials cost is only $14.42/kg, which, unlike most solid electrolytes, lies below the $50/kg threshold for commercialization. The density of LPSO is 1.70&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3, considerably lower than those of the oxide (typically above 5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and chloride (around 2.5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) solid electrolytes. Besides, LPSO also shows excellent anode compatibility. The Li|LPSO|Li cell cycles stably with a potential of ~50&#8197;mV under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 4200&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell with the Si anode shows a capacity retention of 89.29&#8201;% after 200 cycles under 88.6&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Nonaqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>

A tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as high voltage, high energy density, and stable catholyte for nonaqueous redox flow battery.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with high energy densities are essential for efficient and sustainable long&#8208;term energy storage on a grid scale. To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as a high energy density catholyte was developed. A synergistic approach to the molecular design of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was applied, with the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, which enhance its solubility in organic carbonate electrolytes, and a perfluoro (PerF) group to increase its redox potential. When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two&#8208;electron&#8208;active (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56&#8197;V for the first redox process and 3.92&#8197;V for the second redox process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|(PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF batteries, with concentrations of 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94&#8201;% (99.87&#8201;% per cycle, 97.52&#8201;% per day) and 90&#8201;% (99.93&#8201;% per cycle, 99.16&#8201;% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38&#8201;% and 98.35&#8201;%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129&#8197;mW/cm2. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/L (100&#8197;Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75&#8197;M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96&#8197;Wh/L (150&#8197;Wh/L theoretical).

         <title>Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a &#8220;Radical Amino Ester&#8221; chiral auxiliary, we achieve asymmetric acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangements. This approach efficiently constructs &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides via a HAT strategy.







Abstract
The radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non&#8208;expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom&#8211;transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C&#8722;H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7&#8201;:&#8201;1 to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step.

         <dc:description>
A variety of chiral allylic alcohols can be synthesized through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction between alkenyl (pseudo)halides and aldehydes. This innovative technique facilitates both oxidative addition and insertion solely using nickel, representing a significant departure from the traditional NHK reaction pathway that requires both nickel and chromium salts.







Abstract
Chiral allylic alcohols are highly prized in synthetic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity stemming from both alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. While the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of allylic alcohols, it suffers from drawbacks such as the use of toxic chromium salts, high amounts of metal reductants, and poor enantiocontrol. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach involving a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric NHK reaction for the production of chiral allylic alcohols. This method marries alkenyl (pseudo)halides with aldehydes, leveraging a synergistic blend of a chiral nickel catalyst and a photocatalyst. This innovative technique enables both oxidative addition and insertion just using nickel, diverging significantly from the conventional NHK reaction pathway mediated by nickel and chromium salts. The adoption of this methodology holds immense promise for crafting a spectrum of intricate compounds, particularly those of significance in pharmaceuticals. Detailed experimental investigations have shed light on the metallaphotoredox process, further enhancing our understanding and enabling further advancements.

         <title>Chemically&#8208;Driven Autonomous Janus Electromagnets as Magnetotactic Swimmers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;polarization of solenoidal Janus devices into magnetic dipoles is made possible by the efficient coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous and kinetically favored redox reactions taking place at each extremity of the object. This is a straightforward strategy for the design of non&#8208;ferromagnetic, chemically&#8208;driven electromagnets.







Abstract
An electromagnet is a particular device that takes advantage of electrical currents to produce concentrated magnetic fields. The most well&#8208;known example is a conventional solenoid, having the form of an elongated coil and creating a strong magnetic field through its center when it is connected to a current source.

&lt;p&gt;Self-polarization of solenoidal Janus devices into magnetic dipoles is made possible by the efficient coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous and kinetically favored redox reactions taking place at each extremity of the object. This is a straightforward strategy for the design of non-ferromagnetic, chemically-driven electromagnets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electromagnet is a particular device that takes advantage of electrical currents to produce concentrated magnetic fields. The most well-known example is a conventional solenoid, having the form of an elongated coil and creating a strong magnetic field through its center when it is connected to a current source. Spontaneous redox reactions located at opposite ends of an anisotropic Janus swimmer can effectively mimic a standard power source, due to their ability to wirelessly generate a local electric current. Herein, we propose the coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous redox reactions occurring at the extremities of a hybrid Mg/Pt Janus swimmer with a solenoidal geometry to generate significant magnetic fields. These chemically driven electromagnets spontaneously transform the redox-induced electric current into a magnetic field with a strength in the range of &#956;T upon contact with an acidic medium. Such on-board magnetization allows them to perform compass-like rotational motion and magnetotactic displacement in the presence of external magnetic field gradients, without the need of using ferromagnetic materials for the swimmer design. The torque force experienced by the swimmer is proportional to the internal redox current, and by varying the composition of the solution, it is possible to fine-tune its angular velocity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inducing and Switching the Handedness of Polyacetylenes with Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane Pendants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral [2]catenanes as pendants, the precise regulations of chirality induction from the pendants to poly(phenylacetylenes) main chains lead to the successful construction of novel poly[2]catenanes with multistate switchable handedness, providing not only a new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.







Abstract
To explore the chirality induction and switching of topological chirality, poly[2]catenanes composed of helical poly(phenylacetylenes) (PPAs) main chain and topologically chiral [2]catenane pendants are described for the first time. These poly[2]catenanes with optically active [2]catenanes on side chains were synthesized by polymerization of enantiomerically pure topologically chiral [2]catenanes with ethynyl polymerization site and/or point chiral moiety. The chirality information of [2]catenane pendants was successfully transferred to the main chain of polyene backbones, leading to preferred&#8208;handed helical conformations, while the introduction of point chiral units has negligible effect on the overall helices. More interestingly, attributed to unique dynamic feature of the [2]catenane pendants, these polymers revealed dynamic response behaviors to solvents, temperature, and sodium ions, resulting in the fully reversible switching on/off of the chirality induction. This work provides not only new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Anion Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Protected PtAu12 Superatoms: Charging Energy in Vacuum vs Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charging energy of PtAu24(SCnH2n+1)18 in vacuum was evaluated by gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy. Permittivity of the ligand layer, estimated based on the concentric&#8208;capacitor model, decreased with n. The n&#8208;dependent charging behavior is explained by inhomogeneous monolayers due to the formation of bundles of the longer alkyl chains.







Abstract
The charging behavior of molecular Au clusters protected by alkanethiolate (SCnH2n+1=SCn) is, under electrochemical conditions, significantly affected by the penetration of solvents and electrolytes into the SCn layer. In this study, we estimated the charging energy EC(n) associated with [PtAu24(SCn)18]&#8722;+e&#8722;&#8594;[PtAu24(SCn)18]2&#8722; (n=4, 8, 12, and 16) in vacuum using mass&#8208;selected gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy of [PtAu24(SCn)18]z (z=&#8722;1 and &#8722;2). The EC(n) values of PtAu24(SCn)18 in vacuum are significantly larger than those in solution and decrease with n in contrast to the behavior reported for Au25(SCn)18 in solution. The effective relative permittivity (&#1013;m*) of the SCn layer in vacuum is estimated to be 2.3&#8211;2.0 based on the double&#8208;concentric&#8208;capacitor model. Much smaller &#1013;m* values in vacuum than those in solution are explained by the absence of solvent/electrolyte penetration into the monolayer. The gradual decrease of &#1013;m* with n is ascribed to the appearance of an exposed surface region due to the bundle formation of long alkyl chains.

         <title>Understanding Ligand Effects on Bielectronic Transitions: Chemo&#8208; and Electroreduction of Rhodium Bis(Diphosphine) Complexes to Low Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;electron reduction to low&#8208;valent rhodium &#8722;I is underpinned by structural rearrangements that defines whether the redox transitions are stepwise or in a bielectronic fashion. Study of a parametrized series of Rh bis(diphosphine) complexes identifies how ligand parameters influence this behaviour, whereas an expedient computed electronic parameter allows correlating electronics and geometrics with redox potentials.







Abstract
Rhodium complexes in the &#8722;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood. Herein, we investigate the two&#8208;electron reduction of a parameterized series of bis(diphosphine) Rh complexes [Rh(dxpy)2]NTf2 (x=P&#8208;substituent, y=alkanediyl bridging P atoms). Through (electro)reductions from the RhI parents, Rh&#8722;I d10&#8208;complexes were obtained and characterized spectroscopically, including 103Rh NMR data. The reductive steps convolute with structural rearrangements from square planar to tetrahedral coordination. We found that the extent of these reorganisations defines whether the first E0(RhI/0) and second E0(Rh0/&#8722;I) reduction potentials are normally ordered, leading to monoelectronic stepwise transitions, or inverted, giving bielectronic events. Reductionist approaches based on Hammett parameters or the P&#8722;Rh&#8208;P bite angles provide only partial correlations with the redox potentials. However, we identified the C&#8722;O stretch of analogue diphosphine complexes as an expedient computational parameter that enables these correlations through both electronic and geometric features, even in a predictive manner. Gaining control over two&#8208;electron reduction behaviors through rationalized ligand effects has potential impact beyond Rh complexes, for molecular and enzymatic metal sites commonly exhibiting bielectronic transitions.

         <title>Value&#8208;Added Upcycling of PET to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexanedimethanol by a Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistage relay process has been developed that directly transforms PET into high&#8208;value&#8208;added 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimetha&#8208;nol (CHDM). The process utilizes polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) as a crucial intermediate, enabling the efficient and trans&#8208;selective production of CHDM. By implementing a temperature&#8208;programmed, three&#8208;stage relay approach, we successfully achieved an isolated CHDM yield of up to 87&#8201;%, with a significantly enhanced trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1.







Abstract
We present an innovative process for directly transforming poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a polymer extensively used in food and beverage packaging, into trans&#8208;isomer&#8208;enriched 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM), a key ingredient in advanced specialty polymers. Our approach leverages a dual&#8208;catalyst system featuring palladium on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/r&#8208;GO) and oxalate&#8208;gel&#8208;derived copper&#8208;zinc oxide (og&#8208;CuZn), utilizing hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis relay catalysis. This method efficiently transforms PET into polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD), which is then converted into CHDM with an impressive overall yield of 95&#8201;% in a two&#8208;stage process. Our process effectively handles various post&#8208;consumer PET plastics, converting them into CHDM with yields between 78&#8201;% and 89&#8201;% across different substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of this approach through a temperature&#8208;programmed three&#8208;stage relay process on a 10&#8208;gram scale, which results in purified CHDM with an isolated yield of 87&#8201;% and a notably higher trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1, far exceeding that of commercially available CHDM. This research not only provides a viable route for repurposing PET waste but also enhances the control of selectivity patterns in multistage relay catalysis.

         <title>Direct Microenvironment Modulation of CO2 Electroreduction: Negatively Charged Ag Sites Going beyond Catalytic Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported &#8220;nc&#8208;Ag&#8221; active sites featuring both the high intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. The sites could exert long&#8208;range electrostatic forces to regulate interfacial H2O and CO2 in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This work opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating the intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active sites may also boost catalytic performance. Here we designed &#8220;negatively charged Ag (nc&#8208;Ag)&#8221; active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only mediate the surface processes by bonding with the intermediates), the nc&#8208;Ag sites could also manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with a CO faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Tailored F/N Hybrid Polymers by Using Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;controlled radical copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and N&#8208;vinylamides has been developed with fluorinated thiocarbamate and organocatalyst under mild conditions. This work enables on&#8208;demand synthesis of F/N hybrid polymers as versatile and functional structures that could be readily transformed via chain&#8208;extensions and post&#8208;modifications, facilitating the in situ formation of polymeric interphase layers on Li metal anodes.







Abstract
Controlled radical copolymerizations present attractive avenues to obtain polymers with complicated compositions and sequences. In this work, we report the development of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed controlled copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and acyclic N&#8208;vinylamides for the first time. The approach enables the on&#8208;demand synthesis of a broad scope of amide&#8208;functionalized main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers via novel fluorinated thiocarbamates, facilitating regulations over chemical compositions and alternating fractions by rationally selecting comonomer pairs and ratios. This method allows temporally controlled chain&#8208;growth by external light, and maintains high chain&#8208;end fidelity that promotes facile preparation of block sequences. Notably, the obtained F/N hybrid polymers, upon hydrolysis, afford free amino&#8208;substituted fluoropolymers versatile for post modifications toward various functionalities (e.g., amide, sulfonamide, carbamide, thiocarbamide). We further demonstrate the in situ formation of polymer networks with desirable properties as protective layers on lithium metal anodes, presenting a promising avenue for advancing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Methylated Sulfone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Back&#8208;Reaction Inhibited Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise methylation of O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen&#8208;intermediate desorption, which obstructs the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics and inhibits the backward reaction of O2 reduction reaction in photocatalytic overall water splitting. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution, which cooperatively contributes to efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with favored proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS&#8208;COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70&#8201;% of the backward reaction and a three&#8208;fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest reported for organic&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Common Biosynthesis of Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Terpenes through a Fragmentation&#8208;Recombination Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of six bacterial non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers was investigated through a combination of isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results showed that five of these compounds are formed by an unusual fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism. In addition, for anaximandrene a dancing mechanism was discovered, explaining the distribution of labeling over several carbon positions.







Abstract
The biosynthesis of six recently reported non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers, archimedene, aristotelene, eratosthenene, pythagorene, &#945;&#8208;democritene and anaximandrene, was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and isotopic labeling experiments. The results revealed for all compounds except archimedene a unique fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism as previously demonstrated for sodorifen biosynthesis, in addition to a remarkable &#8220;dancing&#8221; mechanism for anaximandrene biosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;The biosynthesis of six recently reported non-canonical C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers, archimedene, aristotelene, eratosthenene, pythagorene, &#945;-democritene and anaximandrene, was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and isotopic labeling experiments. The results revealed for all compounds except archimedene a unique fragmentation-recombination mechanism as previously demonstrated for sodorifen biosynthesis, in addition to a remarkable &#8220;dancing&#8221; mechanism for anaximandrene biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecule Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Wide&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes via the Intelligentized Screening Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte design is presented. Based on an explainable method, the halogenoid property of the cyanide group is demonstrated similar to fluorine in molecular properties. 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the LiCoO2/Li cell operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Operating a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) in a wide temperature range is essential for ensuring a stable electricity supply amidst fluctuating temperatures caused by climate or terrain changes. Electrolyte plays a pivotal role in determining the temperature durability of batteries. However, specialized electrolytes designed for either low or high temperatures typically possess distinct features. Therefore, wide&#8208;temperature electrolytes (WTEs) are necessary as they encompass a combination of diverse properties, which complicates the clear instruction of WTE design. Here we represent an artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of WTE design through stepwise parameterizations and calculations. Linear mono&#8208;nitriles are identified as ideal wide&#8208;liquidus&#8208;range solvents that can &#8220;softly&#8221; solvate lithium ions by weak interactions. In addition, the explainable modules revealed the halogenoid similarity of cyanide as fluorine on the electrolyte properties (e.g. boiling point and dielectric constant). With the further introduction of an ether bond, 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been eventually determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the battery operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C. Particularly, a LiCoO2/Li cell using the proposed WTE can realize stable cycling with capacity retention reaching 72.3&#8201;% after 50 cycles under a high temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Membrane Enthalpy and Entropy Barriers towards Superior Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous TpPa COF interlayer is introduced to regulate the architecture and charge properties of the CAPEI selective layer, culminating in a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. Consequently, M&#8208;TpPaCAPEI exhibits superior separation performance to that of M&#8208;CAPEI and other advanced monovalent ion selective membranes for Li+/Mg2+ separation.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#916;H) and entropy barrier (&#916;S) for designing next&#8208;generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule&#8208;absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. This recorded performance with a Li+/Mg2+ perm&#8208;selectivity of 25.50 and a Li+ flux of 1.86&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li+/Mg2+ separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S&#8208;ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.

         <title>Two RNA Folds from One Sequence: A Ribozyme with Versatile Substrate Processing Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme can adopt a hammerhead fold, allowing them to process various substrates by utilizing their inherent activity and comprehensive conformational flexibility to support RNA cleavage and ligation.







Abstract
We report the design of a single RNA sequence capable of adopting one of two ribozyme folds and catalyzing the cleavage and/or ligation of the respective substrates. The RNA is able to change its conformation in response to its environment, hence it is called chameleon ribozyme (CHR). Efficient RNA cleavage of two different substrates as well as RNA ligation by CHR is demonstrated in separate experiments and in a one pot reaction. Our study shows that sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme intersect with the hammerhead ribozyme and that rather short RNA molecules can have comprehensive conformational flexibility, which is an important feature for the emergence of new functional folds in early evolution.

         <title>Unraveling the Intertwining Factors Underlying the Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two closely related yet distinctly different heterometallic 3d&#8211;4f clusters, featuring respectively a 96&#8208;metal (Dy52Ni44) and a 188&#8208;metal (Dy112Ni76) core built of multi&#8208;shells of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained by the controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+. Comparative experiments under systematically altered conditions were performed to unravel the intertwining factors, including the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base, the reaction temperature, and the reaction duration.







Abstract
Two closely related yet distinctly different cationic clusters, [Dy52Ni44(HEIDA)36(OH)138(OAc)24(H2O)30]10+ (1) and [Dy112Ni76(HEIDA)44(EIDA)24(IDA)4(OH)268(OAc)48(H2O)44]4+ (2) (HEIDA=N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetate), each featuring a multi&#8208;shell core of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained. Depending on the specific conditions used for the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+, the product can be crystallized out as one particular type of cluster or as a mixture of 1 and 2. How the reaction process was affected by the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base and/or by the reaction temperature and duration was investigated. It has been found that a reaction at a high temperature and/or for an extended period favors the formation of the compact and thermodynamically more stable 1, while a brief reaction with a large amount of the base is good for the kinetic product 2. By tuning these intertwining conditions, the reaction can be regulated toward a particular product.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Tetra&#8208;substituted Morpholinone and Benzoxazinone Lactols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. DFT studies identify an N&#8208;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction as key to producing products in highly enantioenriched form.







Abstract
The development of methods to allow the selective acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of tetra&#8208;substituted lactols is a recognised synthetic challenge. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields (up to 89&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er) observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating substitution at N(4) and C(2), di&#8208; and spirocyclic substitution at C(5) and C(6), as well as benzannulation (&gt;35&#8197;examples in total). The DKR process is amenable to scale&#8208;up on a 1&#8197;g laboratory scale. The factors leading to high selectivity in this DKR process have been probed through computation, with an N&#8722;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction identified as key to producing ester products in highly enantioenriched form.

The enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution of tetra&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide derivatives using (2S,3R)&#8208;HyperBTM (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the catalyst (&gt;40&#8197;examples in total) is reported.

Abstract
A general and highly enantioselective method for the preparation of tetra&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide esters via isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is reported. Using (2S,3R)&#8208;HyperBTM (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the catalyst, the scope and limitations of this methodology have been extensively probed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields observed (&gt;40&#8197;examples, up to 99&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er). Substitution of the aromatic core within the 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide skeleton, as well as aliphatic and aromatic substitution at C(3), is readily tolerated. A diverse range of anhydrides, including those from bioactive and pharmaceutically relevant acids, can also be used. The high enantioselectivity observed in this DKR process has been probed computationally, with a key substrate heteroatom donor O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;acyl&#8208;isothiouronium interaction identified through DFT analysis as necessary for enantiodiscrimination.

         <title>Trilayer Polymer Electrolytes Enable Carbon&#8208;Efficient CO2 to Multicarbon Product Conversion in Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trilayer polymer electrolyte was devised to enable the coexistence of high local pH at the cathode surface and acidic interfaces within the membrane, thus concurrently favoring C2H4 formation and addressing the CO2 loss issue. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of ~46&#8201;% and a single&#8208;pass conversion of ~32&#8201;% were achieved for C2H4 at industrially relevant current densities.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO2 electrolyzers exhibit high CO2RR activity, low full&#8208;cell voltages, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the issue of CO2 loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO2RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H+ flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO2 reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a result, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46&#8201;% for C2H4, corresponding to a C2+ FE of 64&#8201;% at 260&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 single&#8208;pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32&#8201;% at 140&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8212;nearly 1.3&#8197;times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM&#8208;MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO2 reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE&#8208;MEA electrolyzer reduces the full&#8208;cell voltage to 2.3&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without compromising the C2H4 FE.

         <title>A NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated and Lysosomal&#8208;Targeted Pt(II) Metallacycle for Highly Potent Evoking of Immunogenic Cell Death that Potentiates Cancer Immunotherapy of Deep&#8208;Seated Tumors</title>

A platinum (Pt) metallacycle (1) is designed as the first example of a supramolecular near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer. 1 generates boosted reactive oxygen species excited by NIR light and induces lysosomal dysfunction thus synergistically augments immunomodulatory response with the effective dose of about a sixtieth compared with oxaliplatin and efficiently reduces adverse effects.







Abstract
Though platinum (Pt)&#8208;based complexes have been recently exploited as immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers for activating immunotherapy, the effective activation of sufficient immune responses with minimal side effects in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose the first example of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated and lysosomal targeted Pt(II) metallacycle (1) as a supramolecular ICD inducer. 1 synergistically potentiates immunomodulatory response in deep&#8208;seated tumors via multiple&#8208;regulated approaches, involving NIR light excitation, boosted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good selectivity between normal and tumor cells, and enhanced tumor penetration/retention capabilities. Specifically, 1 has excellent depth&#8208;activated ROS production (~7&#8197;mm), accompanied by strong anti&#8208;diffusion and anti&#8208;ROS quenching ability. In vitro experiments demonstrate that 1 exhibits significant cellular uptake and ROS generation in tumor cells as well as respective multicellular tumor spheroids. Based on these advantages, 1 induces a more efficient ICD in an ultralow dose (i.e., 5&#8197;&#956;M) compared with the clinical ICD inducer&#8208;oxaliplatin (300&#8197;&#956;M). In vivo, vaccination experiments further demonstrate that 1 serves as a potent ICD inducer through eliciting CD8+/CD4+ T&#8197;cell response and Foxp3+ T&#8197;cell depletion with negligible adverse effects. This study pioneers a promising avenue for safe and effective metal&#8208;based ICD agents in immunotherapy.

Droplets dancing to non&#8208;classical tunes. Nishant Singh and co&#8208;workers (e202406220) show in their Communication how phase&#8208;separated amino acid droplets can non&#8208;classically evolve into poly&#8208;crystals and fibrous hydrogels. Several complex and direct pathways are explored to achieve transient or stable soft materials, single&#8208; or poly&#8208;crystals by provoking disordered droplets.

Radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. In their Research Article (e202406551) Eduard Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. show the utility of an active&#8208;feedback wireless NMR masing detector with the quality factor enhancement up to 1,000,000 to create a RASER at 300 MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional passive NMR detectors. This active&#8208;feedback&#8208;circuit approach potentially enables RASER sensing in a wide range of in vivo applications.

         <dc:description>
Two structurally intricate heterometallic clusters with cores featuring multiple Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra were synthesized by ligand&#8208;controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ni2+ and Dy3+ ions, as reported by Zhiping Zheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409109). Adjusting the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;promoting base and the reaction temperature and duration afforded selectively the kinetic and thermodynamic species, respectively with a Dy112Ni76 and a Dy52Ni44 core.

         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding can be used to recognize non&#8208;substituted carbon&#8208;only molecular fragments, in that way enabling the design of new, complex crystalline materials using &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon sites that for a long time appear to have been forgotten in crystal engineering.

         <title>Photorefinery of Biomass and Plastics to Renewable Chemicals using Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysts harness sunlight to convert biomass and plastic waste into value&#8208;added chemicals. These feedstocks utilize photogenerated electrons and/or holes to undergo reduction and/or oxidation transformations, enabling catalytic upgrading in a low&#8208;carbon, renewable energy&#8208;driven, and environmentally friendly manner.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of biomass and plastic waste provides opportunities for sustainable fuel and chemical production. Heterogeneous photocatalysts, typically composed of semiconductors with distinctive redox properties in their conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), facilitate both the oxidative and reductive valorization of organic feedstocks. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the photorefinery of biomass and plastics from the perspective of the redox properties of photocatalysts. We explore the roles of the VB and CB in enhancing the value&#8208;added conversion of biomass and plastics via various pathways. Our aim is to bridge the gap between photocatalytic mechanisms and renewable carbon feedstock valorization, inspiring further development in photocatalytic refinery of biomass and plastics.

         <title>Evolution of Surface Chemistry in Two&#8208;Dimensional MXenes: From Mixed to Tunable Uniform Terminations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>

Covalently modifiable surface terminations distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials and define their intrinsic properties. This minireview highlights recent advances in MXenes with uniform inorganic or organic surface terminations and provides perspectives on future opportunities and challenges in this field.







Abstract
Surface chemistry of MXenes is of great interest as the terminations can define the intrinsic properties of this family of materials. The diverse and tunable terminations also distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials. Conventional fluoride&#8208;containing reagents etching approaches resulted in MXenes with mixed fluoro&#8208;, oxo&#8208;, and hydroxyl surface groups. The relatively strong chemical bonding of MXenes&#8217; surface metal atoms with oxygen and fluorine makes post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications of such MXenes unfavorable. In this minireview, we focus on the recent advances in MXenes with uniform surface terminations. Unconventional methods, including Lewis acidic molten salt etching (LAMS) and bottom&#8208;up direct synthesis, have been proven successful in producing halide&#8208;terminated MXenes. These synthetic strategies have opened new possibilities for MXenes because weaker surface chemical bonds in halide&#8208;terminated MXenes facilitate post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications. Both computational and experimental results on surface termination&#8208;dependent properties are summarized and discussed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting research field.

         <title>Platelet&#8208;Drug Conjugates Engineered via One&#8208;step Fusion Approach for Metastatic and Postoperative Cancer Treatment</title>

Platelet&#8208;drug conjugates could be prepared via one&#8208;step fusion with multiple&#8208;drug loaded liposomes. Platelets loaded with chemotherapy agent doxorubicin and cytokine IL&#8208;15 triggered anti&#8208;tumor immune response and inhibited melanoma recurrence in metastatic and postoperative tumor models.







Abstract
The exploration of cell&#8208;based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy has gained growing attention. Approaches to engineering therapeutic cells with multidrug loading in an effective, safe, and precise manner while preserving their inherent biological properties remain of great interest. Here, we report a strategy to simultaneously load multiple drugs in platelets in a one&#8208;step fusion process. We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin&#8208;15 (IL&#8208;15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70&#8201;% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Network of Multicatalytic Reactions using a Single Palladium/Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a metabolism&#8208;inspired artificial system designed to respond to multiple stimuli, operating within an integrated network of mechanistically distinct reactions. Our approach enables the efficient performance of multi&#8208;stage processes using three simple starting materials, controlled by specific triggers, and catalysed by a multifunctional PdII/PtII complex, leading to the preferential synthesis of ten products.







Abstract
Given her unrivalled proficiency in the synthesis of all molecules of life, nature has been an endless source of inspiration for developing new strategies in organic chemistry and catalysis. However, one feature that remains thus far beyond chemists&#8217; grasp is her unique ability to adapt the productivity of metabolic processes in response to triggers that indicate the temporary need for specific metabolites. To demonstrate the remarkable potential of such stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, we present a metabolism&#8208;inspired network of multicatalytic processes capable of selectively synthesising a range of products from simple starting materials. Specifically, the network is built of four classes of distinct catalytic reactions&#8212;cross&#8208;couplings, substitutions, additions, and reductions, involving three organic starting materials&#8212;terminal alkyne, aryl iodide, and hydrosilane. All starting materials are either introduced sequentially or added to the system at the same time, with no continuous influx of reagents or efflux of products. All processes in the system are catalysed by a multifunctional heteronuclear PdII/PtII complex, whose performance can be controlled by specific additives and external stimuli. The reaction network exhibits a substantial degree of orthogonality between different pathways, enabling the controllable synthesis of ten distinct products with high efficiency and selectivity through simultaneous triggering and suppression mechanisms.

         <title>Hirocidins, Cytotoxic Metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis, Induce Mitochondrion&#8208;Mediated Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hirocidins A&#8722;C, secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with novel architectures and promising inhibitory activity against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. The total synthesis of hirocidin A and mechanistic investigations, which reveal mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis via caspase&#8208;9, provide opportunities to better understand and chemically enhance hirocidin's antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
Recent advances in whole genome sequencing have revealed an immense microbial potential for the production of therapeutic small molecules, even from well&#8208;known producers. To access this potential, we subjected prominent antimicrobial producers to alternative antiproliferative assays using persistent cancer cell lines. Described herein is our discovery of hirocidins, novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with antiproliferative activities against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. Hirocidin A is an unusual nine&#8208;membered carbocyclic maleimide and hirocidins B and C are relatives with an unprecedented, bridged azamacrocyclic backbone. Mode of action studies show that hirocidins trigger mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis by inducing expression of the key apoptotic effector caspase&#8208;9. The discovery of new cytotoxins contributes to scaffold diversification in anticancer drug discovery and the reported modes of action and concise total synthetic route for variant A set the stage for unraveling specific targets and biochemical interactions of the hirocidins.

         <title>Stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII ions can be constructed using p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (H4TBC[4]) under solvothermal reaction conditions. The topological arrangement of the metal ions leads to significant spin frustration arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at 10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3 T.







Abstract
The solvothermal reaction of FeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O and H4TBC[4] in a basic dmf/EtOH solution affords an [FeIII18] Keplerate conforming to a stellated cuboctahedron. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements reveal spin frustration effects arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at ~10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3&#8197;T.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Weakly Coordinating Anions: Molecular Design, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a systematic, computational evaluation of the potential of differently substituted methanide and propenide anions to serve as as weakly coordinating anion, the mixed 3,5&#8208;bistrifluoromethylphenyl (ArF) and triflyl (Tf) substituted propenide was prepared in gram&#8208;scale and shown to balance proton affinity and coordination ability. The applicability of this weakly coordinating carbanion was demonstrated by the stabilization of p&#8208;block cations.







Abstract
Although carbanions, which are usually regarded as reactive species and powerful metalation reagents, can be stabilized through choice of the substitution pattern, they have rarely been considered for the design of weakly coordinating anions (WCA). Here, we report on an evaluation of the potential of a series of differently substituted carbanions to serve as WCA by computational methods. This led us to the synthesis of the water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable allyl anion 1 with triflyl and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (ArF) moieties, which can be isolated in high yields even on a gram&#8208;scale. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR studies confirmed the weak coordination ability of the anion by showing negligible or only weak interactions with different cations. This property enabled the application of 1 in the stabilization of reactive group&#8197;14 and 15 cations. In addition to the crystallization of a phosphenium cation, the first all&#8208;carbon salt with a non&#8208;aromatic carbanion is reported, which revealed to be a convenient reagent for hydride abstraction such as from silanes. Overall, this work demonstrates the so far untapped potential of carbanions as WCA, that are accessible with a variety of different cations for various applications.

         <title>Complex Pathways Drive Pluripotent Fmoc&#8208;Leucine Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of hierarchical assemblies of Fmoc&#8208;Leu are accessed using non&#8208;classical and classical nucleation following complex pathways. Chemical and thermal inputs lead to phase separated sub&#8208;micron liquid and solid droplets which can transform to fibrous stable hydrogel, transient metastable hydrogels, and milli&#8208;metric polycrystal spherulites or single crystals.







Abstract
Nature uses complex self&#8208;assembly pathways to access distinct functional non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assemblies. This remarkable ability to steer same set of biomolecules into different self&#8208;assembly states is done by avoiding thermodynamic pit. In synthetic systems, on demand control over &#8216;Pathway Complexity&#8217; to access self&#8208;assemblies different from equilibrium structures remains challenging. Here we show versatile non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies of the same monomer via alternate assembly pathways. The assemblies nucleate using non&#8208;classical or classical nucleation routes into distinct metastable (transient hydrogels), kinetic (stable hydrogels) and thermodynamic structures [(poly)&#8208;crystals and 2D sheets]. Initial chemical and thermal inputs force the monomers to follow different assembly pathways and form soft&#8208;materials with distinct molecular arrangements than at equilibrium. In many cases, equilibrium structures act as thermodynamic sink which consume monomers from metastable structures giving transiently formed materials. This dynamics can be tuned chemically or thermally to slow down the dissolution of transient hydrogel, or skip the intermediate hydrogel altogether to reach final equilibrium assemblies. If required this metastable state can be kinetically trapped to give strong hydrogel stable over days. This method to control different self&#8208;assembly states can find potential use in similar biomimetic systems to access new materials for various applications.

         <title>Function Switch of a Fungal Sesterterpene Synthase through Molecular Dynamics Simulation Assisted Alteration of an Aromatic Residue Cluster in the Active Pocket of PfNS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined strategy involving molecular dynamics simulations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to manipulate the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of PfNS protein resulted in the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions, such as the conversion between bicyclic and tricyclic structures and the transition from Type&#8197;B to Type&#8197;A function, thus resulting in the production of new sesterterpenes.







Abstract
Terpene synthases (TPSs) play pivotal roles in generating diverse terpenoids through complex cyclization pathways. Protein engineering of TPSs offers a crucial approach to expanding terpene diversity. However, significant potential remains untapped due to limited understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationships of TPSs. In this investigation, using a joint approach of molecular dynamics simulations&#8208;assisted engineering and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we manipulated the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of a bifunctional terpene synthase (BFTPS), Pestalotiopsis fici nigtetraene synthase (PfNS). This led to the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions yielding different cyclization patterns of sesterterpenes. Specifically, a quadruple variant (F89A/Y113F/W193L/T194W) completely altered PfNS&#8242;s function, converting it from producing the bicyclic sesterterpene nigtetraene to the tricyclic ophiobolin F. Additionally, analysis of catalytic profiles by double, triple, and quadruple variants demonstrated that the ARC functions as a switch, unprecedently redirecting the production of 5/11 bicyclic (Type&#8197;B) sesterterpenes to 5/15 bicyclic (Type&#8197;A) ones. Molecular dynamics simulations and theozyme calculations further elucidated that, in addition to cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions also play a key role in the cyclization patterns. This study offers a feasible strategy in protein engineering of TPSs for various industrial applications.

         <title>Photochargeable Mn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework and Decoupled Photocatalysis</title>

MnBr&#8208;253 particles were synthesized as three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on MOF&#8208;253 and MnBr(CO)3(bpy) complexes, designed as off&#8208;grid colloidal systems aimed at decoupling light harvesting and high&#8208;energy electron storage. Achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion/storage quantum yield and charging rate, the framework was applied for temporally decoupled dark H2 evolution.







Abstract
Designing multifunctional materials that mimic the light&#8208;dark decoupling of natural photosynthesis is a key challenge in the field of energy conversion. Herein, we introduce MnBr&#8208;253, a precious metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) built on Al nodes, bipyridine linkers and MnBr(CO)3(bipyridine) complexes. Upon irradiation, MnBr&#8208;253 colloids demonstrate an electron photocharging capacity of ~42&#8197;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1MOF, with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocharging rate (1.28&#8197;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1MOF) and incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion efficiency of ~9.4&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm. Spectroscopic and computational studies support effective electron accumulation at the Mn complex while high porosity and Mn loading account for the notable electron storage performance. The charged MnBr&#8208;253 powders were successfully applied for hydrogen evolution under dark conditions thus emulating the light&#8208;decoupled reactivity of photosynthesis.

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Quality&#8208;Factor Wireless Masing Magnetic Resonance Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. RASER is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive NMR detectors. We show wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced from 75 up to 1,000,000 via parametric pumping via active&#8208;feedback technique for RASER applications at 300&#8197;MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional MR detector.







Abstract
It has recently been shown that a bolus of hyperpolarized nuclear spins can yield stimulated emission signals similar in nature to maser signals, potentially enabling new ways of sensing hyperpolarized contrast media, including most notably [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate that is under evaluation in over 50&#8197;clinical trials for metabolic imaging of cancer. The stimulated NMR signal emissions lasting for minutes do not require radio&#8208;frequency excitation, offering unprecedented advantages compared to conventional MR sensing. However, creating nuclear spin maser emission is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive MR detectors. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced 22&#8208;fold (to 1,670) via parametric pumping. This active&#8208;feedback technique breaks the intrinsic fundamental limit of NMR detector circuit quality factor. We show the use of parametric pumping to reduce the threshold requirement for inducing nuclear spin masing at 300&#8197;MHz resonance frequency in a preclinical MRI scanner. Indeed, stimulated emission from hyperpolarized protons was obtained under highly unfavorable conditions of low magnetic field homogeneity (T2* of 3&#8197;ms). Greater gains of the quality factor of the MR detector (up to 1&#8197;million) were also demonstrated.

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts: High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Element Combinations in Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an innovative method for accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in Pt&#8208;based quinary high&#8208;entropy alloys, utilizing large&#8208;scale language model, microscale printing, pulsed high&#8208;temperature synthesis, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy, and density functional theory calculations. This offers a new avenue for the discovery of multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.







Abstract
The vast number of element combinations and the explosive growth of composition space pose significant challenges to the development of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Here, we propose a procedural research method aimed at accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on Pt&#8208;based quinary HEAs. The method begins with an element library provided by a large language model (LLM), combined with microscale precursor printing and pulse high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques to prepare multi&#8208;element combination HEA array in one step. Through high&#8208;throughput measurement using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), precise identification of highly active HEA element combinations and exploration of composition space for a specific combination are achieved. Advantageous element combinations are further validated in practical electrocatalytic evaluations. The contributions of individual element sites and the synergistic effects among elements of such HEAs in enhancing reaction activity are elucidated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This method integrates high&#8208;throughput experiments, practical catalyst validation, and DFT calculations, providing a new pathway for accelerating the discovery of efficient multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.

         <title>Constructing Microporous Ion Exchange Membranes via Simple Hypercrosslinking for pH&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economically feasible strategy, simple hypercrosslinking, is proposed to construct ion exchange membranes with microporosity. The presented membranes balance well with high ion conductivity and high ion selectivity and show superiority in process simplicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and anti&#8208;swelling, thus enabling high&#8208;efficiency and stable cycling of pH&#8208;neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries.







Abstract
Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) play a critical role in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). Traditional IEMs that feature microphase&#8208;separated microstructures are well&#8208;developed and easily available but suffer from the conductivity/selectivity tradeoff. The emerging charged microporous polymer membranes show the potential to overcome this tradeoff, yet their commercialization is still hindered by tedious syntheses and demanding conditions. We herein combine the advantages of these two types of membrane materials via simple in situ hypercrosslinking of conventional IEMs into microporous ones. Such a concept is exemplified by the very cheap commercial quaternized polyphenylene oxide membrane. The hypercrosslinking treatment turns poor&#8208;performance membranes into high&#8208;performance ones, as demonstrated by the above 10&#8208;fold selectivity enhancement and much&#8208;improved conductivities that more than doubled. This turn is also confirmed by the effective and stable pH&#8208;neutral AORFB with decreased membrane resistance and at least an order of magnitude lower capacity loss rate. This battery shows advantages over other reported AORFBs in terms of a low capacity loss rate (0.0017&#8201;% per cycle) at high current density. This work provides an economically feasible method for designing AORFB&#8208;oriented membranes with microporosity.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Glutathione Assembly Supported on ZIF&#8208;8 as Robust and Efficient Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu(I)&#8208;glutathione polymer supported on ZIF&#8208;8 is a robust catalyst for the efficient carboxylation of terminal alkynes and the cyclization of propargylamine with CO2 under atmospheric pressure and mild conditions with a wide range of substrates, converting them into high value&#8208;added chemicals, with strong positive synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst is reused at least 10&#8197;times without significant reduction in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;glutathione (GSH) redox system, essential in biology, is designed here as a supramacromolecular assembly in which the tetrahedral 18e Cu(I) center loses a thiol ligand upon adsorption onto ZIF&#8208;8, as shown by EXAFS and DFT calculation, to generate a very robust 16e planar trigonal single&#8208;atom Cu(I) catalyst. Synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8, revealed by catalytic experiments and DFT calculation, affords CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals with a wide scope of substrates by reaction with terminal alkynes or propargyl amines in excellent yields under mild conditions and reuse at least 10&#8197;times without significant decrease in catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Thioesters from Aryl Halides and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical method for synthesizing thioesters from readily available aryl halides and carboxylic acids is here disclosed. This thiol&#8208;free protocol hinges on the direct excitation of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylthiourea and its multifaceted ability to act as the sulfur source, generate aryl radicals upon SET activation of halides, and trap them to in situ produce reactive isothiouronium ions.







Abstract
Thioesters are important in synthesis, materials science, and biology, and their preparation traditionally relies on the use of disagreeable thiols. Here, we report a thiol&#8208;free protocol that stitches together widespread carboxylic acids and aryl halides, producing a diverse array of thioesters. Crucial to this strategy is the discovery that tetramethylthiourea can serve as both a sulfur source and, upon direct excitation by purple light, as a strong reductant, suitable for activating aryl halides via single&#8208;electron transfer. Coupling of the resulting aryl radicals provides an isothiouronium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by carboxylic acids via a polar pathway, affording the thioester products under mild conditions.

         <title>Utilizing &#8220;Latent&#8221; Carbon: Repositioning Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Synthons and Assemblies via Halogen Bonding to &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>

Halogen bonding to &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon sites&#8212;unsubstituted carbon sites that are traditionally seen as dead&#8208;ends in hydrogen&#8208;bonded crystal engineering&#8212;has been used to direct the solid&#8208;state arrangement of discrete and extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded substructures based on acid&#8208;, amide&#8208;, and phenol&#8208;based homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;synthons, thereby generating higher&#8208;order molecular solids.







Abstract
Molecules bearing carboxylic acid, amide, and hydroxyl groups are ubiquitous in crystal engineering, where robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded synthons centred on these functionalities enable reliable crystal structure design. We now show that halogen bonding to the carbon &#960;&#8208;system of such molecules, traditionally ignored in crystal engineering, permits the recognition and directional assembly of the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded structural subunits, leaving the archetypal hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring, ladder, and chain homosynthons intact, but repositioned in space. When applied to heteromolecular synthons, this enables rearranging more complex hydrogen&#8208;bonded motifs and the evolution of binary cocrystals into ternary ones through &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon&#8208;based recognition sites, demonstrating a rational approach to build higher&#8208;order solid&#8208;state supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Wittig Reaction by Phosphorus PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the atroposelective Wittig reaction enabled by PIII/PV=O redox catalysis. An endogenous base release compatible with Lewis acid co&#8208;catalysis thereby generates the ylide intermediates. The mild, chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction allows the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomers with enantioselectivities of up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is renowned as exceptionally versatile method for converting a diversity of aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. Recently, strategies for chiral phosphine catalysis under PIII/PV=O redox cycling emerged to render this venerable transformation stereoselective. Herein, we describe that phosphine redox catalysis enables the enantioselective synthesis of pertinent biaryl atropisomers by means of a stereocontrolled arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction. Key to the process is the release of an endogenous base from readily accessible tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonylated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts triggered by catalyst intramolecularization, permitting mild phosphine redox catalysis for atroposelective Wittig reactions. By this strategy, a broad diversity of biaryl atropisomers is obtained with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 enantioselectivity.

         <title>exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;Substituted Pentabenzocorannulene: Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene, a new buckybowl bearing an internal sp3 carbon atom in the backbone, unexpectedly exhibits wide absorption and emission bands. The methyl group is exclusively located at the convex surface, bolstering the bowl geometry. All molecules form unidirectional bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking to generate polar crystals.







Abstract
exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene (exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me) was synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,2,3&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene. Its bowl&#8208;shaped geometry with an sp3 carbon atom in the backbone and a methyl group located at the convex (exo) face was verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. According to DFT calculations, the observed conformer is energetically more favorable than the endo one by 39.9&#8197;kcal/mol. Compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped analogs with intact &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones (see the main text), exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me displayed a deeper bowl depth (avg. 1.93&#8197;&#197;), redshifted and broader absorption (250&#8211;620&#8197;nm) and emission (from 585 to more than 850&#8197;nm) bands and a smaller optical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (2.01&#8197;eV). exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me formed polar crystals where all bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking with close &#960;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; contacts is arranged unidirectionally, providing the potential for applications as organic semiconductors and pyroelectric materials. This unusual structural feature, molecular packing, and properties are most likely associated with the assistance of the methyl group and the sp3 carbon atom in the backbone.

         <title>Synthesis of Secondary Boronates via Deaminative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Nitroso Carbamates and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the coupling of N&#8208;nitroso carbamates with organo boronic acids is presented. The method allows for the formal deaminative coupling of widely available amines. In particular, the coupling of lysine is presented, which allows for the synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids.







Abstract
A strategy for transition metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl nitroso&#8208;carbamates and boronic acids is reported. The N&#8208;nitroso carbamates are easily prepared from the corresponding amine in two simple steps. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide variety of secondary boronates, benzylic boronates and formal Csp3&#8722;Csp2 cross&#8208;coupling products under operationally simple conditions. Functional group tolerance is also demonstrated and applied in the modification of lysine to make non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

         <dc:description>
In this communication, we report two novel intrinsically liquid crystalline metal halide perovskite&#8208;like materials by utilizing fluorinated ionic liquid crystalline (FILC) mesogens based on polyfluorinated alkylimidazolium cations. Manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions were found to be essential for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of the perovskite&#8208;like structures. This study may pave the way towards a new class of perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.







Abstract
Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskites (HOIHPs) represent an emerging class of semiconducting materials, widely employed in a variety of optoelectronic applications. Despite their skyrocket growth in the last decade, a detailed understanding on their structure&#8211;property relationships is still missing. In this communication, we report two unprecedented perovskite&#8208;like materials based on polyfluorinated imidazolium cations. The two materials show thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior resulting in the emergence of stable mesophases. The manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions are shown to be meaningful for the stabilization of both the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of these perovskite&#8208;like materials. Moreover, the structure of the incorporated imidazolium cation was found to tune the properties of the liquid crystalline phase. Collectively, these results may pave the way for the design of a new class of halide perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.

         <title>Adaptive Helical Chirality in Supramolecular Microcrystals for Circularly Polarized Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral supramolecular interaction strategy is proposed to synthesize organic microcrystals with adaptive helical chirality for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission.







Abstract
Chiral organic molecules offer a promising platform for exploring circularly polarized lasing, which, however, faces a great challenge that the spatial separation of molecular chiral and luminescent centers limits chiroptical activity. Here we develop a helically chiral supramolecular system with completely overlapped chiral and luminescent units for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. Adaptive helical chirality is obtained by incorporating chiral agents into organic microcrystals. Benefiting from the efficient coupling of stimulated emission with the adaptive helical chirality, the supramolecular microcrystals enable high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission with dissymmetry factors up to ~0.7. This work opens up the way to rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Approach to Promoting Photocatalysis Based on Consecutive Photo&#8208;Induced Electron&#8208;Transfer Processes via Efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the host&#8211;guest approach to promoting photoactivation of aryl halides based on the conPET process via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from host to encapsulated rhodamine 6G (Rh&#8208;6G). Highly efficient FRET makes the supramolecular system an efficient catalyst for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides under mild conditions within a short time (1&#8211;4&#8197;h), even in an air atmosphere.







Abstract
Supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8211;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal&#8208;organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8211;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8211;guest complex renders the cage&#8208;based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.

Highly efficient FRET makes the supramolecular system an efficient catalyst for the single-wavelength light-driven activation of aryl halides under mild conditions within a short time (1&#8211;4&#8197;h), even in an air atmosphere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular artificial light-harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8211;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo-induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible-light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal-organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8211;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single-wavelength light-driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8211;guest complex renders the cage-based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancement of Low Temperature Superionic Conductivity by Suppression of Li Site Ordering in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>

Isovalent substitution of Ge4+ for Si4+ in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I is observed for x&#8804;1.2. Control of unit cell volume via this substitution enhances Li+ site disorder beyond Li7Si2S7I. This extensive disorder is stabilised to 30&#8197;K with very low activation energies observed by 7Li NMR, yielding low temperature Li+ transport in highly substituted (x=1 &amp; 1.2) materials that is comparable to best&#8208;in&#8208;class solid&#8208;state electrolytes.







Abstract
Ge4+ substitution into the recently discovered superionic conductor Li7Si2S7I is demonstrated by synthesis of Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I, where x&#8804;1.2. The anion packing and tetrahedral silicon location of Li7Si2S7I are retained upon substitution. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that substitution of larger Ge4+ for Si4+ expands the unit cell volume and further increases Li+ site disorder, such that Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I has one Li+ site more (sixteen in total) than Li7Si2S7I. The ionic conductivity of Li7Si0.8Ge1.2S7I (x=1.2) at 303&#8197;K is 1.02(3)&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with low activation energies for Li+ transport demonstrated over a wide temperature range by AC impedance and 7Li NMR spectroscopy. All sixteen Li+ sites remain occupied to temperatures as low as 30&#8197;K in Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I as a result of the structural expansion. This differs from Li7Si2S7I, where the partial Li+ site ordering observed below room temperature reduces the ionic conductivity. The suppression of Li+ site depopulation by Ge4+ substitution retains the high mobility to temperatures as low as 200&#8197;K, yielding low temperature performance comparable with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li+ ion conducting materials.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8722;N Axially Chiral Aminophosphines via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral P,N ligands were synthesized through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ATH of in situ generated iminophosphines. The transient interaction between iminium and phosphine groups as a Lewis acid&#8208;base pair causes the labilization of the stereogenic axis, enabling the scenario for a DKR. The reaction proceeds with good to high yields and reaching up to 99&#8201;% ee across a range of substrates, including both dicyclohexyl&#8208; and diphenylphosphino derivatives.







Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination via asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) has been used to perform an efficient dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of N&#8208;aryl 2&#8208;formyl pyrroles decorated with a phosphine moiety positioned at the ortho&#8217; position. The strategy relies on the labilization of the stereogenic axis in the substrate facilitated by a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the carbonyl carbon and the phosphorus center. The reaction features broad substrate scope of aliphatic amines and N&#8208;aryl pyrrole scaffolds, and proceeds under very mild conditions to afford P,N atropisomers in good to high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) for both diphenyl and dicyclohexylphosphino derivatives.

         <title>Enantioselective Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Sulfilimines Enabled by Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8211;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl diazonium salt to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters was developed. This strategy offers a general, modular and divergent platform for rapid synthesis of chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups have garnered considerable attention due to their common occurrence in ligands, pharmaceuticals, and insecticides. Nevertheless, enantioselective synthesis of sulfilimines, particularly diaryl sulfilimines remains a challenging and persistent goal. Herein we report a highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8211;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl diazonium salt to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters by Pd catalysis. Bisphosphine ligands bearing sulfinamide groups play a crucial role in achieving high reactivity and selectivity. This approach provides a general, modular and divergent framework for quickly synthesizing chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise challenging to access. In addition, the origins of the high chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity were extensively investigated using density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen in Photocatalytic Gas&#8211;Solid Reactions: Participator vs. Dominator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a dual&#8208;pathway reaction mechanism of lattice oxygen (OL) participation and molecular oxygen oxidation, Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst exhibits efficient complete oxidation of ppm&#8208;level methane and OL plays a dominant role in this reaction. Single&#8208;atom Ru accelerates the O2 activation to &#8901;O2&#8722; and the regeneration of consumed OL during reaction.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen activation has emerged as a popular strategy for optimizing the performance and selectivity of oxide&#8208;based thermocatalysis and electrolysis. However, the significance of lattice oxygen in oxide photocatalysts has been ignored, particularly in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Here, using methane oxidation over a Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst as the prototypical reaction and via 18O isotope labelling techniques, we found that lattice oxygen can directly participate in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Lattice oxygen played a dominant role in the photocatalytic reaction, as determined by estimating the kinetic constants in the initial stage. Furthermore, we discovered that dynamic diffusion between O2 and lattice oxygen proceeded even in the absence of targeted reactants. Finally, single&#8208;atom Ru can facilitate the activation of adsorbed O2 and the subsequent regeneration of consumed lattice oxygen, thus ensuring high catalyst activity and stability. The results provide guidance for next&#8208;generation oxide photocatalysts with improved activities and selectivities.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and the regeneration of consumed O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; during reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lattice-oxygen activation has emerged as a popular strategy for optimizing the performance and selectivity of oxide-based thermocatalysis and electrolysis. However, the significance of lattice oxygen in oxide photocatalysts has been ignored, particularly in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Here, using methane oxidation over a Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;@ZnO single-atom photocatalyst as the prototypical reaction and via &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotope labelling techniques, we found that lattice oxygen can directly participate in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Lattice oxygen played a dominant role in the photocatalytic reaction, as determined by estimating the kinetic constants in the initial stage. Furthermore, we discovered that dynamic diffusion between O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and lattice oxygen proceeded even in the absence of targeted reactants. Finally, single-atom Ru can facilitate the activation of adsorbed O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the subsequent regeneration of consumed lattice oxygen, thus ensuring high catalyst activity and stability. The results provide guidance for next-generation oxide photocatalysts with improved activities and selectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Reprograms Cellular Metabolism to Enhance Photodynamic Therapy and Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer was anchored with the metabolic reprogramming agent 3&#8208;bromopyruvate to enhance photodynamic therapy and antitumor immunity by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to elicit antitumor immunity, reject tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevent lung metastasis.







Abstract
Abnormal cancer metabolism causes hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which limits the antitumor efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we report a photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with anchored 3&#8208;bromopyruvate (BrP), BrP@MOL, as a metabolic reprogramming agent to enhance PDT and antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation during PDT and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to enhance antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL&#8208;mediated PDT inhibited tumor growth by &gt;90&#8201;% with 40&#8201;% of mice being tumor&#8208;free, rejected tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevented lung metastasis. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade potently regressed the tumors with &gt;98&#8201;% tumor inhibition and 80&#8201;% of mice being tumor&#8208;free.

         <title>Depolymerization of Native Lignin over Thiol Capped Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Microbelts Mediated by Photogenerated Thiyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depolymerization of native lignin for the production of functionalized aromatics was realized over irradiated colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 microbelts. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible colloidization&#8208;aggregation for both efficient reaction and facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for the generation of RS&#8901; for selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin.







Abstract
The valorization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic compounds under visible light is appealing yet challenging. In this communication, colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) microbelts was successfully fabricated, which was used as a superior catalyst for depolymerization of native lignin in birch woodmeal under visible light, with an optimum yield of 28.8&#8197;wt&#8201;% to functionalized aromatic monomers achieved in 8&#8197;h. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible interchange of ZIS between the colloidal state for efficient reaction and the aggregated state for facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for light initiated generation of reactive thiyl radical for highly selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bond in native lignin. This work provides a green and efficient strategy for the depolymerization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic monomers under mild conditions, which involves a new mechanism for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin. The capability of cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin by photogenerated thiyl radicals also demonstrates the great potential of using photogenerated thiyl radicals in organics transformations.

         <title>Structural Modulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have adeptly optimized the ORR process through strategic engineering of COFs, effectively transitioning the reaction from a four&#8208;electron pathway to a two&#8208;electron pathway. Significantly, when implemented within a flow cell apparatus, the COF augmented with ionic salt (JUC&#8208;660) demonstrated consistent productivity, maintaining a H2O2 yield rate in excess of 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an extended operational period more than 85&#8197;hours. This performance solidifies its status as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed catalysts reported to date.







Abstract
The electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using metal&#8208;free catalysts has emerged as a viable and sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, the precise architectural design of these electrocatalysts poses a significant challenge, requiring intricate structural engineering to optimize electron transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we introduce a novel design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that effectively shift the ORR from a four&#8208;electron to a more advantageous two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, the JUC&#8208;660 COF, with strategically charge&#8208;modified benzyl moieties, achieved a continuous high H2O2 yield of over 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an impressive duration of over 85&#8197;hours in a flow cell setting, marking it as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed H2O2 electrocatalysts reported to date. Theoretical computations alongside in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that JUC&#8208;660 markedly diminishes the adsorption of the OOH* intermediate, thereby steering the ORR towards the desired pathway. Furthermore, the versatility of JUC&#8208;660 was demonstrated through its application in the electro&#8208;Fenton reaction, where it efficiently and rapidly removed aqueous contaminants. This work delineates a pioneering approach to altering the ORR pathway, ultimately paving the way for the development of highly effective metal&#8208;free H2O2 electrocatalysts.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis of Vinyl Copolymer Carrying Boron Directly Connected to Backbone: Catalytic Esterification through Cooperation of Boron with Neighboring Carboxylic Anhydride</title>

         <dc:description>
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester and maleic anhydride was found to work as a catalyst for direct esterification of alcohol and carboxylic acid. The key to the unprecedented catalytic activity was the activation of carboxylic anhydride by adjacent boron, and the catalytic function through the cooperation of side chains would collect attention as the simple mimic of enzyme.







Abstract
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin) and maleic anhydride (MAH) was found to catalyze direct dehydrative esterification of carboxylic acid and alcohol. The key to the catalytic function is the activation of the MAH unit by the neighboring Lewis acidic boron directly connected to the backbone through the formation of five&#8208;membered ring. The effects of the side&#8208;chain cooperation were clarified through comparisons with the polymers having similar structures and a conventional titanium catalyst as well as the analyses of reactions with carboxylic acid or alcohol. The catalytic activity was enhanced as the molecular weight was higher, which is owing to the structural feature that boron is directly attached to the backbone. The cooperative catalysis is of interest because of its conceptual similarity with enzyme.

         <title>Chirality Interplay between the Interior and Exterior of Metal&#8211;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple stereogenic elements have been embedded into M2L4 metal&#8211;organic cages to control the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages, i.e. within and beyond the first coordination sphere.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic cages featuring two stereogenic elements, in terms of the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges, were exploited. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages. The chirality information induced by a chiral guest inside the cage cavity can pass through the cage framework and influence the orientation of the diazaanthracene segments on the periphery of the cage. In turn, the chirality of a stereogenic center within the diazaanthracene segments can transfer back into the cavity, enabling discrimination of enantiomeric guests.

         <title>Bilateral Unsymmetrical Disulfurating Reagent Design for Polysulfide Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stable and odorless bilateral disulfurating reagents with two divergent mask groups has been established. Diverse arylboronic acids and carbon/nitrogen/sulfur nucleophiles can be sequentially assembled on both sides of a S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Polysulfides are significant compounds in life science, pharmaceutical science, and materials science. Therefore, polysulfide construction is in great demand. The controllable sequential installation of groups on both ends of a S&#8722;S motif faces an enormous challenge owing to the reversible nature of the covalent S&#8722;S bond. A library was established with two divergent mask groups for bilateral unsymmetrical disulfurating reagents (R1O&#8722;SS&#8722;SO2R2). Sequential coupling with preferential activation of the S&#8722;SO2 bond (37.6&#8197;kcal/mol) and controllable activation of the S&#8722;O bond (54.8&#8197;kcal/mol) in the presence of the S&#8722;S bond (62.0&#8197;kcal/mol) enabled successive reactions at each end of the S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides and trisulfides, even for the cross&#8208;linkage of natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides, and a protein (bovine serum albumin).

         <title>Polyelectrolyte Additive&#8208;Modulated Interfacial Microenvironment Boosting CO2 Electrolysis in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acidic CO2 electrolysis offers a promising strategy to achieve high carbon utilization and high energy efficiency. However, challenges remain in suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improving product selectivity. High concentrations of potassium ions (K+) can suppress HER and accelerate CO2 reduction, but they still inevitably suffer from salt precipitation problems. In this study, we demonstrate that the sulfonate&#8208;based polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), enables to reconstruct the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to significantly enhance the acidic CO2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that PSS induces high local K+ concentrations through electrostatic interaction between PSS anions and K+. In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond (H&#8211;bond) network, which is attributed to the H&#8211;bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9% for CO can be achieved at 250 mA cm&#8211;2, simultaneous with a high single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 72.2% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymers containing lactam structures play a crucial role in both natural biological systems and human life, and their synthesis, functions and applications are of utmost importance for biomimetics and the creation of new materials. In this study, we developed an efficient heterogeneous Pauson&#8208;Khand polymerization (h&#8208;PKP) method for the controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s containing &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam functionalities using readily available internal alkynes and imines. The molecular weights of the resulting poly(N&#8208;Ts/&#947;&#8208;lactam)s can be precisely controlled by adjusting the ratio of phenyl formate and nickel. These polymers exhibit high solid&#8208;state luminescence and demonstrate rapid and sensitive dual responsiveness to light and acid stimuli. They further demonstrate strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability. The unique dual&#8208;emission peaks observed in poly(N&#8208;H/&#947;&#8208;lactam)s obtained through post&#8208;treatment under acidic conditions demonstrate a mechanism of aggregation&#8208;induced intermolecular excited&#8208;state proton transfer specific to lactam structures. The efficient one&#8208;pot synthetic method for poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam) provides a novel strategy for constructing polymers with &#947;&#8208;lactam structures in the main chain and the simple and efficient post&#8208;modification method offer a versatile toolbox for functionalizing poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s to expand their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Triggered Spin&#8208;Magnetic Effect in Rare Earth Intra&#8208;particle Heterostructured Nanoalloys for Boosting Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. Alloying RE with conventional 3d transition&#8208;metal (TM) is promising for the fabrication of advanced spin catalysts yet remains much difficulties in preparation, which leads to the mysteries of spin&#8208;magnetic effect between RE and 3d TM on catalysis. Here we define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d TM&#8208;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs) with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework, denoted as RhCo&#8208;RhGd IHAs. They exhibit interface&#8208;triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization. Theoretical calculations further reveal that active sites around the heterointerface with weakened spin polarization optimize the adsorption and dissociation of H2O, thus promoting alkaline hydrogen evolution catalysis. The RhCo&#8208;RhGd IHAs show a small overpotential of 11.3 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, as well as remarkable long&#8208;term stability, far superior to previously reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Curvature&#8208;Induced Electron Spin Catalysis with Carbon Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis by using solid carbon spheres as catalysts, which were synthesized using positive curvature molecular hexabromocyclopentadiene as a precursor molecule, following a radical coupling mechanism. The curvature spin of carbon is regarded as an overlapping state of &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;radical, which is identified by the inverse Laplace transform of pulse&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance. The growth mechanism of carbon spheres abiding by Kroto&#8217;s model, is supported by the density functional theory study of thermodynamics and kinetics calculations. The solid carbon spheres present excellent catalytic behaviour of oxidation coupling of amines to form corresponding imines with the conversion of &gt;99%, selectivity of 98.7%, and yield of 97.7%, which is attributed to the predominantly curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis of carbon, supported by the calculation of oxygen adsorption energy. This work proposes a view of curvature&#8208;induced spin catalysis of carbon, which opens up a research direction for curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Radicals with Emission Peaks over 750 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purely organic molecules exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission possess considerable potential for applications in both biological and optoelectronic technological domains, owing to their inherent advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, biocompatibility, and facile chemical modifiability. However, the repertoire of such molecules with emission peaks exceeding 750 nm and concurrently demonstrating high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) remains relatively scarce due to the energy gap law. Herein, we report two open&#8208;shell NIR radical emitters, denoted as DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM and DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM, achieved through the strategic integration of a donor group (DMNA) onto the Cz&#8208;BTM and PyID&#8208;BTM frameworks, respectively. We found that the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure allows the two designed radical emitters to exhibit a charge&#8208;transfer excited state and spatially separated electron and hole levels with non&#8208;bonding characteristics. Thus, the high&#8208;frequency vibrations are effectively suppressed. Besides, the reduction of low&#8208;frequency vibrations is observed. Collectively, the non&#8208;radiative decay channel is significantly suppressed, leading to exceptional NIR PLQE values. Specifically, DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM manifests an emission peak at 758 nm alongside a PLQE of 55%, whereas DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM exhibits an emission peak at 778 nm with a PLQE of 66%. Notably, these represent the pinnacle of PLQE among metal&#8208;free organic NIR emitters with emission peaks surpassing 750 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Interface Layer Constructed by Trace Zwitterions for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inhomogeneous plating/stripping of Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and parasitic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, severely restricts its cycling life&#8208;span. Here, trace zwitterions (trifluoroacetate pyridine, TFAPD) are introduced into the aqueous electrolyte to construct a multifunctional interface that enhances the reversibility of Zn anode. The TFA&#8722; anions with strong specific adsorption adhere onto the Zn surface to reconstruct the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), preventing the hydrogen evolution and corrosion side reactions caused by free H2O. The Py+ cations accumulate on the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) of Zn anode with the force of electric field during Zn2+ plating, forming a shielding layer to uniformize the deposition of Zn2+. Besides, the adsorbed TFA&#8722; and Py+ promote the desolvation process of Zn2+ resulting in fast reaction kinetics. Thus, the Zn||Zn cells present an outstanding cycling performance of more than 10000 hours. And even at 85% utilization rate of Zn, it can stably cycle for over 200 hours at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Zn||I2 full cell exhibits a capacity retention of over 95% even after 30000 cycles. Remarkably, the Zn||I2 pouch cells (95 mAh) deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention of 99% after 750 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Modification by Ordered Discotic Liquid Crystals for Thermotolerance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditionally used phenylethylamine iodide (PEAI) and its derivatives, such as ortho&#8208;fluorine o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI, in interfacial modification, are beneficial for perovskite solar cell (PSC) efficiency but vulnerable to heat stability above 85 &#176;C due to ion migration. To address this issue, we propose a composite interface modification layer incorporating the discotic liquid crystal 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(pentoxy)triphenylene (HAT5) into o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI. The triphenyl core in HAT5 promotes &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly and enhances its interaction with o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI, forming an oriented columnar phase that improves hole extraction along the one&#8208;dimensional direction. HAT5 repairs structural defects in the interfacial layer and retains the layered structure to inhibit ion migration after annealing. Ultimately, our approach increases the efficiency of solar cells from 23.36% to 25.02%. The thermal stability of the devices retains 80.1% of their initial efficiency after aging at 85 &#176;C for 1008 hours without encapsulation. Moreover, the optimized PSCs maintained their initial efficiency of 82.4% after aging under one sunlight exposure for 1008 hours. This study provides a novel strategy using composite materials for interface modification to enhance the thermal and light stability of semiconductor devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The cycloaddition reaction involving bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) offers a versatile and efficient synthetic platform for producing C(sp3)&#8208;rich rigid bridged ring scaffolds, which act as phenyl bioisosteres. However, there is a scarcity of catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of BCBs to fulfill the need for enantioenriched saturated bicycles in drug design and development. In this study, an efficient synthesis of valuable azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (aza&#8208;BCHs) by an enantioselective zinc&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines is reported. The reaction proceeds effectively with a novel type of BCB that incorporates a 2&#8208;acyl imidazole group and a diverse array of alkynyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted imines. The target aza&#8208;BCHs, which consist of &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers, are efficiently synthesized with up to 94% yield and 96.5:3.5 er under mild conditions. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the reaction follows a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism of BCBs with imines. This mechanism is distinct from previous studies on Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of BCBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic&#8208;Promoted Interatomic Hot Carriers Regulation Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing hot carriers for efficient plasmonic&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) to convert solar energy into secondary energy is one of the most feasible solutions to the global environmental and energy crisis. Finding a plasmonic heterogeneous nanostructure with a more efficient and reasonable hot carrier transport path without affecting the intrinsic plasmonic properties is still a major challenge that urgently needs to be solved in this field. Herein, the mechanism by which plasmonic&#8208;promoted interatomic hot electron redistribution on the surface of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles promotes the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) is successfully clarified. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect can boost the transfer of plasmonic hot electrons from Au atoms to Cu atoms, trigger the interatomic electron regulation of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles, enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, and increase the ammonia yield by approximately 93.9%. This work provides an important reference for rationally designing and utilizing the LSPR effect to efficiently regulate the distribution and mechanism of plasmonic hot carriers on the surface of heterogeneous alloy nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Calibrating the Oxidative Capacity of Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, redox reactions have been reported to occur spontaneously in microdroplets. The origins of such reactivity are still debated, and any systematic correlation of the yield with the reactivity of the reactant is yet to be established. We report the simple, outer&#8208;sphere, one&#8208;electron oxidation of a series of ferrocene derivatives spanning oxidation potentials from &#8722;0.1 V to +0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl generated via nebulization and measured by mass spectrometry of the ferrocenium ions. The reaction environments and dynamics in the droplets are complex, and it is still unclear whether such reactivity correlates with bulk thermodynamic values. Our key finding is that the ion yields decrease monotonically with the oxidation potential of the ferrocenes, which is a thermodynamic quantity. The ion yields emphatically do not obey the Nernstian ratio, revealing the redox processes in the droplets do not follow the assumptions of bulk steady&#8208;state electrochemistry. Furthermore, oxidative competition in the mixture of several ferrocenes suggest a finite oxidative capacity or oxidant concentration. These results demonstrate that even though ion generation could be an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium and kinetically limited process, the oxidative yield in microdroplets does correlate with thermodynamics, suggesting a possible free energy relationship between the kinetics and thermodynamics of the process.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Cyctetryptomycin A and B Enabled by Zr&#8208;Catalyzed Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise synthetic strategy utilizing a Zr&#8208;catalyst for the construction of cyctetryptomycin A and B is herein reported. Cyctetryptomycin A and B are recently isolated, complex tetrameric natural products for which total synthesis has not been previously reported. This study presents a practical approach for the construction of two consecutive quaternary carbon centers via a Zr&#8208;catalyst. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of cyctetryptomycin A and B was achieved by this Zr&#8208;catalyzed radical coupling. The radical dimerization reaction mediated by the Zr&#8208;catalyst required dppe as an indispensable additive. Through both experimental and theoretical investigations into the mechanism of this Zr&#8208;catalyzed reaction, the specific role of dppe was elucidated. In addition, the synthetic approach was extended to enable the practical synthesis of other dimeric natural products, including tetratryptomycin A, dibrevianamide F, and ditryptophenaline. Finally, the synthetic mechanism of cyctetryptomycin A and B, through the oxidative macrocyclization of tetratryptomycin A by CttpC, was newly elucidated by both experimental and docking simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Construction of Polycyclic Heterocycles Containing a [6&#8208;6&#8208;5] or [7&#8208;6&#8208;5] Tricyclic Core Skeleton from a 2&#8208;Isocyanophenyl Propargylic Ester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized isocyanide chemistry represents an important research area in organic synthesis. A structurally unique 2&#8208;isocyanophenl propargylic ester has been designed to incorporate the reactivity of isocyanide and propargylic ester. Thus, the reaction of 2&#8208;isocyanophenyl propargylic ester and 2&#8208;aminoaromatic aldimine facilitates the synthesis of a wide range of polycyclic benzo[b]indolo[3,2&#8208;h][1,6]naphthyridine derivatives. Furthermore, reacting with 2&#8208;hydroxyaromatic aldimine enables the divergent synthesis of both the aforementioned scaffolds and another structurally distinctive diazabenzo[f]naphtho[2,3,4&#8208;ij]azulenes featuring a [7&#8208;6&#8208;5] core skeleton. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that these transformations likely proceed via the in situ generation of a strained cyclopropen&#8208;imine species followed by [3+2] cycloaddition. Next, switchable nucleophilic attack/ring&#8208;expansion/aromatization and nucleophilic addition/ring&#8208;expansion/elimination account for the observed selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Sodium Ion Batteries Enabled by Switching Sodiophobic Graphite into Sodiophilic and High&#8208;Capacity Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the crustal abundance of sodium element, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a promising complementary to lithium&#8208;ion battery for stationary energy storage applications. The cointercalation chemistry enables the use of cost&#8208;effective graphite as anodes, whereas the low capacity (&lt;130 mAh g&#8208;1) and high redox potential (&gt;0.6 V vs. Na/Na+) of graphite significantly limit the energy density of SIBs. Herein, we induce the high&#8208;capacity Na metal into sodiophilic ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t&#8208;GICs) via co&#8208;intercalation and deposition reactions, thereby achieving Na/t&#8208;GIC anodes with high capacities and low working voltage (0.18 V). The new anodes exhibit high coulombic efficiencies of above 99.7 % over 550 cycles and a high&#8208;rate capacity of 588.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 6 C (10 min per charge). When it is paired with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes, the SIBs demonstrate a high energy density of 259 Wh kg&#8208;1both electrodes surpassing that of commercial LiFePO4//graphite batteries. The outstanding anode performance is attributed to the tailored sodiophilicity of graphite through manipulating the ether solvents and the in&#8208;situ generated space among t&#8208;GIC flakes to stably accommodate Na metal. Our findings for stable Na plating/striping on sodiophilic graphite materials provide an effective approach for developing advanced SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mirror&#8208;Image Random Nonstandard Peptide Integrated Discovery (MI&#8208;RaPID) Technology Yields Highly Stable and Selective Macrocyclic Peptide Inhibitors for Matrix Metallopeptidase 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) plays a crucial role in cancer metastasis and progression, making it an attractive target for therapeutic development. However, the development of selective MMP7 inhibitors is challenging due to the conservation of active sites across various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we have developed mirror&#8208;image random nonstandard peptides integrated discovery (MI&#8208;RaPID) technology to discover innate protease&#8208;resistant macrocyclic peptides that specifically bind to and inhibit human MMP7. One identified macrocyclic peptide against&#160;D&#8208;MMP7, termed&#160;D20, was synthesized in its mirror&#8208;image form,&#160;D&#8217;20, consisting of 12&#160;D&#8208;amino acids, one cyclic&#160;b&#8208;amino acid, and a thioether bond. Notably, it potently inhibited MMP7 with an IC50&#160;value of 90 nM, and showed excellent selectivity over other MMPs&#160;with similar substrate specificity. Moreover,&#160;D&#8217;20&#160;inhibited the migration of pancreatic cell line CFPAC&#8208;1, but had no effect on the cell proliferation and viability.&#160;D&#8217;20&#160;exhibited excellent stability in human serum, as well as in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids.&#160;This study highlights that MI&#8208;RaPID technology can serve as a powerful tool to develop&#160;in vivo&#160;stable macrocyclic peptides for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) plays a crucial role in cancer metastasis and progression, making it an attractive target for therapeutic development. However, the development of selective MMP7 inhibitors is challenging due to the conservation of active sites across various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we have developed mirror-image random nonstandard peptides integrated discovery (MI-RaPID) technology to discover innate protease-resistant macrocyclic peptides that specifically bind to and inhibit human MMP7.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high&#8208;value carbon&#8208;based chemicals provides a sustainable approach to achieving an artificial carbon cycle. In the decade, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a kind of porous crystalline porous materials featuring well&#8208;defined structures, large surface area, high porosity, diverse components, easy tailorability, and controllable morphology, have attracted considerable research attention, serving as electrocatalysts to drive CO2 reduction. In this review, the reaction mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction and the structure/component advantages of MOFs meeting the requirements of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction are analyzed. After that, the representative progress for the precise fabrication of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, focusing on catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation, are systemically summarized. Furthermore, the emerging applications and promising research for more practical scenarios related to electrochemical CO2 conversion are specifically proposed. Finally, the remaining challenges and future outlook of MOFs for electrochemical CO2 reduction are further discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Annealing Effects on Long&#8208;lived Fluorenol Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Styrene Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorene derivatives have been widely developed in OLEDs because of its efficient fluorescence quantum efficiency, but for which unique rigid biphenyl planar structure and large conjugated system, we hypothesize that they have a great potential for room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) applications, and confirmed this conjecture by subjecting polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and phosphors to thermal annealing. The cross&#8208;linked structure formed during thermal annealing judiciously modulates the phosphorescence emission characteristics of the fluorenol with the synergistic interaction between PVA and fluorenol. Specifically, the lifetime exhibited a substantial increase from 1352.2 ms to 2874.1 ms, accompanied by a quantum yield augmentation from 4.8% to 11.3%, which substantiate that cross&#8208;linked induced by thermal annealing effectively amplifies the phosphorescent intensity and stability of the phosphors, facilitating ultralong phosphorescent emission at ambient conditions. Furthermore, an effective probe based on this film is developed for its highly sensitive, quantitative and immediate detection of volatile organic compounds. This investigation not only proffers a novel paradigm for the development of advanced RTP materials but also imparts insightful considerations for optimizing the performance of polymers in conjunction with functional materials, encompassing bioimaging, sensing, and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Stable Chiral Aminosulfonium Ylides and Their Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isolation and catalytic enantioselective synthesis of configurationally stable S&#8208;stereogenic sulfonium ylides has been a significant challenge in the field of asymmetric synthesis. These reactive intermediates are crucial for a variety of synthetic transformations, yet their inherent tendency towards rapid inversion at the sulfur stereocenter has hindered their practical utilization. Conventional approaches have focused on strategies that incorporate a C=S bond&#8208;containing cyclic framework to help mitigate this stereochemical lability. In this work, we present an alternative tactic that leverages the stabilizing influence of an adjacent N&#8208;atom and cyclic sulfide moiety. Exploiting a copper catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular carbene transfer reaction, structurally diverse S&#8208;stereogenic aminosulfonium ylides have been achieved in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Experimental results indicate that the careful selection of 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketone precursors is crucial for achieving optimal stereoinduction in this transformation. The resulting highly enantioenriched aminosulfonium ylides allow for further stereospecific elaborations to furnish aminosulfonium ylide oxides and sulfinamide. This work expands the boundaries of chiral sulfonium ylide chemistry, providing access to a broad range of previously elusive S&#8208;stereogenic aminosulfonium ylide scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Coordination Solvation Structure for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries via Electric Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unveiling inherent interactions among solvents, Li+ ions, and anions are crucial in dictating solvation&#8208;desolvation kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Developing an electrolyte with a low ion&#8208;transport barrier and minimal solvent coordination in its interfacial solvation structure is essential for forming an anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, a key component for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries. In this study, we harness electric dipole&#8208;dipole synergistic interactions to formulate an electrolyte with significantly reduced interfacial solvent coordination. Operando characterization and theoretical analysis reveal that 2&#8208;fluoropyridine (FPy) with high dipole preferentially adsorbs onto the Li metal surface. The adsorbed FPy molecule squeezes succinonitrile in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance, leading to the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. Consequently, the introduction of FPy enhances the reversible capacity of the LiCoO2||Li cell, which maintains a capacity of 143 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles at a 1C rate. Moreover, the cycle life of LiCoO2 batteries with a limited supply of lithium extends from 120 cycles to over 200 cycles. These findings offer a strategy that can be applied broadly to design interfacial solvation structures for various metal&#8208;ion/metal&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Shotgun Sequencing of 512&#8208;mer Copolyester Allows Random Access to Stored Information</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Digital information encoded in polymers has been exclusively decoded by mass spectrometry. However, the size limit of analytes in mass spectrometry restricts the storage capacity per chain. In addition, sequential decoding hinders random access to the bits of interest without full&#8208;chain sequencing. Here we report the shotgun sequencing of a 512&#8208;mer sequence&#8208;defined polymer whose molecular weight (57.3 kDa) far exceeds the analytical limit of mass spectrometry. A 4&#8208;bit fragmentation code was implemented at aperiodic positions during the synthetic encoding of 512&#8208;bit information without affecting storage capacity per chain. Upon activating the fragmentation code, the polymer chain splits into 18 oligomers, which could be individually decoded by tandem&#8208;mass sequencing. These sequences were computationally reconstructed into a full sequence using an error&#8208;detection method. The proposed sequencing method eliminates the storage limit of a single polymer chain and allows random access to the bits of interest without full&#8208;chain sequencing.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbenoids with Sulfinate as Nucleofuge for Matteson&#8208;Type Homologation: Direct Insertion of Oxygen&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Substituted Units into Carbon&#8210;Boron Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbenoid insertion into boronate carbon&#8722;boron bonds, namely the Matteson&#8208;type homologation, has been recognized as a powerful tool for constructing carbon&#8722;carbon bonds. However, some limitations and inconvenience still exist with the carbenoids currently employed, such as the use of highly cryogenic and basic conditions. Herein, we report a new class of stable carbenoids with sulfinate as nucleofuge for Matteson&#8208;type homologations, which directly introduce O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituted methylenes into carbon&#8722;boron bonds. Enabled by oxazaborolidines as the boronic substrates, the reaction is operatable at 0 oC or room temperature with weaker bases. Broad functional groups, including acidic C&#8722;H bonds, can be tolerated. The synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and iterative insertion of various carbenoids.</dc:description>

The synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated in the gram-scale synthesis and iterative insertion of various carbenoids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eliminating Hydrogen Fluoride through Piperidine&#8208;Doped Separators for Stable Li Metal Batteries with Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrofluoric acid (HF)&#8208;induced electrode and interfacial structure degeneration poses a significant challenge for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To address this issue, we propose a separator strategy that involves decorating a regular polyethylene (PE) separator with molecular sieves (TW) impregnated with piperidine (PI). The porous structure of the TW serves as a reaction chamber for PI and HF. As a result, the HF content in the controlled electrolyte with 500 ppm H2O (ELE&#8208;500) is notably reduced when using TW@PI&#8208;PE separators, thereby shielding nickel&#8208;rich cathodes from HF etching. Simultaneously, due to the hydrolysis of Li salts, and the inertness of PI towards H2O, a uniform lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase can form on the Li metal anode, further mitigating dendrite formation. The lifespan of the symmetric Li cell using the TW@PI&#8208;PE separator is doubled in ELE&#8208;500, exhibiting stable 500&#8208;hour cycles at 3 mA cm&#8722;2 and 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Additionally, with the effective limitation of transition metal (TM) dissolution, the 4.6&#8208;V LMBs employing a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode maintain an 81% capacity retention over 100 cycles, even in ELE&#8208;1000. The innovative TW@PI system presented here offers a fresh perspective for future research aimed at eliminating HF in LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Solvent Free DLP 3D Printing of Degradable Poly(Allyl Glycidyl Ether Succinate)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Digital light processing (DLP) printing forms solid constructs from fluidic resins by photochemically crosslinking polymeric resins with reactive functional groups. DLP is used widely due to its efficient, high&#8208;resolution printing, but its use and translational potential has been limited in some applications as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art resins experience unpredictable and anisotropic part shrinkage due to the use of solvent needed to reduce resin viscosity and layer dependent crosslinking. Herein, poly(allyl glycidyl ether succinate) (PAGES), a low viscosity, degradable polyester, was synthesized by ring opening copolymerization and used in combination with degradable thiol crosslinkers to afford a solvent free resin that can be utilized in DLP printing. Varying resin formulations of PAGES polymer are shown to decrease part shrinkage from 14% to 0.3%. Photochemically printed parts fabricated from PAGES possess tensile moduli between 0.43 and 6.18 MPa and degradation profiles are shown to vary between 12 and 40 days under accelerated conditions based on degree of polymerization and crosslink ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Energy Transfer in the Sensitization of Americium Enables Observation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from a molecular americium (Am) complex is reported. Coordination of Am(III) by a combination of thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and chiral diphosphine oxide ligands yielded a complex with strong sensitized metal&#8208;centered luminescence. The energy transfer process for sensitization appears to occur via a unique resonant pathway, which results in the removal of the overlap between ligand phosphorescence and sensitized Am luminescence that has always been observed. Owing to this feature, and despite the limited amount of material that could be used due to the radioactivity of 241Am, CPL could be measured. The collected luminescence and CPL spectra provide insight into the crystal field splitting of the 5D1 &#8594; 7F1 transition. These results pave the way for future studies of Am(III) luminescence to investigate electronic structure effects in this and other 5f elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Configurational Isomerization&#8208;Induced Orientation Switching: Non&#8208;Fused Ring Dipodal Phosphonic Acids as Hole&#8208;Extraction Layers for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonic acid (PA) self&#8208;assembled molecules have recently emerged as efficient hole&#8208;extraction layers (HELs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the structural effects of PAs on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on indium tin oxide (ITO) and thus photovoltaic performance remain obscure. Herein, we present a novel class of PAs, namely &#8220;non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids&#8221; (NFR&#8208;DPAs), featuring simple and malleable non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchoring groups. The efficacy of configurational isomerism in modulating the photoelectronic properties and switching molecular orientation of PAs atop electrodes results in distinct substrate surface energy and electronic characteristics. The NFR&#8208;DPA with linear (C2h symmetry) and brominated backbone exhibits favorable face&#8208;on orientation and enhanced work function modification capability compared to its angular (C2v symmetry) and non&#8208;brominated counterparts. This makes it versatile HELs in mitigating interfacial resistance for energy barrier&#8208;free hole collection, and affording optimal active layer morphology, which results in an impressive efficiency of 19.11% with a low voltage loss of 0.52 V for binary OSC devices and an excellent efficiency of 19.66% for ternary OSC devices. This study presents a new dimension to design PA&#8208;based HELs for high&#8208;performance OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Reaction Induced Compressive Strain for Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium&#8208;based inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising light&#8208;harvesting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their promising thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. However, obstacles to commercialization remain regarding their phase instability. In this work, we report a facile and effective strategy to regulate the surface compressive strain via in&#8208;situ surface reaction to stabilize CsPbI3 perovskite. The use of a chelating ligand with a molecular configuration closely matching the integer multiples of the unit cell lattice parameters of CsPbI3 induces compressive strain at the surface of CsPbI3. The chemical bonding and strain modulation synergistically not only passivate film defects, but also inhibit perovskite phase degradation, thus significantly improving the intrinsic stability of inorganic perovskite. Consequently, enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.0% and 18.6% were respectively achieved in 0.16&#8208;cm2 lab&#8208;scale devices and 25.3&#8208;cm2 solar modules. Further, surface reaction enables PSCs with enhanced thermal and operational stability; these devices retain over 95% of their initial PCE after damp&#8208;heat tests (i.e., in 85 &#8451; and 85% R.H. air) for 2000 h, and remain 99% of their initial PCE after operating for 2000 h, representing one of the most stable inorganic PSCs reported so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Coordination&#8208;Accelerated Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emission for Efficient Solution&#8208;Processible Ultrapure Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) type emitters have emerged as highly promising candidates for high&#8208;resolution organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions with simultaneous short excited state lifetimes and ultrapure blue color (a CIEy close to 0.046 and an emission peak &gt; 440 nm) have rarely been obtained for MR emitters. Herein, we report a design of dual gold&#8208;coordinated MR molecules to achieve efficient and short&#8208;lived ultrapure blue TADF emission. The dinuclear Au(I) complex, namely iPrAuBN, shows a narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with a peak maximum of 448 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29 nm in doped film. The coordination with two Au atoms significantly shortens the delayed fluorescence lifetime to 7.8 &#956;s in comparing with 60.6 &#956;s for the organic analogue. Solution&#8208;processed OLED doped with iPrAuBN demonstrates an ultrapure blue electroluminescence with a peak maximum of 442 nm, a FWHM of 19 nm, Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.154, 0.036), and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 14.8%.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic Ion Barrier&#8208;Enabled Ultradurable Zn (002) Plane Orientation towards Long&#8208;Life Anode&#8208;Less Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A steric hindrance/electric field shielding&#8208;driven &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; is engineered towards ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed Zn stripping/plating in original Zn2+&#8208;free hydrated electrolytes. As&#8208;assembled anode&#8208;less Zn&#8214;VOPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O full cells (N/P ratio: 2&#8201;:&#8201;1) show a high energy density of 75.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 full electrode after 842&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, far surpassing conventional counterpart with thick Zn anode and low cathode loading mass.







Abstract
Gradual disability of Zn anode and high negative/positive electrode (N/P) ratio usually depreciate calendar life and energy density of aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). Herein, within original Zn2+&#8208;free hydrated electrolytes, a steric hindrance/electric field shielding&#8208;driven &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; is engineered towards ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed Zn stripping/plating to solve this issue. Guided by theoretical simulations, hydrophobic adiponitrile (ADN) is employed as a steric hindrance agent to ally with inert electric field shielding additive (Mn2+) for plane adsorption priority manipulation, thereby constructing the &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221;. This design robustly suppresses the (002) plane/dendrite growth, enabling ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed dendrite&#8208;free Zn stripping/plating. Even being cycled in Zn&#8214;Zn symmetric cell over 2150&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the efficacy remains well&#8208;kept. Additionally, Zn&#8214;Zn symmetric cells can be also stably cycled over 918&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, verifying uncompromised Zn stripping/plating kinetics. As&#8208;assembled anode&#8208;less Zn&#8214;VOPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O full cells with a low N/P ratio (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) show a high energy density of 75.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1full electrode after 842&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, far surpassing counterparts with thick Zn anode and low cathode loading mass, featuring excellent practicality. This study opens a new avenue by robust &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; design to develop long&#8208;life anode&#8208;less Zn batteries.

         <title>In Vivo Synthetic Anticancer Approach by Resourcing Mouse Blood Albumin as a Biocompatible Artificial Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), capable of in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, were prepared using circulating albumin in the bloodstream, through the reaction with a ruthenium catalyst. The in situ prepared ArM was transported to the cancer and catalyzed a reaction with proapoptotic peptides, effectively suppressing cancer proliferation.







Abstract
Methods for producing drugs directly at the cancer site, particularly using bioorthogonal metal catalysts, are being explored to mitigate the side effects of therapy. Albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyze reactions in living mice while protecting the catalyst in the hydrophobic pocket. Here, we describe the in situ preparation and application of biocompatible tumor&#8208;targeting ArMs using circulating albumin, which is abundant in the bloodstream. The ArM was formed using blood albumin through the intravenous injection of ruthenium conjugated with an albumin&#8208;binding ligand; the tumor&#8208;targeting unit was conjugated to the ArM using its catalytic activity, and the ArM was transported to the cancer site. The delivered ArM catalyzed a second tagging reaction of the proapoptotic peptide on the cancer surface, successfully suppressing cancer proliferation. This approach, which efficiently leveraged the persisting reactivity twice in vivo, holds promise for future in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis utilizing endogenous albumin.

         <title>Electrochemical Skeletal Indole Editing via Nitrogen Atom Insertion by Sustainable Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct editing of the core heterocyclic skeleton of pharmaceutical lead compounds typically relies on superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents. Herein, we report the electrochemical nitrogen atom insertion reaction into indoles enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, leading to the formation of biologically active quinazoline scaffolds.







Abstract
Skeletal molecular editing gained considerable recent momentum and emerged as a uniquely powerful tool for late&#8208;stage diversifications. Thus far, superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents were largely required for skeletal indole editing. In contrast, we herein show that electricity enables sustainable nitrogen atom insertion reactions to give bio&#8208;relevant quinazoline scaffolds without stoichiometric chemical redox&#8208;waste product. The transition metal&#8208;free electro&#8208;editing was enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and proved robust on scale, while tolerating a variety of valuable functional groups.

         <title>Highly Anion&#8208;Conductive Viologen&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Membranes as Nanopower Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a fully crystalline viologen&#8208;based 2DP (V2DP) membrane that can simultaneously achieve high ionic flux and selectivity, possessing great positive charge density and abundant ion transport nanochannels. Benefitting from the tailored pore size of 4.5&#8197;nm, it demonstrates an impressive current density of 5.5&#215;103&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2 and maintains a substantial anion selectivity of 0.70, as a result, it realizes a remarkable power density of 55&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) and their layer&#8208;stacked 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) membranes hold great potential for harvesting sustainable osmotic energy. The nascent research has yet to simultaneously achieve high ionic flux and selectivity, primarily due to inefficient ion transport dynamics. This is directly related to ultrasmall pore size (&lt;3&#8197;nm), much smaller than the duple Debye length in the diluted electrolyte (6&#8211;20&#8197;nm), as well as low charge density (&lt;4.5&#8197;mC&#8201;m&#8722;2). Here, we introduce a &#960;&#8208;conjugated viologen&#8208;based 2DP (V2DP) membrane possessing a large pore size of 4.5&#8197;nm, strategically enhancing the overlapping of the electric double layer, coupled with an exceptional positive surface charge density (~6&#8197;mC&#8201;m&#8722;2). These characteristics enable the membrane to facilitate high anion flux while maintaining ideal selectivity. Notably, V2DP membranes realize an impressive current density of 5.5&#215;103&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2, surpassing benchmarks set by previously reported nanofluidic membranes. In the practical application scenario involving the mixing of artificial seawater and river water, the V2DP membranes exhibit a considerable ion transference number of 0.70 towards Cl&#8722;, contributing to an outstanding power density of ~55&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations reveal the important role of the large quantity of anion transport sites, which act as binding sites evenly located in the positively charged N&#8208;containing pyridine rings. These binding sites enable kinematic coupling and decoupling between anions and the V2DP skeleton, establishing a continuous Cl&#8722; ion transport pathway. This work demonstrates the great promise of large&#8208;area ultrathin 2DP membranes featuring highly organized charged ion transport networks when applied for osmotic energy conversion.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) and their layer-stacked 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) membranes hold great potential for harvesting sustainable osmotic energy. The nascent research has yet to simultaneously achieve high ionic flux and selectivity, primarily due to inefficient ion transport dynamics. This is directly related to ultrasmall pore size (&amp;lt;3&#8197;nm), much smaller than the duple Debye length in the diluted electrolyte (6&#8211;20&#8197;nm), as well as low charge density (&amp;lt;4.5&#8197;mC&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Here, we introduce a &#960;-conjugated viologen-based 2DP (V2DP) membrane possessing a large pore size of 4.5&#8197;nm, strategically enhancing the overlapping of the electric double layer, coupled with an exceptional positive surface charge density (~6&#8197;mC&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). These characteristics enable the membrane to facilitate high anion flux while maintaining ideal selectivity. Notably, V2DP membranes realize an impressive current density of 5.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;A&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing benchmarks set by previously reported nanofluidic membranes. In the practical application scenario involving the mixing of artificial seawater and river water, the V2DP membranes exhibit a considerable ion transference number of 0.70 towards Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, contributing to an outstanding power density of ~55&#8197;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical calculations reveal the important role of the large quantity of anion transport sites, which act as binding sites evenly located in the positively charged N-containing pyridine rings. These binding sites enable kinematic coupling and decoupling between anions and the V2DP skeleton, establishing a continuous Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion transport pathway. This work demonstrates the great promise of large-area ultrathin 2DP membranes featuring highly organized charged ion transport networks when applied for osmotic energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Se&#8208;Elemental Concentration Gradient Regulation for Efficient Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells With High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative Se&#8208;elemental concentration gradient regulation strategy has been exploited for the first time through TA&#8208;synergistic dual&#8208;sulfur source to prepare high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 films. This strategy regulates the energy level structures to produce a favourable energy band structure, suppressing hole&#8208;transport energy level barrier and amplifying electron&#8208;transport driving force. The champion Sb2(S,Se)3 PHJ solar cell displays an considerable efficiency of 9.28&#8201;% with the highest Voc of 0.70&#8197;V (&#951;&gt;9.0&#8201;%).







Abstract
Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3), featuring large absorption coefficient, excellent crystal structure stability, benign non&#8208;toxic characteristic, outstanding humidity and ultraviolet tolerability, has recently attracted enormous attention and research interest regarding its photoelectric conversion properties. However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) for Sb2(S,Se)3&#8208;based photovoltaic devices is relatively low, especially for the device with a high power conversion efficiency (&#951;). Herein, an innovative Se&#8208;elemental concentration gradient regulation strategy has been exploited to produce high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 films on TiO2/CdS substrates through a thioacetamide(TA)&#8208;synergistic dual&#8208;sulfur source hydrothermal&#8208;processed method. The Se&#8208;elemental gradient distribution produces a favorable energy band structure, which suppresses the energy level barriers for hole transport and enhances the driving force for electron transport in Sb2(S,Se)3 film. This facilitates efficient charge transport/separation of photogenerated carriers and boosts significantly the Voc of Sb2(S,Se)3 photovoltaic devices. The champion TA&#8208;Sb2(S,Se)3 planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cell displays an considerable &#951; of 9.28&#8201;% accompanied by an exciting Voc rising to 0.70&#8197;V that is currently the highest among Sb2(S,Se)3&#8208;based solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 9.0&#8201;%. This research is anticipated to contribute to the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film and the achievement of efficient inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 PHJ photovoltaic device.

         <title>Carbonic Anhydrase Variants Catalyze the Reduction of Dialkyl Ketones with High Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones containing two similar alkyl groups is challenging. Although human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) naturally catalyzes the reaction of achiral water and CO2 to form achiral carbonic acid, the active zinc site in hCAII catalyzes, through a zinc&#8208;hydride, highly enantioselective reductions of a wide range of dialkyl ketones. Variants of hCAII react with distinct selectivites.







Abstract
Human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) naturally catalyzes the reaction between two achiral molecules&#8212;water and carbon dioxide&#8212;to yield the achiral product carbonic acid through a zinc hydroxide intermediate. We have previously shown that a zinc hydride, instead of a hydroxide, can be generated in this enzyme to create a catalyst for the reduction of aryl ketones. Dialkyl ketones are more challenging to reduce, and the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with two alkyl groups that are similar in size and electronic properties, is a particularly challenging transformation to achieve with high activity and selectivity. Here, we show that hCAII, as well as a double mutant of it, catalyzes the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with high yields and enantioselectivities, even when the two alkyl groups are similar in size. We also show that variants of hCAII catalyze the site&#8208;selective reduction of one ketone over the other in an unsymmetrical aliphatic diketone. Computational docking of a dialkyl ketone to variants of hCAII containing the zinc hydride provides insights into the origins of the reactivity of various substrates and the high enantioselectivity of the transformations and show how a confined environment can control the enantioselectivity of an abiological intermediate.

         <title>Coupling Manipulation of Interfacial Chemistry and Coordination Structure in Vanadium Oxides Enables Rapid Magnesium Ion Diffusion Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are a highly promising energy storage system due to their high volumetric capacity and intrinsic safety. However, the practical development of RMBs is hindered by the sluggish Mg2+ diffusion kinetics, including at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) and within the cathode bulk. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to manipulate the interfacial chemistry and coordination structure in oligolayered V2O5 (L&#8208;V2O5) for achieving rapid Mg2+ diffusion kinetics. In terms of the interfacial chemistry, the specific exposed crystal planes in L&#8208;V2O5 possess strong electron donating ability, which helps to promote the degradation dynamics of C&#8211;F/C&#8211;S bonds in the electrolyte, thereby establishing the inorganic&#8208;organic interlocking CEI layer for rapid Mg2+ diffusion. In terms of the coordination structure, the straightened V&#8208;O structure in L&#8208;V2O5 provides efficient ions diffusion path for accelerating Mg2+ diffusion in the cathode. As a result, the L&#8208;V2O5 delivers a high reversible capacity (355.3 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1) and an excellent rate capability (161 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1). Impressively, the interdigital micro&#8208;RMBs is firstly assembled, exhibiting excellent flexibility and practicability. This work gives deeper insights into the interface and interior ions diffusion for developing high&#8208;kinetics RMBs.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to manipulate the interfacial chemistry and coordination structure in oligolayered V2O5 (L-V2O5) for achieving rapid Mg2+ diffusion kinetics. In terms of the interfacial chemistry, the specific exposed crystal planes in L-V2O5 possess strong electron donating ability, which helps to promote the degradation dynamics of C&#8211;F/C&#8211;S bonds in the electrolyte, thereby establishing the inorganic-organic interlocking CEI layer for rapid Mg2+ diffusion. In terms of the coordination structure, the straightened V-O structure in L-V2O5 provides efficient ions diffusion path for accelerating Mg2+ diffusion in the cathode.

         <dc:description>The control of enantioselectivity in radical cation reactions presents long&#8208;standing challenges, despite a few successful examples. We introduce a novel strategy of asymmetric counteranion&#8208;directed electrocatalysis to address enantioselectivity in radical cation chemistry. This concept has been successfully demonstrated in two reactions: an asymmetric dehydrogenative indole&#8208;phenol [3 + 2] coupling and an atroposelective C&#8208;H/N&#8208;H dehydrogenative coupling. These reactions have enabled the synthesis of benzofuroindolines and C&#8208;N axially chiral indoles with high yields and excellent enantiomeric excesses. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed a radical&#8208;radical coupling mechanism. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the indole radical cation as the pivotal intermediate, rather than a neutral indolyl radical, shedding new light on the underlying processes driving these reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonflammable Fluorinated Electrolyte Realizing High Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Zn Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the low decomposition potential of H2O and its corrosive effect to Zn foil, the Zn metal battery with aqueous electrolytes operates within a narrow electrochemical window and exhibits low anode utilization ratio. Fluorinated carbonate ester, exhibiting low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, is suitable for constructing high&#8208;voltage batteries, yet its application in Zn metal battery has been scarcely explored. Herein, we propose an electrolyte based on fluorinated solvents and ethoxy (pentafluoro) cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) additive, which exhibits a high decomposition voltage of 2.75 V in Zn batteries. The fluorinated carbonate esters possess non&#8208;flammability and exhibit reduced solvation capacity which in turn promotes the incorporation of anions into Zn2+ solvation shell. Consequently, an anion&#8208;derived interface layer is formed on Zn anode, aiding the compact and planar growth of deposited Zn. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell exhibits an impressive Zn utilization of 91% for 140 h, a level seldom reported previously. Benefitting from the oxidation resistant solvents and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface layer formed by PFPN additive, the Zn//graphite dual&#8208;ions battery shows an extended cycling life of 1000 cycles. Furthermore, an anode&#8208;free cell was constructed and stably operated for 100 cycles, with a notably high average discharge midpoint voltage of 1.84 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Ternary Cluster: Polyoxometalate Cluster Sandwiched by Gold Clusters Protected by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coinage metal (Au, Ag, Cu) cluster and polyoxometalate (POM) cluster represent two types of subnanometer &#8220;artificial atoms&#8221; with significant potential in catalysis, sensing, and nanomedicine. While composite clusters combining Ag/Cu clusters with POM have achieved considerable success, the assembly of gold clusters with POM is still lagging. Herein, we first designedly synthesized two cluster structural units: an Au3O cluster stabilized by diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands and an amine&#8208;terminated POM linker. The subsequent reaction involved amine substitution in the POM linker for the central O atom in the Au3O cluster, resulting in the first ternary composite cluster &#8213; a POM cluster sandwiched by two Au clusters protected by NHCs. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and other characteristic methods characterized their atomically precise structures. Furthermore, altering the NHC ligands decreased the number of gold atoms in the sandwich structures, accompanying the different protonated degrees of amine ligand in the terminal end of the POM linker. These composite clusters showed excellent performances in catalytic H2O2 conversion through the synergistic effect between gold clusters and POM clusters. This work opens a new avenue to functional composite metal clusters and would promote their enhanced catalysis applications through intercluster synergistic interactions within composite systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling by Solid Additive for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling&#160;can hinder exciton&#160;transport and&#160;induce undesirable non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in a shortened exciton diffusion distance and constrained&#160;exciton dissociation in organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, suppressing&#160;electron&#8208;phonon coupling is crucially important for achieve high&#8208;performance&#160;OSCs. Here, we employ the solid additive to regulating electron&#8208;phonon coupling in OSCs. The planar configuration of SA1 confers a significant advantage in suppressing lattice vibrations in the active layers, reducing&#160;the scattering of excitons by phonons caused by lattice vibrations. Consequently, a slow but sustained hole transfer process is identified in the SA1&#8208;assisted film, indicating an enhancement in hole transfer efficiency.&#160;Prolonged&#160;exciton diffusion length and exciton lifetime are achieved in the&#160;blend film processed with SA1, attributed to a low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate&#160;and low energetic disorder&#160;for charge carrier transport. As a result,&#160;a high&#160;efficiency&#160;of&#160;20% was achieved for ternary device with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current. This work highlights the important role of suppressing electron&#8208;phonon coupling in improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Multifunctional Organic Molecules via Michael Addition Reaction to Manage Perovskite Crystallization and Defect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additive engineering plays a pivotal role in achieving high&#8208;quality light&#8208;absorbing layers for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Various functional groups within the additives exert distinct regulatory effects on the perovskite layer. However, few additive molecules can synergistically fulfill the dual functions of regulating crystallization and passivating defects. Here, we custom&#8208;synthesized 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidone (UPy) organic small molecules with diverse functional groups as additives to modulate crystallization and defects in perovskite films via the Michael addition reaction. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that the &#8208;OH groups in UPy exhibit significant effects in fixing uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, passivation of lead&#8208;iodide antisite defects, alleviating hysteresis, and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Furthermore, the enhanced C=O and &#8208;NH2 motifs interact with the A&#8208;site cation via hydrogen bonding, which relieves residual strain and adjusts crystal orientation. This strategy effectively controls perovskite crystallization and passivates defects, ultimately enhancing the quality of perovskite films. Consequently, the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the UPy&#8208;based p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs reaches 1.20 V, and the fill factor surpasses 84%. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 25.75%. Remarkably, the unencapsulated device maintained 96.9% and 94.5% of its initial efficiency following 3,360 hours of dark storage and 1,866 hours of 1&#8208;sun illumination, respectively.</dc:description>

Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that the -OH groups in UPy exhibit significant effects in fixing uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, passivation of lead-iodide antisite defects, alleviating hysteresis, and reducing non-radiative recombination.

This strategy effectively controls perovskite crystallization and passivates defects, ultimately enhancing the quality of perovskite films. Consequently, the open-circuit voltage of the UPy-based p-i-n PSCs reaches 1.20 V, and the fill factor surpasses 84%. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 25.75%.

         <title>Stochastic Sensing of Chloride Anions Using an &#945;&#8208;Hemolysin Pore with a semiaza&#8208;Bambusuril Adapter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stochastic sensing of chloride anions has been developed by employing a semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter inside the &#946; barrel of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin pore. When the chloride receptor blocks the protein pore, it inhibits the ionic current through the pore, providing a single&#8208;molecule sensing technology and concomitantly allowing detection of its chloride guest. The kinetic parameters are deduced from the single&#8208;channel recordings in the absence and presence of chloride anions.







Abstract
Pores containing molecular adapters provide internal selective binding sites, thereby allowing the stochastic sensing of analytes. Herein, we demonstrate that semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) acts as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter when lodged within the lumen of the wild&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (WT&#8208;&#945;HL) protein pore. Because the bambusurils are recognized as anion receptors, the anion binding site within the adapter&#8208;nanopore complex allows the detection of chloride anions, thus converting a non&#8208;selective pore into an anion sensor.

         <title>Discovery, Characterization and Synthetic Application of a Promiscuous Nonheme Iron Biocatalyst with Dual Hydroxylase/Desaturase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alpha&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) have recently emerged as useful biocatalysts for C&#8211;H oxidation and functionalization. In this work, we characterized a new &#945;KGD from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, which displays broad promiscuity toward a number of substrates with different ring systems. Unexpectedly, AneA was found to be capable of both desaturation and hydroxylation and require an amino ester motif on its substrate for productive catalysis. Insights gathered from the biochemical characterization and substrate&#8208;activity profiling of AneA enabled the development of a chemoenzymatic strategy toward several complex sesquiterpenoids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bandgap&#8208;Tuned Tetragonal Perovskite as Zero&#8208;Strain Anode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PIBs are emerging as a promising energy storage system due to high abundance of potassium resources and theoretical energy density, however, progress of PIBs is severely hindered by structural instability and poor cycling of anode material during continual insertion and extraction of larger&#8208;sized K+. Hence, developing anode material with structural stability and stable cycling remains a great challenge. Herein, bandgap&#8208;tuned Mo&#8208;doped and carbon&#8208;coated lead titanate (CMPTO) with zero&#8208;strain K+ storage is presented as ultra&#8208;stable PIBs anode. Mo doping introduces narrowed bandgap and optimized crystal lattice for enhanced intrinsic electron and ion transfer. Demonstrated by in situ XRD characterizations, the crystal structure stays stable with unchanged peak positions, fully revealing zero&#8208;strain characteristic of CMPTO anode during potassium storage for stable cyclic capability. Ultimately, CMPTO anode achieved ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of 7000 cycles at 500 mA g&#8208;1 with high capacity retention of 90% and considerable specific capacity of 130.9 mAh g&#8208;1 after 600 cycles at 100 mA g&#8208;1; with relatively large density, CMPTO realized eminent volumetric capacity of 1111.09 mAh cm&#8208;3 and ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 10000 cycles at 7041 mA cm&#8208;3. This work introduces a promisingly new route into developing anode materials with ultra&#8208;stable performance for PIBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskites (PREDPs) have garnered significant attention for their versatile physical properties, including ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, large piezoelectric responses, and circularly polarized luminescence. However, their potential for X&#8208;ray detection remains unexplored, and the low Curie temperature (TC) limits the performance window for PREDP ferroelectrics.&#160;Here, by applying the chemical regulation strategies involving halogen substitution on the organic cation and Rb/Cs substitution to the PREDP [(R)&#8208;M3HQ]2RbEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;M3HQ = (R)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] with a low TC of 285 K, a novel 3D PREDP ferroelectric [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ = (R)&#8208;N&#8208;chloromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] are successfully synthesized, for which the TC reaches 344 K. More importantly, such a strategy endowed [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 with notable X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Centimeter&#8208;sized [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 single crystals fabricated from aqueous solutions demonstrated a sensitivity of 1307 &#181;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and a low detectable dose rate of 152 nGyair s&#8208;1, the highest sensitivity reported for hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors. This work positions PREDPs as promising candidates for the next generation of eco&#8208;friendly optoelectronic materials and also offers substantial insights into the interaction between structure, composition, and functionality in ferroelectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Coupled Binuclear&#8208;Site Catalysts for Low&#8208;Temperature Selective Acetylene Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous metal catalysts with bifunctional active sites are widely used in chemical industries. Although their improvement process is typically based on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, it is hindered by the lack of model catalysts. Herein, we report an effective vacancy&#8208;pair capturing strategy to fabricate 12 heterogeneous binuclear&#8208;site catalysts (HBSCs) comprising combinations of transition metals on titania. During the synthesis of these HBSCs, proton&#8208;passivation treatment and step&#8208;by&#8208;step electrostatic anchorage enabled the suppression of single&#8208;atom formation and the successive capture of two target metal cations on the titanium&#8211;oxygen vacancy&#8208;pair site. Additionally, during acetylene hydrogenation at 20 &#176;C, the HBSCs (e.g., Pt1Pd1&#8211;TiO2) consistently generated more than two times the ethylene produced by their single&#8208;atom counterparts (e.g., Pd1&#8211;TiO2). Furthermore, the Pt1Pd1 binuclear sites in Pt1Pd1&#8211;TiO2 were demonstrated to catalyze C2H2 hydrogenation via a bifunctional active&#8208;site mechanism: initially C2H2 chemisorb on the Pt1 site, then H2 dissociates and migrates from Pd1 to Pt1, and finally hydrogenation occurs at the Pt1&#8211;Pd1 interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Cooperative Ion Transport Pathway in Ultra&#8208;Thin Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes toward Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries due to their decent flexibility, safety, and interfacial stability. However, their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and limited conductivity, leading to inferior electrochemical performance.&#160; Herein, we proposed to design ultra&#8208;thin solid&#8208;state electrolyte with long&#8208;range cooperative ion transport pathway to effectively increase the ionic conductivity and stability. The impregnation of PVDF&#8208;HFP inside pores of &#160;fluorinated covalent organic framework (CF3&#8208;COF) can disrupt its symmetry, rendering rapid ion transportation and inhibited anion imigration. The functional groups of CF3&#8208;COF can interact with PVDF&#8208;HFP to form fast Li+ transport channels, which enables the uniform and confined Li+ conduction within the electrolyte. The introduction of CF3&#8208;COF also enhances the mechanical strength and flexibility of SPEs, as well as ensures homogeneous Li deposition and inhibited dendrite growth. &#160;Hence, a remarkably high conductivity of 1.21&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 can be achieved. Finally, the ultra&#8208;thin SPEs with an extremely long cycle life exceed 9000 h can be obtained (the longest cycle life reported until now) while the NCM523/Li pouch cell demonstrates a high capacity of 760 mAh and 96% capacity retention after cycling, holding great promises to be utilized for practical solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>30 Seconds to success! &#8211; The Wittig reaction, a fundamental and extensively utilized reaction in organic chemistry, enables the efficient conversion of carbonyl compounds to olefins using phosphonium salts. Traditionally, meticulous reaction setup, including the pre&#8208;formation of a reactive ylide species via deprotonation of a phosphonium salt, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;yielding reactions under classical solution&#8208;based conditions. In this report, we present an unprecedented protocol for an ultra&#8208;fast mechanically induced Wittig reaction under solvent&#8208;free and ambient conditions, often eliminating the need for tedious ylide pre&#8208;formation under strict air and moisture exclusion.&#160;A range of aldehydes and ketones were reacted with diverse phosphonium salts under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions, frequently giving access to the respective olefins in only 30 seconds.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical deployment of Zn&#8208;ion batteries faces challenges such as dendrite growth, side reactions and cathode dissolution in traditional electrolytes. Here, we develop a highly conductive and dynamically ion&#8208;sieved electrolyte to simultaneously enhance the Zn metal reversibility and suppress the cathode dissolution. The dynamic ion screen at the electrode/electrolyte interface is achieved by numerous pyrane rings with a radius of 3.69 &#197;, which can selectively facilitate the plating/stripping and insertion/extraction process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ and Zn2+ on the anode and cathode surfaces. As a proof of concept, Zn//Zn symmetric cells deliver exceptional cyclic stability for over 6,800 h and ultrahigh cumulative plated capacity of 3.9 Ah cm&#8722;2. Zn//Na2Mn3O7 cells exhibit satisfactory cycling performance with capacity retention of 82.7% after 4,000 cycles, and the assembled pouch cells achieve excellent stability and durability. This work provides valuable insights into the development of electrolytes aimed at enhancing the interface stability of aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Metformin Conjugates Acting as Promising PD&#8208;L1 Inhibitors through the AMP&#8208;Activated Protein Kinase Mediated Lysosomal Degradation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of metalloimmunology, the potential of platinum drugs in cancer immunotherapy has attracted extensive attention. Although immunochemotherapy combining PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 antibodies with platinum drugs has achieved great success in the clinic, combination therapy commonly brings new problems. Herein, we have developed a platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate as a promising alternative to antibody&#8208;based PD&#8208;L1 inhibitors, not only disrupting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 axis on cell surface but also down&#8208;regulating the total PD&#8208;L1 levels in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells comprehensively, thus achieving highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small molecule. Mechanism studies demonstrate that Pt&#8208;metformin conjugate can selectively accumulate in lysosomes, promote lysosomal&#8208;dependent PD&#8208;L1 degradation via the AMPK&#8208;TFEB pathway, and modulate the upstream regulatory proteins related to PD&#8208;L1 expression (e.g. HIF&#8208;1&#945; and NF&#8208;&#954;B), eventually decreasing the total abundance of PD&#8208;L1 in NSCLC, overcoming tumor hypoxia, and activating anti&#8208;tumor immunity in vivo. This work suggests an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8208;L1 for the first time and provides a unique design perspective for the development of novel platinum drugs for immunochemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Dendrite&#8208;Free Room Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Novel Sodium Thiotellurate Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries was severely hindered by inhomogeneous sodium deposition and notorious sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) shuttling. Herein, novel sodium thiotellurate (Na2TeS3) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8208;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfide shuttling. On the cathode side, a heterostructural sodium sulfide/sodium telluride embedded in a carbon matrix (Na2S/Na2Te@C) was rationally designed through a facile carbothermal reaction, where the Na2TeS3interface will be in&#8208;situ chemically obtained. Such an interface provides abundant electron/ion diffusion channels and ensures rich catalytic surfaces toward Na&#8208;S redox, which could significantly improve the utilization of active material and alleviate polysulfide shuttling in the cathode. On the anode side, the inevitable formation of soluble polytellurosulfides species will migrate on Na anode surface, finally constructing a compact and smooth solid&#8208;electrolyte Na2TeS3 interphase (SEI) layer. Such electrochemical formed Na2TeS3 interface can significantly enhance ionic transport and stabilize Na deposition, thus realizing dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal plating/stripping. Benefitting from these advantages, an anode&#8208;free cell fabricated with the Na2S/Na2Te@C cathode exhibits an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C, which could pave a new path to design high&#8208;performance cathodes for anode&#8208;free RT Na&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiral&#8208;concave Prussian Blue Crystals with Rich Steps: Growth Mechanism and Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigating the formation and transformation mechanisms of spiral&#8208;concave crystals holds significant potential for advancing innovative material design and comprehension. We examined the kinetics&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth mechanisms of Prussian Blue crystals with spiral concave structures, and constructed a detailed crystal growth phase diagram. The spiral&#8208;concave hexacyanoferrate (SC&#8208;HCF) crystals, characterized by high&#8208;density surface steps and a low stress&#8208;strain architecture, exhibit enhanced activity due to their facile interaction with reactants. Notably, the coordination environment of SC&#8208;HCF can be precisely modulated by the introduction of diverse metals. Utilizing X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, we elucidated the formation mechanism of SC&#8208;HCF to Co&#8208;HCF facilitated by oriented adsorption&#8208;ion exchange (OA&#8208;IE) process. Both experimental data, and density functional theory confirm that Co&#8208;HCF possesses an optimized energy band structure, capable of adjusting the local electronic environment and enhancing the performance of the oxygen evolution reaction. This work not only elucidates the formation mechanism and coordination regulation for rich steps HCF, but also offers a novel perspective for constructing nanocrystals with intricate spiral&#8208;concave structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Superior Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a cascade synthetic strategy for preparing well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DAC). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we constructed a Fe dual&#8208;atom catalyst bridged by two nitrogen atoms, which exhibited excellent oxygen reduction performance. Theoretically, our strategy can be further extended to synthesizing DACs with various metal categories and coordination environments, facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different reaction applications.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been proposed to break the limitation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in the synergistic activation of multiple molecules and intermediates, offering an additional degree of freedom for catalytic regulation. However, it remains a challenge to synthesize DACs with high uniformity, atomic accuracy, and satisfactory loadings. Herein, we report a facile cascade synthetic strategy for DAC via precise electrostatic interaction control and neighboring vacancy construction. We synthesized well&#8208;defined, uniformly dispersed dual Fe sites which were connected by two nitrogen bonds (denoted as Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe). The as&#8208;synthesized DAC exhibited superior catalytic performances towards oxygen reduction reaction, including good half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#8197;V), high kinetic current density (21.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and perfect durability. Theoretical calculation revealed that the DAC structure effectively tunes the oxygen adsorption configuration and decreases the cleavage barrier, thereby improving the catalytic kinetics. The DAC&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air batteries exhibited impressive power densities of 169.8 and 52.18&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which is 1.7 and 2.0 times higher than those based on Pt/C+Ir/C, respectively. We also demonstrated the universality of our strategy in synthesizing other M&#8208;N2&#8208;M DACs (M=Co, Cu, Ru, Pd, Pt, and Au), facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different catalytic applications.

         <title>A Simple and Sequential Strategy for the Introduction of Complexity and Hierarchy in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF) Crystals for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures is proposed here. As proof of concept, we have obtained examples of HOF crystals with hierarchical superstructures and the first reported HOF&#8208;on&#8208;HOF crystals.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a new class of crystalline porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) with great potential for a diverse range of applications. HOFs face common challenges to POMMs, and in general to purely organic crystals, that is, the difficulty of integrating complexity in crystals. Herein, we propose a simple and sequential strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures. The strategy is based on controlling the assembly conditions, avoiding the use of any surface functionalization or template, which allows to obtain hierarchical crystalline porous superstructures in an easy manner. As proof of concept, we obtained the first example of core&#8211;shell (HOF&#8208;on&#8208;HOF) crystals and HOFs with hierarchical superstructures having superhydrophobicity and trapping abilities for the capture of persistent water contaminants such as oils and microplastics. We expect that this strategy could serve as inspiration for the construction of more intricate multiscale structures that could greatly expand the library of HOF materials.

         <title>Taming Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymerization by a Machine&#8208;Learning Discovered Crystallization Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning approach is used to derive a non&#8208;classical model that describes the crystallization of two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) in a homogeneous solution. This model reveals that gradually increasing monomer addition speed increases the speed of 2D COF crystal growth. The insights provided by this model led us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which was previously achieved with prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators.







Abstract
Rapidly synthesizing high&#8208;quality two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) is crucial for their practical applications. While strategies such as slow monomer addition have been developed based on an empirical understanding of their formation process, quantitative guidance remains absent, which prohibits precise optimizations of the experimental conditions. Here, we use a machine&#8208;learning approach that overcomes the challenges associated with bottom&#8208;up model derivation for the non&#8208;classical 2D COF crystallization processes. The resulting model, referred to as NEgen1, establishes correlations among the induction time, nucleation rate, growth rate, bond&#8208;forming rate constants, and common solution synthesis conditions for 2D COFs that grow by a nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanism. The results elucidate the detailed competition between the nucleation and growth dynamics in solution, which has been inappropriately described previously by classical, empirical models with assumptions invalid for 2D COF polymerization. By understanding the dynamic processes at play, the NEgen1 model reveals a simple strategy of gradually increasing monomer addition speed for growing large 2D COF crystals. This insight enables us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which could only be achieved previously by prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators. These results highlight the potential for systematically improving the crystal quality of 2D COFs, which has wide&#8208;reaching relevance for many of the applications where 2D COFs are speculated to be valuable.

         <title>Switching Reaction Pathways of CO2 Electroreduction by Modulating Cations in the Electrochemical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved tunable reaction pathways for CO2 electroreduction by adjusting the cations in the electrochemical double layer. The main product could be switched from CO (Faradaic efficiency of 97.3&#8201;%) to formate (Faradaic efficiency of 93.5&#8201;%) by simply changing the alkali metal cations in the ternary ionic liquid&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
Tuning the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) solely by changing electrolyte is a very attractive topic. In this study, we conducted CO2RR in different aqueous electrolytes over bulk metal electrodes. It was discovered that controlled CO2RR could be achieved by modulating cations in the electrochemical double layer. Specifically, ionic liquid cations in the electrolyte significantly inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while yielding high Faraday efficiencies toward CO (FECO) or formate (FEformate) depending on the alkali metal cations. For example, the product could be switched from CO (FECO=97.3&#8201;%) to formate (FEformate=93.5&#8201;%) by changing the electrolyte from 0.1&#8197;M KBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M 1&#8208;octyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bromide (OmimBr) to 0.1&#8197;M CsBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M OmimBr aqueous solutions over pristine Cu foil electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the ordered structure generated by the assembly of Omim+ under an applied negative potential alters the hydrogen bonding structure of the interfacial water, thereby inhibiting the HER. The difference in selectivity in the presence of different cations is attributed to the hydrogen bonding effect caused by Omim+, which alters the solvated structure of the alkali metal cations and thus affects the stabilization of intermediates of different pathways.

         <title>Bidentate Coordination Structure Facilitates High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Utilization Aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH) stabilizes the Zn anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling stable cycling of the Zn anode with a maximum area capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a ZUR of 97&#8201;%. At the same time, a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in the four&#8208;electron transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reaction is achieved through a bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. The four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine battery is a promising energy storage device, but the conventional two&#8208;electron reaction potential and energy density of the iodine cathode are far from meeting practical application requirements. Given that iodine is rich in redox reactions, activating the high&#8208;valence iodine cathode reaction has become a promising research direction for developing high&#8208;voltage zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. In this work, by designing a multifunctional electrolyte additive trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH), a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reactions with a high theoretical specific capacity is achieved through a unique amine group, Cl bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. Characterization techniques such as synchrotron radiation, in situ Raman spectra, and DFT calculations are used to verify the mechanism of the stable bidentate structure. This electrolyte additive stabilizes the zinc anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling the zinc anode to cycle steadily at a maximum areal capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 97&#8201;% zinc utilization rate. Finally, the four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5. The unique bidentate coordination structure contributes to the further development of high&#8208;valence and high capacity aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Unconventional hcp/fcc Nickel Heteronanocrystal with Asymmetric Convex Sites Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular precursor&#8208;directed strategy is developed to construct unconventional Ni heteronanocrystals with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating asymmetric surfaces with plenty of convex sites. Such unique convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy while stabilizing interfacial *H2O, synergistically facilitating alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Developing non&#8208;platinum group metal catalysts for the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for alkaline fuel cells. To date, Ni&#8208;based materials are the most promising candidates but still suffer from insufficient performance. Herein, we report an unconventional hcp/fcc Ni (u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni) heteronanocrystal with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating rugged surfaces with plenty of asymmetric convex sites. Systematic analyses discover that such convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy, circumventing the over&#8208;strong *H adsorption on traditional hollow positions, and simultaneously stabilizing interfacial *H2O. It thus synergistically optimizes the HOR thermodynamic process as well as reduces the kinetic barrier of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step. Consequently, the developed u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni exhibits the top&#8208;rank alkaline HOR activity with a mass activity of 40.6&#8197;mA&#8201;mgNi&#8722;1 (6.3&#8197;times higher than fcc Ni control) together with superior stability and high CO&#8208;tolerance. These results provide a paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by shifting the adsorption state of intermediates through configuring surface sites.

         <title>p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization in Ag&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical Sn&#8208;doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) with strong p&#8211;d orbital hybridization achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) NH3 yield rate in electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction at ampere&#8208;level, which can be further extended to Struvite production and Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Mechanistic studies reveal that such p&#8211;d orbital hybridization in SnAg benefits nitrite deoxygenation, the rate&#8208;determining step for NH3 synthesis.







Abstract
Considering the substantial role of ammonia, developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion has attracted increasing interest. Herein, we proposed a feasible strategy of p&#8211;d orbital hybridization via doping p&#8208;block metals in an Ag host, which drastically promotes the performance of nitrate adsorption and disassociation. Typically, a Sn&#8208;doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) delivers a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.5&#177;1.85&#8201;% for NH3 at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE and reaches the highest NH3 yield rate to 482.3&#177;14.1&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1. In a flow cell, the SnAg catalyst achieves a FE of 90.2&#8201;% at an ampere&#8208;level current density of 1.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 78.6&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, during which NH3 can be further extracted to prepare struvite as high&#8208;quality fertilizer. A mechanistic study reveals that a strong p&#8211;d orbital hybridization effect in SnAg is beneficial for nitrite deoxygenation, a rate&#8208;determining step for NH3 synthesis, which as a general principle, can be further extended to Bi&#8208; and In&#8208;doped Ag catalysts. Moreover, when integrated into a Zn&#8208;nitrate battery, such a SnAg cathode contributes to a superior energy density of 639&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1, high power density of 18.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and continuous NH3 production.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds Enabled Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers Recyclability and Material Circularity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) offers a new avenue for closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs. This review highlights the recent developments, focusing on crosslinking polymers made from CANs, emphasizing applications in carbon fiber recycling and resin sustainability.







Abstract
Due to their remarkable features of lightweight, high strength, stiffness, high&#8208;temperature resistance, and corrosion resistance, carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are extensively used in sports equipment, vehicles, aircraft, windmill blades, and other sectors. The urging need to develop a resource&#8208;saving and environmentally responsible society requires the recycling of CFRPs. Traditional CFRPs, on the other hand, are difficult to recycle due to the permanent covalent crosslinking of polymer matrices. The combination of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with carbon fibers (CFs) marks a new development path for closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs and polymer resins. In this review, we summarize the most recent developments of closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs from the unique paradigm of dynamic crosslinking polymers, CANs. These sophisticated materials with diverse functions, oriented towards CFs recycling and resin sustainability, are further categorized into several active domains of dynamic covalent bonds, including ester bonds, imine bonds, disulfide bonds, boronic ester bonds, and acetal linkages, etc. Finally, the possible strategies for the future design of recyclable CFPRs by combining dynamic covalent chemistry innovation with materials interface science are proposed.

         <title>Confined Element Distribution with Structure&#8208;Driven Energy Coupling for Enhanced Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Irving&#8208;William order, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to directionally tune the enrichment of elements at the M1 site of Prussian blue analogues, is proposed to restrain localized enrichment and release of stresses and induce structure&#8208;driven energy coupling phenomenon.







Abstract
The structural failure of Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] could not be alleviated with traditional modification strategies through the adjustable composition property of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), considering that the accumulation and release of stress derived from the MnN6 octahedrons are unilaterally restrained. Herein, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to directionally tune the enrichment of elements, is proposed to restrain structural degradation and induce unconventional energy coupling phenomenon. The non&#8208;uniform distribution of elements at the M1 site of PBAs (NFM&#8208;PB) is manipulated by the sequentially precipitated Ni, Fe, and Mn according to the Irving&#8208;William order. Electrochemically active Fe is operated to accompany Mn, and zero&#8208;strain Ni is modulated to enrich at the surface, synergistically mitigating with the enrichment and release of stress and then significantly improving the structural stability. Furthermore, unconventional energy coupling effect, a fusion of the electrochemical behavior between FeLS and MnHS, is triggered by the confined element distribution, leading to the enhanced electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;polarization ability. Consequently, the NFM&#8208;PB demonstrates superior rate performance and cycling stability. These findings further exploit potentialities of the adjustable composition property and provide new insights into the component design engineering for advanced PBAs.

         <dc:description>
A seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium has been developed as the key core skeleton for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. The low&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring lead to a stabilization of the LUMO via a &#8220;px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation&#8221;. The observed intense emission with a large Stokes shift was attributed to a large structural relaxation with a contribution from a quinoidal resonance structure in the excited state.







Abstract
Positively charged phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles are characteristic core skeletons for functional molecules. While various phosphonium&#8208;containing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring compounds have been reported, the seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium have not been fully studied yet. In this study, dithieno[3,2&#8208;b;&#8201;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]phosphepinium ions containing electron&#8208;donating aminophenyl groups were synthesized. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the resulting donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor dyes revealed a bent conformation of the central seven&#8208;membered ring. These compounds exhibit fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region with a bathochromic shift of ca. 70&#8197;nm compared to a phosphepine oxide congener and a large Stokes shift. High fluorescence quantum yields were obtained even in polar solvents due to the suppression of the nonradiative decay process. A theoretical study revealed that the phosphepinium skeleton is highly electron&#8208;accepting owing to the orbital interaction between a px orbital of the phosphonium moiety and a &#960;* orbital of the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene moiety. Due to the lower&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety compared to that of the phosphine oxide and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring, the phosphepinium ring permits effective px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation. A large structural relaxation with a contribution of a quinoidal resonance structure is suggested in the excited state, which should be responsible for the bright emission with a large Stokes shift.
